But some cost-cutting measures, like Medicaid changes, will take a couple of years.","President Donald J. Trump’s sweeping bill that is set to become law on Friday will have wide-ranging implications in Connecticut and across the country on everything from taxes to health care to nutrition assistance.
Many of the tax breaks and provisions will go into effect pretty quickly or in the near future. But some of the cost-cutting measures to pay for the bill will take a couple of years before they kick in, like the most significant changes to Medicaid.
Parts of the bill will be permanent, including the 2017 tax cuts passed during the first Trump administration that were set to expire at the end of this year. That includes lower income tax rates as well as the lower corporate tax rate. But some relief will only last for a few years, like deductions on overtime pay and tips on federal income taxes.
Many of the provisions line up around upcoming elections. Some of more generous tax relief, which could give Republicans a boost in their reelection efforts, won’t expire until after the 2026 midterm elections when control of Congress is up for grabs.
And the reforms to Medicaid and nutrition assistance that could lead to cuts — that Democrats, who all voted against the bill, have warned about — won’t apply until late in Trump’s term and close to the 2028 presidential election.
What taxpayers will see in the near term and when provisions will expire
A number of new or modified tax deductions and credits will go into effect this year, though many are set to expire after a few years. That relief will go toward families, children, tipped workers and seniors, though lower earners will not benefit as much.
The bill modestly and permanently raises the maximum amount of the child tax credit from $2,000 to $2,200 per child under the age of 17 and requires at least one parent to have a Social Security number. Those with lower incomes will not benefit as much because they make too little and the tax credit is not fully refundable.
Changes to state and local tax deductions, known as SALT, will be especially beneficial for higher cost-of-living states like Connecticut. In 2022, state taxpayers had the highest average SALT deduction, around $9,100, just under the current $10,000 cap, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. That year, 11% of Connecticut’s returns claimed SALT, one of the highest rates in the U.S.
The 2017 tax bill placed a cap on SALT deductions at $10,000. The new legislation raises it to $40,000 and would get phased out for those who make over $500,000, starting in the 2025 calendar year. The cap would increase by 1% each year starting in 2025 through 2029. It would then go back down to the current threshold in 2030.
Workers will be able to deduct overtime pay or tips from their federal income tax, though there are limitations to the amount of the deductions and which workers qualify. The deductions related to tips are capped at $25,000 a year, while workers can deduct up to $12,500 on overtime pay. That relief phases out for those who earn over $150,000 a year or $300,000 if filing jointly.
And taxpayers can deduct up to $10,000 of interest on their auto loans if the car is new and assembled in the U.S. All three of those tax deductions would take effect in 2025 and last through 2028.
Seniors who are 65 and older with low to middle incomes will be able to make an additional $6,000 deduction that will start in the 2025 tax year and run through 2028. The full deduction will apply to those who individually earn under $75,000 a year or $150,000 for couples. It starts to phase out above those income thresholds and cuts off at $175,000 or $250,000 if filing jointly.
The bill will automatically create new savings accounts for newborns born between Jan. 1, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2028. The federal government will contribute a one-time infusion of $1,000 and then allow parents to contribute $5,000 a year up until age 18 that can be invested in the stock market. The secretary of the Treasury will automatically open an account if a parent doesn’t establish one.
On energy, the bill will wind down some of the clean energy tax incentives that were implemented during the Biden administration in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act soon, while others will take a few years.
Tax credits to make homes more energy efficient as well as electric vehicle rebates will go away by the end of the year.
While some of the Medicaid provisions will take a few years to set in, people will see more immediate effects related to the enrollment process for the Affordable Care Act and its subsidies. Starting next year, there will be requirements to verify an enrollee’s income and immigration status instead of automatic re-enrollment.
What will go into effect over the next few years
States like Connecticut will need to implement big changes to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, in the coming years. Some states could be eligible for delays in implementation.
One of the biggest implications of the bill will be on states’ finances as they take on more of the costs associated with these safety net programs. That could have a domino effect on how states fund and structure the programs and lead to reductions in benefits or changes to eligibility standards. 
Both programs will institute new work requirements for certain beneficiaries in order to be eligible, while states will take on new costs that were once covered by the federal government.
To qualify for Medicaid as an adult under 65, a recipient will need to work or participate in training, education or community service at least 80 hours a month. That criteria will also apply to parents or guardians who have children 14 and older.
Exemptions will apply to certain groups including parents, guardians or caretakers of children 13 and under or who are disabled, veterans with disabilities, those who are “medically frail” or have serious medical conditions and those who are pregnant. Recipients will now need to prove they are eligible twice a year, instead of once.
This would go into effect on Dec. 31, 2026 at the earliest, though states can apply for a waiver to give them until the end of 2028 to comply with the new requirements.
Almost 950,000 people are enrolled in Connecticut’s Medicaid program known as HUSKY, according to DSS. About 73% of Connecticut adults on Medicaid were working either part-time or full-time, according to a KFF analysis of the 2023 American Community Survey.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes and scores federal legislation, estimated that about 138,000 people could lose Medicaid coverage in Connecticut, with the higher end of enrollment loss up to 172,000.
From 2028 to 2032, it also lowers Medicaid provider taxes, which enables states to increase the amount of Medicaid funding they receive from the federal government. This change will apply to states that expanded Medicaid, which Connecticut did after the enactment of the Affordable Care Act.
Nearly all states use such taxes to increase what they get for Medicaid. Connecticut has levied a provider tax that collects hundreds of millions annually from hospitals then redistributes those funds, plus more, back to the industry. Those return payments technically count as public health care spending and help Connecticut qualify for federal Medicaid grants.
States depend heavily on the federal government to help pay for Medicaid. The state’s Office of Policy and Management projected Connecticut would spend a total of $11.6 billion on Medicaid in fiscal year 2025. The federal government contributed about 59% of that funding, which is about $6.9 billion.

Connecticut Department of Social Services Commissioner Andrea Barton Reeves said she fears people will decide it’s too cumbersome to comply with the requirements and be forced to find coverage that’s higher cost or lower quality. DSS oversees HUSKY and SNAP.
“We believe they’re just going to be so frustrated and so ground down by the process that’s already quite complicated in its current form,” Barton Reeves said in an interview with The Connecticut Mirror on Thursday. “Their health will suffer and we’ll see really bad effects as a result.”
Stricter work requirements will also apply to some SNAP recipients, with similar exemptions to the ones in the Medicaid provision. About 69% of Connecticut households on SNAP already have at least one 18- to 55-year-old member working, according to DSS.
Now, more older Americans will need to work or train at least 80 hours a month to receive SNAP. The bill raises the age limit for able-bodied adults without dependents from 54 to 64. And it also applies to able-bodied adults who have children 14 and older. The bill lowered the age of a dependent, which is currently under age 18.
States may also need to pick up some of the costs associated with SNAP benefits for the first time in the nutrition program’s history. The federal government has always paid 100% of the benefits and equally shared the administrative costs with states.
Starting in fiscal year 2028, states will need to keep their payment error rate below 6% in order for the feds to keep paying for all costs associated with SNAP benefits. Those error rates take into account overpayments and underpayments.
But if it’s higher, states will have to take on anywhere from 5% up to 15%. And they will also need to pay more of the administrative fees starting in fiscal year 2027.
Connecticut’s payment error rate was about 10% in 2024. Based off of that number, the state would hit the top of the threshold and pay 15% of SNAP benefits. But that number will change since Connecticut’s share will be determined by the payment error rate from either fiscal year 2025 or 2026 — and the state can choose between the two. States may be able to delay implementation for another year or two.
In Connecticut, more than 400,000 people got SNAP benefits in 2025, according to the DSS. More than half of the recipients in the state are in families with children. That same year, Connecticut received a total of $894 million in SNAP benefits. The average benefit for each household member per month was about $190.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Waiting for President Donald Trump to deliver his remarks at the Iowa State Fairgrounds, Iowa Republicans celebrated the passage of the “big, beautiful bill” through Congress Thursday.
The event on the fairgrounds Midway was the launch of a yearlong celebration leading up to America’s 250th anniversary through the organization America250, which also planned the Washington, D.C. military parade in June.
Speaking to reporters, Iowa GOP chair Jeff Kaufmann said “aside from politics, this is a big deal that he’s starting in Iowa” for the year of events, saying he was hopeful the event and others planned throughout the country will lead to people coming together for patriotic celebrations.
“This is a really big deal for Iowa,” Kaufmann said. “… I know it’s very political, I know it’s going to be very combative, you know, today, in terms of when we talk policy – I get that. God bless America. But there’s got to be moments during this next year when we can take a time out for just a bit.”
While the gathering was officially linked to the country’s anniversary, much of the discussion at the event was centered around the passage of the tax and spending budget reconciliation bill that passed the U.S. House and was sent to Trump’s desk earlier Thursday.
Kaufmann thanked Trump and Iowa’s all-Republican federal delegation for voting in support of the measure, saying the measure was “not only … beautiful, it’s the right thing to do.”
The bill, which passed the House in a 218-214 vote is the controversial measure that would implement Medicaid work requirements, shift more funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program from the federal government to states, and extend the 2017 tax cuts approved during Trump’s first term. It also provides more than $170 billion in funding for the federal government to carry out mass deportations and raises the national debt limit by $5 trillion.
 Trump said he plans to sign the bill into law Friday, July 4, while military planes fly overhead.
“We’ll be signing with those beautiful planes flying right over our heads,” he told reporters before getting on Air Force One to head to Des Moines Thursday.
Lori Coltrain, a Des Moines resident who came with her granddaughter to the event, said she wanted to “hear the truth” from Trump about the bill and other policies advanced by his administration.
“I just hate all the negativity about it,” Coltrain said. “People should just celebrate that he’s actually gotten it through.”
Though many attendees spent several hours Thursday afternoon with temperatures above 90 degrees, spirits were high among many who were excited to hear from the president following the successful passage of one of Republicans’ major policy proposals.
Keith Reicks of Ridgeway said he was excited to hear from the president and Iowa Republican leaders about bringing the bill to the finish line. He said he was not concerned about the protests and public opposition from Democrats and others about the legislation – and said he trusts Trump to sort out any unexpected issues that could be caused by the measure.
“I think if something turns up, Trump will straighten it out,” Reicks said. “It seems like he always does. And I believe in the man. When I was younger, I didn’t think too much of Donald Trump, because I always thought he was a pusher, but now I’m glad he’s pushing.”
He also said he does not believe the discontent with the bill and some Trump policies will result in major Democratic gains during the 2026 election, saying Democrats are more focused on “complaining” about Republicans and Trump than putting forward their own ideas.
He said Iowans and most Americans still support Trump and believe he is doing a good job in the White House.
“I think he’s doing a good job,” Reicks said. “I’d vote for him again if he was running, but I don’t think he’s going to.”
Though the crowd of Trump supporters spoke largely in favor of the bill and the Republican trifecta’s work since the 2024 general election, other Iowans have rallied against GOP leaders’ actions. Protests were planned outside the State Fairgrounds for Thursday, the latest in weeks of actions calling for Iowa’s delegation to oppose the budget reconciliation bill.
Kaufmann called for Republicans to stand strong in support for the measure despite widespread opposition.
“Listen to this very carefully, folks: Do not cede an inch when you’re talking to your neighbors and friends,” Kaufmann said. “And it says this – if you work and if you’re legal, you’re not going to get kicked off Medicaid, that’s a lie. It’s a lie for desperate people.”
All four of Iowa’s U.S. House members – Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Ashley Hinson, Zach Nunn and Randy Feenstra – voted in support of the bill. They, alongside  Secretary of Interior Doug Burgum, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, flew with Trump to Iowa on Air Force One following the House vote. 
Trump hinted in a Truth Social post Tuesday he planned to talk about “some of the GREAT things he had already done on trade, especially as it relates to Farmers.” 
Earlier this year, Trump announced plans to set a baseline 10% tariffs on international imports, while he set a 90-day pause shortly after the announcement; they are set to go into effect on July 9. 
In Iowa, many farmers, local businesses owners and agricultural producers have expressed concern that they will be unable to absorb the added costs of the tariffs leading to disruptions for their business and higher costs to consumers. A study by Farmers for Free Trade found tariff costs for Iowa importers increased by 304%, roughly $68 million, from April 2024 to April 2025 and are set to increase going forward. 
Trump said he plans to begin sending letters to countries Friday dictating tariff rates.

If approved by a judge, the payment would resolve a lawsuit in which the estate of the late Kenneth Johnson alleged racism, negligence and medical malpractice led to his death at the Newport prison.

The estate of a Black man who died in a Vermont prison more than five years ago has agreed to accept $1.5 million to resolve a lawsuit brought against the state’s former medical provider alleging that racism, medical malpractice and negligence led to the man’s death.
Details of the proposed resolution were included in recent court filings in the case in U.S. District Court in Burlington arising from the December 2019 death of 60-year-old Kenneth Johnson at the Northern State Correctional Facility in Newport.
A court filing by attorneys in the case, titled a “Stipulated Order of Judgment,” still needs the approval of Judge Christina Reiss, who has presided over the case. 
The filing seeking the order of judgment to resolve the claims differs from a straight out settlement. 
“It’s a judgment, and that’s an important distinction,” said James Valente, an attorney representing Johnson’s estate. 
Confidentiality provisions are often part of settlements resolving litigation between private parties. A judgment, on the other hand, is a matter of public record.
“Our client had reservations about a settlement that would include a confidentiality provision,” Valente said Thursday. Olynthea Johnson, Kenneth Johnson’s sister, is the administrator of his estate. 
Shap Smith, an attorney for Centurion Health, the state’s contracted medical provider for prisons at the time of Johnson’s death, declined to comment Thursday. 
The lawsuit filed in December 2021 alleged that Johnson died in the prison infirmary after workers for Virginia-based Centurion Health failed to diagnose and treat a tumor that led to Johnson’s death by asphyxiation.

The wrongful death and medical malpractice lawsuit also alleged Centurion Health discriminated against Johnson, a Black man, due to his race. 
According to the suit, Johnson endured “extreme pain and suffering” and “extreme psychological distress” in the hours before he died. The suit accuses guards and medical staff of ignoring his pleas for medical help.
Initial reports from the Vermont Department of Corrections at the time said  it appeared Johnson died from natural causes. A person who was incarcerated with Johnson told Seven Days a week after Johnson’s death that he had been having difficulty breathing and begging for medical care before he died. 
Later, investigations, including the one by the Vermont Defender’s General’s Office, blasted the corrections department and Centurion medical staff over the care provided to Johnson. 
A court filing by Centurion’s attorneys stated that the health care provider has made an offer of $1.5 million to the estate. “This offer of judgment includes all amounts that might be recovered by the estate for any damages, costs, attorneys’ fees, and pre-judgment interest,” the filing said. 
The offer of judgment, the filing added, was “not to be construed as an admission of liability by any defendants, or any official, employee or agent of Centurion of Vermont.”
In a separate court filing this week, the estate accepted the offer. As of Thursday afternoon, the judge had yet to sign off on the proposed order of judgment, according to court filings.
Valente, speaking Thursday afternoon, said he believed that the judge would sign off on the order. If the judge does so, the lawsuit would be resolved. 
Johnson’s estate had previously reached a settlement with the Vermont Department of Corrections, which had also been named as a defendant in the lawsuit, for $150,000, according to Valente and a corrections department spokesperson.  
That $150,000 payment is in addition to the $1.5 million the estate would receive from Centurion.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE — A federal judge presiding over the Tennessee criminal charges against Kilmar Abrego Garcia has ordered lawyers to refrain from making public statements about the case.
Thursday’s order by US District Judge Waverly Crenshaw came at the request of Abrego’s attorneys, who argued that government officials had “launched a public disparagement campaign against” their client that could prejudice his chance at a fair trial and violated standard court rules.
The defense attorneys cited a string of statements by members of the Trump administration that variously labelled Abrego a “gangbanger,” “monster,” “Illegal predator,” “Illegal alien terrorist,” “wife beater” and “barbarian.”
“From the moment Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia challenged his illegal rendition to El Salvador in March 2025, the government has repeatedly maligned him in public statements,” the attorneys wrote.
Abrego Garcia was beaten and tortured in Salvadoran prison, new court filings reveal

“Mr. Abrego is entitled to a fair trial,” they wrote. “But he is nearly certain to be denied that right if the government, left to its own devices, stays its current course.”
Crenshaw’s one-sentence order, issued in response, said: “All counsel are expected to comply with the local rules of this court.”
Court rules prohibit making public statements that “have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding in the matter.” The rule applies to attorneys and “the government agencies or offices . . . and employees of such . . . government agencies or offices, with which the lawyer is associated.”
Abrego was living in Maryland when he was mistakenly dispatched to a Salvadoran prison as part of a larger Trump administration illegal immigration crackdown. 
Court documents filed Wednesday in a separate immigration case in Maryland alleged Abrego endured “severe beatings, severe sleep deprivation, inadequate nutrition, and psychological torture” while there.
He was later brought to Nashville to face two human smuggling charges. Prosecutors allege Abrego participated in a scheme to transport migrants who illegally entered the United States to points around the country. 
In a reversal, judge keeps Kilmar Abrego in jail over deportation concerns

The former federal prosecutor who conceded Abrego had wrongly been sent to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador was later fired and has subsequently filed a whistleblower complaint that alleges his termination was, in part, related to his public admission of the government’s administrative error in the high-profile case.
Abrego, who has no past criminal history in the United States, has entered not guilty pleas to the charges. 
Abrego is due back in a Nashville courtroom July 16 for a hearing that could determine if he is released from federal custody. 
Both prosecutors and defense attorneys concede Abrego will almost certainly be taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) should he be released from the custody of the U.S. Marshalls, who maintain control over federal pretrial detainees.
Abrego, 29, entered the United States illegally from El Salvador as a teenager, but in 2019 an immigration judge issued an order preventing U.S. officials from deporting him to his home country, where Abrego said he feared gang violence.
A federal magistrate in Nashville initially granted Abrego’s release last week. 
But defense attorneys, citing conflicting statements by the Trump administration about whether Abrego could be removed from the United States before trial, have asked he temporarily remain jailed in Nashville.

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.
The city of Burlington decided on Thursday to “indefinitely pause” a sanctioned parking area for people experiencing homelessness before the initiative had even begun.
The “Safe Overnight Parking pilot project” at Perkins Pier along the city’s waterfront was slated to begin on Friday, July 4. City officials announced its creation on Tuesday, as a response to a round of evictions from the state’s motel voucher program that has primarily impacted families with children and individuals with severe medical needs.

But on Thursday afternoon, city officials decided to halt the project, in response to “substantial community feedback, and out of concern for the safety of program participants based on threatening comments made by members of the public on various online platforms,” according to a city press release.
Joe Magee, deputy chief of staff for Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak, said city officials received a significant number of concerned messages from “residents, and businesses, and folks who have boats docked” near the Maple Street lot. 
Social media posts expressing hostile sentiments about the project also led city officials to worry about the safety of unhoused people staying there, Magee said. The police department planned to do additional patrols of the area, Magee said, but the parking lot would not have had a “stationary overnight security presence.”
The city had received two inquiries from people who had wanted to park overnight in the lot, which was supposed to have space for twelve vehicles, Magee said. Officials had not yet approved any registrations for it.
Between June 23 and July 1, state officials anticipated 140 adults and 61 children would lose access to the motel voucher program in the Burlington area. The current wave of evictions from the program is in large part the result of an executive order expiring that had protected families with children and people with acute medical needs, like those who are homebound or receiving cancer treatment. 
Burlington officials estimate that hundreds of people are already sleeping outdoors or in vehicles in the city, with tents tucked along the waterfront bike path an increasingly common sight.
“The city does not have the resources or staff to be able to … address the shortage of shelter alone,” Magee said. “We really need state partnership to come up with more tangible solutions.”

Of those, 137,000 face obstacles from more stringent work requirements in the bill, and the other 33,000 are refugees and asylees who would also no longer be eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP.
Washington would also be on the hook for about $88 million in added administrative costs annually, according to estimates the governor’s office sent out Thursday. And unless Washington reduces its already-low payment error rate, it could have to shoulder upward of $100 million a year in new costs the feds previously paid.
States that can’t pick up those added costs could be forced to severely downsize or shut down their SNAP programs entirely. While the federal government funds the benefits, states run the program. The two levels of government share administrative expenses.
“It’s a very real possibility that states will just choose not to participate in SNAP at all,” said Claire Lane, director of the Seattle-based Anti-Hunger and Nutrition Coalition.
Democrats decried the legislation for shredding the social safety net while locking in tax cuts for wealthy Americans. The proposed cuts to food stamps would be the biggest since the program’s launch.
The SNAP changes would reduce federal spending on the program nationwide by an estimated $230 billion over 10 years. This is one of the key ways that Republicans offset revenue losses from lower taxes.
“This bill takes food from our most vulnerable Washingtonians to give tax breaks to the ultra-wealthy,” Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson said in a statement Thursday.
The White House recently said “the mission of the program has failed,” while the GOP overhaul “promotes work, responsibility, and restores SNAP to serve the truly needy.”
Currently, SNAP requires able-bodied adults between the ages of 18 and 54 without dependents to work at least 20 hours per week to access food stamps. The megabill the U.S. House passed Thursday would up that to age 64 and add work requirements for parents whose children are at least 14 years old. Previously exempt veterans, former foster youth and people experiencing homelessness would also need to work.
In March, the most recent month for which data is available, over 908,000 Washingtonians received a total of $168 million in SNAP benefits. That’s more than 10% of the state’s residents. Nationwide, the country’s largest anti-hunger initiative serves upward of 42 million people.
The 137,000 who could lose benefits unless they meet the new work requirements make up 15% of the state’s SNAP participants. These requirements could take effect this year.
Others on the program would see their benefits reduced by an average of $56 per month, according to the state Department of Social and Health Services that runs Washington’s SNAP program.
The agency estimates the lost economic activity from SNAP will cost grocery stores, farmers markets and other Washington retailers at least $360 million annually.
The legislation Republicans call the “big, beautiful bill” also carries major financial implications for the state. 
The biggest chunk comes from errors in payments states make to recipients. Based on how often they overpay or underpay, states would have to shoulder more of the cost of funding benefits. Those that keep their error rates below 6% can avoid paying anything. 
Last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture released error rates for each state in fiscal year 2024. Washington’s was 6.06%. The vast majority of that is overpayments. 
The national average is around 11%.
At the eleventh hour, Senate Republicans carved out exemptions for states with the worst error rates to help win the key vote of Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. Her state has by far the highest error rate, at nearly 25%.
For Washington, this issue could mean more than $100 million in new state expenses. This won’t start until 2028 federal fiscal year, so the state can still improve its error rate.
The megabill also shifts more administrative costs to the states from a 50-50 split to the feds paying just 25%. 
The reconciliation bill’s passage and looming financial threat for states come as Washington raises taxes and cuts costs to fill a huge budget shortfall.
“This massive payment shift to states is happening at the same time that we’re losing state workers, and as the economy slows for everyone,” Lane said. “Every state’s budget is going to be pressed.”
Trump is set to sign the legislation carrying his domestic agenda Friday. Washington’s congressional delegation voted along party lines, with all Democrats opposed and Reps. Michael Baumgartner, R-Spokane, and Dan Newhouse, R-Sunnyside, supporting the bill.
Their central and eastern Washington districts have the most households that receive SNAP benefits, as of 2023, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
Newhouse’s office identified the changes to the SNAP program as provisions that the congressman “worked to secure” and said they would save taxpayers money by “rooting out waste, and instituting long-overdue accountability incentives to control costs.” His office also described the state cost-sharing revisions as “modest.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/food-stamps-SNAP-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-03 19:03:56.653925

The Fourth of July and Pioneer Day drone shows will double the size Salt Lakers saw last year, city officials announced this week.

“So 150 is pretty typical for a drone show. And this year, for the first time, we’ll be doing 300 drones, which will allow us the ability to have bigger, better, more intricate, more detailed images up in the sky with the drones,” said Jana Cunningham, communications manager for the Salt Lake City Department of Public Lands.
For Saturday, the day after Independence Day, the city is planning a big event in Jordan Park starting at 8 p.m. with live music and food trucks. The drone show, scheduled to last about 20 minutes, will begin at 10 p.m. 
The Saturday lights display is set to feature iconic monuments from across the country, Cunningham said, “such as the Space Needle, the Golden Gate Bridge and Statue of Liberty, the Lincoln Memorial, things like that.”
The city’s Pioneer Day drone show will cap off a full day of celebrations on July 24 at Liberty Park. That event is also set to start at 8 p.m., but the drone display is scheduled for 10 p.m.

To celebrate the most Utah-centric holiday, the city is planning a show that reflects the state’s idiosyncratic culture.
“Spectators can enjoy graphics and images such as national parks,” Cunningham said. “We’re going to do soda shops, because nothing screams Utah more than a dirty soda.” 
Cookie wars, city and state flags, and other Utah landmarks are also expected to make appearances in the drones’ choreographies. 
The city has been hosting drone shows since 2023 in line with its sustainability goals, and attendees have embraced the new tradition, Cunningham said. 
She also said it’s a safer alternative to fireworks.
“We have a great risk of fire,” Cunningham said. “(Fireworks) also create quite a bit of pollution in the air and debris in the air. And really, we switched to drones because it guarantees more of a safe and environmentally friendly celebration.”
Private firework discharges are still allowed in the city. But, there are restricted areas to help prevent accidental fires.

(Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Education’s decision this week to hold back $6.8 billion in federal K-12 funds next year has triggered alarm among state education officials, school leaders and advocacy groups nationwide over how the lack of funds will affect their after-school, enrichment and language-learning services.
The Trump administration’s decision to freeze the funding has put states in “triage mode” as they scramble to decide what programs may be cut without that funding, said Mary Kusler, senior director for the Center for Advocacy at the National Education Association. The money was approved by Congress to support education for English language learners, migrants, low-income children and adults learning to read, among others.
As of July 1, school systems are unable to draw down funding, jeopardizing summer programs, hiring and early-year planning for the 2025–26 school year.
The funding freeze affects several core programs: Title II-A (educator training and recruitment), Title III-A (English learner support), Title IV-A (student enrichment and after-school), as well as migrant education and adult education and literacy grants. Trump has proposed eliminating all those programs in his proposed budget for next fiscal year, but that proposal hasn’t gone through Congress.
State superintendents sent out missives to school districts early this week and now are scrambling to make choices.
“This is not about political philosophy, this is about reliability and consistency,” Alabama state Superintendent Eric Mackey said to Politico this week. “None of us were worrying about this.”
The administration says it is reviewing the programs.
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the U.S. Department of Education wrote to states in its announcement Monday.
Trump administration tells states it’s freezing $6.8 billion for K-12 school programs

Historically, the department releases allocations by July 1 to ensure schools can budget and plan effectively for the coming school year. Withholding the money could result in canceled programs, hiring freezes and the loss of essential support for English learners, migrant children and other high-need populations, education and state officials told Stateline.
“America’s public school leaders run district budgets that are dependent on a complex partnership between federal, state, and local funding,” said David R. Schuler, executive director of the School Superintendents Association in a statement. “For decades, school districts have relied on timely confirmation of their federal allocations ahead of the July 1 start of the fiscal year — ensuring stability, allowing for responsible planning, and supporting uninterrupted educational services for students.”
The states facing the largest withheld amounts include California ($810.7 million), Texas ($660.9 million), and New York ($411.7 million), according to data from the NEA and the Learning Policy Institute, an education think tank.
The Missouri state budget that took effect Tuesday includes more than $79 million in federal funds the state anticipated receiving from the frozen programs. The largest portion is $28.9 million dedicated to improving teacher effectiveness, closely followed by $24.9 million for science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, education programs and career counseling and mentorship in those fields.
For 17 states and territories, the freeze affects over 15% of their total federal K-12 allocations, according to the Learning Policy Institute. For smaller jurisdictions such as the District of Columbia and Vermont, the disruption hits even harder: More than 20% of their federal K-12 budgets remain inaccessible.
Colorado Education Commissioner Susan Córdova urged school districts to begin contingency planning in case funds are not released before the federal fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. California State Superintendent Tony Thurmond hinted at possible legal action, which has become a trend as states fight the second Trump administration’s funding revocations or delays.
“California will continue to pursue all available legal remedies to the Trump Administration’s unlawful withholding of federal funds appropriated by Congress,” Thurmond said in a statement.
The NEA and the NAACP have filed for a preliminary injunction, calling the administration’s delay an illegal “impoundment” — a violation of the federal Impoundment Control Act, which bars the executive branch from withholding appropriated funds without congressional approval.
Education advocates warn the recent decision by the Trump administration to withhold funding reflects a broader pattern of federal disengagement from public education.
Community nonprofits said the withholding could devastate their programming too. The Boys and Girls Clubs of America could have to close more than 900 centers — bringing the loss of 5,900 jobs and affecting more than 220,000 children, said President and CEO Jim Clark in a statement.
The 1974 Impoundment Control Act lets the president propose canceling funds approved by Congress. Lawmakers have 45 days to approve the request; if they don’t, it’s denied. Meanwhile, agencies can be directed not to spend the funds during that time.
A White House statement shared with States Newsroom this week said “initial findings have shown that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.”
“Kids, educators, and working families are the ones losing,” said Kusler, of the NEA. “We need governors and communities to step up — now.”

Republican Thomas Massie and Democrat Morgan McGarvey opposed the measure but not for the same reasons.
Republican U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers, whose Appalachian district is one of the country’s most dependent on Medicaid, issued a statement claiming the One Big Beautiful Bill Act “strengthens Medicaid and SNAP benefits.”
An independent analysis of the bill’s effects on rural health care found that Kentucky will suffer the biggest hit of any state — a decline of $10 billion in Medicaid payments to rural providers over 10 years as 130,000 rural Kentuckians are expected to lose their Medicaid coverage. The analysis is by KFF, a nonpartisan health research organization.
‘They’ll get over it,’ McConnell reportedly assures GOP colleagues about Medicaid cuts

The Kentucky Hospital Association has warned the legislation would eliminate 33,000 jobs as Medicaid underfunding forces hospitals to reduce services or even close.
The bill also trims future funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, in which 575,000 Kentuckians participate, and shifts to states part of the costs.
In his statement, Rogers hinted that the measure headed for Trump’s desk is not the final word. “Ultimately, this is not the end of our reconciliation work, and as a cardinal member of the House Appropriations Committee, I will continue working to improve funding options for our rural hospitals and clinics.”
Rogers, of Somerset, also said, “While the House-version of the bill would have been far better for rural healthcare, the Senate added a $50 billion safety net for rural healthcare providers, carving out funding specifically for rural states like Kentucky, and delaying implementation of new provider tax rates to 2028.”

The House version, shepherded out of committee by House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Brett Guthrie, a Republican from Bowling Green, protected supplemental Medicaid payments that narrow the revenue gap between Medicaid and private insurance by pumping billions of dollars into Kentucky hospitals that treat a large share of low-income patients. The supplemental payments are funded by a tax on health care providers.
The Senate version, which the House largely adopted, would effectively eliminate the supplemental support that Kentucky hospitals say is critical to their viability, Kentucky Hospital Association President and CEO Nancy Galvagni told the Lantern. 
In the Senate, where Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote, Rand Paul of Kentucky was one of three Republicans who voted against the bill, objecting to its deficit-raising effects. Sen. Mitch McConnell voted for it.
The legislation makes tax cuts, including no taxes on tips, effective immediately while the cuts to benefits won’t go into effect until after next year’s mid-term elections.
Guthrie hailed passage of the bill, calling it a “a victory for millions of Americans, providing a historic tax cut, securing Medicaid, and ensuring American energy dominance.”
  U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)
But his fellow Republican, Massie of Vanceburg, pointed to the bill’s effects on federal deficits and debt and the economy. The bill will add $3.4 trillion to deficits during the next decade compared to current law, according to the Congressional Budget Office. 
“Although there were some conservative wins in the budget reconciliation bill (OBBBA), I voted No on final passage because it will significantly increase U.S. budget deficits in the near term, negatively impacting all Americans through sustained inflation and high interest rates,” Massie posted on X.
Republican U.S. Rep. Andy Barr, of Lexington, who’s seeking the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate next year, issued a statement saying, “This is the latest and greatest chapter of the Trump economic comeback — and the theme is promises made, promises kept.”
Barr echoed a familiar GOP talking point: “We achieved all of these goals while protecting and strengthening Medicaid for Kentuckians who truly need it — not ineligible recipients or illegal immigrants.”
Rogers, likewise, said: “The bill protects the longevity of Medicaid benefits for our most vulnerable population by slashing waste, fraud and abuse of the program. With 4.8 million able-bodied adults receiving Medicaid, who choose not to work, the bill enforces a 20-hour weekly work requirement for those individuals who do not have small kids. Without question, we are adding integrity and strength to Medicaid and SNAP assistance for those who need it most in the years ahead.”
Rogers said the bill “reinvests in coal country, by expanding a tax credit that some coal mines will now be eligible for, including Eastern Kentucky.”

Democrat Morgan McGarvey of Louisville slammed the GOP budget bill’s priorities calling it “a slap in the face to Kentucky and all of rural America. It will kick millions of Americans off their health insurance, take food away from Kentucky families, kids, and seniors, and add trillions to the national debt. All so that Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos pay even less in taxes. It is cruel and indefensible.
“I don’t want to hear any Republican who voted for this say they care about rural America or our national debt ever again,” McGarvey said.
Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, who has been an outspoken critic of the measure, repeated his warnings that the changes will be “devastating” for Kentucky.
In an interview on MSNBC, Beshear said 200,000 Kentuckians stand to lose health care and states cannot possibly make up for the federal government’s retreat from funding social safety net programs.
“No state has the budget to fix what the federal government, that Donald Trump and the Republicans are about to break. No state can make up for hundreds of billions of dollars of Medicaid payments flowing through our economy. If you just look at the economy at large, health care is one of the fastest growing segments out there. And this is the Republicans just taking a hatchet to it. We’re going to see job losses across America.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2194945302-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-03 19:03:56.653925

 The Senate version cuts nearly $1 trillion from Medicaid over 10 years

The Senate version of the budget and tax cut bill is expected to cut federal spending on Medicaid by around $1 trillion and increase the number of uninsured Americans by 11.8 million over the next 10 years, according to a preliminary estimate from the Congressional Budget Office.
US House passes massive tax break and spending cut bill, sending it to Trump

Erin Riley, outreach and engagement coordinator with the advocacy group Idaho Voices for Children, said the estimates in health care reductions are “conservative,” and many of the losses of coverage would be due to increased paperwork under new requirements in the bill. 
“In general, we might see people losing their Medicaid coverage because of eligibility, … but it’s a lot of paperwork,” Riley said. “It’s death by 1,000 cuts. So folks that would probably be eligible for traditional Medicaid, they might get caught up in that cycle of not being able to report that they are eligible. There’s just a lot of red tape.” 
Under the bill, able-bodied adults would be required to work or conduct “work-related activities” at least 80 hours a week and prove eligibility and compliance every six months. There would be exceptions for parents of children under the age of 14. 
Idaho is also pursuing its own work requirement through House Bill 345 for those who are insured through Medicaid expansion — a program approved by voters in 2018 to extend Medicaid eligibility to those who earned too much to qualify for traditional coverage but not enough to qualify for the premium tax credit to get health care coverage through the state marketplace. 
The state’s changes to Medicaid will need to be approved by federal authorities before going into effect.
 Sen. Crapo says bill protects Medicaid coverage for those it was intended for 

The broad-reaching bill extends tax cuts approved in 2017, during the first Trump administration, that mostly benefit wealthy people, critics and some experts say. The bill, among many provisions, also enhances funding for the military and immigration enforcement, ends renewable energy programs approved by the Biden administration, and reduces funding for some public assistance programs, such as Medicaid and food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP.

Crapo, who serves as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said that the bill would protect benefits “for whom Medicaid was intended,” including pregnant women, children, seniors and those with disabilities; Crapo didn’t include in his remarks low-income residents, who were eligible after states were able to expand Medicaid following the passage of the Affordable Care Act. 
He argued that programs that enroll healthy Americans and undocumented residents have been driving up the program’s costs. 
“This rate of expansion is unsustainable and puts the future of the program at risk,” Crapo said on the floor. 
U.S. Sen. Jim Risch’s office said in a press release that one of the achievements of the bill he supported was it preserved “Medicaid for vulnerable Americans by enacting common-sense reforms that prioritize resources for those who need care.”

Rep. Mike Simpson’s office could not be immediately reached for comment on the Medicaid portion of the budget bill, but said in an emailed statement the bill “is the America-First policy agenda that Idahoans and Americans nationwide voted for in November.” 
U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher’s office also could not be immediately reached for comment. He said in a press release that he voted Thursday to “deliver what effectively will result in the single largest tax cut in American history for the American People, and to bolster border and military resources to keep our communities safe.”
In a statement, Idaho Democratic Party Chair Lauren Necochea sharply criticized the votes of Idaho’s congressmen.
“Idaho Democrats believe hard work should mean a roof over your head, food on the table, healthcare you can count on, and a fair shot for your kids. Mike Simpson and Russ Fulcher just voted to rip that away,” she said. “They backed a Republican budget that pushes the American Dream further out of reach for working people, while catering to billionaires with penthouses and private jets.”

The spending bill does not extend the enhanced premium tax credits, which were passed by Congress through the American Rescue Plan Act to reduce health care premiums through the marketplace established in the Affordable Care Act. The enhanced credits are slated to expire this year, and if Congress does not extend them, many people would see their premiums “skyrocket,” Riley said. 
On average, the tax credits have reduced premium payments by $705 a year, according to the health care policy organization KFF. 
Increases could be more significant for some groups. 
An estimate by Idaho Voices for Children shows an Idaho couple in their 60s, making $82,000 a year, would see their annual premiums rise from $6,970 to over $22,222. 
“With that high premium cost, we’re going to see people drop off because they’re just not going to be able to afford coverage,” Riley said.

(Provided/Gullah Traveling Theater)When George Washington goes to heaven in the Gullah Traveling Theater’s telling of the American Revolution, Saint Peter stops him at the pearly gates.
The country’s first president and commander-in-chief of the Continental Army must first reckon with his ownership of slaves and their lives before he can pass, Saint Peter tells him.
Though obviously a fictional scenario, the Virginia planter’s will indicates he did struggle internally with the juxtaposition of securing freedom for a country while enslaving people, according to historians. Signed six months before his death in 1799, it ordered enslaved workers at Mount Vernon freed when his wife, Martha Washington, died, though fewer than half actually were.
In the play, the general does make it into heaven.
Through Washington and other famous Revolutionary figures looking back at their lives, the nonprofit theater company tells the often-overlooked story of enslaved people in South Carolina during the Revolution, said director Anita Singleton Prather.


How to see the show
An excerpt of the show will play at 4 p.m. July 9 at Christ Lutheran Church in Hilton Head Island. Tickets are free.
Da’Gullah American Revolution Experience will play at 2 p.m. July 19 at May River Theater in Bluffton. Advance tickets for adults are $45. Youth ages 7 to 17 are $15. Children age 0 to 6 are free. All tickets include a rice tasting. The show will be part of a mini festival taking pace from noon to 6 p.m. at the theater.


“They say behind every great man is a great woman, but I knew behind every great Revolutionary hero was probably some Black folks,” Prather said.
SC250, which is tasked with celebrating the 250th anniversary of the country’s founding, asked the Beaufort-based theater troupe’s director last year if she would be interested in putting on a show about the Gullah Geechee experience during the Revolutionary War.
Prather jumped at the chance to tell the story, she said.
“A lot of our history has not been included in your normal textbooks or archives,” Prather said.
Research was Prather’s first step.
She, like many people, knew much of the history that has been compiled of enslaved people during the Civil War, but the Revolution remained a dark spot in that history. That wasn’t for lack of trying. Not nearly as much has been written about slaves during that era, she said.
Prather knew that many people were enslaved in Barbados and brought to Charleston, so she visited the country in the Caribbean Sea in January. There, she got a better sense of the slave trade during that time.
She read accounts of the people enslaved to well-known figures during the war in South Carolina, including “Swamp Fox” Francis Marion and “Fighting Gamecock” Thomas Sumter.
Because the play is fictional, Prather used historical accounts as the bones of the stories and filled in the gaps with her own writing, she said.
The play, called Da’Gullah American Revolution Experience, heavily features music, which was another challenge.
Scott Gibbs, the company’s music and art director, wanted to include traditional Gullah Geechee songs from the era, knowing some from the Civil War had survived the years, but he couldn’t find much. So, he rearranged other spirituals to fit the scenes, he said.
“I’ve learned that sometimes (music) lightens the telling of the story,” Gibbs said. “You still have to tell the story. You still have to tell the truth, but it’s how you tell the story and how you tell the truth.”
While the story grapples with an ugly part of history, the point is not to take away from the major contributions and sacrifices the heroes of the Revolutionary War made in founding the country.
Principles of the Declaration of Independence they signed, such as liberty, freedom and the pursuit of happiness, were generally good, Prather said.
Founding Mothers’ Day recognizes SC women’s contributions to The Revolution

The Founding Fathers should have recognized that those principles should have applied to all people in the country, including those who were enslaved, she said. To do that, the play humanizes the people denied the right to freedom for which the heroes of the Revolution fought, she said.
At a time when references to slavery at places such as national parks are being removed, Prather wanted audiences to grapple with the difficult parts of the past, she said.
“If you leave out the Gullah Geechee, then South Carolina history is not complete,” Prather said. “If you leave out South Carolina history, American history is not complete. Without American history, world history is not complete.”
“We have to tell the stories, and history is not good or bad,” Prather continued. “It’s just what happened.”
Those contradictions were what made Prather decide to frame the story through characters looking back on their lives at heaven’s gates as opposed to using a more traditional linear narrative, she said.
A person like Washington, seen as a symbol of freedom during the Revolution, can face the people he enslaved as he never would have in life, she said.
In this version of the afterlife, enslaved people confront the people who owned them. During one act of the play, the characters read fictionalized letters to their masters, saying everything Prather imagined they might have said if given the chance.
For instance, Oscar Marion — who was enslaved by the general who’s the namesake of a South Carolina city, county and public university — is able to ask Francis Marion how he could enslave him despite them reportedly being friends as children and fighting side by side during the war.
“‘You don’t think I deserve the same freedom I fought for you to have?’” Prather said Oscar Marion asks. “‘You don’t think I deserve the same thing?’”
The play, which showed an abridged preview in May, is only able to tell the story of a handful of enslaved people. Prather wants people to take away a broader curiosity of their role in the war.
“There are so many untold stories that need to be told,” Prather said. “We won’t get to tell them all, but hopefully we’ll give people enough of a taste that they will go and do some of their own research.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-03-at-4.27.05-PM.png,,,2025-07-03 18:07:35.127822

Jim Pillen on Thursday announced an interim director for the Nebraska Department of Economic Development: Maureen Larsen, who currently serves as the governor’s general counsel.
Larsen, who earned her law degree from the University of Nebraska College of Law, also serves as Pillen’s deputy director of policy research. The policy division serves as the governor’s personal lobbying arm.
She is to transition from her current role July 21, replacing K.C. Belitz, whose resignation was announced suddenly last month after serving two years on the job. Belitz’s final day as DED director is July 18.
Larsen earned her bachelor’s degree from the University of Vermont. 
The DED director has been a rather high-profile position, overseeing grants and funding for economic development ventures and attending related ribbon-cuttings for projects across the state.

Larsen’s general counsel and policy research position has been more behind the scenes. She was quoted in a 2023 Flatwater Free Press story about an apparent unprecedented move by the Pillen administration to shield the governor’s communications.
Larsen, in a response to the news outlet’s request for email, said certain communication of the governor was “protected by executive privilege” or “deliberative process privilege,” the FFP reported. 
Several former and current officials and advocates told the FFP they couldn’t recall any other Nebraska governors invoking that privilege to deny access to records.
Pillen’s media statement thanked Belitz for his service. It did not indicate when a permanent DED director might be named.

The ACLU of Missouri filed a lawsuit Wednesday in Cole County with two objectives: Keep the proposal designated as Amendment 3 off of […],"The Cole County Courthouse in Jefferson City (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)A fight over wording for a proposal to reverse the abortion rights amendment Missouri voters added to the state Constitution in November will look very much like a similar fight in 2023.
The ACLU of Missouri filed a lawsuit Wednesday in Cole County with two objectives: Keep the proposal designated as Amendment 3 off of the November 2026 ballot or, failing that, completely reword the ballot language crafted by lawmakers. The job of defending the proposal and the way it is written will fall to Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, who is the lead defendant.
In 2023, the ACLU of Missouri also challenged ballot language, written by then-Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, but with the intent of getting a citizen initiative on the ballot.
“It certainly feels a lot like deja vu to go back into Cole County and argue again over a misleading and inaccurate ballot summary statement from a Missouri politician,” ACLU attorney Tori Schafer said in an interview with The Independent.
One of the main proponents of the legislative measure, Sam Lee of Campaign Life Missouri, said the lawsuit was expected. He said he doesn’t think the measure will be thrown off the ballot and said the ballot language is defensible and should stand.
“You get a dozen lawyers in a room, and they’ll write it 12 different ways,” Lee said. “And as long as it’s fair and impartial, there are a variety of ways of doing it.”
When the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, it triggered a Missouri law banning abortions in almost all instances. That led to an initiative campaign, which resulted in a 52% majority approving a constitutional amendment that made abortion legal up until the point of fetal viability.
But except for a short period, abortions have remained unavailable because the question of which of Missouri’s abortion regulations remain in force is tied up in court. Prior to the total ban, for example, Missouri required a 72-hour waiting period between an initial appointment and an abortion, that a woman seeking an abortion be given a lengthy document about fetal development and that all abortions take place in specially licensed ambulatory surgical centers.
The lawsuit over those issues is being heard in Jackson County Circuit Court, where Judge Jerri Zhang could issue a decision at any time on a request for an injunction against the laws.
The proposal passed by lawmakers would repeal the voter-approved initiative in its entirety and replace it with language that would allow the ban to be reinstated. It would carve out limited exceptions, allowing abortions in cases of rape, incest, fetal anomaly or medical emergencies during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.
The proposal would also ban gender transition surgeries or medications for people under 18, and require all lawsuits that raise questions about state laws on reproductive health care be filed in Cole County.
The ballot language written by lawmakers, and being challenged in the lawsuit, would state:
“Shall the Missouri Constitution be amended to:

Guarantee access to care for medical emergencies, ectopic pregnancies, and miscarriages;
Ensure women’s safety during abortions;
Ensure parental consent for minors;
Allow abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest;
Require physicians to provide medically accurate information; and
Protect children from gender transition?”

In the lawsuit, the ACLU is arguing that the ballot language is unfair and misleading.
The “summary statement uses language which is intentionally argumentative and likely to create prejudice for the measure,” the petition states.
The most glaring omission is that it does not mention what it is replacing, the lawsuit states. 
“Among other things, the summary statement fails to advise voters that it will repeal a measure they just adopted in the last election cycle,” attorneys wrote.
The language should at least inform voters that there will be no protected right to obtain an abortion, Schafer said.
“The courts back in 2023 made sure we had a fair and accurate ballot summary statement and fair ballot language,” she said. “We know that they’ll do the same this year.”
The gender-affirming treatments language and the provision directing venue of reproductive health care cases to Cole County are impermissible, the lawsuit states. They violate the Constitution’s requirement that constitutional amendments address only one subject.
“We know that the reason that Missouri politicians put that piece about Cole County in there is because they don’t like the fact that we’ve been successful on the (legal challenges to restrictive laws) in Jackson County,” Schafer said. “It was a very politically motivated reason that they put that in.”
Lee said he thinks all the subjects relate to reproductive health care and will survive that part of the challenge.
“It’s a weak argument, because even supporters of what passed in November last year link reproductive health care with transgender care,” he said.
The return to court over ballot language on abortion rights is the latest round of a seemingly endless contest. 
Abortion rights supporters will never give up, Schafer said.
“I feel like what we’re asking for is a very simple thing, which is just get politicians out of health care and let people make their own health care decisions,” she said. “And so that is our stance on that.”
If the legislative measure makes it to the ballot and passes, Lee said, he expects a new initiative to reverse it. Lee has been an anti-abortion activist for decades, including many years as an influential lobbyist.
Asked when he expects the debate to end, Lee said:
“Not in my lifetime. I’m not saying that because of me personally. I’m just saying I don’t expect it to be settled anytime soon.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-07-03 21:41:32+00:00,Mississippi Today,Medicaid cuts could be devastating for the Delta and the rest of rural America,"Shalina Chatlani, Stateline and Kim Krisberg, Stateline",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/03/medicaid-cuts-mississippi-lousiana/,"""There's nowhere to go"": An inside look at how already struggling communities in Mississippi and Louisiana could be affected by the Medicaid cuts in the new federal tax and spending bill.","Note: This story first published in Stateline, which is part of States Newsroom, the nation’s largest state-focused nonprofit news organization.
LAKE PROVIDENCE, La. — East Carroll Parish sits in the northeastern corner of Louisiana, along the winding Mississippi River. Its seat, Lake Providence, was a thriving agricultural center of the Delta. Now, the town is a shell of its former self. Charred and dilapidated buildings dot the small city center. There are a few gas stations, a handful of restaurants — and little to no industry.
Mayor Bobby Amacker, 79, says at one point “you couldn’t even walk down the street” in Lake Providence’s main business district because “there were so many people.”
“It’s gone down tremendously in the last 50 years,” said Amacker, a Democrat. “The town, it looks like it’s drying up. And it’s almost unstoppable, as far as I can tell.”
Now, East Carroll residents stand to lose even more. Like many people in Louisiana, they received a lifeline when the state expanded Medicaid to more low-income adults in 2016. Expansion drove Louisiana’s uninsured rate to the lowest in the Deep South, at 8% in 2023 for working-age adults, according to state data, despite it having the highest poverty rate in the U.S. that year.
This week, both chambers of Congress approved President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill. It includes more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint state-federal health insurance program for poor families and individuals, to help pay for tax cuts that mostly benefit the rich. The legislation would cause 11.8 million more Americans to become uninsured by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
The bill includes new work rules for Medicaid recipients and would require them to verify their eligibility more frequently. It also would limit a financing strategy that states have used to boost Medicaid payments to hospitals.
Republicans say enrollees are taking advantage of the Medicaid program and getting benefits when they shouldn’t be. They say the program costs too much and states are not paying their fair share.
The Delta region, which includes communities in both Louisiana and Mississippi, would suffer under such large cuts. But in Louisiana — where almost half of the state depended on Medicaid in 2023, the Louisiana Department of Health reported — the cuts could be ruinous. Louisiana could lose up to $35 billion in federal Medicaid support over the next decade, according to KFF, a health policy research group. Mississippi, which never expanded Medicaid, could still lose up to $5 billion.
Residents are watching with apprehension, fear and, sometimes, anger, wondering how Congress could be so blind to how much they are struggling.
“If they take that away from us and everyone that really needs it, that’s going to be bad,” said Sherila Ervin, who lives 20 minutes up the road from Lake Providence in Oak Grove and has Medicaid coverage.
Medicaid work requirements and other health care provisions in the bill ignore the reality of living in poorer rural communities, where people struggle to find the jobs, transportation and internet access required to meet the rules, according to interviews with people and providers in the Delta region.
Even though Louisiana and Mississippi have taken very different approaches to Medicaid — one expanded eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act and the other didn’t — both rely heavily on the program to sustain access to medical care for all their residents.
On a hot summer day in June, Ervin walks into the bare-bones 99-cent store in downtown Lake Providence. As she looks over some clothing, she says she’s heard about the potential Medicaid cuts. But she hadn’t heard about the work requirements, and is shocked they’re even on the table.
“I don’t like that. I don’t think they should put a stipulation on that,” Ervin says, exasperated that she would have to report her work hours. It’s hard enough as it is, she says, to thrive in this community.

Ervin, 58, has been working at Oak Grove High School in the cafeteria, serving hot plates to children for two decades. She says it’s one of the good, steady jobs available in this area, but her income is only around $1,500 per month.
Ervin’s job offers health benefits, but she can’t afford the premiums on her salary. She relies on Medicaid for care, including medications for her high blood pressure.
In East Carroll Parish, around 46.5% of people live below the poverty level, meaning the area is overwhelmingly poor, at over four times the national poverty rate, with a median income of $28,321. For Black households, the figure is a mere $16,690.
Expansion was a lifeline for people such as Ervin. Louisiana offers Medicaid to people who earn below 138% of the federal poverty line — currently about $22,000 a year for an individual.
“Sometimes you can work, but then when you work, you still can’t pay to get help,” Ervin said.
It’s a similar economic situation an hour away across the river. Poverty is about three times the national rate in Washington County, Mississippi, where residents in the city of Greenville lament the consequences of not being able to avoid destructive medical debt, which can keep them stuck in a cycle of gig work and of living paycheck to paycheck.
Greenville, the county seat, is among the fastest-shrinking cities in the U.S. It’s still one of the larger rural cities in Mississippi, with coffee shops, restaurants, hotels, a regional hospital and several big-box stores. But the downtown has just a few small businesses and a bank, and residents say jobs are hard to find.
Greenville resident April McNair, 45, remembers giving birth 17 years ago, long before Mississippi extended postpartum Medicaid to a full year. She had Medicaid coverage during pregnancy, but was kicked off shortly after giving birth, despite having post-delivery complications.

The result was a trip to the emergency room and a $2,500 bill she couldn’t cover. Right after giving birth, McNair looked for work. She said potential employers often told her that she was overqualified because she had a master’s degree.
“I had to kind of figure out how to make my ends meet,” McNair said. “I ended up with a significant bill, all because I did not have Medicaid.”
McNair feels like Mississippi leaders are making a mistake by continuing to reject full Medicaid expansion.
“That’s a selfish move. To me, they’re selfish,” McNair said, adding that now she’s worried for neighbors in Louisiana who may lose the lifeline she wishes she had.
“God forbid, hypothetically speaking, what if one of them meets their demise because of this bill that [Congress] passed?”
Hard to thrive
Mississippi experienced its first taste of equalized access to medicine in the late 1960s.
Delta Health Center, the first federally funded health center in the nation, opened during the peak of the Civil Rights Movement in the all-Black town of Mound Bayou, about an hour north of Greenville. The center vowed to care for anyone regardless of race or ability to pay in a region plagued with poverty, poor health and discrimination — and continues to do so to this day.
It was a significant opportunity for generations of African Americans who had gone without health care, in a place where people had no access to clean drinking water, running sewage systems or even food, said Robin Boyles, chief program planning and development officer at Delta Health Center.
But it wasn’t easy for the clinic to mobilize support, even though it was clearly needed. Before its opening, it faced pushback from politicians and even doctors. In a 1966 clipping from a local newspaper, the white-owned Bolivar Commercial, the editorial board railed against the new clinic, saying it would “lead further to socialized medicine.”
The situation is certainly better in Mississippi and Louisiana than it was in the 1960s, but critics say the Medicaid cuts could reverse hard-fought progress.
People who live in the Delta are fiercely proud of their communities, but conditions there make it hard to thrive.
Black residents, who are the overwhelming majority, have had a particularly hard time. After the Civil War, many were relegated to sharecropping of cotton and corn for subsistence. Meanwhile, an elite white class of plantation owners and investors amassed enormous amounts of wealth.
A 2001 report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights described the area as one with “limited economic resources; inadequate employment opportunities; insufficient decent, affordable housing; and poor quality public schools.”
“We have a lot of patients that are one health issue away from either being out of a job or being bankrupt because of a trip to the emergency room,” said Dr. Brent Smith, a physician at a primary care clinic at Delta Health System in Greenville.
Even some of the most vulnerable people, such as new moms in Mississippi, still struggle to get basic care, in part because the state has left billions of dollars in federal funding for Medicaid expansion on the table, said Dr. Lakeisha Richardson, an OB-GYN at Delta Health System.
“There are a lot of maternal [care] deserts in Mississippi where women have to travel 60 miles or more just to get prenatal care and just to get to the closest hospital for delivery,” Richardson said. “And I don’t see that getting any better in Mississippi and in rural areas.”
Richardson says nearly all her patients are working moms, many of whom would really benefit from having Medicaid expansion.
“America doesn’t realize that there are people out here struggling for no reason of their own,” she said.
That’s why Medicaid expansion in Louisiana in 2016, much like the community health center movement in Mississippi, was a bright spot in the rural South, said Smith.
“Louisiana expanded Medicaid, a surprising move in the South to see any state expand,” Smith said. “They saw it for what it was, which was a very real opportunity to assist this specific group of patients.”

In Mississippi, 20 rural hospitals are at immediate risk of closure, according to a recent report, more than double the number at risk in Louisiana. In many cases, Medicaid is the largest and most reliable payer for rural hospitals. While Louisiana’s overall uninsured rate plummeted to 8.3% by 2023, in Mississippi it was 10.5%.
“Unlike a lot of our Southern peers, we have not had the same level of closures of facilities,” said Courtney Foster, senior policy adviser for Medicaid, with the nonprofit Invest in Louisiana.
“Medicaid was like a real lifeline for people in transition. Oftentimes it was people who had lost their jobs and were just looking to get back on their feet.”
Now, the new work and reporting requirements could put that progress at risk.
In East Carroll Parish, finding a job — let alone a good-paying one with health benefits — is difficult, says Rosie Brown, executive director at the East Carroll Community Action Agency, a nonprofit that helps low-income people with their rent and utility bills. Many of the jobs available in town pay minimum wage, just $7.25 an hour.
Brown loves living in Lake Providence; this is where her family is. She doesn’t want to move but wishes the government would invest more in her community — not take away benefits that help people who are hanging on by a thread.
“We have one bank. We have one supermarket,” she said. “Transportation isn’t easy either.”
Local infrastructure is so limited, she’s even heard of some people charging residents $20 for a ride to Walmart. Some people have to hitch a ride an hour away to go to work, she said.
“There’s nowhere to go,” Brown said.
Dominique Jones works at the local library, where she helps roughly 75 to 85 people per month apply for programs such as Medicaid and food assistance. Many of the residents she helps don’t have access to the internet or even a computer, a real barrier for people who’d be required to report their working hours to state Medicaid officials.
“This town right here is made up of a lot of old people that need Medicaid and Medicare. And without it, they wouldn’t have any kind of health care at all,” Mayor Amacker said.
Even a job in local government in Lake Providence doesn’t offer affordable health insurance.
Nevada Qualls, 25, sits across from Amacker’s office. She earns just $12 an hour as a cashier at city hall. The low pay means she qualifies for Medicaid expansion coverage, which is good because she can’t afford the premiums for private insurance.
“I feel like there should be a higher threshold for people that can get Medicaid, because they’re still struggling,” she said.
At the 99-cent store, school district worker Ervin wonders whether state and federal leaders understand what it’s like to live in her community, urging them to visit and see for themselves.
“They want to do stuff for the rich people that’s already rich,” she said. “What are they doing? It’s almost like there’s no common sense with them.”
‘The tremble factors’
While leaders in the U.S. Senate were working into the night this past weekend debating Trump’s tax and spending bill, Greenville resident Jennifer Morris was praying for the pain to stay away.
Morris, 44, has hemicrania continua, a headache disorder that causes constant pain on one side of her head. There’s no underlying trigger and no cure. Her doctors help her keep the pain to a minimum with regular treatments that include dozens of injections into her head.
“It doesn’t take the pain away,” she said during a late-night gathering in Greenville’s Greater Mount Olivet Missionary Baptist Church in June. “It does reduce the pain so that I’m able to function. But it’s rough.”
Morris is worried about the looming Medicaid cuts. She qualifies for Mississippi Medicaid because her condition counts as a disability, and she depends on the coverage to afford her medications.
Morris’ Medicaid may be safer than that of her Delta neighbors in Lake Providence, as some of the most dramatic Medicaid changes being considered — such as work requirements — target Medicaid expansion states only.
But Mississippi could be hurt by a provision in the Senate bill that would target a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government.
Mississippi could see a major hit to its Medicaid funds, which “would be a tremendous decrease in revenue for the state,” harming “services and access to care,” says Mitchell Adcock, executive director at the Center for Mississippi Health Policy.
“It would be just the opposite of expansion. It would be a contraction for the Medicaid program in the state,” he said.
Leonard Favorite, a pastor who was attending the same event at Mount Olivet Church, as Morris, says he grew up on a plantation in Louisiana and worked his way out of poverty by joining the Air Force. This type of journey is hard, he said, when you’re already starting from so far behind. He thinks the “big, beautiful bill” will create more roadblocks for poor people.

“You have people who are already living below the poverty line and they will certainly be submerged into poverty at unspeakable levels,” said Favorite, 70.“ That seems to be the trend of this administration from the point of view of looking from the outside.
“Poor people are beginning to feel the tremble factors of an administration that caters toward the rich.”
National researchers estimate that up to 132,000 Louisianans who gained health insurance under expansion could lose it under work rules.
But national reports that rely on census data likely underestimate the potential Medicaid losses. For example, while 2023 census data show 47% of East Carroll Parish was on Medicaid, state health data reviewed by Stateline and Public Health Watch suggests the number is more like 64%. Similarly statewide, census data showed about a third of Louisianans were on Medicaid. State data shows that percentage is closer to 46.5%.
Experts such as Joan Alker at the Georgetown Center for Children and Families say the undercounts nationally are a well-known issue among researchers, but it’s difficult to correct because the quality of state reporting can be so uneven.
State Medicaid funding is also at risk. For years, both Mississippi and Louisiana have relied on revenue generated through a financing tool — known as a provider tax — to draw down more federal dollars and boost Medicaid reimbursements to providers. But congressional Republicans hope to limit states’ ability to collect those taxes.
Depending on how Congress restricts provider taxes, Mississippi could lose hundreds of millions in federal Medicaid funding, crucial in a state with such a high uninsured rate, said Richard Roberson, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association.
“It’s unavoidable that when you’re taking that much money out of the system, that there’s not going to be some repercussions felt even in non-Medicaid expansion states like Mississippi,” Roberson said.
Last week, the Louisiana Hospital Association signed a statement calling the package of Medicaid cuts before Congress “historic in their devastation.”

“The airport, at a minimum, has a responsibility to let the public know what’s happening inside these walls, and on the tarmac,” Julie Macuga of Burlington said at the city’s airport commision meeting Wednesday.

A loose group of advocates is urging the panel that oversees operations at Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport to issue a statement describing — and, some said, condemning — how federal immigration agents have repeatedly used Vermont’s largest air hub to transport people detained in the state and possibly facing deportation to other parts of the country.
Speaking at the Burlington Airport Commission’s monthly meeting Wednesday evening, two advocates also presented data they said showed federal immigration agents are flying far more people out of the airport, which is run by the City of Burlington, than is widely known.
Leif Taranta of Burlington and Brian Clifford of Essex said their findings, which they’ve compiled into a public chart online, suggest at least 450 people detained by federal law enforcement in immigration cases have been transferred through the Burlington airport since the start of January. That includes transfers by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.
VTDigger has not independently verified Taranta and Clifford’s work, though a representative from the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project, which is one of the state’s few networks offering pro bono legal aid to non-U.S. citizens, endorsed the advocates’ effort at Wednesday’s meeting.
“The airport, at a minimum, has a responsibility to let the public know what’s happening inside these walls, and on the tarmac,” Julie Macuga of Burlington, another advocate who spoke at the meeting, told the airport commissioners.
The panel did not develop a statement at its meeting, though the body’s chair, Tim George, said in an interview afterward that he and the other commissioners would continue to discuss the request, including what, specifically, his counterparts would be willing to say.
“I think we’ll have some conversations about that and see how we want to proceed,” he said.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
Wednesday’s meeting comes as Vermont officials’ interactions with immigration authorities have drawn increased scrutiny following the high-profile arrests of Columbia University student and Palestinian rights activist Mohsen Mahdawi and Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk. Both students were in the country legally but have been targeted by President Donald Trump’s administration for deportation. Mahdawi is a Vermont resident, while Öztürk’s detention was challenged in federal court in Vermont.
Federal officials have shuffled detainees from other states into and out of Vermont, and used commercial flights out of the airport, which is in South Burlington, to facilitate deportations, VTDigger has reported. Those jailed in Vermont’s prisons include people with established lives in the state, like farmworkers. Vermont’s prisons have also held people from other New England states, including Kseniia Petrova, a Russian scientist working at Harvard University.
Öztürk was shuttled from Massachusetts, where she was arrested, to an ICE field office in St. Albans before being flown out of the Burlington airport early the following morning to Louisiana. She spent weeks in detention there before a judge in Vermont ordered her release. Meanwhile, agents attempted to fly Mahdawi out of the airport to Louisiana, as well, after he was arrested while attending a U.S. citizenship interview in Colchester, the student’s lawyers have said.
That a public body as minor as the airport commission — which is only advisory by design and consists of residents from Burlington, South Burlington and Winooski — was facing questions about the actions of federal immigration agents is evidence of just how focused public scrutiny of immigration enforcement in the state has become.

One commissioner, Helen Riehle, a former longtime state legislator from South Burlington, called the use of the airport for transporting ICE detainees “abhorrent.” 
Still, it’s not clear there is much — if anything — the commission, or the staff who run the day-to-day operations at the airport, could do to impact how the federal government chooses to use the facility to transport detainees, said Nic Longo, the airport’s director. He said the airport administration generally is not privy to information about immigration operations there.
“We don’t know when these are happening,” he said, referring to when people are transferred through the airport by federal immigration agents. “We don’t get advised. We don’t get any communication.”
He added, too, that the airport could risk losing access to federal grants and other funding assurances by impeding or refusing to comply with immigration enforcement — a point U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy made publicly earlier this year. (That threat has since been temporarily blocked by a federal judge after a coalition of 20 states, including Vermont, sued to challenge its legality.)

There were several instances, Longo noted, in which ICE agents were parking their vehicles in areas where parking wasn’t allowed. The airport pushed back — in some cases, nearly towing the vehicles — and got the agents to park in spaces generally available to the public. The airport’s goal, he said, is to treat the agents as if they are any other law enforcement officials, or members of the public.
ICE did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday about its operations at the airport. 
Taranta, one of the activists, said the group collected data on those operations using U.S. Department of Justice press releases, the PACER system that tracks federal court cases, and a Vermont Department of Corrections website that provides access to a jail tracking system where people can find friends and family members in the state’s prisons. They also verified the data through news articles and direct observations at prisons and the Burlington airport, they said. 
The activists said the data they collected shows as many as 500 immigration detainees have likely been moved through Vermont between Jan. 1 and July 1. About 460 were highly likely to have been transferred through the Burlington airport, the citizen researchers believe, with many of them booked on early morning flights. 
“That’s a shocking number if true,” said Brett Stokes, an attorney at the Center for Justice Reform at the Vermont Law and Graduate School, in an interview Wednesday. Stokes said he would be inclined to trust it unless proven otherwise, but he doesn’t believe it’s a statistic the federal government is required to track.
Activists shared that they were concerned people are being moved through the state without access to legal representation. 
A major concern expressed by those who spoke at the commission meeting was that people flown out of the airport — who were often unshackled, in plain clothes and accompanied by U.S. Marshals — did not have an opportunity to meet with an attorney before facing deportation proceedings outside of the state. The early hours of transport, which the activists have said their findings repeatedly show, also make it difficult for attorneys to connect with clients, they said.
“It’s become clear to us that the airport plays a large role in the region’s ICE operations and most people don’t know about this, including the airport commissions,” Taranta said in an interview. “I hope they’ll take some actions against it.”

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)The number of Arkansas students participating in one of three summer nutrition programs offered in the state has already eclipsed last year’s count, officials said Thursday at a food distribution event in Sherwood.
The newest program, Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer for Children, or Summer EBT, was created through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 and modeled on a similar initiative created during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Each child enrolled in the Summer EBT program receives a debit card loaded with $120 for purchasing fresh meat, fruit and vegetables, dairy products, breads, snacks and non-alcoholic drinks. 
Arkansas, which has one of the nation’s worst rates of food insecurity, opted into the program last year even as many other Republican-led states did not — a trend that has continued in the second year of the program with 13 states choosing not to participate. Oklahoma has opted out of the program for the second straight year, but some tribal nations within the state are participating.
New report ranks Arkansas’ food insecurity rate worst in the U.S.

This year, 325,000 students have been enrolled into Arkansas’ Summer EBT program so far, said Mary Franklin, director of the Arkansas Department of Human Services’ (DHS) Division of County Operations. DHS spokesperson Gavin Lesnick said the program, which “makes a lot of sense” for Arkansas, served 293,000 students in 2024. 
The department is accepting applications until Aug. 25.
Of the 325,000 current participants, the vast majority were automatically enrolled in the program because they met certain criteria, such as Medicaid or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) enrollment or receiving free or reduced meals at their school. Only 7,000 participants were not automatically enrolled this year, Lesnick said.
“A lot of those children just automatically don’t have to do anything,” Lesnick said, “but if you aren’t in one of those buckets, you have to fill out an application.”
The one exception, he said, is for those at schools that automatically give all students free or reduced lunch. Those students still have to apply to receive the Summer EBT benefit. Lesnick and Franklin both emphasized that people should apply for the program even if they are unsure if they qualify.
“We’re thrilled [the Summer EBT program] is going well,” Lesnick said.
Patty Barker, the campaign director for No Kid Hungry Arkansas, which is part of the Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance, said the rollout of the Summer EBT program has gone much smoother in its second year. State officials highlighted how benefits for students who were enrolled in the program last year were loaded onto the cards they were given last summer instead of new ones. 
Barker said an enhanced focus on messaging, making sure parents and students knew about the program, and an earlier start date, have made the summer nutrition program more successful this year. The alliance worked with the state to get the word out, Barker said.
“The federal program was new last summer, and just the process, it didn’t get started until midsummer,” Barker said. “So this year we were ahead of the game and able to start announcing that the program was going to be offered in the spring before kids go home from school; getting schools on board to be able to make all the families aware. So that was a huge bonus.”
The Summer EBT program is administered by DHS with help from the state Department of Education. Education Secretary Jacob Oliva said in an interview that his department coordinates with DHS to help it determine which students should be automatically enrolled in the program.
“We work with [DHS] to help find students and families that qualify, work with school districts that are willing to support…the program. We have a Food and Nutrition Division that helps share the word, communicate, collaborate with a lot of people who may not know that they’re eligible for extra support through the summer,” Oliva said.
Oliva, Franklin and Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders all emphasized the importance of addressing child hunger before assisting with a drive-up meal distribution outside Cato Elementary Thursday morning. Sanders specifically touted what she described as bipartisan efforts to provide free breakfast to every student in Arkansas regardless of their means, which she named as one of her biggest legislative priorities for the 2025 session.
“It’s one of the biggest challenges we have in our state,” Sanders said of the state’s food insecurity issue, “but it’s something that we are not going to ignore and refuse to take on and tackle. I know that we can move Arkansas from being at the bottom of this list by utilizing programs like this.”
The state offers other nutrition programs to feed students during the summer months. The two other initiatives, both offered through the U.S. Department of Agriculture and administered by the state education department, are the Seamless Summer Option (SSO) and the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP). The meal distribution that Sanders and other officials participated in were part of the SFSP, which provides meals and snacks to students at approved sites such as schools. 
Franklin said that the programs were not either-or — students could participate in more than one at the same time.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_3868-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-03 18:07:35.127822

John Perkins.","Karah Spencer Perkins Potter died from the kind of pervasive gun violence her family has spent decades working to curb in Jackson.
At her funeral service Wednesday, family members, friends and others talked about the 23-year-old’s spirit, smile and servant’s heart — reminiscent of her grandfather, renowned civil rights and evangelical leader, the Rev. John Perkins, who advocated for development and racial reconciliation in west Jackson.  
While working at a summer camp run by her family’s nonprofit, the John and Vera Mae Perkins Foundation, Potter helped local kids, taking them for a haircut or out to eat. With her friends, she’d dream up ways to build back Jackson’s forgotten communities.
“She was right on the edge of everything opening up, and she was walking forward with flair,” Liz Perkins, Potter’s aunt, said during the service at New Horizon Church International. “She had a way of making people feel safe just by being with her.” 
But her family believes Potter’s desire to help and protect others may have led to her death in the early morning hours of June 22, 2025.
Potter and some friends had just come from a club when they stopped at a gas station on Northside Drive off I-55 at about 4:40 a.m. There, Potter’s friend and the friend’s boyfriend, Phillip Bullock, got into an argument, and Potter intervened.

An off-duty officer who witnessed the incident said he saw Potter and Bullock arguing with guns in their hands, and Potter fired her gun into the air, according to a redacted report from Capitol Police, the responding agency. The officer also saw Bullock shoot Potter, who fell to the ground, the report said.
After firing, Bullock drove away, and the off-duty officer shot at Bullock, according to the report. 
Officers did not find a weapon at the scene, according to the report. Capitol Police called Potter’s family soon after, and Perkins said they told her the gas station’s video showed Potter was tussling with Bullock when he grabbed her hand, pushed it down, pulled out his gun and shot her in the head. 
The officer also told Perkins that they were still looking for the gun Potter supposedly had. “If she shot the gun, where is the gun?” she asked.
But Bullock has not been charged with Potter’s killing. While the Capitol Police incident report listed his initial charge as aggravated assault, Bullock was charged with possession of a gun as a convicted felon, according to Hinds County Court records. A call to Bullock’s court-appointed public defender was not returned.
In 2017, he had pleaded guilty to aggravated assault against his sister-in-law in Holmes County as well as home invasion. The judge gave him seven years in prison.
Potter’s family is outraged.
“He got out Tuesday, the day after she was declared dead,” said Potter’s mother, Joanie. “He should be charged with murder.”
Perkins said Bullock, who lives just two doors down from the family in west Jackson, is now claiming self-defense, but her understanding is that Potter was trying to get her friend away from him. 
“We ain’t saying she was perfect,” Perkins said, “but Karah was a human being who didn’t need to be shot down like a dog.”
Potter’s parents say she was a charismatic young adult who was trying to figure out her future. After moving to Starkville to attend Mississippi State University, Potter decided not to enroll and moved back home to live with her parents while managing a soap store and studying for the real estate exam. 
“That was going to change her trajectory,” her mother said.
Potter had also recently started bartending at Babes, a local club. In the past month or so, Potter’s mother discovered a gun in her daughter’s drawer and questioned her, but Potter insisted she needed the gun for protection and that everyone at the club had one.
Her mother argued against it. “What about a man overpowering you and killing you with your gun?” her mother quoted herself as asking Potter.
At the service Wednesday, clergymen passed out tissues as gatherers watched videos of Potter laughing, blowing out birthday cake candles, playing with puppies and kittens, visiting Washington, D.C., and riding a horse.

When Potter’s father Ron Potter and his wife got the call from the Capitol Police, Ron said they feared that Potter had been in a car accident. The detective said no, Ron said, she was shot in the head. 
“I was faced with a critical question that I’ve wrestled with for years now,” he said. “That question takes on real flesh, and the question is, does the Christian faith have anything meaningful to say to the lived realities of injustice, terminal illness, sickness, death?” 
In search of answers, Ron said he was forced to take a look at what he called “signals of transcendence” that Potter possessed, or the ways in which God revealed himself through Potter, such as her appreciation for beauty, her desire to form relationships with others and her empathy. 
Those qualities were reflected in many of the other testimonies to Potter’s life. Several of her cousins spoke, and they all said she was like a sister to them. 
One cousin, Shelby Perkins, shared 23 memories for each year of Potter’s life: Her dimples, visiting Jamaica, dinner at the Mighty Crab, shucking peas in their grandma’s kitchen, riding home from the reservoir in the back of their uncle’s truck, holding each other tight as they walked up creaky stairs in their family home, and how the kids at the summer camp adored “Miss KK.” 
“I thank God for handpicking us to be cousins,” she said. 
Potter’s older sister Varah shared that the family adopted Potter, who was just 18 days old, because Varah wanted a little sister. Varah, who is seven years older, said the two did not always get along, though they’d grown closer in recent years. 
“We were like oil and water,” Varah said.

Then Varah read a poem inspired by the flowers that Potter loved. 
Potter’s hairstylist said she wanted to tell Potter’s mother that “she was a good soul and you raised her right.” Another friend said that the day Potter died, she had just left the doctor’s office and was planning to tell Potter that she was pregnant. 
“Now she knows, of course she knows, she’s everywhere now,” she said. 
To honor Potter, the Perkins family has set up the Sunshine Scholarship Fund at the Perkins Foundation to aid young people heading to college. Potter’s parents also say they also plan to work to dissuade young people from owning guns. 
Potter grew up in a family dedicated to community service. The Perkins Foundation, founded in 1983, focuses on “transforming lives, equipping leaders and restoring hope in communities.”
Catherine Cook, who went to high school with Potter at Saint Joseph Catholic School in Madison, said Potter wanted to follow in those footsteps, but the world can be a cruel place for people like Potter who have a big heart. 
“Still, she had a dream that life could be better,” she said. “We would drive around Jackson and point at a building and say this is the business that I want to put in this building or this is how I want to build up the community and I just, I would hate to see her dream never come true.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/03160124/IMG_4314.jpg,,,2025-07-03 18:07:35.127822

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Utah Republican leaders celebrated the final passage of the “big, beautiful bill” on Thursday, one day before the self-imposed Fourth of July deadline to bring it to President Donald Trump’s desk for his signature.
All members of the Utah congressional delegation voted in favor of the massive tax and spending bill that supports theTrump administration’s priorities. The bill was ultimately only opposed by two Republicans in the House and three in the Senate.
US House passes massive tax break and spending cut bill, sending it to Trump

Shortly after the House vote, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox thanked the delegation for helping the bill get across the finish line in a social media post.
“Today’s passage of the budget bill is a win for Utah families: it delivers meaningful tax relief, invests in energy abundance,” Cox wrote. “And, thanks to bipartisan teamwork, preserves every state’s freedom to craft commonsense AI safeguards.”
The package passed in a tight 218-214 House vote after undergoing changes in the Senate earlier this week. 
The lengthy bill includes spending plans for border security, defense, energy production, health care and higher education. 
It has, however, been heavily criticized for slashing Medicaid spending, effectively leaving millions of Americans without health care coverage.
Utah Democrats were dismayed at what they describe as “devastating” consequences for Utahns who rely on Medicaid, while funding “fiscally irresponsible tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans.”
“(Utah’s) Medicaid budget totals $5.5 billion through a combination of federal and state funding. Under this bill, nearly $1 billion, or approximately 20% of that funding, will be slashed,” Utah House Democrats said in a statement. “The consequences are undeniable: sick, low-income, and at-risk Utahns will lose access to critical healthcare. Programs will be gutted. The quality and availability of services will decline. And rural hospitals, who cover more than just Medicaid patients, will close.”
Utah Democratic Party Chair Brian King called the package “a betrayal of working people” because of its health care and food assistance cuts, among other concerns.

“Utah’s entire Congressional delegation voted yes. Every single one of them chose political survival over public service, cowering to pressure from party leaders, special interests, and the president’s threats,” King said in a statement.
However, Utah Republican Rep. Mike Kennedy, who is also a family doctor, defended the Medicaid provisions included in the bill. He said that as a health care provider, he recognizes how essential the program is, but he argued the government needs to “right-size” it.
“If we don’t take a different trajectory, these programs will collapse under the economic failures of prior administrations,” Kennedy said on the House floor. 
Rooting out fraud, waste and abuse would help preserve Medicaid, Kennedy said in a social media post.
“The One Big Beautiful Bill proves we don’t have to choose. We can protect those in need and stop the waste,” he said.
RECA expansion 
Buried at the end of the bill’s many provisions is an expansion to the Radiation Compensation Exposure Act, or RECA, which compensates people sickened by nuclear weapons development and testing.
That was one of the wins Utah Republican Rep. Celeste Maloy celebrated Thursday.
“While no bill is perfect, the One Big, Beautiful Bill reflects the promises made and kept by President Trump and House Republicans,” Maloy said in a statement.
Called downwinders, people who got cancer or other diseases from above-ground nuclear tests were eligible for federal payments — but not everyone in Utah was covered, despite evidence showing nuclear fallout blanketed the state in the 1950s and 1960s.
All of Utah’s downwinders could be compensated under Senate’s ‘big, beautiful bill’

Now, under provisions included in the “big, beautiful bill,” anyone who lived in Utah and got sick from the tests will be eligible for compensation. The news was met with mixed reactions from advocates who generally opposed the “big beautiful bill,” but were happy to see RECA expanded.
“A bright spot in this otherwise terrible reconciliation bill is that it finally allows some of the people harmed by nuclear weapons testing and production to access a federal program from which they were unfairly excluded,” said Dr. Gretchen Goldman, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists. “That truly is a win for thousands of people across the country, including the people harmed by the first atomic bomb test in New Mexico.”
Mary Dickson, a Utah downwinder, said it was “bittersweet.” She’ll now be eligible for coverage, but told Utah News Dispatch she was disappointed that downwinders in Guam, Montana and parts of Nevada and Arizona were left out.
“Obviously I’m happy to see more downwinders covered. I’m very happy to see that. But I’m also heartsick to see that so many others that we’ve been fighting with in this battle for so long are left out,” she said. “It feels a bit like a hollow victory to me.” 
Environmental concerns
Environmental groups were quick to decry the bill’s passage on Thursday, criticizing the many provisions that phase out tax credits for renewable energy, require increased oil and gas lease sales, and cut royalties that oil producers were required to pay.
“If Republicans cared about clean air and water, wildlife, or a livable planet for current and future generations, this bill would be dead in the water. But their priorities are clear,” said Travis Hammill, Washington D.C. director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance.
He noted that Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee’s proposal to require the sale of millions of acres of public lands was stripped out of the bill earlier this month after it received “widespread, bipartisan backlash.” 
Mike Lee drops national forests from proposed public land sale, makes several other changes

“While we’re glad to see schemes to sell off public lands stripped from the Budget Bill, we are clear-eyed about the impacts of the rest of the bill: gutting tax credits for clean energy, attacking the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and creating new handouts to extractive industries – all of which will devastate wild public lands for decades to come,”  Hammill said.
Jennifer Rokala, executive director for the public land advocacy group the Center for Western Priorities, called the bill a “handout to billionaires at the expense of working people.”
“It gives a multi-billion dollar tax cut to the oil and gas industry, which is already raking in sky-high profits, and adds billions to the federal debt,” Rokala said. ““This bill cuts the public out of public land management, making oil and gas drilling the dominant use of public land and removing avenues for public participation from the leasing process. The vast majority of Westerners want to see public lands managed for clean air and water, as well as wildlife habitat conservation and increased recreation access. This bill does the opposite.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-03 21:12:37+00:00,CT Mirror,Hartford school board member to challenge Larson,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/03/john-larson-challenger-ruth-fortune/,"Ruth Fortune, a mayoral appointee on the Hartford Board of Education, will be the first Democrat to challenge Larson’s U.S. House seat.","Ruth Fortune, a 37-year-old mayoral appointee on the Hartford Board of Education who came to the U.S. from Haiti as a young undocumented immigrant, filed papers Wednesday declaring her intention to challenge U.S. Rep. John B. Larson for the Democratic nomination in 2026.
The first tentative steps by towards beginning a race — Fortune created a campaign committee with no public announcement or sign of private outreach to political players — might have gone unnoticed in other years, but Democrats are hypersensitive this cycle about potential intra-party challenges.
An immediate question Thursday from some Democrats, none of whom was willing to be quoted out of deference to Larson: Will the filing break the ice and prompt others to take a look at running against a long-serving incumbent who had a “complex partial seizure” during a speech in February and turns 77 this month?
Three of Connecticut’s five U.S. House members are 72 or older, age was a difficult and ultimately disqualifying issue for the octogenarian Joe Biden in 2024, and the Democratic Party is in the midst of an identity crisis after the loss of the White House to Donald J. Trump. 
Larson, a former state Senate leader first elected to Congress in 1998, is raising money for a run in 2026, when Democrats hope to recapture the closely divided House — a realistic goal that seems to be encouraging every member of the delegation to run at least once more.
In a telephone interview, Fortune offered no criticism of Larson and said her motive for running was not in reaction to anything the incumbent has said or done.
“My reasons for running are my reasons for running. I want to bring my voice, my lived experiences, my fierce advocacy, and really try to do as much as I can to support people as they try to aspire to whatever it is that their dream is and their goals are,” she said. “I thank Congressman Larson for his service.”
Fortune’s challenge to Larson came as a surprise to Mayor Arunan Arulampalam, who appointed her to the school board a year ago, and the city’s Democratic chair, Marc DiBella.
“Somebody texted me about it,” Arulampalam said. “I was surprised. It was the first I heard.”
DiBella said by text he did not know Fortune and offered no further comment.
The 1st Congressional District represented by Larson is overwhelmingly Democratic, meaning the only threat to Larson would come in a primary. Larson, who is from East Hartford, has not had a primary since 1998, when the seat was open. He said his plans to run again are unchanged.
“In a democracy, anyone who desires to run is free to do so. I fully intend to announce my candidacy after the municipal elections this year,” Larson said in a texted statement. “I remain proud of the achievements for the 27 towns I represent and work with, especially the people my office has been able to help and serve.”
Fortune has a compelling personal story, but no experience as a candidate for elective office.
Testifying in favor of financial aid for undocumented students before the General Assembly in 2016, when she was a law student in her mid-twenties and about to become a naturalized U.S. citizen, Fortune offered herself as an example of what educational opportunity can mean to a young immigrant.
“My family left Haiti in 2000. We came to the U.S. as tourists and became undocumented immigrants in search of a better future,” Fortune told lawmakers. “When we first arrived, eight of us, including my parents and brother, shared one bedroom in my aunt’s house. But the house had indoor plumbing, running water and even more importantly, access to the U.S. school system.”
They settled in Westbury, N.Y., on Long Island. She said she graduated from Baruch College, which was relatively affordable, and lived in a sublet that cost $350 a month.
Fortune said Thursday that the Obama administration gave Haitians temporary protective status after an earthquake devastated Haiti, multiplying the island’s many miseries.
“I think at that point, to be honest, I realize how much good government can do, how much it is really a force for good, if it is used in that fashion. And shortly after that, I sort of figured, I want to go to law school. I want to understand more how the law works, why it is it can do these things that it does,” she said.
Fortune said she arrived in the U.S. as a tourist with her family. She was 12 and spent her first decade trying to live inconspicuously as she obtained an education.
To lawmakers in 2016, she said, “I made it through college because I was able to pay in-state tuition rate and frankly because I lucked out by getting a good waitressing job during college that allowed me to pay my $4,000 annual in-state tuition out-of-pocket.”
Fortune is a graduate of the University of Connecticut School of Law and an associate at Wiggin & Dana, specializing as a trust and estate lawyer. She is married, the mother of three and lives in the West End of Hartford. In her testimony, she described volunteering for Barack Obama in Iowa in 2012.
“The best training I received as a campaign staffer was on how to effectively tell my story and how to ask for what I want,” she said.
Larson, who has made stabilizing Social Security a personal crusade, said after joining other Democrats in voting against Trump’s bill that extends tax cuts at the expend of social safety net program, his focus remains the same. 
“My focus has been and continues to be protecting and enhancing Social Security,” Larson said. “Right now, we are in a battle with the Trump administration and fighting back against their direct attempts to privatize and cut Social Security as they continue to slash the nations’s number-one nutrition program, SNAP, and kick 17 million people off their health insurance.”
His seizure in February came during a speech in the House, when he froze and lost the ability to speak. A day later, he attributed the episode to a heart valve replacement 15 years ago.
“Sometimes, people with this condition can later develop symptoms such as the momentary change in speech or movement that was apparent yesterday,” Larson said.

A month later, a video of Larson passionately complaining about Elon Musk refusing to answer congressional questions regarding how Social Security factored into the Trump administration’s plans for cutbacks went viral, winning notice and applause from Rachel Maddow on MSNBC.
“Where’s Elon Musk?” Larson thundered at a committee meeting. “I’m sure he’s a genius and is a very credible person because of the wealth he’s accumulated, but that does not put him above the law or the responsibility to come before this committee in this Congress. If he’s so great, if these plans and all the fraud and abuse that he found are so imminent, why isn’t he here explaining it? You know why? Because he’s out to privatize Social Security.”
Maddow approved.
“I’m happy to report that Congressman John Larson is definitely back and at full strength,” Maddow said. “He has been eating his proverbial Wheaties. He appears to be very hydrated, very energized, and, may I suggest, you get out of his way.”
Larson had a second, less dramatic episode in April, briefly pausing in mid-sentence at a Hartford press conference.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Fortune_Ruth_square-scaled.jpg-1024x1024.avif,,,2025-07-03 18:07:35.127822

It is the latest twist in a months-long legal battle over an executive order signed by President Donald Trump on Jan. 21, his first day back in office, that sought to deny citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. unless at least one of their parents was a citizen or a permanent legal resident.
Historically, “birthright” citizenship has been granted to anyone born on U.S. soil, regardless of their parent’s status. But Trump claimed in his executive order that that was a misinterpretation of the law, which he claimed was never intended to apply to everyone.
Judge gives administration until Tuesday to put birthright citizenship plans in writing

The order was almost immediately challenged in court by groups that said birthright citizenship is a bedrock of U.S democracy, and that denying citizenship to a child born here could make the child stateless altogether. Judges in three different districts, including Boardman, agreed and issued nationwide injunctions to block the order.
The government appeal focused on whether the district court judges had the authority to impose a nationwide ban on the order. In a 6-3 ruling Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed that the judges should not have extended the injunction beyond those people and groups that brought the suits.
But the high court’s ruling noted that a class-action suit could apply nationally. That’s why the plaintiffs in the Maryland case — CASA, the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project at 15 women who are pregnant or new mothers — were back in court Monday, seeking to get their suit certified as a class action suit for all undocumented parents and their babies.
The Supreme Court sent the cases back to the district court, but also set July 27 as the earliest date the administration can apply the executive order, to allow time for the cases to be reheard. On Monday, Boardman ordered Trump’s attorneys to clarify in writing the government’s view of what it can do under the executive order, and when.
Trump’s attorneys agreed in the filing that the earliest date the administration would apply the order is, in fact, July 27. But the the court’s ruling also provided for a 30-day ramp-up period, the notice said.
“The Court’s stay thus allows Defendants to immediately begin to ‘develop[] and issu[e] public guidance about the Executive’s plans to implement the Executive Order,’” the filing reads.
Boardman also gave Trump’s lawyers until July 7 to file a response to the plaintiffs’ motion to turn the case into a class action lawsuit.

Laura Kelly said Thursday that she and her husband of more than 40 years were granted a divorce.
She decided to speak publicly about the amicable end of her marriage because of inquiries about the status of her relationship with retired physician Ted Daughety.
Kelly, 75, said the pair remained on friendly terms before and after the divorce was finalized in October. They were married in 1983 and have two adult daughters.
“Throughout my time in public office, I’ve always guarded my family’s privacy. It’s been my policy to keep my personal life separate from my public one to the extent possible,” Kelly said.
She said it had “come to my attention that my marital status has become a topic of some speculation, so I will share that Ted and I divorced in October of 2024.”
“It was amicable and mutual, and we both continue to share in the lives of our family,” the governor said.
The Democratic governor’s brief statement was the first official confirmation of a split. The governor resides at the Topeka residence for Kansas governors known as Cedar Crest. Her family home in the Potwin neighborhood of central Topeka has been sold.
In a statement, Daughety said that “Laura and I made this decision together, based on what worked best for us and for our family.”
Kelly was elected to the Kansas Senate to represent a Topeka-area district in 2005 and remained in that job for nearly 15 years. She was elected governor in 2018 and reelected in 2022.
Daughety was a pulmonary and sleep disorder specialist who practiced medicine for decades in Kansas.
Divorce among sitting U.S. governors hasn’t been common, but Democrat John Carlin ended two marriages while serving as governor of Kansas.
Carlin took office in 1979 and received a divorce from Ramona Hawkinson in 1980. Carlin and his second wife, Karen Bigsby Hurley, were divorced in 1985 during his second term.

Michelle Lujan Grisham on July 3, 2025 said she may call a special legislative session to address fallout from the federal Republicans' budget bill. (Eddie Moore / Albuquerque Journal)New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said Thursday she may need to call a special legislative session to address the impact to the state from the Congressional Republicans’ passage of their so-called “big beautiful bill.” The GOP’s tax and spending legislation includes cuts expected to cause millions of Americans to lose health care access through Medicaid; curtail food benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program; and hurt rural hospitals, among other repercussions.
BREAKING: US House passes massive tax break and spending cut bill, sending it to Trump

“The Republican budget bill is an abomination that abandons working families and threatens the health and well-being of New Mexicans,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement. “Their vote to slash funding for health care and child nutrition to pay for tax cuts for the ultra-rich isn’t just bad policy—it’s an outright betrayal.”
The bill, she added, “will hit New Mexico hard. From cuts to Medicaid funding that keeps our rural hospitals open, to reductions in food assistance for children, to threats against education programs that ensure our kids have a brighter future, this budget puts politics over people. It also amounts to an egregious tax hike on Americans who will pay higher prices for health care, electricity, and other services.” The governor noted she is “prepared to call a special session if necessary to protect New Mexicans from their fiscal assault.”
Earlier this week, New Mexico Health Care Authority Secretary Kari Armijo told members of a newly established federal funding stabilization committee that as many as 88,530 New Mexicans will lose their Medicaid coverage due to provisions in the bill. The bill will also likely cause 58,180 New Mexicans to lose their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, she said.
New Mexico House Democrats issued a statement shortly after federal passage of the bill saying that “out-of-touch” Republicans had passed “the most cruel and backwards bill we have seen in our lifetimes.” Republicans, the statement said, “are kicking folks off their healthcare, shuttering our rural hospitals, letting children and seniors go hungry, and raising costs for all working people, in order to please President Trump and line the pockets of his ultra wealthy donors. This legislation will have a devastating impact on families across our country and right here at home.”
Legislative Finance Committee Director Charles Sallee also told lawmakers this week that New Mexico interest earning record oil and gas revenues will help buffer the state from some of the cuts, which House Democrats noted in their statement.
All three Democratic New Mexico members of the U.S. House of Representatives held a joint news conference shortly after the vote in Washington, D.C., with U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury, who represents the state’s 1st Congressional District, referring to the tax and spending legislation as a “big, ugly abomination of a bill” and the “biggest rollback in American history, directly attacking our communities.”
Stansbury further cited the effects on New Mexicans’ health care, food security and education, saying the bill “is going to have truly catastrophic impacts for New Mexico.” Republicans, she added, are trying to downplay those impacts.

“And so our question is, then, ‘Why did they have to pass it in the dark of night in both the Senate and the House?’ It’s because they know millions of Americans are going to be hurt by it, but they don’t care. Their message to America today is: They won. America loses. They don’t care. You can lose your health care, you can lose your food assistance, you can lose your education. They don’t care.”
That being said, Stansbury added, “We don’t want New Mexicans to lose hope. We want them to use their understanding of what’s about to happen to fuel the fight. We have to take back the House.”
U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez, who represents the southern portion of the state in the 2nd Congressional District, described himself as “furious.”
“This is the biggest tax giveaway to the richest people in this country, and it’s being paid for on the backs of working families,” Vasquez said. “And the saddest thing is, is that it’s taking health care away from those who need it the most.”
U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández from the 3rd Congressional District, said she refers to the budget reconciliation bill as the “betrayed for billionaires” bill. Leger Fernández further contrasted and described the types of bills passed under federal Democratic leadership, such as the Affordable Health Care Act, the Inflation Reduction Act and the American Rescue Plan, which helped insure all Americans, invested in renewable energy and stimulated the economy, respectively, she said.
“It shouldn’t be that just the wealthy get the good life,” she said. “We all want the good education, a good home, good health care, a beautiful planet to live on, right? That’s the good life. But Republicans are actually, instead of …waking up thinking about the American dream…we are waking up into the American nightmare because their big, ugly bill undoes all the progress that Democrats were making.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Unknown-1024x707.jpeg,,,2025-07-03 17:07:53.537385

(Photo via Google Earth) An Iowa home-health agency accused of using falsified records and billing for care services that were never documented has engaged in “fraudulent practices,” a state board has concluded.
While the Iowa Board of Nursing recently cleared a Cedar Rapids nurse of any responsibility for some of the alleged issues, it did conclude records had been falsified by someone at Compassion North America, that Medicaid had been double-billed for some services, and that an unlicensed nurse was providing patient care for the company.
Joseph Lemor, the CEO of Compassion North America, said this week that testimony at the hearing was inaccurate and that the board’s conclusions were factually wrong and stemmed from a “witch hunt” by the board. He said the company plans to appeal the board’s decision to district court.
In July 2024, the Iowa Board of Nursing charged Lemor’s wife, registered nurse M’balu Kebbie, with improper delegation of nursing services and falsifying records related to the nursing practice or knowingly permitting the use of falsified information in such records.
A hearing on the charges was held in April, and although it was closed to the public, the board’s findings from the testimony and the evidence presented during the hearing were recently made public.
According to the board, Kebbie was first licensed by the board in April 2007. At some point, she began working for Compassion North America, a home-health care agency that is based in Cedar Rapids and run by her husband. Kebbie was the company’s director of nursing and human resources, according to Compassion’s website.
In September 2022, the board alleges, it received a complaint from a patient, “G.F.,” who alleged Compassion had assigned unlicensed staff to perform skilled nursing care tasks, and that the staff failed to complete documentation of the care provided in his home.
G.F., who is a Medicaid beneficiary, had sustained a spinal cord injury in a 2018 car accident that resulted in quadriplegia, and he now uses a wheelchair for ambulation. He also has a tracheostomy — a surgically created opening in the throat to facilitate breathing — and uses a ventilator.
According to the board, G.F. was hospitalized for several days in June 2022 due to a severe infection. He was then discharged to his home, with a physician’s order for temporary, 24-hour, in-home skilled nursing care, seven days per week. The care was to include maintenance of his tracheostomy, wound care, intravenous catheter-line care and medication monitoring.
Compassion North America was approved by Iowa Medicaid’s managed care organization, Amerigroup, to provide the services from June 29, 2022, through Aug. 29, 2022.
In addition to Kebbie, the board alleges, Compassion employees Elizabeth Smith and Maudalyn Pierre provided most of the services — although G.F. later complained the company never provided the 24/7 level of staffing that was ordered and approved, and also claimed the staff behaved unprofessionally.
The board alleges that after becoming concerned with the professional qualifications of the staff, G.F. and his mother informed the state that they had not seen any of the staff take notes or complete any documentation while in their home.
They alleged that after they asked Compassion to provide them with copies of their nursing notes and other records, the company never complied. The board says that after G.F. relayed his concerns about Compassion to Amerigroup, the managed care company “then terminated its contract with Compassion” at the end of August 2022.
Board: Nurse was ‘unlicensed’ at the time
A state investigator allegedly reviewed the work schedules of Compassion employees, which reportedly showed the company was not actually providing 24/7 care to G.F. as ordered.  The caregivers listed on the work schedule allegedly included four individuals, only two of whom — Kebbie and licensed practical nurse Elizabeth Smith — were licensed nurses.
However, Smith’s nursing license had expired in January 2021 and was not reactivated until 18 months later, on July 6, 2022.
The state investigator reviewed thousands of pages of records subpoenaed from Compassion, the board says, and concluded Smith was the only nurse to document any nursing care for G.F. from June 29, 2022, through July 1, 2022 – during which time Smith was unlicensed.
In addition, the records regarding G.F.’s care did not always identify who performed the tasks or what specific care was provided. A comparison of Compassion’s billing records with the staff work schedule allegedly showed the company had submitted payment claims for skilled nursing services for which there was no corresponding documentation to indicate the care had ever been provided. There were also payment claims for services provided by a registered nurse that exceeded 24 hours in a single day, the state investigator testified.
Smith reportedly told the investigator Compassion never provided her with a functioning computer, so she completed her documentation in a notebook that was left at G.F.’s home. According to the board, Kebbie had no explanation for the irregularities in the nursing documentation – including instances where it appeared Compassion had billed Medicaid twice for services related to G.F.’s care.
Board records show Kebbie denied falsifying or fabricating records related to G.F.’s care, and explained that her husband was the sole person responsible for billing. As for her role as the director of nursing, Kebbie denied knowing Smith’s license had lapsed and denied she was responsible for supervising Smith’s work.
Board rules on ‘fraudulent practices’
With regard to the allegation that Kebbie had improperly delegated to Smith certain tasks that were outside the scope of Smith’s license, the board concluded the documents supporting that claim were most likely fabricated by Compassion after the fact — and so, the board reasoned, there was “insufficient evidence” to support the allegation.
As for the allegation that Kebbie had delegated nursing responsibilities to an individual she knew was not licensed at the time, the board concluded that while Smith was supervised by Kebbie, “there is simply not enough evidence to conclude she knew the LPN’s license was inactive when providing care to the patient.”
However, the board added, the evidence did suggest Kebbie failed to properly delegate G.F.’s care to Smith. As the supervising registered nurse, the board said, Kebbie was responsible for the implementation of care plans, the supervision of Smith and the accuracy of medical notes.
Kebbie, the board said, had admitted she had not reviewed Smith’s documentation of G.F.’s care. As such, the board concluded, Kebbie had violated state regulations related to unethical conduct.
With regard to the allegations of falsified records, the board dismissed that charge as it related to Kebbie while noting there was evidence “someone associated with Compassion” had falsified documents.
Had Kebbie “properly reviewed her subordinate’s records or otherwise given G.F.’s care plan the appropriate amount of attention, she would have known fraudulent practices had occurred,” the board said. “Nevertheless, there is not enough evidence in the record to support the conclusion that (Kebbie) knew the records were falsified.”
Citing what it called Kebbie’s “lack of previous disciplinary history,” the board ruled that she could retain her Iowa nursing license subject to two years of probation that will entail some level of supervision by a board-approved monitor.
However, state records show that in 2012 the board disciplined Kebbie for briefly working as a nurse while her license was inactive. In that case, the board agreed to a settlement that called for Kebbie to pay a $50 civil penalty.
CEO: Board is engaged in a ‘witch hunt’
Joseph Lemor, Kebbie’s husband and the CEO of Compassion North America, said the board’s written findings are replete with factual errors, adding that the board’s ruling will likely be appealed to district court. No sanctions have been imposed on Compassion North America by the nursing board, whose jurisdiction is limited to the employees engaged in nursing.
With regard to Smith’s lack of an active nursing license, he said that at some point in time — he said he was unsure as to when — he checked with the board and determined Smith was properly licensed. But, he said, it was Smith’s responsibility to make sure she was licensed at the time she was delivering care to Compassion North America’s patients.
“It’s the personal responsibility of the nurse to make sure they’re not working without a license,” he said. “She has to defend that herself.”
As for the board’s assertion that Amerigroup terminated its contract with Compassion North America, Lemor said, “That is false. Nothing like that happened.” He said the company is still an approved care provider that is reimbursed by Medicaid for the services it delivers to Iowans.
Lemor said the nursing board is engaged in a “witch hunt,” adding that he questions whether the patient, G.F., actually filed a complaint with the board due to what he sees as irregularities with the patient’s alleged signature on documents.
The board’s assertion that his wife admitted having failed to review Smith’s documentation, along with the board’s finding that records were falsified, are also untrue, he said.
“We did not do anything improper,” he said. “We have nothing to hide.”
He said he is currently disputing the amount of money Compassion North America collected for G.F.’s care, saying the company was “extremely underpaid.”

Speaking publicly for the first time, Allison Layton Statham called for Duncan to go free in a July 22 bail hearing. “This innocent man is on death row,” she told Mississippi Today. “Justice needs to be done.”
In April, a judge threw out Duncan’s conviction, questioning their conclusions and citing the failures of his court-appointed counsel.
Prosecutors have appealed the judge’s decision and are fighting his release on bail, saying Duncan poses both a flight risk and “a safety risk to not only the victim’s family, but also the general public.”
Statham disagreed and said she wants all of the evidence, including a sealed video of a bite-mark expert examining her child’s body, made available so that everyone can know the truth. “Authorities are still wanting to bury the truth,” she said. “What they did was railroad him.”

For a long time, Haley’s paternal aunt, Jennifer Berry, awaited word of Duncan’s execution, she said. “We’ve mourned quite a few people in our family, and we have never mourned like we mourned when that child died.”

Since talking with a documentary filmmaker in February and digging into the case, she believes he should go free. “I’ve been in turmoil since realizing this,” she said. “He’s a young man who was falsely accused of a crime he didn’t commit.”
She has petitioned prosecutors, the attorney general and the governor for a meeting but has yet to receive a reply.
The judge’s dismissal marks at least 10 wrongful convictions involving pathologist Dr. Steven Hayne, who has since died, or bite-mark expert Michael West, who once claimed he matched a suspect’s teeth to a half-eaten bologna sandwich. Eight of these wrongful convictions happened in Mississippi.
In 1994, the American Board of Forensic Odontology suspended West for a year for overstating credentials and misidentifying bite marks, and a dozen years later, he was forced to resign from the American Board of Forensic Pathology.
In 2008, the state of Mississippi barred Hayne from doing autopsies. He once wrote in his autopsy report about removing and examining a victim’s ovaries. The problem? The victim was male.
That same year, Levon Brooks and Kennedy Brewer were exonerated after spending a combined 30 years in prison. West’s bite-mark testimony helped convict Brooks of the rape-murder of a 3-year-old girl in Noxubee County. When another 3-year-old girl was raped and killed, West gave bite-mark testimony that helped lead to a death sentence for Brewer.
DNA discovered the truth: a serial killer had raped and murdered both girls. He confessed to his crimes, and Brooks and Brewer were freed.
It remains unknown how many other wrongful convictions these experts may have played a role in. Hayne once said he conducted up to 30,000 autopsies in Mississippi. West has said he analyzed more than 300 bite marks and investigated more than 5,000 deaths. He no longer believes bite marks should be used in court and did not respond to requests for comment on the dismissal of Duncan’s conviction.
Berry felt compelled to come forward now and call for a review of each case in Louisiana and Mississippi involving these discredited experts, she said. “Every case they put their fingers on needs to be reopened and examined.”
‘I wasn’t going to lie for them’
On the morning of Dec. 18, 1993, Statham said as she left for work Oliveaux was bouncing on her bed, tossing her “moo cow” in the air. She said she left her daughter in the care of the 25-year-old Duncan, whom she loved and had been living with for several months.
Duncan, who has maintained his innocence for more than three decades, told police he made Oliveaux oatmeal for breakfast and put her in the bathtub, where the water measured less than 3.5 inches. While doing dishes, he said he heard a noise and found her face down in the water. He said he grabbed her out of the tub and ran next door. The neighbors, paramedics and doctors were unable to save the life of Oliveaux, who had suffered recent seizures.

Haley Oliveaux
When Statham said she arrived at the emergency room, Duncan was distraught, apologizing over and over. Police charged Duncan with negligent homicide.
At the hospital, when West Monroe Police Detective Chris Sasser examined the body and saw the girl’s anus dilated and “laying open,” he concluded she “had been sodomized,” according to the police report. “It was a horrible sight.”
Rather than use a nearby pathologist, then-District Attorney Jerry Jones had the girl’s body transported two hours away to Mississippi for Hayne to do the autopsy. After the pathologist examined Oliveaux, he called in West to examine suspected bite marks.
Video captures West’s initial examination, starting at 9:35 p.m. He mentions a bruise on her left elbow, possible abrasions and contusions, and visible diaper rash. No mark can be seen on her cheek, and West makes no mention of one.
Twenty minutes later, Hayne telephoned Detective Sasser and said at about the time of the child’s death, she suffered lacerations and penetration to the anus, which the pathologist attributed to sexual assault, as well as multiple contusions to multiple surfaces on the body and lacerations and contusions to the scalp, according to the police report.
Hayne also said there were adult bite marks on the child made at or about the time of death and asked for the suspect’s dental molds.
After receiving this information, Sasser contacted a prosecutor, and the charge was upgraded to first-degree murder, which can carry a death penalty in Louisiana.

After the molds arrived the next day, the video resumed. West can be seen jamming a mold of Duncan’s teeth into the child’s cheek. West identified these as bite marks belonging to the suspect.
Hayne did the autopsy. He concluded that Haley’s death was a homicide, that her injuries suggested she had been sexually assaulted at or about the time of her death and that she had been forcibly drowned.
Other pathologists questioned Hayne’s conclusions. A rape kit came back negative. The Louisiana State Crime Lab tested Duncan’s clothing, the child’s clothing and her bath toys for any seminal fluid. There was none.
In the days following her daughter’s death, Statham said prosecutors called her into their office. She said they asked her if her daughter ever said or implied that Duncan wanted her to suck his penis like a baby bottle.
She told Mississippi Today that her toddler daughter could hardly speak. “She could say, ‘I want burgers,’ or ‘I want M&Ms,’” she said.
After she told them no, she said they replied, “If you don’t tell the truth, you could be implicated.”
She was 21 at the time. “My baby died, and the man I loved had been hauled off,” she said. “It was very intimidating. I was scared. But I wasn’t going to lie for them.”
Months later, police got a statement from jail inmate Michael Cruse. He quoted Duncan as saying the baby pointed at his penis and he said “something about a bottle or bobble.” Cruse later testified that Duncan said he blacked out and when he came to, he was trying to have sex with the baby and killed her because he “couldn’t get the baby to be quiet.”
To demonstrate his innocence, Duncan took a polygraph test. He reportedly showed no deception when he said he didn’t kill the child or hold her head underwater. Jurors never heard this, because polygraphs are inadmissible as evidence.
By the time the trial began in 1998, much of the important physical evidence was gone. The rape kit had been lost. So had Hayne’s autopsy slides. Samples of her blood that no one had tested for toxicology — a standard practice for autopsies — had been destroyed. So had Hayne’s detailed reports on his slides.
All that experts had available to examine were Hayne’s autopsy report and a few photos of the child’s body and injuries.
In his opening remarks at the 1998 murder trial, the district attorney said Duncan “rode that baby like a bull” and “in a sexual frenzy … bit her behind the ear … bit her elbow … She screamed, and she died in a bathtub full of water so bloody you couldn’t see the bottom.”
With West’s credentials now under question, prosecutors relied on another expert, who looked at West’s photos and identified Duncan as the one who made bite marks on the child. That expert didn’t see West’s video. Neither did the defense experts. Neither did the jury.

Hayne backed up the prosecution theory that Duncan drowned the child to cover up his sexual assault. He told jurors the bruise on her head was “consistent with a digit, such as a thumb or finger, pressing down on the back of the head.”
Asked if the child could have suffered a seizure, Hayne said no because “the brain showed no sign of seizure activity.”
Hayne testified that the child wouldn’t have survived her anal injuries, and another doctor told jurors there would have been so much blood, it would be like someone having their head cut off.
But police never found a drop of blood anywhere in the house, never found any evidence of cleaning. The detective later said if there had been any blood or semen at the scene, they would have discovered it.
Hayne testified that fragmented tomato, pickle and onion were in the child’s stomach, but no oatmeal — a detail prosecutors seized on as proof that Duncan concocted this cover story to conceal his horrific crime.
When police arrived, they found oatmeal in the kitchen, in the bathtub and on Duncan’s clothing. The neighbor saw uncooked oatmeal when he cleared Oliveaux’s throat before performing CPR.
The prosecutors told jurors the uncooked oatmeal was proof he planted it.
The jury convicted Duncan and sentenced him to death.
‘Bad medicine, bad science and bad lawyering’
Tucker Carrington, who wrote a book on Hayne and West with journalist Radley Balko, “The Cadaver King and the Country Dentist,” said the Louisiana case bears similarities to the case of Jeffrey Havard, convicted of capital murder for allegedly raping and killing an infant in Natchez in 2002, thanks to Hayne’s testimony.
Havard has said he was bathing his girlfriend’s 6-month-old baby, Chloe Britt, when she slipped from his hands and hit her head on the toilet.
But as in Duncan’s case, law enforcement officers thought the baby had been sexually assaulted. At trial, a parade of doctors and nurses testified about anal rips and tears they saw, describing the worst anal trauma they had seen, and prosecutors called Havard a monster.
The autopsy report, however, showed no such damage, only anal dilation and a small contusion. The rape kit came back negative.
Despite that, Hayne’s testimony backed the prosecution’s theory of sexual assault, and Havard was sentenced to Mississippi’s death row.
After examining the case, renowned pathologist Dr. Michael Baden concluded that Britt’s injuries were consistent with her being accidentally dropped and that she wasn’t sexually assaulted. “Dilation of the anus occurs normally in children when they die as muscles relax and when seen by a casual observer can be misinterpreted as evidence of perimortem penetration,” he said.
Other pathologists agreed with Baden that the anal dilation had been misread as abuse, and in 2014, Hayne told a reporter he didn’t believe a rape took place. He said the anal contusion could have resulted from a bowel movement.
He originally testified that the baby had died from shaken baby syndrome. Now he said he didn’t believe that was true because science had since determined such conclusions were flawed.
At least 34 people have been exonerated in shaken baby cases after being wrongly imprisoned, according to the National Registry of Exonerations.
Graham Carner of Jackson, Jeffrey Havard’s current attorney, said his client’s case is filled with “bad medicine, bad science and, frankly, bad lawyering.”

After a three-day hearing where the defense called Hayne to testify, the trial judge reduced Havard’s sentence from death to life. His appeal for freedom is now pending in U.S. District Court.

Havard’s lawyer, Graham Carner of Jackson, said the case is filled with “bad medicine, bad science and, frankly, bad lawyering.”
After a three-day hearing where the defense called Hayne to testify, the trial judge reduced Havard’s sentence from death to life. His appeal for freedom is now pending in U.S. District Court.
“Innocence is different than not guilty, and innocence is different than you didn’t get a fair trial,” Carner said, “but I believed as soon as I dug into Jeffrey’s case that he was an innocent man and I believe that to this day.”
‘Science, like law, evolves over time’
The damage that Hayne and West have done to Mississippi is immense, said former state Supreme Court Justice Oliver Diaz Jr., and he is stunned the state has never reviewed their cases for possible wrongful convictions.
“They operated in Mississippi for years unchecked,” he said. “Mississippi used Hayne as the state medical examiner, even though he did not meet the statutory qualifications.”
Hayne’s testimony helped convict Tyler Edmonds, who was just 13 when he falsely confessed that he and his half-sister had both killed her husband. He said she had told him she would “fry,” but he would go unpunished.
At trial, Hayne testified that the fatal wound was consistent with two people pulling the trigger, saying, “I can’t exclude one [shooter], but I think that would be less likely.”
The Mississippi Court of Appeals concluded such testimony was scientifically unfounded: “You cannot look at a bullet wound and tell whether it was made by a bullet fired by one person pulling the trigger or by two persons pulling the trigger simultaneously.”

Diaz said Hayne’s testimony prompted him to dig deeper. “Two hands on a trigger? You don’t have to do any research to know that’s ridiculous,” he said. “That’s what led me to look at Hayne closer.”
What he found was disturbing. He didn’t realize Hayne was essentially acting as state medical examiner, but he wasn’t a board-certified pathologist.
Diaz wound up writing a scathing dissent centered on the pathologist that prompted other justices to change their minds, he said. “As science, like the law, evolves over time, one generation’s expert is another’s quack.”
He now regrets the first vote he cast on the high court, a death penalty case that relied on the words of Hayne and West, he said. “Based upon their testimony, my first Supreme Court vote was to execute an innocent man, Kennedy Brewer.”
He and other justices later supported the dismissal of Brewer’s conviction, and his last opinion called for the end of the death penalty. “It’s not a workable system when errors like this can take place,” he said. “No matter how careful we are, we’re going to vote to execute innocent people.”
What the jury never heard
In November 1993, Statham brought her daughter twice to the hospital for seizures after she stopped breathing. One doctor suggested she could be suffering from Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, a potentially life-threatening reaction, often to medication, that can cause lesions in the mouth and the genital area. The disease can also cause seizures.
Nearly three weeks before her death, a chest of drawers fell on Haley, who suffered three skull fractures and a subdural hematoma that caused her to spend six days in the hospital. Duncan and Statham told child social services that she had been climbing to reach her piggy bank.
But the jury never heard about this serious injury because of a deal that Duncan’s original lawyers made with prosecutors.
Pathologists say it’s critical to know everything possible about a person’s medical history before drawing conclusions about a death. Testimony shows police knew Oliveaux’s medical history, but it remains unclear if Hayne knew that history before concluding she had been raped and killed.
In a six-day hearing last September, two pathologists called Hayne’s conclusions unfounded, said they saw no evidence of a rape or homicide, and believed Haley drowned accidentally, perhaps after suffering a seizure.
In one sworn statement, former jail inmate Michael Lucas said he heard Duncan tell Cruse that he didn’t kill the toddler. An investigator testified that Cruse now admits he lied at the 1998 trial because he wanted leniency for the felony he was facing.
Duncan’s lawyers told those at the hearing that they planned to show West’s video involving Haley, warning that it was graphic and disturbing. An excerpt of that video had first surfaced in 2009 when the Reason website published it. The video appalled many in the legal and forensic science communities.
The video showed West jamming, dragging and scraping Duncan’s dental mold across the child’s body dozens of times. Some of those in the courtroom gasped, some covered their eyes, and others, including Duncan, wiped away tears.
After seeing the video, Lowell Levine, past president of the American Board of Forensic Odontology, called what West did “fraud.”
In 2009, the National Academy of Sciences concluded there was no basis in science for forensic odontologists to conclude a person is “the biter” to the exclusion of all other suspects. 
Adam Freeman, past president of the American Board of Forensic Odontology, testified that the bite marks identified on Haley weren’t bite marks at all. He called these determinations “junk science” that can’t be defended scientifically.
In 2015, he helped conduct a study on the reliability of bite marks. In all but a few cases, board-certified dentists couldn’t even agree if they were looking at a bite mark. As a result, he resigned from leadership in protest and stopped doing any bite-mark analysis.
Nationwide, at least 34 wrongful convictions have occurred since 1989 because of bite marks, six of them in Mississippi that all involve West, according to the National Registry of Exonerations.
Dr. Robert Bux, who served as chief medical examiner for the El Paso County Coroner’s Office in Colorado Springs, questioned how Hayne could say the child’s injuries matched shoving her face underwater.
If that were so, “I’d expect to see injuries on the front part of her body, particularly on her forehead or nose, cheeks, anterior parts of shoulders, anterior parts of the knees,” said Bux, who helped investigate Pat Tillman’s death in Afghanistan.
The autopsy showed lacerations to the anus. Bux said these could have been caused by an infection, a diaper rash, a hard stool or vigorous washing. “There’s no way to know. You have to look at it microscopically, and it wasn’t looked at,” he said.
Up until 2007 or so, people believed anal dilation proved sexual abuse, he said. “A dilated anus means nothing. We saw it all the time in adults and children.”
The lack of blood at the scene suggests something other than a violent assault, he said. “It’s absolutely bloodless. I mean where is the blood in the sink? Where’s the blood on the victim?”
He rejected the claim by Hayne that the child stopped bleeding because she was dead. Blood gives way to gravity, he said. “It’ll come out drip, drip, drip, so, you’re going to see it, and you’re going to see it for hours, and you’re going to see it for days. I don’t think you can just wash that off because it’s going to continue to ooze after she’s dead.”
Her death appears to be “a tragic accident of drowning,” he said. “I don’t see any evidence to me that would support that it was forced.”
She drowned, possibly because she suffered another seizure, he said, “but I can’t prove that because Hayne didn’t do any investigation that would help us on that.”
Hayne’s lack of research and examination prompted Duncan’s lawyers to twice ask for the exhumation of Oliveaux’s body before the 1998 trial. The judge denied the requests.
Her mother said if her daughter’s body needs to be exhumed to answer any questions, she supports that. “It might give us some answers to what happened then,” Statham said.
If prosecutors win their appeal, Duncan would remain on death row and face execution. ProPublica and Verite News reported that Duncan’s bid for freedom has become more urgent with Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry pushing for executions. In March, Louisiana held its first execution in 15 years, using nitrogen oxide to put Jessie Hoffman Jr. to death.
If Duncan faced another trial, jurors would hear a much different story, his lawyers said. “Rather than the State’s sensational story of pure horror — including rape, biting, blackouts, a panicked forcible drowning, and a cover-up involving massive quantities of blood that Mr. Duncan, cold and calculating, cleaned up before seeking help for the child — the jury would instead hear the true story: Haley tragically but accidentally drowned in the bathtub.”
After the 1998 trial, Statham spiraled downward. She could have survived her daughter’s death, but surviving this horror story proved nearly impossible, she said.
Duncan’s conviction didn’t just destroy his life, she said. “All of our families were destroyed by this. We’re still collateral damage in this.”

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday mustered a mostly party-line 218-214 vote to approve President Donald Trump’s signature federal tax and spending bill, which will head to his desk for a signature on Friday, July 4.
The bill’s passage marked a major victory for U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) and U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-South Dakota) after weeks of dissension and some initial defections. The bill includes a wide swath of tax and spending cuts that some have warned would kick millions off Medicaid and force states to take up the bulk of costs on key social programs.
While Democrats in Michigan castigated the bill’s passage as doing real harm to the most vulnerable, GOP members of Congress cheered the action, saying it delivers on Trump’s various campaign promises.
Each member of Michigan’s Republican congressional delegation voted in favor of the bill, including U.S. Rep. John James of Shelby Township, who has previously declared his intention to seek the Michigan GOP nomination for governor in 2026.
“We’re cutting taxes on tips and overtime, protecting Social Security, rebuilding American manufacturing, and putting an end to handouts for illegal immigrants and able-bodied adults who won’t work,” James wrote in a statement shared on X. “This bill secures our border, strengthens our economy, and keeps our word to the American people.”
U.S. Rep. Lisa McClain (R-Bruce Township), the House Republican Caucus chairwoman, told ABC News that “people in my district” wanted Medicaid dollars only going to the most vulnerable, and not undocumented immigrants or others that Republicans have deemed ineligible to receive those funds with new work requirements.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“We know that Medicaid isn’t exactly on solid ground, so we really need to make sure that when we put a dollar into that Medicaid program, that it is going to the most vulnerable,” McClain said. “That’s what Republicans have done. They have shored up Medicaid, making sure that the most vulnerable get those benefits that they deserve, and that they get them for the future to come.”
She called Democratic Party efforts to stall, upend or warn people about the consequences of the bill “fear mongering” and equated it to gaslighting the American people.
U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Zeeland), who is a potential candidate for the U.S. Senate in Michigan, posted on X that he was attending the enrollment session for the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” with Johnson, noting that it would be sent to Trump to sign on Friday.
Huizenga called the process “a long, but very important journey for the future of America.”
U.S. Rep. Tim Walberg (R-Tipton) said in a statement released by the U.S. House Education & Workforce Committee, of which Walberg chairs, that Congress took decisive action to bring cost downs for Americans – a claim that will be watched closely by critics of the bill.
“This bill puts forward the first set of significant conservative reforms to the higher education landscape in two decades,” Walberg said. “And thanks to the Committee and House Republicans’ initiative and hard work, the One Big Beautiful Bill will help maintain America’s world-class higher education system.”
U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) in a statement said he believed the bill would “prevent the largest tax hike in American history, lower energy costs, and permanently secure our border – all while protecting the integrity of Medicaid and SNAP for those who need them most.” 
“This legislation will create thousands of good-paying jobs to boost our economy, ensure the middle class keeps more money in their pockets, and invest in a brighter future for America,” Barrett said. “It also delivers on promises made to hardworking families and businesses in Michigan: no tax on tips or overtime, permanent tax relief, an expanded Child Tax Credit, and more.”
Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) called the budget bill “one more huge win for Michigan thanks to President Trump.”
“Under this plan, working families will get to keep more of their paychecks,” Hall said in a statement. “Our border will be far more secure and criminal illegal aliens will be removed from our communities. The American military will be even stronger. And taxpayers will finally see better value for their dollars as wasteful programs and fraud are cut out of the budget. This is exactly what Americans voted for, and this is what Michigan needs to be successful.”
Democrats decry bill’s passage as a ‘fail’ for Michigan
Meanwhile, Michigan Democrats sharply criticized the bill, calling out its impacts on vital programs like Medicaid and food assistance while noting the plan largely benefits the richest in our country.
U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City) reiterated her “no” vote in a statement, saying the bill would make life more expensive for Michigan residents, who are already facing high costs.
“Working families will lose their health care, children will go hungry, and our seniors will lose access to long-term care, all to pay for massive tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy. Everybody will see daily costs go up like health care, utility bills, and food to help Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos make more money,” McDonald Rivet said. 
U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) called the bill “an act of violence against our communities,” marking the largest cut to Medicaid in history. 
“Republicans should be ashamed of themselves for saying the people losing their health care will just ‘get over it’ because ‘we’re all going to die.’ They are responsible for the over 50,000 people who will die unnecessarily every year because of this deadly budget,” Tlaib said. 
U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Detroit) highlighted how the bill’s cuts to Medicaid and SNAP would harm his constituents, calling it a betrayal of the working class.
“My district has the fourth highest SNAP participation rate in the country at 29%, and 47% of our district relies on Medicaid to get the healthcare they need to survive. My decision to vote no on this bill was the easiest I’ve had as an elected official, as these cuts will deeply harm every single person in my congressional district,” Thanedar said. 
In addition to raising concerns on the bill’s impacts on healthcare and food assistance, U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) noted the package would eliminate investments into manufacturing and place rural hospitals at risk of closure as a result of its cuts to medicaid. 
“This bill will benefit the millionaires and billionaires like Donald Trump at the expense of Michiganders. I will continue to stand up to this Administration every single day, until we finally see a deal that works for Michigan and the people I care so deeply about,” Stevens pledged. 
U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten (D-Grand Rapids), similarly committed to working for her constituents, after citing the 218-214 margin on which the bill passed as evidence that it will have disastrous consequences. 
“Our work is not over. Today is a disappointing day for our nation, but we will continue to work towards the future that West Michigan deserves,” Scholten said in a social media post. 
Also in a social media post, U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor) called the bill one of the most consequential, devastating, dangerous bills Congress had passed in recent history, questioning why anyone would vote in support of the policy. 
“This bill is a complete and total failure. The American people overwhelmingly disagree with it, and will not forget those who chose to vote for this cruelty,” she said. 
Curtis Hertel Jr., chair of the Michigan Democratic Party, slammed Republican members of the state’s congressional delegation for their support of the bill, honing his criticism on members sitting in vulnerable Congressional districts. 
 “Congressmen James, Barrett, and Huizenga are betraying the very Michiganders they promised to serve when they chose Donald Trump’s reckless agenda over parents with cancer and hungry children,” Hertel said, noting “Michiganders will not forget what they’ve done when November comes.”
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee similarly honed its criticism on Barrett and Huizenga, with Chair Suzan DelBene calling their support for the bill “the latest and loudest declaration of the fact that they will always prioritize serving Republicans’ billionaire campaign donors at the expense of the children, families, and workers they’re supposed to represent.”
“The DCCC will make sure every battleground voter knows how vulnerable House Republicans — including Barrett and Huizenga — abandoned them by passing the most unpopular piece of legislation in modern American history, and we’re going to take back the House majority because of it,” DelBene said. 
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer lambasted James, Barrett and Huizenga, while applauding her Democratic colleagues for opposing the bill. 
“I stand with them and remain committed to doing everything in my power to defend Michiganders. It’s time to stop playing politics with people’s lives and get to work on real, commonsense solutions that improve people’s lives.” 
With James running as one of the Republican hopefuls in Michigan’s 2026 gubernatorial election, the Democratic Governors Association laid into the representative as a key vote on the tax and spending bill. 

The DGA similarly criticized former Michigan House Speaker Tom Leonard for his support of the plan, while calling on Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township) and Former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox – other high profile Republicans seeking the governorship – to “be clear about whether they, like their competitors, support taking away Michiganders’ health care all to pay for big tax cuts for the wealthy.”
Groups continue to ring alarms over Medicaid cuts
Various political advocacy groups also sounded off in statements released Thursday, mostly calling out the bill and those who voted for it.
“We will not forget when you put the pocketbooks of billionaires and your own greedy political ambitions above the health of your people,” said Monique Stanton, CEO of the Michigan League of Public Policy. “And when health clinics and hospitals close and the stories of loss begin to spread, these same lawmakers will try to place blame on the states. When Michiganders lose their lifesaving coverage over unnecessary additional bureaucratic hurdles, these same lawmakers will claim they are preventing fraud, waste and abuse, of which there is no evidence.”
The result of cutting Medicaid funds could be devastating to Michigan’s health care infrastructure, costing Michigan hospitals more than $6 billion over the next decade as facilities attempt to maintain the same level of care, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association, in a statement.
About 70% of Medicaid, for which 1 in 4 Michiganders is a recipient, is federally funded while the state funds the other 30%. As states navigate how to continue health care coverage for millions of residents, Michigan hospitals may have to eliminate service lines or close down entire facilities, Peters said.
“This bill is an attack on Medicaid, expanded health insurance coverage and healthcare access. We are extremely disappointed with the actions taken by Congress. Today is an extremely large step backwards for making and keeping our communities healthier,” Peters said.
The bill’s one-year ban on state Medicaid funds for certain health care nonprofits that provide abortions could force Planned Parenthood to shut down nearly 200 health centers across the country, eliminating another sector of Michigan’s public health care system Ashlea Phenicie, chief external affairs officer of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Michigan said in a statement earlier this week.
The bill aims to effectively shutdown Planned Parenthood health clinics and impose an abortion ban even in states like Michigan where abortion rights are law, Phenicie said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/mikejohnsonjulyshutt-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-03 17:07:53.537385

Big changes could be coming to the fairgrounds, which state officials hope to develop to benefit the nearby International District and address the state's housing shortage. (Photo courtesy NM State Fair)A board the New Mexico Legislature created earlier this year took its first steps Thursday toward what could be a $500 million investment in a long-struggling neighborhood in the heart of Albuquerque, a process that could also result in the relocation of the New Mexico State Fair. 
At the New Mexico State Fair Tax District Board’s first meeting, members committed to statewide standards around open meetings and procurement; announced the hiring of a design firm tasked with creating a master plan for the fairgrounds; and outlined how the New Mexico State Fair Commission will employ eminent domain to buy out business owners in one corner of the fairgrounds. 
Members include New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller and New Mexico Senate President Pro Tempore Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque), along with other state, county and city leaders. 
The board is empowered to raise property taxes and issue up to $500 million in bonds to fund the development. The bonds are backed primarily by future gaming revenue taxes generated at the Downs casino and racino, which holds a multi-decade lease on property within the fairgrounds perimeter. 
Based on expected taxes and current interest rates, the board could quickly raise up to $170 million in bonds to finance the project, according to a report from the Legislative Finance Committee.
Lawmakers early this year passed Senate Bill 481, which established the new special tax district and board membership. The board also announced Thursday that Stantec, an international design firm, had won a competitive bid awarding it $850,000 to come up with a master plan for the fairgrounds. 
Stantec also developed the master plan for Netflix’s Mesa del Sol campus south of Albuquerque, along with mixed-use developments in Denver and El Paso. 
Lujan Grisham, Stewart and others have touted the potential dramatic change at the fairgrounds as a way to rescue the adjacent International District, which has long been plagued with high poverty and crime rates. The governor deployed National Guard Some neighborhood advocates have raised concerns about who will benefit from the investment and whether it will gentrify a working-class neighborhood.

While no decisions have been made about whether the re-envisioning of the Expo New Mexico property will mean the relocation of the fairgrounds, Lujan Grisham said Thursday that Stantec will be giving serious consideration to that possibility as it completes options for the master plan. 
The fair has been held at Expo New Mexico since 1938. 
Redeveloping the area could also allow the state to build more housing units in a state and city with a severe housing shortage, advocates have said. “This state land in the heart of New Mexico’s largest city presents a unique opportunity to create badly needed new housing for the workforce, while spurring massive private investment,” Lujan Grisham said in a December news release touting the plan. 
Martin Chavez, the former Albuquerque mayor, is spearheading the project as the governor’s senior adviser. He told Source New Mexico after the meeting that while the project has never been intended as an affordable housing development, that new mixed-income housing is a key component of the new master plan Stantec is working on. 
That said, there is no minimum number of housing units that the firm is required to develop a plan around, he said. 
The board has much else to iron out for the development to occur, including Expo New Mexico’s forced acquisition of a handful of businesses, including restaurants and a tire shop, on the southwest corner of the property near Central Avenue and San Pedro Avenue. 
Ricky Serna, the state Transportation Department secretary, said his agency will support Expo New Mexico as it handles the eminent domain process and outlined next steps at the Thursday meeting. 
State officials said they will soon approach business owners in the area with offers to buy their properties, offers that contemplate the value of the businesses, costs to relocate and the property themselves. 
Bernalillo County Commissioner Adriann Barboa raised concerns about whether the business owners would be fairly compensated and whether buying them out would just result in more vacant buildings in a neighborhood with a lot of them. She pointed out that the nearby Wal-mart and two national pharmacy chains across the street have left.
Lujan Grisham responded the state would own the buildings and would manage them as productively as possible during the “parallel planning” regarding the redevelopment that is occurring at the same time the state is acquiring the buildings. 
Keller, attending the meeting remotely, said he’s seen repeated state efforts to redevelop the fairgrounds and invest in the International District that have dissipated without action. The passage of Senate Bill 481 and the meeting Thursday were already more action than he’s seen in years, he said. 
“This is real, and that’s good,” he said. “So I just want to appreciate a little bit of bias towards action, so that’s what we need, and I’m confident that we’ll do it in a fair and appropriate way.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2849216211_b3194b76c6_o-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-03 17:07:53.537385

Florida is moving to solidify its renaming of the training airport where the 3,000-person capacity detention center in the Everglades is located to “Alligator Alcatraz.”
Workers covered the sign at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport Wednesday night with a replacement bearing the moniker Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier publicly rolled out two weeks ago, when he announced plans for the facility, according to a photo published in the Miami Herald. Uthemeier announced Wednesday that hundreds of immigrants were set to arrive that night.
“It’s definitely our official title,” said Bryan Griffin, the governor’s communications director, to reporters on Wednesday morning. But immigrant and environmental advocates and indigenous leaders have criticized the name.
During President Donald Trump’s visit to the detention center on Tuesday, Uthmeier told the president he’d been inspired by his quest to reopen California’s Alcatraz Island, which served as a maximum-security prison from 1934 to 1963 and is now a public historical landmark.
Trump applauded the name when he visited the detention center on Tuesday, and the press release announcing the presidential tour had “Alligator Alcatraz” in the dateline.
“It’s known as Alligator Alcatraz, which is very appropriate because I looked outside, and that’s not a place I want to go hiking anytime soon,” Trump said. “But very soon, this facility will house some of the most menacing migrants, some of the most vicious people on the planet.”
Feds tell court they’re not in charge of Everglades detention center after migrants arrive

While the identities of those who arrived at the detention center Wednesday night is not yet known, approximately 71% of immigrants detained nationwide have had no criminal record, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.
The rebranding of the airport prompted the Republican Party of Florida to sell shirts, beverage coolers, hats, and mugs, and the official U.S. Department of Homeland Security and White House X accounts have posted AI-generated images of alligators wearing “ICE” hats.
Both the Seminole Tribe of Florida and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida have denounced the opening of the detention center. William “Popeye” Osceola, secretary of the Miccosukee Tribe, said he considered the portrayal of alligators and pythons as guards to the detention center as contradictory to the environmental harms.
“It’s just, again, not an accurate framing of the actual issues out there, and, you know, adding more stress to this ecology that’s not gonna help anything when we still need a lot more resources to address what’s going on out there,” he said. “People aren’t gonna be aware of that because they’re gonna be focused on this idea of like, ‘Oh Alligator Alcatraz, what a fun name.'”
Thomas Kennedy, a policy analyst for the Florida Immigrant Coalition, called the merch ugly and criticized the media’s adoption of the DeSantis administration-given name.
“It’s like a cartoonish name that’s supposed to sort of normalize the center, diminish it’s negative impact in the minds of the public while also associating immigrants with crime through the name Alcatraz — which in Americana and history is associated with one of the most nefarious prisons in American history,” Kennedy said in a phone interview with Florida Phoenix.
“So, I do think the name is regrettable, and so many people just kind of regurgitate it.”
Responding to a suit filed in federal court to halt the detention center, the federal government tried to distance itself and referred to the site as the temporary detention center or TNT Detention Facility.
Elise Bennett an attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the groups suing in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, said her group opposes the harm to the environment in the Big Cypress National Preserve.
“The name itself really shows that this is a political stunt,” she told the Phoenix.

(Getty Images)A New Jersey appellate panel dismissed a personal injury suit Thursday against homeowners in Morristown, reaffirming that residential property owners are not liable for sidewalk injuries unless they actively worsen hazardous conditions.
The case was brought in February 2021, after plaintiff, Debra Gottsleben, went on a morning walk and slipped on ice outside of a home owned by Christopher and Maureen Annese.
The couple purchased the home in October 2020 but left it vacant during renovations that lasted until August 2021, according to the ruling.
Gottsleben slipped on their sidewalk one snowy morning in February 2021 and immediately sought medical attention for multiple fractures in her left ankle, which required surgery, the ruling states. 
Gottsleben argued that the Anneses’ should be held liable, saying the home should be treated as a commercial property because it was under renovation. She also argued that the Anneses worsened the sidewalk’s icy condition by negligently clearing the snow or failing to do so. 
The lawsuit also sought damages for her injuries.
New Jersey follows a bright-line rule for sidewalk liability, which says that commercial property owners are liable for failing to maintain sidewalks. Residential property owners are generally not liable for this, unless they worsen the natural condition and create a hazard, as Gottsleben argued.
The Anneses countered that they did not worsen the condition of the sidewalk. The day of the fall, over three inches of snow fell, according to Gottsleben’s own weather expert. 
Gottsleben’s husband had taken pictures of the scene, but not until after snow had covered the sidewalk.
A panel of three judges unanimously ruled that the Anneses cannot be held liable for the injury, rejecting Gottsleben’s claims.
“It is not our role to create new exceptions to the sidewalk liability principles that have been repeatedly enunciated and modified by the Supreme Court,” Judge Jack Sabatino wrote.
The judges agreed that the home was always intended for personal use, not commercial use, and did not bear the same liability as a commercial property. Photos of the sidewalk did not represent conditions at the time of her fall, because most of the snowfall occurred after her fall, they said.
“If a jury were permitted to impose liability in these circumstances based on contradictory evidence and speculation, the policy consequences for homeowners could be detrimental,” Sabatino wrote.
The decision maintains the current precedent, that residential property owners in New Jersey are not liable for failing to remove snow or ice from sidewalks unless their actions exacerbate sidewalk dangers. 
The court also acknowledged that expanding liability to unoccupied homes under renovation might improve safety for pedestrians but would require further legislative action.

However, that law does not protect people convicted of serious crimes.","In summary
The Trump administration faults California’s sanctuary state law for allowing what it describes as violent criminals to remain in the country. However, that law does not protect people convicted of serious crimes.


After launching immigration sweeps that sparked weeks of protests in Los Angeles, the Trump administration faulted California policies for protecting those they described as “the worst of the worst,” meaning immigrants convicted of violent crimes.
“Why do Governor Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass care more about violent murderers and sex offenders than they do about protecting their own citizens?” said Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a news release announcing a group of LA detentions.
However, records and a CalMatters analysis show the state had previously coordinated with Immigration and Customs Enforcement attempting to hand over two of the agency’s top targets in LA:  Roland E. Veneracion-Enriquez and Cuong Chanh Phan, both of whom had served time in state prisons for violent offenses.
That cooperation undercuts the Trump administration’s characterization of why it launched a massive immigration crackdown in the nation’s second-largest city. 
Chanh Phan, who had served time after being convicted of murder, was released directly to ICE in 2022, records show. 
As for Veneracion, state prison officials in May told ICE about the prisoner’s upcoming release, but the feds did not pick him up. Instead, the convicted sex offender was released, and ICE trumpeted his arrest in Los Angeles two weeks later.
California’s so-called sanctuary law does not apply to unauthorized immigrants convicted of serious crimes, and state prisons have handed over more than 9,000 people with those backgrounds to ICE since Gov. Gavin Newsom took office in 2019, state data show. The same rules apply to county jails, where sheriffs sometimes complain that ICE fails to pick up people who they believe should be deported in compliance with the sanctuary law.
In those cases, prison or jail employees communicate with federal immigration authorities before someone’s release.
Four others on the “worst of the worst” list had served time in Los Angeles and Orange County jails, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Officials at those jails said they did not know whether sheriff’s deputies had been in communication with ICE about those men prior to their release.
Top Trump officials have repeatedly said they’re targeting “criminal illegal aliens,” but immigrant and civil rights groups allege federal authorities have launched an indiscriminate enforcement blitz that’s mostly netted day laborers and workers from Latino communities who are not threats to public safety.
Between June 6 and June 22, immigration enforcement teams arrested 1,618 immigrants for deportation in Los Angeles and surrounding regions of Southern California, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed to CalMatters last week. During that time, masked agents have arrested car wash employees, farmworkers, U.S. citizens, and people attending their immigration court hearings. 
Federal data obtained by the Cato Institute shows 65% of the people booked into ICE detention since October 2024 have no criminal convictions. More than 93% of those booked were never convicted of violent offenses, according to the libertarian research center. Data shows immigrants — including those who are undocumented — commit crimes at much lower rates than U.S.-born citizens do.
Officials from Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to emailed questions from CalMatters about the arrests of Veneracion and Chanh Phan. 
How ICE detainers work
An ICE detainer – or an “immigration hold” – is a written request between a jail or prison and federal immigration authorities to coordinate the prisoner’s release directly to immigration authorities, typically to start the process for deportation. 
ICE holds or detainers are the primary method immigration authorities use to find people for deportation. Immigrant Legal Resource Center, a national nonprofit that provides legal training and does pro-immigrant policy work in California and Texas, estimated in January that 70 to 75% of ICE arrests in the interior of the U.S. were historically handoffs from another law enforcement agency, such as local jails or state or federal prisons. 
When a person enters the state prison system, the corrections department is required to identify people who may be subject to deportation within 90 days and send an initial inquiry to ICE. Typically, ICE will respond about whether the person can be deported and, if so, issue a detainer. The detainer means ICE will take custody of the person upon their release. 
Shortly before an individual is released, state prison employees again contact ICE and let them know the person’s release date is approaching. ICE then decides whether or not they will pick the person up. 
So far in 2025, ICE has picked up 587 people of 11,231 inmates released from the state prison system. They pick up about 87% of the people whom they’ve placed detainers on, state data shows.  
What we know about former prisoners detained in LA
Veneracion-Enriquez, 55, was released from a California state prison in May after spending 28 years in prison for rape, according to the California Department of Justice’s sex offender database and the corrections department. The corrections department was ready to hand him over to ICE, but a day before his release, ICE cancelled his detainer, state officials confirmed in response to questions from CalMatters. 
That month, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation contacted ICE about Veneracion’s pending release, as required by law. Emails show that they notified ICE that Veneracion was going to be released within 15 days. Typically, the federal immigration agency prefers to apprehend criminals in a controlled location directly outside a state prison.  But on May 19, ICE cancelled the hold, according to state officials. He was released a day later.
Veneracion was released and given an ankle monitor to wear that broadcast his location to law enforcement authorities. His address was included in the sex offender registry. According to state records, his last registered address was at an apartment complex in Long Beach. 
Immigration authorities then arrested Veneracion, a citizen of the Philippines, on June 7 during his regularly scheduled ICE check-in at the Los Angeles ICE office. It’s unclear if he’s been deported.  
Chanh Phan, the other former state prisoner highlighted on the Homeland Security Department’s “worst of the worst” list, was released directly into ICE’s custody in August 2022 during the Biden administration, according to corrections department records.  He was on parole until Aug. 14, 2024. 
“Criminal Illegal Alien Arrested during Los Angeles ICE Operation Committed Notorious Gang-Affiliated Murder of Two Teenagers at a Graduation Party” is the headline on the press release the Department of Homeland Security sent out to publicize its arrest of Chanh Phan, a 49-year-old from Vietnam. He had spent 24 years in prison for second-degree murder.
“This criminal illegal alien is who Governor Newsom, Mayor Bass, and the rioters in Los Angeles are trying to protect over U.S. citizens,” the Department of Homeland Security wrote in the press release. 
It is unclear what happened after California released him to ICE, such as whether Chanh Phan remained in ICE detention or whether he was released by ICE into Los Angeles and then re-arrested last month. CalMatters does not have details about where or how Chanh Phan was arrested by ICE earlier this month.

Newsom vetoed bills to expand sanctuary law
California adopted its sanctuary law during the first Trump administration. It’s meant to shield unauthorized immigrants accused of minor infractions from facing deportation. 
The law allows state corrections officials to continue working with federal immigration agencies regarding individuals in state custody who are facing deportation after serving their sentences. It also allows local law enforcement officials to work with the feds for individuals convicted of serious or violent felonies, such as assaults, child abuse, felony DUI, and other crimes.
At the local level, at least one sheriff wishes ICE would pick up more people. 
In March, the Orange County sheriff made headlines for complaining that ICE wasn’t picking up all of the people it could. Sheriff Don Barnes told the Orange County Board of Supervisors that out of 48,000 suspects booked into jail in 2024, 733 were deportable, but the state’s sanctuary law prevented deputies from alerting ICE about 456 inmates. Of the remaining 277, 49 were not picked up by federal authorities, Barnes told the board.  
“Those who are not picked up by ICE continue to victimize our community and consume law enforcement resources,” he told the county board. 
State lawmakers have tried expanding the sanctuary protections to people in prison. In 2019 and 2023, Newsom vetoed two bills that would have restricted the corrections department’s cooperation with ICE.
In the most recent veto, he said that the current law  “strikes the right balance.”
Newsom has long positioned California as a bastion of immigrant rights, often clashing publicly with federal officials over deportation policy. But under his watch, the state has facilitated thousands of transfers from prison to ICE – a point he recently emphasized in a back-and-forth on social media with Trump Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller. 
“Yes, we seek sanctuary from your stupidity,” Newsom’s press office recently posted, responding to criticism from a former Trump aide in April. “P.S. Voldermort, you should know the state has coordinated 10,588+ times with ICE to remove dangerous criminals from the state since Governor Newsom took office.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/060625_ICE-Raid-DTLA_JWBH_CM_29.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-03 17:07:53.537385

(U.S. House of Representatives screenshot)West Virginia House of Representative members Carol Miller and Riley Moore, both Republicans, praised the House’s passage of a massive tax credit and spending bill Thursday.
The House signed off on the Senate’s changes to the so-called “Big, Beautiful Bill Act” with a 218 to 214 vote Thursday afternoon, in time for President Donald Trump to sign the legislation by his Independence Day deadline.
Miller spoke in support of the legislation from the House floor. 
“This is a big win for our West Virginia businesses,” she said. “It provides relief to gig workers by ending the Democrats’ absurd $600 1099K reporting threshold and reverts back to the time-tested standard of $20,000 and 200 transactions. It will provide economic relief, secure our borders, and ensure American energy dominance,” she said. 
“This legislation will make the life of the average American better, and I support getting it to President Trump’s desk. I urge all my colleagues to do the same,” Miller said.
  West Virginia Treasurer Riley Moore
In a statement, Moore said the bill fulfills a mandate the American people gave Trump to secure the nation’s borders, lower costs, and return to commonsense. 
“This bill provides the largest border security investment in America’s history — $175 billion to finish the wall, hire thousands of new ICE and Border Patrol agents, and conduct mass deportations — giving the president every tool he needs to restore our national sovereignty,” Moore said. “We also provide the largest tax cut in American history — no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and 88% of seniors will pay no taxes on Social Security.  
The legislation will extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts by slashing Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. It will shift some of the costs of a federal food assistance program to the states for the first time. 
In West Virginia, where about 500,000 people get their health care from Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, about 82,000 people are expected to lose coverage as a result of changes in the bill, according to a news release from West Virginians for Affordable Health Care.
Nationally, about one million people will lose their health care, according to an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office. The bill will increase health insurance premiums for about 67,000 West Virginians by eliminating tax credits for plans through the Affordable Care Act that made them affordable. 
In a statement, Ellen Allen, executive director of West Virginians for Affordable Care, said the state’s congressional delegation betrayed it by supporting the bill. 
“West Virginia’s congressional delegation now has the disgraceful distinction of voting for and helping pass the largest cuts to Medicaid in history,” she said. “In addition to historic coverage losses, ten West Virginia hospitals and three nursing homes could be forced to shut down, resulting in layoffs and hurting local economies. 
“West Virginia’s congressional had the power to vote this devastating bill down and protect working West Virginians and their health care, but instead, they chose to line the pockets of billionaires with even more tax breaks,” Allen said. 
Allen said besides the health care tax credits that expire at the end of the year, the “true pain” of the bill likely will not be felt right away. 
“The worst of this legislation will be felt in 2027 when people lose Medicaid, when hospitals aren’t reimbursed, when people are having trouble verifying work requirements even though they’re working,” Allen said. “So that will snowball into hospitals.”
The bill sets up a $50 billion fund to support rural hospitals, but won’t not enough to cover the people coming to the hospitals with no health insurance, she said. 
“I just can’t see how anybody thought this was a good idea,” Allen said. 
The West Virginia Democratic Party also condemned the bill’s passage. 
“This budget is Robin Hood in reverse,” Democrat Party Chair Del. Mike Pushkin said in a statement. “Donald Trump and his Republican allies are robbing the poor to enrich the wealthy. Over half a million West Virginians — including kids, veterans, seniors, and people with disabilities — just got told they don’t matter.”

People who are not immune to measles should contact their health care provider to discuss protective options, the Health Department said, including vaccination or immune globulin, depending on eligibility and timing. People considered immune to measles include those who:

Were born before 1957.
Received one dose of measles vaccine (MMR) as an adult or from 12 months to pre-school age.
Received two doses of measles vaccine (MMR) as a school-aged child or as an adult at higher risk of infection.
Have a presence of measles antibodies shown by a lab test.
Had a previous measles infection shown by a lab test.

The public alert comes as the in-state number of reported measles cases has remained at four for two weeks. The super-contagious disease is nearing a six-year record as outbreaks spread across the United States. According to a federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention update Tuesday, there are 1,267 confirmed cases affecting 34 states.
In response to cases appearing in South Dakota, the state Health Department is holding vaccination clinics across the state through July 10. 
Measles symptoms appear in two stages, first with a runny nose, cough and slight fever. Second, occurring on the third to seventh day of the illness, a red blotchy rash appears and lasts for up to a week. The rash usually begins on the face.

Article Summary

The U.S. House gave final passage Thursday to a bill that will cut federal Medicaid spending in Illinois by an estimated 20%, or $48 billion, over 10 years.
Medicaid pays for about 40% of all childbirths in Illinois as well as 69% of all nursing home care, according to an independent analysis.
State officials estimate 330,000 Illinoisans could lose Medicaid coverage if President Donald Trump signs the bill into law.
The Illinois Department of Public Health said nine rural hospitals in Illinois would face closure or severe service reductions due to the cuts.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.


SPRINGFIELD — The U.S. House gave final passage Thursday to a budget bill that will cut federal Medicaid spending by an estimated $1 trillion over 10 years.

All three Republican members of the Illinois congressional delegation voted in favor of the bill, despite a last-minute plea from Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker who warned the bill will result more than 330,000 Illinoisans losing Medicaid coverage and have a devastating effect on some rural hospitals.

“As those who are entrusted with protecting the health of all your constituents, I urge you to oppose these harmful Medicaid provisions and work to protect healthcare access for rural Illinois families, workers, and veterans,” Pritzker wrote in the letter addressed to GOP Reps. Mike Bost, Darin LaHood and Mary Miller.

The cuts would translate to about $48 billion in Illinois over that period, or about 20% of what the state would otherwise receive, according to an analysis by KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research organization.

That would be one of the largest percentage reductions in any state in the nation, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research organization formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation. Louisiana and Virginia would each see cuts of about 21%, KFF said.

The state-level analysis is based largely on Congressional Budget Office estimates showing the bill would reduce federal Medicaid spending by $1 trillion nationwide over the next decade.

The KFF analysis does not include estimates of the number of people who would lose Medicaid coverage under the bill, noting how that will depend on how individual states respond to the policy changes contained in the bill. But overall, it estimates the number of uninsured Americans will grow by 11.8 million.

The bill, which includes many of President Donald Trump’s domestic policy priorities – including tax cuts and increased spending on border security – passed the Senate on Tuesday by a vote of 51-50, with Vice President J.D. Vance casting the tie-breaking vote. Both senators from Illinois, Democrats Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, voted no.

The final vote in the House was 218-214.

“The One Big, Beautiful Bill is a once-in-a-generation victory for the American people,” Miller said in a statement after the House vote. “It delivers on President Trump’s America First agenda with bold, decisive, and immediate action. This is the most pro-worker, pro-family, pro-America legislation I have voted for during my time in Congress, and I was proud to help get it across the finish line for the hardworking Americans across my district.”

Medicaid and the health care marketplace

Medicaid, which is jointly funded by states and the federal government, provides health coverage for lower-income individuals and families. It was established in 1965 alongside Medicare, the federally funded health coverage program for people over 65.

Today, according to the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, the program covers about 3.4 million people in Illinois, or a fourth of the state’s population. At a total cost of $33.7 billion a year, it is one of the largest single categories of expenditures in the state’s budget. It pays for about 40% of all childbirths in the state, according to KFF, as well as 69% of all nursing home care.

But questions about its future loomed over the Illinois General Assembly during the just-completed legislative session as both Congress and the General Assembly were crafting their respective budgets for their upcoming fiscal years.

“This was a difficult year because of the unprecedented changes and cuts that are looming on the horizon in Washington,” state Rep. Anna Moeller, D-Elgin, said on the floor of the Illinois House during debate over a Medicaid bill on the final day of the session.

Speaking with reporters at an unrelated event Tuesday, Pritzker predicted “hundreds of thousands” of people in Illinois will lose Medicaid coverage if the Senate bill is signed into law.

“This is shameful, if you ask me, and it’s going to be very hard to recover,” Pritzker said. “The state of Illinois can’t cover the cost – no state in the country can cover the cost of reinstating that health insurance that is today paid for mostly by the federal government, partly by state government.”

Policy changes under the bill

According to KFF, most of the reductions in Medicaid spending would result from just a few policy changes contained in the bill

Those include imposing a work requirement on adults enrolled in Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act, also known as “Obamacare.” That law expanded eligibility for Medicaid to working-age adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level. About 772,000 people in Illinois are enrolled under that program.

The bill also calls for requiring people enrolled through the ACA expansion to verify their continued eligibility for Medicaid twice a year instead of annually. That is expected to filter out enrollees whose incomes rise above the eligibility limit as well as those who simply fail to complete the verification process.

Another provision would limit the ability of states to finance their share of the cost of Medicaid by levying taxes on health care providers. Illinois imposes such taxes on hospitals, nursing facilities and managed care organizations that administer the program. Revenue from those taxes is used to draw down federal matching funds that are then used to fund higher reimbursement rates to health care providers.

The final version of the bill does not, however, include a provision penalizing states like Illinois that also provide state-funded health care to noncitizens who do not have lawful status to be in the United States. That provision, which was included in the earlier House version, was not included in the Senate bill, according to KFF.

The ratio of people older than 65 to children younger than 18 grew in every state, according to a Stateline analysis of the estimates released last week, which measure age changes in mid-2024 compared with earlier years.
Other states where older people already outnumbered children in 2023: Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia. That grew from just four in 2020: Florida, Maine, Vermont and West Virginia.
In South Carolina, where the entire population is growing, residents 65 and older represented 19.7% of the population, while children 18 and younger represented 21% in July 2024. That compares to 18% and 22%, respectively, four years earlier, according to the estimates.
States such as SC with more affordable housing dominated post-pandemic jobs boom

The national trend bodes poorly for the future number of young adults who can help care for older relatives, according to a report published last year by the Maxwell School of Citizenship & Public Affairs at Syracuse University.
“America’s health and aging care system is unprepared to support its large and growing older adult population,” the report concluded. It said health care likely will become scarcer and more unequal if the nation’s older population grows to 73 million as projected by 2030, from the roughly 61.3 million in the latest 2024 estimates.
The new census estimates show Maine and Vermont have the highest ratios: about 1.3 older people for every child, followed by New Hampshire (1.2), Florida and West Virgina (each about 1.1).
New England’s labor force has been slow to recover since the pandemic, partly because of an aging population, according to a report published in January by the New England Public Policy Center at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
Florida has many of the counties with the highest ratios of older people to children, the census estimates show.
Among larger counties with 100,000 people or more, older adults outnumber children the most — by 8 to 1 — in Florida’s Sumter County, home to most of The Villages with its fast-growing retirement communities.
The ratio is 3 to 1 in Florida’s Charlotte and Sarasota counties, as well as North Carolina’s Brunswick County and Massachusetts’ Barnstable County, where Cape Cod is located.
The ratio is 2 to 1 in New Mexico’s Santa Fe County, Arizona’s Mohave and Yavapai counties, and in five Florida counties.
The nation’s median age reached a new historical high at 39.1, up from 38.9 in 2023, the census also found. The median age was below 30 until 1980 and below 20 until 1870.
Maine’s population in 2024 was the oldest of any state, with a median age of 44.8; Utah’s was the youngest at 32.4 as of 2024.
The median age of South Carolinians in 2024 was 40.5, according to census estimates.

Masters, R-Berkeley, sits in a meeting of the House Public Heath subcommittee on March 5, 2025 in Charleston, W.Va. (Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)Del. Ian T. Masters, whose Instagram account he says was used by someone else last month to write an antisemitic comment, spoke publicly on Thursday for the first time since the comment was reported.
Masters, R-Berkeley, appeared on the Eastern Panhandle’s WRNR radio station. His interview came the day after one given by House Majority Leader Pat McGeehan. During his appearance, McGeehan said he personally investigated how the antisemitic comment was made by an Instagram account Masters previously used and that still bore his full name and a link to an organization he once led.
WRNR is owned by another member of the House Republican caucus, Del. Mike Hornby, R-Berkeley, according to the Secretary of State. Another Republican, Del. Michael Hite, R-Berkeley, was one of the hosts on the show while Masters gave his interview.
The comment in question was left on June 21 by an account with the handle @NoQuarterMasters in response to another comment on a post from April 12 about Dave Portnoy, founder of Barstool Sports.
McGeehan told the radio show on Wednesday that he found the individual who actually left the comment — a friend of Masters’ late brother — and he was “very sick,” “basically homeless” and living with substance use disorder after a recent extended hospital stay where he woke up from an almost two-month-long coma. Masters, McGeehan said, had given the man an old iPhone in 2024 that had his personal Instagram account, as well as other social media, still logged in.
On Thursday, Masters further explained the incident and asserted again that he did not leave the comment. 
“I can unequivocally tell you I did not author that comment,” Masters said.
Masters has denied making the comment since it was first reported by West Virginia Watch on June 24. In an interview that day, he said he did not have “any active Instagram account” and did not acknowledge an affiliation with the account’s handle, @NoQuarterMasters. When the comment was made, the account still used Masters’ full name and was previously tagged and featured in photos of Masters posted by other public Instagram pages.
He said Thursday that he didn’t take ownership of the account during his interview with West Virginia Watch because he “wasn’t about to hand over any personal information” to a reporter he didn’t know. Masters did not respond to a phone call for this story.
Masters’ explanation of how the comment was left by someone else through his account largely echoed what McGeehan shared. The person who left the comment, Masters said, was someone he had “known for a long while and cared about and was trying to help.”
“[I] provided them with an older phone [and] some money to try to get back on their feet … It was an older phone my kids had messed around with, but it was ostensibly supposed to be to fill out job applications or reach family or whatever,” Masters said. “I provided that to this person, and I do care about the person — even in light of this — it’s somebody that had been around me during the loss of my brother, somebody who had been very close to my brother and an individual I was trying to help.”
McGeehan said that the person responsible was “probably going to eventually die in the near future” due to either his illness or from overdose. Masters said he learned through McGeehan’s interview that the person “was in an even worse place than [he] was aware.”
“I hope this individual is not that sick, I didn’t know that,” Masters said.
Because this was someone he cared for, Masters said he didn’t at this time want to release their name, but he was “contemplating” doing so.
Masters said he’s working to get information from Meta, which owns Instagram, about the login locations for the account so he can show definitively that it wasn’t him, but he hasn’t gotten that yet.
He also said he’s “been in discussion” with law enforcement regarding the incident.
“I don’t know at present if this circumstance of me leaving a device logged in and a person using that meets that criminal side of things,” said Masters, who is a lawyer by trade. “There’s a lot that I’m trying to process and understand here.”
The profile picture on Masters’ Instagram account — which he said he’s regained control of and has logged out of it on devices he no longer owns — shows a letter addressed to him and partially covered by runes burnt into wooden pendants hanging from strings. The letter, Masters said, was from his brother, who died by suicide in 2014 and the picture is of a “memorial wall” in his home honoring him.
Several of the runes on the pendants show symbols classified by the Anti-Defamation League, an advocacy organization dedicated to stopping antisemitism across the world, as antisemitic symbols commonly used by groups and individuals espousing white supremacist, neo-Nazi and antisemitic ideals.
Masters said, however, that the symbols have been taken out of context and were meant only to honor his brother, who loved Vikings and read a lot of Norse mythology. 
“It’s a sad aspect of our discourse — in the way that everything has been twisted — that this is somehow this Nazi imagery,” Masters said.
One of the pendants shows a carving of a wolf under a horizontal Wolfsangel. Masters said this pendant was an homage to one of his brother’s favorite songs, “Keep The Wolves Away.” 
The Wolfsangel symbol was appropriated by Nazi Germany as the divisional insignia for several Waffen-SS units and, more modernly, is used in the logo for the Aryan Nations in the U.S. and Europe. Unlike the other symbols, per the ADL, it’s not one that is still associated with other religions or cultures outside of these beliefs.
Last week, the state Democratic Party called for a “legitimate” investigation into not just the comment left by Masters’ account, but into the imagery used in the profile picture.
The party, led by Del. Mike Pushkin, D-Kanawha, outlined several steps that House leadership should take to clear Masters of charges, including performing a “full forensic investigation” of his devices, social media accounts and email and seeking an explanation of the account’s profile picture and the symbols within it, among other things.
McGeehan has classified the request from state Democrats as being politically motivated. He called out Pushkin and Del. Evan Hansen, D-Monongalia — the only two Jewish people in the state Legislature — by name, saying they were “not interested in the truth” about who really left the antisemitic comment and were making “deceptive accusations because they desire power and social status.”
The investigation, McGeehan told WRNR, is “over.”
“I’ve done due diligence … It’s over,” McGeehan said. “As far as I’m concerned, this is a witch hunt. That’s it.”

Janet Mills gives State of the State address at the Maine State House in Augusta on Jan. 30, 2024. (Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)After the U.S. House of Representatives finally overcame conservative pushback and passed the massive budget reconciliation package on Thursday, Maine leaders and organizations condemned the spending bill they say will harm Maine people for years to come. 
Gov. Janet Mills decried its passage, calling it an “ugly, purely partisan bill.”
“There is certainly nothing pretty about denying food to hungry children, preventing Maine people from seeing their doctor, or preventing a doctor from being paid,” she said in a statement after the vote. 
Mills said Maine can’t absorb the costs the bill will foist onto the state after slashing federal funding for food assistance and health coverage, among other programs. Her administration will review the final language of the bill in the coming weeks to determine the full impact to the state’s budget. 
The bill’s significant cuts to Medicaid are just one of the areas where the state will be forced to cover costs or risk residents losing access.
An analysis of the package by the nonpartisan health research organization KFF shows it would reduce federal spending on Medicaid in Maine by at least $3 billion over the next ten years.
With a final vote of 218-214, both of Maine’s two Democratic U.S. representatives, Reps. Chellie Pingree and Jared Golden, joined their caucus in voting against the measure. With U.S. Sen. Susan Collins as the lone Republican to oppose the bill in the final Senate vote, Maine’s entire delegation ended up rejecting the budget that makes significant reductions to the social safety net to pay for an extension of the tax cuts passed during President Donald Trump’s first term as well as $170 billion in immigration enforcement and border-related measures. The bill will also add an estimated $3.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade.
In a statement after the vote, Pingree called the bill “the most harmful, heartless and regressive bill” she has seen in her time in Congress. 
“The impact of this legislation here in Maine will be devastating,” she continued, adding that tens of thousands could lose access to health care and food assistance. 
“It’s an assault on the working class, a gift to the ultra-wealthy, a climate disaster, and a ticking time bomb for the economy.”
Golden said in a statement Thursday afternoon that it could close rural hospitals and “blow up the national debt.”
“This year, we had a real opportunity to pass a budget that put the middle class first,” Golden said. “Instead, from the very beginning, this GOP majority has used a broken, partisan process where the only choices put on the floor seemed to be ‘bad’ or ‘worse.’” 
Collins also cited the threat to rural hospitals as her primary reason for opposing the bill. In a statement after the Senate vote, she said her decision “stems primarily from the harmful impact it will have on Medicaid, affecting low-income families and rural health care providers like our hospitals and nursing homes.” 
The left-leaning Maine Center for Economic Policy said congressional Republicans passed “a shell game into federal law—and working-class Americans are the marks.”
“Any child can tell you that $4 trillion is not the same thing as zero, and yet that’s the math Republicans have used to justify their reckless, debt-exploding plan,” said President and CEO Garrett Martin in a statement. 
The bill also includes a provision barring Medicaid reimbursements for non-abortion health services provided by Planned Parenthood, which the organization has described as a “backdoor abortion ban.” Maine’s reproductive health providers have warned for months that passage of the bill would dramatically impact their ability to stay open, particularly in rural areas, and continue providing essential care.
“Our patients’ lives matter and the politicians who voted in support of taking away health care to give billionaires tax cuts will have to answer to them,” said Nicole Clegg, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Northern New England.

(Photo courtesy of the U.S. Fire Administration)Nearly six years after Sioux Falls officials filed a federal lawsuit against chemical manufacturers for pollution discovered in the city’s groundwater, the city received its first installment of settlement money this June: $37.2 million.
Dave Pfeifle, city attorney, said in an emailed statement that the funds will be reserved to “replenish, protect, and secure source water” for the city. Vanessa Gomez, the mayor’s chief of staff, added that the city is in the process of determining the “best course of action” to place the settlement funds into a “restricted and committed” fund to achieve that goal.
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been used in industry and consumer products since the 1940s, including in modern products such as nonstick cookware and water-resistant clothing, and don’t break down easily in the environment or in the human body. Research indicates PFAS exposure may be linked to negative developmental and reproductive effects, and an increased risk of some cancers.
“PFAS have become a widespread, environmental issue that affects not only Sioux Falls, but the nation, and impacts people’s lives through the everyday products they use,” Pfeifle said. “The City’s proactive response and pursuit of litigation is a testament to our commitment and responsibility to supply safe and reliable drinking water to our community.”
South Dakota government, university plan to start in-state ‘forever chemical’ testing labs

Sioux Falls was one of thousands of plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit against manufacturers of firefighting foam that contained PFAS. The settlement agreement was approved by a U.S. District Court in South Carolina last year. The full amount that the city will receive is unknown, Pfeifle said. The city did not respond to a follow up question seeking an explanation.
Sioux Falls alleged that chemical-makers tested for and were aware of health risks of compounds used in a firefighting foam that for decades was tested and stored at the Sioux Falls Regional Airport. Investigators for the Air National Guard — which is co-located at the airport — tested the soil and groundwater near the airport beginning in 2013, finding high amounts of PFAS.
Health advisories from the EPA set a safety limit of 70 parts-per-trillion for drinking water at the time. Groundwater and soil near the airport was contaminated at a rate of 255,100 parts-per-trillion, according to analysis of military records by Northeastern University and advocates with the nonprofit Environmental Working Group.
PFAS mitigation, testing and planning efforts
Sioux Falls officials shuttered 21 of the city’s 64 wells “out of an abundance of caution” once the contamination was identified, Pfeifle said, “which significantly impacted the city’s ability to harvest water and severely limited its water supply.”
The Environmental Protection Agency proposed regulating PFAS levels in drinking water at a stricter 4 parts per trillion in 2023, which experts projected would cost South Dakota water systems hundreds of millions of dollars to test and treat. Water providers throughout South Dakota have since been testing drinking water to ensure compliance once the limits are in place, including federal testing of private wells. Initial tests of Mount Rushmore’s drinking water exceeded the new limit in 2024.
The EPA under the Trump administration is planning to delay enforcement of some PFAS drinking water limits until 2031 and reconsidering rules for other types of PFAS.
Sioux Falls plans to follow PFAS guidance from the South Dakota Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources, said Sioux Falls Public Works Director Mark Cotter. It’ll continue its monthly PFAS testing, Cotter added in an email, “which shows Sioux Falls’ drinking water is well within all health-based limits” set at the state and federal level.
The city expects to receive several more payments over the next decade from the 3M settlement, as well as chemical manufacturers DuPont, Tyco and BASF. The payments will be listed in the city’s monthly financial reports.

The state of South Dakota plans to open its own drinking water testing laboratory, and South Dakota State University researchers plan to test surface water and environmental samples, including animal tissue and plant material, to understand how the chemicals work their way through the food chain. The state is currently sampling South Dakota surface waters for PFAS, after the East Dakota Water Development District and South Dakota Mines found PFAS along the Big Sioux River watershed in the eastern part of the state last year. It is also offering free PFAS cleanup to local fire departments and schools throughout the state.
The Sioux Falls Regional Airport Authority also sued companies behind the firefighting foam in 2019, seeking damages for the cost of investigating and addressing the contamination. Dan Letellier, executive director, said the airport is part of a group of property and landowners set to go to trial or potentially settle.
Ellsworth, Box Elder continue investigation and mitigation of PFAS contamination
Other South Dakota communities have experienced PFAS contamination, including Box Elder near Ellsworth Air Force Base and wells at National Guard facilities near Custer and in Rapid City.
Ellsworth is one of many military installations throughout the country with PFAS contamination, South Dakota Ellsworth Development Authority Business Operations Manager Howie Aubertin told South Dakota Searchlight.
Groundwater and soil at Ellsworth Air Force Base were contaminated at a rate of up to 551,000 parts-per-trillion as of 2016, according to analysis of military records by Northeastern University and the Environmental Working Group.

The contamination affected dozens of families living near the base and on the western edge of Box Elder city limits. The property owners were provided bottled water, treatment systems for private wells or were hooked up to a waterline from the base.
Box Elder, Ellsworth Development Authority and Rapid City partnered to build a pipeline to transport water from Rapid City to about 35 impacted properties. Construction on the $12.5 million project, funded by the U.S. Air Force, began last year and is expected to finish by the end of the year, Aubertin said. The Air Force provided additional funding to widen the system and provide for the base’s future growth.
The base is still studying the extent of PFAS in non-drinking water sources around and near the base with plans to remedy the contamination. 
“The issue of PFAS at Ellsworth is not solved, and the Air Force recognizes that,” Aubertin said. “It is still in its investigative and exploratory phase.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/firefighting-foam-FEMA-photo-1024x512-1-e1682111382938.jpg,,,2025-07-03 16:10:47.138746

Jef Landry and state lawmakers are tearing down government ethics enforcement,"A longtime member of the Louisiana Board of Ethics accuess Gov. Jeff Landry and lawmakers of trying to dismantle ethics enforcement. (Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate-Pool)The immediate past chairman of the Louisiana Board of Ethics said Gov. Jef Landry and state lawmakers are tearing down government ethics enforcement with the massive overhaul of ethics and campaign finance laws they enacted last month. 

“With these new changes, we are not slowly – we are expeditiously – veering into an arena into which we are being made nonessential,” said La Koshia Roberts, an attorney from Lake Charles who has served on the board since 2018 and is its longest-serving member. 
“They are hamstringing us,” she said in an interview following the board’s meeting Tuesday. “They are essentially dismantling the Board of Ethics starting with this legislation.” 

At the urging of Landry, state lawmakers passed sweeping changes to ethics and campaign finance laws last month that loosen dozens of existing restrictions on public servants, diminish government transparency and create new ways for people accused of government misconduct to push back on charges they face for allegedly breaking the law. 

The ethics board enforces statutes that are meant to protect the public against misconduct, inappropriate influence and favoritism in government. It oversees the conduct of elected officials, public employees, public contractors and lobbyists in state and local government. Everyone from the governor and state lawmakers to trash collectors and public school teachers are subject to its scrutiny. 

Roberts, who was appointed by the Louisiana House of Representatives, said the governor and legislators rewrote the ethics laws to benefit themselves. She said some adjustments had been made so that people who were not complying with the law will not be forced to do so. 
“They’ve done exactly what I thought they were going to do. They were going to carve out a law that was going to accommodate and satisfy certain people across the street,” who work in the Louisiana Capitol, Roberts said. 

In an interview after the meeting, Roberts said she was specifically referring to the governor and Louisiana Legislature when she mentioned “people across the street.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

She contends the law changes created a new hierarchy for ethics enforcement, in which the governor and legislators were entitled to flexibility that wasn’t afforded to public employees with less power.

“I know we don’t write the law, but it’s our job to apply the law which we’ve done for years now, but apparently, until just recently, certain people felt like they didn’t have to follow it and we should not apply it,” she said during the meeting. 
To what extent the governor or legislators have been investigated and reprimanded by the board is difficult to discern. It’s also hard to tell what laws changes might be in response to previous or ongoing investigations. 
The board’s deliberations only become public when it files charges or issues a fine. But it’s common for the board to drop an investigation or run out of time before completing it, which keeps the matter confidential. The board can also take other types of actions to reprimand someone that are secret, such as issuing a written warning.  

Board members and staff can face criminal charges for sharing information about ethics investigations considered privileged. 
Landry has had several run-ins with the board that have become public however. The board has repeatedly fined him for filing his campaign finance reports late, according to documents obtained through a public records request, and asked him to stop using his political funds to pay off his personal car loan. 

In the most high-profile incident, the board charged the governor two years ago, when he was still the state attorney general, with violating a government transparency law. Landry did not disclose to the ethics board that he had taken a flight to and from an attorneys general conference in Hawaii on a political donor’s private plane. 
His case has not been closed yet because the board and Landry are still negotiating over what the consequences should be for the violation. 
Landry’s attorneys have said the new ethics law will not impact his case. The portion of the law which he failed to follow aremained untouched in the recent law changes. 

Roberts  also accused legislators of attempting to intimidate the board last fall when a few attended a board executive session, which is not open to the public, in person. She said one of the lawmakers who came was Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New Iberia, who is chairman of a legislative committee that handles ethics laws. 
At the time, the board and legislators were in a dispute over when the board should hire a new state ethics administrator, who serves the board’s attorney and who oversees ethics investigations. 
“It was only during that time that members of the legislature found it necessary to come in and sit in on our executive session,” she said. “And in my opinion, it was a way to try to bully this board to not conduct our business the way it should be conducted.”

The ethics board ended up hiring David Bordelon for the job on an interim basis in December, but only after legislators unsuccessfully sued to stop the selection process. 
The lawmakers were attempting to stall the hiring of a new administrator until at least January, when the makeup of the board changed with new appointees from Landry and the state lawmakers.

Colorado’s four Democratic representatives, Reps. Diana DeGette of Denver, Joe Neguse of Lafayette, Jason Crow of Centennial and Brittany Pettersen of Lakewood, voted against the bill. The four Republicans, Reps. Jeff Hurd of Grand Junction, Lauren Boebert of Windsor, Jeff Crank of Colorado Springs and Gabe Evans of Fort Lupton, voted for it. Colorado’s two Democratic U.S. senators, Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper, voted against the bill when it was in the Senate on Tuesday.


Here is how members of the Colorado delegation to the U.S. House voted on Trump’s tax break and spending cut package:

Lauren Boebert (R): Yes
Jeff Crank (R): Yes
Jason Crow (D): No
Diana DeGette (D): No
Gave Evans (R): Yes
Jeff Hurd (R): Yes
Joe Neguse (D): No
Brittany Pettersen (D): No



“It’s deeply disappointing that all the Republican members of our delegation voted for this bill, despite being warned repeatedly of the damage it will cause for their constituents and our state,” Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said in a statement following the final vote. “Colorado Republicans and Trump now own the devastating impacts, cost increases, and chaos this bill will impose on hardworking Coloradans and Americans.”
Estimates suggest the measure could cause well over 100,000 Coloradans to lose Medicaid coverage. Tens of thousands of Coloradans could lose food assistance.
In his own statement, Evans called the bill a “bold, commonsense blueprint for how to secure the border, lower costs for families, crack down on dangerous illegal immigrants, and give local law enforcement the tools needed to keep our communities safe.”
Boebert said she took a cue from residents she represents.
“After listening to constituents and community leaders from across the 4th District and securing wins for Colorado, I am proud to vote YES on President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill,” she said in a statement.
The bill extends tax cuts established during Trump’s first term in 2017, boosts spending for defense and border security and creates new tax breaks on tips and overtime. It makes cuts to Medicaid spending, funding for nutritional assistance programs and eliminates some clean energy tax incentives created during the Biden administration.
BREAKING: US House passes massive tax break and spending cut bill, sending it to Trump

Colorado Democrats have repeatedly condemned the bill as it inched through the legislative process, claiming it will endanger the health care coverage of a huge swath of Coloradans, destroy clean and renewable energy projects, jeopardize food assistance for low-income families and blow a massive hole into an already tight state budget. State economists estimate the bill could decrease state revenues by as much as $500 million and increase costs to the state by around $500 million.
“The cruelty behind this bill is simply staggering, and it is all to appease the ego of Donald Trump and further his extreme and hateful agenda of mass deportations and his dangerous America Alone foreign policy,” DeGette said in a statement. “Our country is watching, and those who supported this horrific bill must justify taking Medicaid away from children, the disabled, our veterans, and senior citizens so that billionaires can get even more money in their pockets.”
State Sen. Jeff Bridges, a Democrat who chairs the state Joint Budget Committee, said in a statement that the bill will “almost certainly” force the Legislature into a special session to make further cuts to Colorado’s budget.
“Those cuts rest entirely at the feet of Gabe Evans, Jeff Hurd, and Donald Trump,” he said.

(Photo via Getty Images)Amid allegations of “gamesmanship” and forum shopping, a federal judge has blocked, at least for now, President Donald Trump’s attempt to move his lawsuit against the Des Moines Register and its pollster out of federal court and into state court.
Noting that Trump recently filed an appeal on one specific issue within the federal lawsuit, U.S. District Court Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger found that because the president’s appeal had conferred jurisdiction of the case to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, he must first dismiss that appeal before voluntarily dismissing the underlying lawsuit.
For now, that means the president and his lawyers are pursuing the same legal case against the newspaper and pollster Ann Selzer in both state court and federal court.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The lawsuit was initiated in December 2024 when Trump sued the Register, its parent company, Gannett, and the Register’s former pollster, J. Ann Selzer, in Polk County District Court. The president alleged the newspaper’s Iowa Poll, which was published shortly before the Nov. 5 election, deliberately overstated support for the Democratic nominee for president, Vice President Kamala Harris, by 16 percentage points.
Trump argued the poll amounted to “brazen election interference” and violated Iowa’s Consumer Fraud Act — claims the defendants have denied.
Attorneys for the president later expanded the lawsuit, adding claims by U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, a Republican who narrowly won reelection in the state’s 1st Congressional District, and by Brad Zaun, a former Republican state senator from Urbandale, who lost his bid for reelection.
At the defendants’ request, the case was transferred to federal court. However, a legal dispute soon arose over whether federal court was the proper forum for the case given the fact that Miller-Meeks and Zaun, like the defendants, are based in Iowa.
On May 23, 2025, a federal judge denied Trump’s motion to remand the case from federal court back to state court. In that decision, the court allowed the president to file an appeal on the issue but also ordered Trump to file an amended complaint removing Miller-Meeks and Zaun from the case, eliminating any claims that were exclusive to the two Iowa-resident plaintiffs.

On May 23, 2025, the judge denied Trump’s motion to remand the case to state court. On June 2, 2025, lawyers for the president filed a petition for permission to appeal that decision, and the appeal itself was docketed that same day, according to court records.
Four weeks later, on June 30, 2025, Trump’s attorneys filed notice with the court that they were seeking to dismiss their federal lawsuit and, that day, they refiled the case in state court.
Lawyers for the Register objected, arguing that long-standing law bars litigants from dismissing a case they initiated “simply to avoid an adverse decision or seek a more favorable forum.”
The newspaper’s lawyers noted that in the federal case, Trump has lost his bid to have the case remanded to state court, lost his motion to stay the case, and been ordered to file a revised and amended complaint that conforms to the court’s orders.
The Register’s lawyers also argued the timing of the new state court lawsuit is “significant” in that it was filed just one day before Iowa’s Uniform Public Expression Protection Act, commonly known as an “anti-SLAPP law” that shields newspapers from baseless or frivolous claims, went into effect.
“This new legislation would apply to President Trump’s lawsuit,” the Register’s lawyers argued, calling the president’s actions an attempt to “escape the jurisdiction of the federal courts in time to restate his claims in Iowa’s state court without being subject to Iowa’s anti-SLAPP law.”
In response, lawyers for the president argued the “accusation of gamesmanship rings hollow” given the fact that the president first filed his case in state court only to see it see it moved to federal court at the newspaper’s urging. They also said the anti-SLAPP law isn’t applicable to their newly filed state case since it is based entirely on the lawsuit initially filed last December.
In ruling against the president on the dismissal of his federal case, Judge Ebinger noted that because Trump had not yet filed a motion to dismiss his June 2 appeal to the Eighth Circuit, she could “take no action that would affect the pending matter before the Eighth Circuit.” She stated that allowing the president to dismiss the underlying federal case would, for all practical purposes, “result in a dismissal of Trump’s appeal — which is procedurally improper.”

,New Jersey Monitor,2025-07-03 19:24:21+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,Advocates say New Jersey budget falls short of affordable housing needs,Morgan Leason,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/07/03/advocates-say-new-jersey-budget-falls-short-of-affordable-housing-needs/,Advocates are sounding the alarm over the new state budget they say undercuts funding for the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.,"Advocates say the budget state lawmakers approved Monday undercuts funding for affordable housing. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Advocates accused New Jersey lawmakers this week of underfunding affordable housing in the $58.8 billion annual budget they approved Monday.
The budget diverts money from the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, which supports the construction and preservation of housing for people earning at or below 80% of an area’s median income.
State officials anticipate collecting $130 million during the current fiscal year for the fund, but under the new budget will divert $125 million from affordable housing development and rehabilitation. That leaves just $5 million, which can only subsidize around 40 homes, according to the Housing and Community Development Network of New Jersey.
The diverted funds will instead be used for programs that help first-generation home buyers and rental assistance, which were separate budget items in previous years, according to the Fair Share Housing Center.
Staci Berger, the network’s president and CEO, said the diversion contradicts years of coordinated planning with developers and investment in housing projects.
“It is tone-deaf and irresponsible to use this money for anything other than its intended purpose,” Berger told the New Jersey Monitor. 
A Rutgers-Eagleton poll released in May found that New Jersey residents support using the trust fund for its original purpose and enacting legislation to lower housing costs. More than half of New Jerseyans said their housing costs aren’t affordable and are getting worse, the poll found.
Jag Davies is a spokesman for the Fair Share Housing Center.
“Affordable housing benefits everyone in New Jersey, not just the residents, and addresses so many other social and economic problems at the root,” Davies said.
The disinvestment comes at a critical time, as July 1 marked the start of New Jersey’s fourth round of affordable housing obligations that go through 2035, Davies noted. By law, every municipality must submit a plan for how it will meet its affordable housing obligations. 
New Jersey has an affordable housing shortage of nearly 290,000 fewer affordable homes, according to the network. 
People of color are disproportionately impacted, Berger said. New Jersey’s persistent racial wealth gap is nearly double its pre-pandemic levels, the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice found in an April report.
“White folks have just significantly more wealth due to the equity in their homes, and unless we change the homeownership dynamic and undo 400-plus years of systemic and institutional racism that has permeated our lending market and our housing system, we aren’t really going to tackle that wealth gap in a meaningful way,” Berger said.
Still, the final budget was not without wins for people who need affordable housing. 
Lawmakers passed legislation in both houses allowing the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency to distribute up to $100 million each year in tax credits to support the development or rehabilitation of affordable housing over coming years. The program does not replace the trust fund but will help, advocates say.

Advocates urged policymakers to support other proposals, some of which already are in the Statehouse pipeline, including: 

Raising the eviction filing fee as a deterrent for landlords and a revenue source to fund eviction prevention programs, such as emergency rental assistance.
Adding a surcharge on the sale of luxury homes.
Adding a luxury landlord fee that can be forgiven if the landlord provides affordable units with inclusionary zoning or caps rent increases.

“Legislators need to urgently prioritize protecting vulnerable tenants and facilitating affordable housing development,” Davies said. “Without enhanced tenant protections, New Jersey and other states around the country are going to see a massive wave of evictions in the coming months and years.”

Tim Fleming, a Covington Republican, has become the first candidate to launch a bid for secretary of state, seeking to replace Brad Raffensperger as Georgia’s top election official. “Yesterday, I took the necessary steps to formally begin preparing a campaign for Georgia Secretary of State,” Fleming wrote in a post on Facebook Thursday. […]","Republican Rep. Tim Fleming of Covington has become the first candidate to launch a bid for Georgia secretary of state in 2026. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderState Rep. Tim Fleming, a Covington Republican, has become the first candidate to launch a bid for secretary of state, seeking to replace Brad Raffensperger as Georgia’s top election official.
“Yesterday, I took the necessary steps to formally begin preparing a campaign for Georgia Secretary of State,” Fleming wrote in a post on Facebook Thursday.
“An official announcement will be made at the appropriate time, but in the meantime, I look forward to continuing meaningful conversations with Georgians across this great state about the challenges we face and the future we can build together with strong conservative leadership,” he added.
The secretary of state is responsible for overseeing elections across the state, granting business licenses for a variety of professions, and managing Georgia’s securities market. The role soared to new prominence after the 2020 presidential election, when Raffensperger, a Republican, resisted pressure from President Donald Trump to overturn Georgia’s election results in his favor. 
In the years since, the Republican-controlled state Legislature and State Election Board have sought to strip power from the office, removing Raffensperger from his former position as chair of the State Election Board before ousting him from the board altogether. The Georgia GOP has also imposed sanctions on Raffensperger, passing a resolution to ban him from qualifying as a Republican in future elections.

Raffensperger, who first became secretary of state in 2019, has not announced whether he intends to run again for the seat in 2026. But Fleming, a business owner and outspoken supporter of the president, may be positioning himself to be a more Trump-aligned alternative. Raffensperger beat a Trump-backed challenger in 2022. 
First elected to represent Georgia House District 114 in 2022, Fleming previously worked as Gov. Brian Kemp’s chief of staff. According to his campaign website, he also served as deputy secretary of state under Kemp, who was Georgia’s top election official from 2010 until 2018. 
Fleming has helped shape election policy in his brief time in the General Assembly. During his first term in the Legislature, he successfully passed House Bill 1207, a bill initially aimed at revising ballot proofing procedures for local superintendents. However, it was later amended to include language from Senate Bill 221, a controversial elections bill that failed to pass during the 2023 legislative session. Among other changes, the legislation required all election workers to be U.S. citizens, outlined protections for poll watchers and eliminated the requirement for polling places to maintain a ratio of one voting machine for every 250 voters. The governor signed HB 1207 into law in May 2024.
Earlier this year, Fleming also introduced a controversial election bill that would prohibit Georgia from sharing voter information with third-party groups like the Electronic Registration Information Center, limit voters’ ability to drop off absentee ballots on the final weekend before Election Day and expand poll-watching areas, among other provisions. The bill successfully passed through both chambers, but failed to gain final passage before the Legislature adjourned.
He was also appointed to lead this year’s House Blue-Ribbon Study Committee on Election Procedures, which is expected to evaluate Georgia’s current election policies and provide recommendations for new election laws ahead of Georgia’s 2026 legislative session. The study committee will hold its first meeting in Atlanta on July 15.

Don Bacon ultimately followed along.","There was no political surprise from the all-Republican Nebraska federal delegationLINCOLN — Republican leadership on the Hill successfully wrangled enough Senate and House Republicans, including the Nebraska federal delegation, into supporting President Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill.” 
The bill passed the U.S. House along party lines, 218-214, and will now be sent to the president to be signed into law. There was no political surprise from the all-Republican Nebraska federal delegation, who spent the week defending the GOP mega bill through national interviews on the Hill.
“We’re delivering on President Trump’s growth agenda,” Rep. Mike Flood, who represents eastern Nebraska’s 1st District, told Fox Business. “This is about growth.” 
The only two House Republicans to vote against the bill were Pennsylvania Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick and Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie.
Earlier this week, the GOP mega bill passed the Senate after an overnight session, with a tie-breaking vote by Vice President JD Vance. U.S. Sens. Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts have been interviewed about what they said is the importance of preserving Trump’s tax cuts. In a trend, Nebraska’s Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District Rep. Don Bacon vocally pushed back, expressing concerns about the Senate version of the bill’s proposed cuts to Medicaid, emphasizing that he had received reassurances the bill would not degrade the quality of healthcare for people covered by Medicaid. 
He even said he won’t support the Senate’s reconciliation bill if it cut the Medicaid provider tax rate. 
But in the end, he voted for it. Bacon defended his vote, like the rest of the delegation, by emphasizing the preservation of the Trump tax cuts. 
“I wish they had done the house … version,” Bacon told CNN, “But I have an opportunity to protect taxpayers … from a 20% tax increase.” 
BREAKING: US House passes massive tax break and spending cut bill, sending it to Trump

Rep. Adrian Smith, who represents Nebraska’s largely rural 3rd District, said on the House floor, “We’re stopping a tax increase on the average middle class household.” 
Trump and Republican leadership in Congress successfully made their self-imposed deadline of July 4 to get the “big beautiful bill” to the president’s desk. Now the delegation will try to sell the bill to Nebraskans, as multiple polls indicate that Trump’s signature piece of legislation is unpopular among Americans who are aware of it.
The bill would make tax cuts from the first Trump administration permanent, cementing most of its benefits for high earners. It also introduces some new temporary tax breaks for workers earning less, boosts funding for immigration enforcement, starts funding Trump’s “Golden Dome” missile defense program and accomplishes other goals from Trump’s domestic agenda.
To offset the cost of the mega bill, the plan is to reduce spending on the social safety net by adding work requirements for Medicaid and food stamps, and would lower provider taxes, a tax nearly every state uses to help fund Medicaid programs. 
Congressional experts have estimated that the package would add $3.253 trillion to the debt during the next decade. An analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office also estimates that 5.2 million adults would lose Medicaid coverage due to the stricter requirements, which are expected to save the federal government $280 billion over the next six years. 
The bill would require able-bodied people and working-aged individuals to show the government proof of employment to remain on the program every six months. For months, state lawmakers, left-leaning political advocacy organizations, medical professionals, activists and some everyday Nebraskans have expressed concerns about the “disastrous” consequences of the mega bill’s Medicaid cuts for healthcare access and to rural hospitals.
Trump’s mega bill includes $50 billion for rural hospitals as an attempt to offset Medicaid cuts, but according to KFF, a health research organization, analysis, those cuts could decrease Medicaid spending in rural areas by $155 billion over the next decade.  
In Nebraska, it’s estimated that the state would lose between $3 billion and $5 billion in Medicaid federal funding over the next 10 years, according to KKF. The director of the Nebraska Rural Health Association stated that six rural Nebraska hospitals would likely close as a result. 
A rural hospital in southwest Nebraska, Curtis Medical Center, has already announced plans to close in the coming months because of the anticipated Medicaid cuts. 
“Unfortunately, the current financial environment, driven by anticipated federal budget cuts to Medicaid, has made it impossible for us to continue operating all of our services, many of which have faced significant financial challenges for years,” Troy Bruntz, president and CEO of Community Hospital, said in a news release.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey lawmakers this week renewed state funding to protect access to reproductive health services in New Jersey, while private fundraising for abortion has soared — both trends abortion-rights advocates here hope will offset federal funding cuts Congress approved.
Legislators in Trenton passed a $58.8 billion budget Monday that contained $22.3 million for family planning care; staff recruitment, retention and training for reproductive health care providers; and security improvements and technology upgrades for abortion clinics, among other reproductive health care services.
While the budget contained other cuts and diversions that drove advocates and even some members of Gov. Phil Murphy’s cabinet to protest, lawmakers maintained the same level of state funding for reproductive health care as they’ve allocated in recent years, said Kaitlyn Wojtowicz, executive director of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund of New Jersey.
She applauded the support, calling reproductive health care “a fundamental right and a critical component of both public health and the state’s economic vitality.”
“With mounting attacks from a president and Congress who are hostile toward reproductive rights, threatening access to reproductive health care including abortion, we urge New Jersey elected officials to continue to prioritize reproductive health by working to offset future funding shortfalls resulting from federal attacks and by continuing to implement policies and programs that overcome barriers to accessing care,” Wojtowicz said.
The federal budget bill passed by the Senate Tuesday and the House Thursday prohibits federal Medicaid funding from going to large health care clinics that provide abortions, effectively defunding Planned Parenthood clinics.
The Hyde Amendment bars the use of federal funds for abortion with a few exceptions, but Planned Parenthood clinics rely heavily on Medicaid funding, not for abortions, but instead to provide standard reproductive health care at low to no cost, including contraception, treatment for sexually transmitted infections and cancer screenings.
The cuts, consequently, could jeopardize health care for 1.1 million patients and drive almost 200 Planned Parenthood clinics to close nationally, Wojtowicz said.
In New Jersey, Planned Parenthood staff see about 133,000 patients a year, and a third of them rely on Medicaid, she added.
“There will definitely be an impact in New Jersey,” she said.
The bill will “gut access to reproductive health care,” agreed Kelly Baden, vice president for public policy at the Guttmacher Institute.
“Medicaid is not a luxury — it’s a lifeline,” Baden said in a statement. “It ensures access to essential care, including sexual and reproductive health services, for millions of people. Slashing this program to finance tax cuts for the wealthy is not just wrong — it’s cruel.”
New Jersey’s Congressional delegation split on the bill along party lines, with Sens. Andy Kim and Cory Booker and the eight Democratic Congress members voting against it and Republican Reps. Jeff Van Drew, Tom Kean Jr., and Chris Smith voting in favor.
The bill now goes to President Donald Trump for his signature.
 Private funding up 
As threats to public funding for reproductive health care have grown, private fundraising for reproductive health services has risen.
The New Jersey Abortion Access Fund, a volunteer-run nonprofit that pays for abortions for women who can’t afford them, has seen its donations jump 61% in the past year, said Quadira Coles, the fund’s board president.
Donations have soared more than 900% since 2022, Coles added. That’s when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the constitutional right to abortion in a landmark ruling known as Dobbs, clearing the way for states to restrict or ban the procedure.
The fund gave out $39,000 to 145 patients in 2021, and by 2024, it helped 1,140 patients by funding $427,954 in care, Coles said.
Planned Parenthood also privately fundraises and has similarly seen a spike in support, Wotjowicz said.
“After Dobbs, there were a lot of supporters, volunteers, and donors who wanted to help, and one of the ways that the affiliates have been trying to funnel that energy is to patient assistance — helping patients get to New Jersey, providing them lodging when they’re here, or helping them have a hot meal while they’re traveling from Alabama or Louisiana,” Wotjowicz said.
In other states where abortion is restricted, some donors have stopped or scaled back their giving, fearing they could be held criminally or civilly liable for aiding and abetting abortion, Coles said.
That hasn’t happened in New Jersey — yet, she said.
New Jersey policymakers passed a law in 2022 barring the extradition of people involved in reproductive health services to other states that have restricted or criminalized abortion.
But abortion foes “are getting more creative” in their fight, Coles said.
“The more we do good, the more they find ways to attack our work,” she said.
Uncertainty persists because of the coming general election too, she added.
New Jersey voters will pick a new governor to replace Murphy, a term-limited Democrat who has codified abortion rights statewide. U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat who supports abortion rights, and former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, a Republican, are running to replace him. Ciattarelli has said he is “pro-choice … up to 20 weeks,” but Sherrill last week warned that Ciattarelli is a “Trump lackey” who would threaten women’s rights on multiple fronts.
“Whoever becomes the governor next could really change the abortion-access landscape here,” Coles said.

The Mississippi Department of Education on Tuesday disbanded the Mississippi Achievement School District, which consolidated the struggling school districts in 2019 into a single one under direct state supervision. 
The Legislature created the Mississippi Achievement School District in 2016 to target the lowest-performing schools in the state. Yazoo City and Humphreys County, both majority-Black and low-income areas, were the district’s inaugural school systems. 
But House Bill 1696 passed in 2024 — co-authored by Democratic Rep. Timaka James-Jones, who represents Humphreys — dissolved the Mississippi Achievement School District starting July 1, 2025. 

State Rep. Timaka James-Jones speaks during a press conference  at the Mississippi Capitol in Jackson, Miss., on Monday, April 14, 2025. Credit: Eric Shelton/Mississippi Today
Republican Rep. Kent McCarty of Lamar County, who authored the bill as vice-chair of the House Education Committee, said the legislation was aimed at giving districts more control.
“I hope the extra flexibility allows them to move toward more independence,” McCarty said Thursday. “Eventually, we’d love to see every district function independently without oversight from the department and make the improvements they need to be high-performing districts.”
But that doesn’t mean the districts are fully back to local control. They’ve just separated and become “districts of transformation” — a different, more widespread framework for low-performing schools to improve their student achievement. 
School systems can become districts of transformation if they consistently receive failing grades in the state’s accountability report card. Under that model, those districts have to develop and implement improvement plans. They get support from the state education department and are closely overseen by the agency. State takeovers can mean more teaching observations and frequent classroom visits from administrators. 
Since 1996, school districts have been taken over using the “district of transformation” model 23 times. Four districts currently operate under the model: Holmes, Noxubee, Humphreys County and Yazoo City.
Earl Watkins, who previously managed the Humphreys County and Yazoo City schools as superintendent of the achievement district, will take the helm of the Yazoo City school district, while Stanley Ellis will lead the Humphrey County district. 
The two superintendents will still answer directly to the state Board of Education.
That’ll be the case for at least one more year — both Yazoo City and Humphreys County received “C” marks on their state report card this past school year, so if they receive “C” grades this year, they still need one more consecutive year of that grade or higher to regain local control. 
“With the scores we have, we’re well on the way to the next steps,” James-Jones said. “It really does boost the pride of our community and we have this united goal now. We’re looking forward to our students getting everything that they need to be successful.”
Humphreys, which received a “D” rating during the 2023-2024 school year, made a “C” by two points.
The growth was largely due to higher scores among the bottom 25% of 3rd to 8th grade students in math and English. Both English and math test scores are given extra weight along with any improvements made by students in the bottom 25%.
Yazoo City raised its grade from an “F” through similar means, with math students in the bottom 25% showing more growth from last year. 
Tenashe White, who teaches 8th grade math in Humphreys, gives credit foremost to her students. But she also acknowledges the help of educational consultants and her fellow teachers who helped plan activities that helped students master math standards through play.
“We threw math bowls, science bowls, spelling competitions to kind of open it up more so they can have some fun but also perform on the tests,” White said. “We had different incentives like ice cream socials.”
Ellis started as the Humphreys superintendent Tuesday. He said anyone who’s not focused on teaching and learning will find themselves “out of place” at the district. 
“Our motto is, ‘New day, new direction,’” he said. “This is our opportunity to get a new start.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/03134307/IMG_6508.jpeg,,,2025-07-03 15:10:25.957849

She decided to speak publicly about the amicable end of her marriage because of inquiries about the status of her relationship with retired physician Ted Daughety.
Kelly, 75, said the pair remained on friendly terms before and after the divorce was finalized in October. They were married in 1979 and have two adult daughters.
“Throughout my time in public office, I’ve always guarded my family’s privacy. It’s been my policy to keep my personal life separate from my public one to the extent possible,” Kelly said.
She said it had “come to my attention that my marital status has become a topic of some speculation, so I will share that Ted and I divorced in October of 2024.”
“It was amicable and mutual, and we both continue to share in the lives of our family,” the governor said.
The Democratic governor’s brief statement Thursday was the first official confirmation of a split. The governor resides at the Topeka residence for Kansas governors known as Cedar Crest. Her family home in the Potwin neighborhood of central Topeka has been sold.
In a statement, Daughety said that “Laura and I made this decision together, based on what worked best for us and for our family.”
Kelly was elected to the Kansas Senate to represent a Topeka-area district in 2005 and remained in that job for nearly 15 years. She was elected governor in 2018 and reelected in 2022.
Daughety was a pulmonary and sleep disorder specialist who practiced medicine for decades in Kansas.

The vote came after significant delays and the arm-twisting of holdouts, but Republicans got it done before their self-imposed deadline of July 4.
The House voted 218-214 largely along party lines, with only two Republicans opposed and all five Democratic members of Connecticut’s congressional delegation voting against it. Major divisions held up the bill Wednesday, with a bloc of Republicans raising concerns about the changes made by the Senate and wanting it to look like the original House bill. Leadership held a procedural vote open for multiple hours as they worked to get enough support, making it the longest vote in the history of the lower chamber.
A subsequent procedural vote to move to final passage also stalled late Wednesday and into the early morning. But Congress finished the monthslong process of crafting and passing a bill through budget reconciliation. This allows them to bypass filibusters in the Senate and pass certain kinds of bills without relying on votes from Democrats. And Republicans ultimately met their goal of getting a bill to Trump’s desk before the holiday.
“Some of us have literally been up for days now, but this day is a hugely important one in the history of our nation,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said just before the final vote.
“Today for us was about results. Democrats deliver performances and Republicans deliver results,” he added, referencing the House Democratic leader’s speech railing against the bill that broke the record for longest floor speech. “We’re going to deliver what we were sent here to do and every American will benefit from it.” 
Trump is expected to sign the bill on Friday.
The House initially passed its own version of the sweeping bill in late May, but it inevitably faced major changes as it made its way over to the Senate. On Tuesday, the Senate narrowly advanced its own legislation, with Vice President JD Vance breaking the tie and casting the deciding vote. The House needed to take another vote on the Senate-amended version before it fully cleared Congress and could get signed into law.
With Republicans in full control of Congress and the White House, Democrats were left out of the mix and with no negotiating power. But they sought to delay procedural votes on the bill, a symbolic move to show their support for Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps. 
And as they were winding down Thursday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., spoke for nearly nine hours before the final vote and read stories of people across the U.S. who rely on different government services that are at risk. That delayed the vote until midafternoon.
And on Wednesday, more than 100 members — including U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District — spent nearly an hour making unanimous consent requests to amend the rule on the bill.
“Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to amend the rule to make an order the amendment at the desk that protects against any cuts to Medicaid and SNAP,” Hayes and other lawmakers said as they went one by one to make the request on the House floor. Republicans objected to each request.
States and their finances will likely take some of the biggest hits as they account for new changes and shifts in funding for social services. That could end up having a ripple effect on how their residents qualify for certain programs like Medicaid and SNAP or reduce benefits.
“This bill is going to have devastating impacts on millions of Americans for years to come and was passed for the sole purpose of giving tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires,” said Gov. Ned Lamont, in a statement. “It will amount to a massive income transfer from the poorest and most vulnerable Americans to the wealthiest. Not only does this plan bankrupt the federal government, but it slashes critical safety net programs, particularly Medicaid and SNAP, that so many hard-working American families need for their health and survival.”
Connecticut officials said they are monitoring what the federal bill means for the state and the services it provides, particularly surrounding health care.
“I’d like [Connecticut residents] to know that we are incredibly vigilant around this,” Connecticut Department of Social Services Commissioner Andrea Barton Reeves said in an interview with The Connecticut Mirror Thursday.
“Many of us doing this work are not sleeping because we’re extraordinarily concerned about people falling off the rolls and being without health care,” she added. The state is “trying to do all that we can to try to preserve as much coverage under the new federal rules as we possibly can and we will help them navigate the changes.”
Lamont said his administration is “dedicated to doing what we can do mitigate some of the impact of what this bill will cause, but with a federal administration insistent on eliminating critical safety nets it is going to be nearly impossible for any state to backfill the billions in federal cuts we are going to face.”
He said he would be meeting with state lawmakers to analyze the bill and determine its impact on the state budget.
Democrats argue the bill will disproportionately benefit wealthier Americans and big corporations, balloon the national debt and cut critical services. And they have been highlighting the painstakingly long votes and tight margins in both chambers to show that even some Republicans are skeptical about the bill.

At a Congressional Black Caucus press conference Wednesday, Hayes argued the provisions in the bill are “direct attacks on our youngest generation” based on the implications it has on education and SNAP.
And she said it could further hurt communities that are disproportionately affected by food insecurity. She noted that nearly 27% of Black families are SNAP recipients.
Cuts to SNAP could also have additional implications for kids beyond the home. She said that if children no longer get SNAP benefits, that could also result in them losing access to free or reduced-price lunches at school since schools get reimbursed for serving meals to eligible students. Kids on SNAP automatically qualify for such meals.
“We can afford to feed children in the United States of America and even more, we can afford to educate children in the United States of America,” Hayes said. “Republicans are not just cutting budgets, they’re cutting futures.”
The bill seeks to extend the tax breaks in the 2017 tax law that passed during Trump’s first term and will expire at the end of the year. It would also steer billions of dollars in immigration funding, including money for a border wall and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. And it would phase out clean energy tax credits passed during the Biden administration related to electric vehicles and consumer tax credits.
The legislation would make many of the tax breaks permanent from 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including lower income tax rates. A number of tax provisions were amended or narrowed in the Senate bill.
The bill raises the $10,000 threshold on deductions for state and local taxes, or SALT, to $40,000, which would get phased out for those who make over $500,000. It raises the cap through 2029, which would return to the current threshold after that.
If the cap increases, it would be especially beneficial for higher cost-of-living states like Connecticut. In 2022, state taxpayers had the highest average SALT deduction, around $9,100, just under the current $10,000 cap, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. That year, 11% of the state’s returns claimed SALT, one of the highest rates in the U.S.
Other tax provisions would permanently raise the child tax credit from $2,000 to $2,200 starting in 2026, with one parent who needs to have a Social Security number to claim it. Some workers would be able to deduct overtime pay or tips from their federal income tax, but those tax breaks would expire at the end of 2028. And seniors who are 65 and older with low to middle incomes would be able to make an additional $6,000 deduction for the next few years.
To pay for these tax provisions, the bill includes steep spending cuts, which would have a direct impact on some safety net programs and state finances.
To qualify for Medicaid as an adult between 19 and 64, a recipient would need to work or participate in training, education or community service at least 80 hours a month, though there are some exemptions. States will need to check on eligibility more often.
Work requirements will also apply to adults with children who are 14 years and older. It also adds a provision that blocks Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood for one year. Federal law already prohibits funding going toward abortions with a few exceptions, but it could threaten other services those clinics provide like cancer screenings, birth control and other types of routine care.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes and scores federal legislation, estimated that about 138,000 people could lose Medicaid coverage in Connecticut, with the higher end of enrollment loss up to 172,000. That estimate is based off of the House version of the bill.
On SNAP benefits, more older Americans will need to work or train at least 80 hours a month. The bill raises the age limit for able-bodied adults without dependents from 54 to 64. It also changes the age of a dependent regarding SNAP. Now, able-bodied adults with children 14 and older will fall under the new work requirement.
States like Connecticut would need to pay a portion of SNAP benefits for the first time in the program’s history as well as take on more of the administrative costs. That has raised concerns about potential benefit cuts if states cannot fill in the gap.

Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer.Nurses in the Twin Cities said Thursday they called off a strike planned for next week after reaching a tentative deal with hospitals over accusations of unfair labor practices, including hospitals allegedly failing to negotiate in good faith.
But nurses and other health care providers in the Duluth area still plan to go on strike starting Tuesday, according to the Minnesota Nurses Association. 
Union leaders have said since bargaining began in March that increasing nurse staffing levels statewide was their No. 1 priority. They said this would ensure better care for patients, decrease burnout, and lessen violence against health care workers.
Striking, the union said, was the tool to force hospitals to negotiate in good faith. The Minnesota Nurses Association said in a press release Thursday that nurses resolved the unfair labor practice as part of the agreement they reached. 
“Nurses have always said this fight isn’t just about contracts, it’s about safe care,” association President Chris Rubesch said in the release. “We’ve been fighting an uphill battle. The campaign may be over for now in the Metro, but the fight for safe staffing and patient care is far from over.”
Nurses and employers in the Twin Cities were negotiating into the early hours of the morning Thursday, the union said. The agreement they reached includes a 10% raise over three years, language to put Minnesota’s break law into place and provisions on workplace violence. 
The hospital systems that reached a tentative agreement include Allina Health, Children’s Minnesota, M Health Fairview, Health Partners and North Memorial Health, according to the union. 
The Twin Cities Hospitals Group and Minnesota Hospital Association, which include hospitals involved in negotiations, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The negotiations come as Congress debates the GOP budget bill that would significantly cut Medicaid, a joint federal and state-funded program that pays medical providers for their care. 
Over 1.2 million Minnesotans receive health care through Medicaid, known as Medical Assistance in Minnesota, and the congressional cuts would impact people’s health care coverage or their ability to access care. Many of Minnesota’s rural hospitals see a high rate of Medicaid patients, and their costs could increase if they don’t receive government compensation for the care they offer.
Although Twin Cities nurses have reached a tentative agreement, members will still need to vote on their final contract. Nurses and advanced practice providers in Duluth are set to move forward with their unfair labor practices strike on July 8 and July 10, respectively.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/P1094691-copy-1024x746.jpg,,,2025-07-03 15:10:25.957849

(Courtesy New Mexico Department of Game and Fish)A bill introduced Monday, proposing to strip endangered species protections from Mexican gray wolves would mean “unrecoverable losses” for the Southwestern wolves, wildlife advocates said.
Arizona Republican U.S. Rep. Paul Gosar’s bill, “Enhancing Safety for Animals Act,” would remove the wolf from the federal list of endangered species and end U.S. population restoration efforts in Mexico. Gosar’s office issued a news release saying “significant attacks by wolves on cattle, elk, moose, and sheep have occurred and have negatively impacted hunters and ranchers throughout Arizona.”
Delisting would also end federal investigation into wolf predation on livestock and reduce federal funding for livestock losses, Michelle Lute, executive director for Wildlife for All, told Source NM, and would further erode recovery programs.
“Stripping federal protections for Mexican gray wolves would invite another extinction,” Lute said. “This is not alarmist, this is what we’re already seeing.”
Mexican gray wolves once lived throughout the mountains and deserts of New Mexico, Arizona and Mexico, but were driven to near-extinction by the 1970s due to years of eradication to keep them from preying on cattle.
Outlook for Mexican gray wolf still positive, despite recent death

Two years after the passage of the Endangered Species Act, U.S. Fish and Wildlife added the Mexican gray wolf to the list, garnering federal protections. Officials captured the seven remaining wild wolves, and bred them back from extinction. Federal wildlife officials reintroduced the wolves in Arizona and New Mexico in 1998. Today, the national wild population is 286 animals. Reintroduction in Mexico occurred in 2011.
Tensions over the wolf introduction program have escalated in New Mexico, culminating in Catron and Sierra county boards issuing disaster declarations in resolutions earlier this year and asking state officials to step in, end federal wolf releases into the wild and kill wolves that prey on livestock.
Federal delisting would remove federal prohibitions on killing wolves, said Michael Robinson, senior conservation advocate at the Center for Biological Diversity.
“Bypassing the Endangered Species Act to strip all protections from beleaguered Mexican gray wolves and leave them vulnerable to Arizona’s shoot-on-sight laws would cause a massacre,” Robinson said in a statement. “The Southwest’s ecology would suffer, and we’d be left with a sadder, drabber landscape if Gosar and the livestock industry’s cruel vision for wolf extermination becomes law.”

,DC,2025-07-03 18:47:37+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"How the megabill allows Trump to expand mass deportations, curb immigrant benefits",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/how-megabill-allows-trump-expand-mass-deportations-curb-immigrant-benefits,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending cut bill cleared early Thursday has as its centerpiece $170 billion for the administration's immigration crackdown, helping fulfill the president’s 2024 campaign promise of mass deportations of people without permanent legal status.The measure, passed by the House 218-214, would fulfil several of Trump’s key immigration priorities, such as bolstering border security, increasing immigration detention capacity and adding fees to legal pathways for immigration, among other things. Thousands more Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers are slated to be hired.While most of the immigration-related provisions in the massive bill would vastly expand immigration enforcement, it also aims to limit benefits currently extended to some immigrants with legal status.Immigrants with a lawful status, including asylum, under the bill would be ineligible to receive food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Immigrants without legal status or authorization to be in the country are already ineligible for SNAP benefits, which roughly 42 million people rely on.The bill could also cut off tax benefits from mixed-status families, in which family members have different immigration statuses.For example, while Republicans would raise the child tax credit to $2,200 per eligible child, the bill would exclude that benefit to U.S. citizen children who are born to immigrant parents without legal status. The proposal would require that the parent applying for the child tax credit also have a Social Security number.The 870-page megabill was passed by the Senate 51-50 on Tuesday, with Vice President JD Vance casting a tie-breaking vote.Here’s an overview of what else the bill will do:Immigration enforcementThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the country, at nearly $30 billion through September 2029.Those funds would go toward hiring 10,000 ICE officers within five years. The money would also pay for retention bonuses, transportation of immigrants, upgrades of ICE facilities, detainment of families, and the hiring of ICE immigration lawyers for enforcement and removal proceedings in immigration court.An ICE signing bonus would be given to those hired after the bill is signed into law, and as a retention bonus if an ICE agent has five years of service specifically dealing with immigration enforcement. The bill does not specify how much a signing bonus or retention bonus should be.The Senate’s version provides ICE with added flexibility in which areas to allocate the nearly $30 billion.DOD fundingSeparately from ICE, the bill would include $1 billion for the Department of Defense to deploy military personnel for border-related operations, construction and temporary detention on military installations.Trump in April directed several agencies to start militarizing a stretch of the southern border as he continues to intertwine the U.S. military with his administration’s immigration crackdown.Created was a military buffer zone along the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona, California and New Mexico. It means that any migrant crossing into the United States would be trespassing on a military base, and therefore allows active-duty troops to hold them until U.S. Border Patrol agents arrive.National and military experts have raised concerns that militarizing that strip of land could violate the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law that generally prohibits the military from being used in domestic law enforcement.Additionally, the Trump administration last month deployed 4,000 National Guard members and 700 Marines to Los Angeles, amid major protests that arose after immigration agents began targeting day laborers at Home Depots for immigration enforcement.DetentionThe bill sets aside $45 billion for building new centers to detain immigrants, from single individuals to families. It’s a more than 300% increase from ICE’s fiscal year 2024 budget for detaining immigrants, which was about $9 billion. Building new detention centers takes time, so private prison companies such as CoreCivic and GEO Group are likely to enter into more contracts with ICE.Those companies have begun expanding detention capacity. CoreCivic last month acquired a 736-bed facility in Virginia and GEO this month purchased a 770-bed facility in western California.Border securityThe bill would allocate $46.6 billion for U.S. Customs and Border Protection to construct a wall along the U.S. Mexico border, as well as make any repairs. That would be more than three times what the first Trump administration spent on barriers at the southern border, at roughly $15 billion.Some of the technology that would be added on the border includes cameras, lights, sensors, and other detection improvements. The funds would be used beginning in fiscal year 2025 until Sept. 30, 2029.Another $4.1 billion would go toward hiring CBP personnel, until the end of September 2029. Another $2 billion would go toward retention and bonuses for CBP personnel.The bill would also set aside $855 million for the repair of vehicles that CBP officers use. Republicans included $5 billion for upgrades and repairs at CBP facilities.Additionally, $6.1 billion would go toward buying nonintrusive equipment to detect illicit narcotics at ports of entry along the southwest, northern and maritime borders.Also, any immigrant without legal authorization and who is apprehended at a port of entry would be subject to a $5,000 fine.There is currently a civil fine ranging from $50 to $250. Asylum-seekers typically surrender themselves at ports of entry.Legal immigration pathways, application feesThe bill would give the Department of Justice roughly $3.3 billion for the Executive Office for Immigration Review to prosecute immigration matters, such as noncitizen voting – something that is extremely rare – and violations of the Alien Registration Act.In April, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem announced that immigrants in the country without legal authorization were required to register with the agency or face jail time and a fine of up to $5,000.The bill would also provide funding for the hiring of immigration judges, but will cap the number of judges at 800. There are roughly 700 now, amid a 3.5 million case backlog in immigration court, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC.The bill would also overhaul immigration fees and application fees for immigrants seeking legal pathways, both permanent and temporary.For the first time, there would be a fee to apply for asylum, set at $100. There are no fee waivers for nearly every new fee set or increased by the bill, except for applications dealing with unaccompanied minors. All fees would also be subject to adjustment for inflation. Asylum-seekers who want to apply for initial work permits would also have to pay another fee of $550, something that is currently free.For an asylum applicant wanting to renew work permits, the bill would lower the cost to $275, where it is currently $470 to renew online and $520 to mail in the paperwork.For immigrants on Temporary Protected Status, meaning the DHS secretary has deemed the immigrant's home country too dangerous to return to, the fee to apply would be $500. It’s currently $50.The fee to apply for humanitarian relief would increase to $1,000, where it is currently $630.The bill would slightly increase the initial work application fee for TPS holders and those with humanitarian status to $550, up from a $470 fee for submitting online and $520 to mail in the paperwork.To renew those work permits, the bill would lower the cost to $275, down from $470 for online and $520 for mail.The nonimmigrant visa, which is currently free and handled by the State Department, would now cost $250 under the bill. This visa is typically used for international students, agricultural workers and other special skilled immigrant labor.Unaccompanied immigrant childrenSome of the $2 billion in funding for DHS would go toward removing unaccompanied children under certain circumstances. That includes if the child is found by a port of entry, is not a victim of human trafficking, and does not fear returning to their home country.The bill would also provide a $300 million fund for the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which handles unaccompanied children, to conduct background checks and home studies on any potential sponsor of an unaccompanied child.There would also be funding to check children in ORR custody for their potential criminal and gang history. Those 12 and older would be subject to examinations “for gang-related tattoos and other gang-related markings,” according to the bill.The special juvenile immigrant visa, which is for immigrant children who are either abandoned or abused by a parent, and allows them to apply for lawful permanent resident status, would now cost $250 under the bill, but the fee could be waived. It’s currently free.State grants, World Cup and OlympicsThe bill would also give some states $450 million for the Operation Stonegarden Grant Program, which gives funding to states and local governments that participate in border enforcement.The bill would help states that are hosting major sporting events such as the World Cup in 2026 and the Olympics in 2028.The bill allocates $625 million for security and other costs related to the FIFA World Cup and $1 billion for security and planning costs for the Olympics, which Los Angeles is hosting in 2028.",,,,2025-07-03 16:10:47.138746

Leading the appointments as the city’s interim chief administrative officer, Pieter Teeuwissen, a former Hinds County Court Judge who served as city attorney under former mayors Harvey Johnson and Frank Melton. 
The chief administrative officer is a vital position in Jackson City Hall as Teeuwissen will essentially serve as the deputy mayor, with most of the city’s departments reporting to him. So far, Teeuwissen said the job has mostly entailed a lot of reading in preparation for the city’s intensive budget process. 
“How do we craft a budget with audits that are now three years old?” Teeuwissen said, referring to the city’s failure to complete timely audits in recent years. “That would be the issue, and if you ask me next Monday, that’s gonna be the issue. Next Tuesday, next Wednesday, until we get a budget done.”
Willie Bozeman, Horhn’s campaign manager, will serve as interim chief of staff. Horhn’s appointments can serve in an interim capacity for 90 days, and Horhn must put their name on the agenda to be confirmed by the Jackson City Council before that time period is up.

Other new faces in the administration include: 

ReSean Thomas, a former leader of the firefighters union who helped secure pay raises in recent years, will serve as interim fire chief;
Von Anderson, who oversaw communications for Horhn’s transition team after serving as the chief commercial officer for the Jackson Municipal Airport Authority, will be the interim director of planning and development;
Grace Fisher, a former communications director at the Mississippi Department of Corrections and editor at the Clarion Ledger, will serve as interim communications director;
Pearlean Campbell, former victim services director at MDOC, will serve as interim constituent services director;
Nathan Slater, a local technology consultant, will oversee the IT department;
and Jamal Sibley, a staff on the Horhn campaign, will serve as interim special assistant to the mayor. 

Slater has already started working on the city’s website and said he hopes to roll out a new one within 30 days. 
Of the directors Horhn has retained from former Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba’s leadership team, the most notable is Fidelis Malembeka, the chief financial officer. 
Other holdovers include City Attorney Drew Martin, Municipal Clerk Angela Harris, Police Chief Joe Wade, and Director of Human Resources, Toya Martin.

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Education’s decision this week to hold back $6.8 billion in federal K-12 funds next year has triggered alarm among state education officials, school leaders and advocacy groups nationwide over how the lack of funds will affect their after-school, enrichment and language-learning services.
The Trump administration’s decision to freeze the funding has put states in “triage mode” as they scramble to decide what programs may be cut without that funding, said Mary Kusler, senior director for the Center for Advocacy at the National Education Association. The money was approved by Congress to support education for English language learners, migrants, low-income children and adults learning to read, among others.
As of July 1, school systems are unable to draw down funding, jeopardizing summer programs, hiring and early-year planning for the 2025–26 school year.
The funding freeze affects several core programs: Title II-A (educator training and recruitment), Title III-A (English learner support), Title IV-A (student enrichment and after-school), as well as migrant education and adult education and literacy grants. Trump has proposed eliminating all those programs in his proposed budget for next fiscal year, but that proposal hasn’t gone through Congress.
State superintendents sent out missives to school districts early this week and now are scrambling to make choices. 
“This is not about political philosophy, this is about reliability and consistency,” Alabama state Superintendent Eric Mackey said to Politico this week. “None of us were worrying about this.”
The administration says it is reviewing the programs.
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the U.S. Department of Education wrote to states in its announcement Monday. 
Trump administration tells states it’s freezing $6.8 billion for K-12 school programs

Historically, the department releases allocations by July 1 to ensure schools can budget and plan effectively for the coming school year. Withholding the money could result in canceled programs, hiring freezes and the loss of essential support for English learners, migrant children and other high-need populations, education and state officials told Stateline.
“America’s public school leaders run district budgets that are dependent on a complex partnership between federal, state, and local funding,” said David R. Schuler, executive director of the School Superintendents Association in a statement. “For decades, school districts have relied on timely confirmation of their federal allocations ahead of the July 1 start of the fiscal year — ensuring stability, allowing for responsible planning, and supporting uninterrupted educational services for students.” 
The states facing the largest withheld amounts include California ($810.7 million), Texas ($660.9 million), and New York ($411.7 million), according to data from the NEA and the Learning Policy Institute, an education think tank. 
For 17 states and territories, the freeze affects over 15% of their total federal K-12 allocations, according to the Learning Policy Institute. For smaller jurisdictions such as the District of Columbia and Vermont, the disruption hits even harder: More than 20% of their federal K-12 budgets remain inaccessible.
Colorado Education Commissioner Susan Córdova urged school districts to begin contingency planning in case funds are not released before the federal fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. California State Superintendent Tony Thurmond hinted at possible legal action, which has become a trend as states fight the second Trump administration’s funding revocations or delays.
“California will continue to pursue all available legal remedies to the Trump Administration’s unlawful withholding of federal funds appropriated by Congress,” Thurmond said in a statement.
The NEA and the NAACP have filed for a preliminary injunction, calling the administration’s delay an illegal “impoundment” — a violation of the federal Impoundment Control Act, which bars the executive branch from withholding appropriated funds without congressional approval.
Education advocates warn the recent decision by the Trump administration to withhold funding reflects a broader pattern of federal disengagement from public education.
Community nonprofits said the withholding could devastate their programming too. The Boys and Girls Clubs of America could have to close more than 900 centers — bringing the loss of 5,900 jobs and affecting more than 220,000 children, said President and CEO Jim Clark in a statement.
The 1974 Impoundment Control Act lets the president propose canceling funds approved by Congress. Lawmakers have 45 days to approve the request; if they don’t, it’s denied. Meanwhile, agencies can be directed not to spend the funds during that time. 
A White House statement shared with States Newsroom this week said “initial findings have shown that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.” 
“Kids, educators, and working families are the ones losing,” said Kusler, of the NEA. “We need governors and communities to step up — now.”

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)TOPEKA — President Trump’s spending and tax cut bill, which will add billions to the country’s budget, generated a tidal wave of predictions about the effects on vulnerable Kansans.
In her role leading the Democratic Governors Association, Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly said states cannot make up the financial losses from the “disastrous budget” in H.R. 1, which the president refers to as “one, big beautiful bill.” The House passed the measure on Thursday, sending it to the president for his signature.
“While Washington Republicans continue to talk about ‘cost shifts,’ Democratic governors have been clear that it will be impossible for states to respond to such massive cuts by backfilling with state resources,” Kelly said. “We cannot gut health care or let children go hungry in the name of giving tax breaks to the wealthy.”
The bill was passed by the Senate on Wednesday, with Kansas Sens. Roger Marshall and Jerry Moran voting in favor.
In the House, Kansas Rep. Sharice Davids, a Democrat, was the sole vote from the Sunflower State against the bill, with Republican Reps. Tracey Mann, Ron Estes and Derek Schmidt voting to pass.
Kansas stands to see costs for its Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program increase by at least $15 million, said Erin La Row, spokeswoman for the Kansas Department for Children and Families.
That’s what it will cost Kansas to make up its share of administrative costs. The match is currently 50/50 and the bill increases that to a 75/25 split, La Row said. In federal fiscal year 2025, Kansas paid just more than $30 million for its share, and that would increase to about $45 million.
Kansas would take an even larger financial hit in the state-federal cost share for SNAP benefits.
The bill penalizes states that have larger than acceptable error rates in processing SNAP benefits. Kansas had an error rate in 2023 of 12%. La Row said its 2024 rate dropped to 9.98%, which puts the state in a category to cost-share 10% of the $413 million in SNAP benefits that were issued.
“The state would have to cost share just over $41 million (10%) under the Senate version,” La Row said in an email. “These changes would become effective Oct. 1, 2027.”
If Kansas lowers its error rate to 5% or less, the bill drops cost-sharing to zero. 
Kansas House Speaker Dan Hawkins said in a news release that Gov. Laura Kelly was “fearmongering” about possible budget effects. He referred to the 2023 error rate of 12% as the highest in the region and said Kelly and DCF failed to comply with federal demands to improve efficiency.
“If Governor Kelly truly wants to avoid a hole in the state budget, she needs to stop pointing fingers at the Trump Administration and focus on her own Administration’s repeated failure to effectively manage the SNAP program,” Hawkins said. “A 12% error rate is unacceptable. Hard stop.”
The solution is to drop the error rate to 5% or below, he said, and the state budget won’t be affected.
 
Medicaid costs
Kansans also can expect to see Medicaid cuts that will jeopardize Kansas hospitals and nursing homes, according to reports by the United Methodist Health Ministry Fund and the REACH Healthcare Foundation. 
Kansas stands to lose nearly $3.9 billion in Medicaid funding, with Kansas hospitals standing to lose as much as $2.65 billion in funding over 10 years, the two organizations said in a news release.
A report from the National Rural Health Association and Manatt Health, released Tuesday, found that rural hospitals will lose 21 cents out of every dollar they receive for funding Medicaid, the joint state and federal public health insurance program that serves more than 360,000 Kansans.
Cindy Samuelson, spokeswoman for the Kansas Hospital Association, said Medicaid covers nearly one-third of all births in Kansas and cares for nearly two-thirds of all nursing home residents statewide.
“Kansas hospitals rely on Medicaid reimbursement, which accounts for 15% of inpatient days on average,” she said. “Most Medicaid spending in Kansas supports the elderly and disabled, meaning cuts would impact those who need care the most.”
Reduced Medicaid funding translates to uninsured Kansans, which Samuelson said would drive up costs of uncompensated care, which shifts those costs to businesses and private insurance payers. Sixty-seven percent of Kansas hospitals are operating in the red, she said.
In a nod to the impact Medicaid cuts would have on rural hospitals, the Senate included a $50 billion rural hospital fund in its bill, but that’s not enough, said David Jordan, president and CEO of the United Methodist Health Ministry Fund. In a research brief, Jordan’s organization said Kansas rural hospitals would receive about $811 million from that fund.
“It will not offset the billions of dollars that Kansas and Kansas hospitals lose from the bill,” he said. “As you know, Kansas has more financially vulnerable hospitals than any other state in the country and the average hospital in Kansas is operating with a -9.9% average. Our hospitals cannot afford to absorb billions of dollars in Medicaid cuts without cutting services and/or possibly closing their doors.”
 
No ‘common sense’
Statements about the spending bill flowed throughout the week, challenging House representatives to make changes, which didn’t happen.
“At a time when families are struggling to make ends meet, they just voted on a bill that, along with the tariffs, will make things even worse by stoking inflation and raising interest rates,” said Kansas Sen. Cindy Holscher, who is running for governor, after the Senate vote. “Nothing about this bill says ‘common sense,’ and everything about it says ‘extremism.’ ”
Julie Govert Walter, executive director of the North Central-Flint Hills Area Agency on Aging, last week listed seven concerns in a letter to the editor about the bill’s effects on older adults, caregivers and people with disabilities.
“These proposed large cuts to the Medicaid program will have a significant impact on our state’s ability to continue these essential (home and community-based) services over time,” she said. “You cannot bleed a system this significantly and expect all of it to remain healthy.”
Among the seven issues she addressed was expected closures of rural hospitals and clinics as a result of funding cuts to Medicaid. 
“Not having available health care will speed the economic deterioration of vulnerable Kansas communities and adversely affect the tax bases of counties and cities dependent on a stable population,” Govert Walter said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/protestersjuly22025-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-07-03 15:10:25.957849

If voters oppose Republicans at the ballot box in return, it could mean the GOP loses the House during next year’s midterm elections.In the end just two Republicans in the House and three in the Senate opposed the measure, which the Senate approved earlier in the week with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote.Trump posted on social media numerous times in the days leading up to the vote, thanking supportive Republicans who were praising the bill during interviews and threatening to back primary challenges against GOP lawmakers who stood in the way of passage.“Largest Tax Cuts in History and a Booming Economy vs. Biggest Tax Increase in History, and a Failed Economy,” Trump posted just after midnight when it wasn’t yet clear the bill would pass. “What are the Republicans waiting for??? What are you trying to prove??? MAGA IS NOT HAPPY, AND IT’S COSTING YOU VOTES!!!”Johnson said during a floor speech the legislation is a direct result of the November elections, when voters gave the GOP control of the House, Senate and the White House.“That election was decisive. It was a bellwether. It was a time for choosing,” Johnson said. “And I tell you what — the American people chose, overwhelmingly, they chose the Republican Party.”

The package, he said, would make the country “stronger, safer and more prosperous than ever before.”“We've had spirited debates, we've had months of deliberation and now we are finally ready to fulfill our promise to the American people,” Johnson said.Republicans were spurred to write the tax provisions in the legislation to avoid a cliff at the end of the year, created by the party’s 2017 tax law. But the legislation holds dozens of other provisions as well, spanning border security, defense, energy production, health care and higher education aid.The bill raises the country’s debt limit by $5 trillion, a staggering figure that many fiscal hawks would have once balked at, but is enough to get Republicans past the midterm elections before they’ll have to negotiate another deal to raise the country’s borrowing limit.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office’s latest analysis of the measure projects it would add $3.4 trillion to deficits during the next decade compared to current law.Jeffries: “It guts Medicaid’House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., called the health care provisions “reckless” during a speech that lasted nearly nine hours, forcing the vote to take place in the afternoon rather than early morning, and said the “bill represents the largest cut to health care in American history.”

“Almost $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid,” Jeffries said. “This runs directly contrary to what President Trump indicated in January, which was that he was going to love and cherish Medicaid. Nothing about this bill loves and cherishes Medicaid. It guts Medicaid.”The speech broke the eight-hour-and-32-minute record that then-Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., set in 2021 when he sought to delay Democrats from passing a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package. House leaders are allowed to exceed normal speaking limits through a privilege called the “magic minute.”The nonpartisan health research organization KFF’s analysis of the package shows it would reduce federal spending on Medicaid by nearly $1 trillion during the next decade and lead to 11.8 million people becoming uninsured.Republicans made numerous changes to the state-federal health program for lower income people and some people with disabilities, including a requirement that some enrollees work, participate in community service, or attend an educational program for at least 80 hours a month.Medicaid patients will no longer be able to have their care covered at Planned Parenthood for routine appointments, like annual physicals and cancer screenings, for one year. Congress has barred federal taxpayer dollars from going to abortions with limited exceptions for decades, but the new provision will block all Medicaid funding from going to Planned Parenthood, likely leading some of its clinics to close.Overnight dramaHouse passage followed several frenzied days on Capitol Hill as congressional leaders and Trump sought to sway holdouts to their side ahead of a self-imposed Fourth of July deadline.The Senate, and then later the House, held overnight sessions followed by dramatic votes where several Republicans, who said publicly they didn’t actually like the bill, voted to approve it anyway. GOP leaders didn’t have much room for error amid a narrow 53-seat Senate majority and a 220-212 advantage in the House. That delicate balance hovered in the background during the last several months, as talks over dozens of policy changes and spending cuts in the bill appeared deadlocked.Any modifications meant to bring on board far-right members of the party had to be weighed against the policy goals of centrist lawmakers, who are most at risk of losing their seats during next year’s elections.The House passed its first version of the bill following a 215-214 vote in May, sending the legislation to the Senate, where Republicans in that chamber spent several weeks deciding which policies they could support and which they wanted to remove or rework.The measure changed substantially to comply with the complex rules for moving a budget reconciliation bill through the upper chamber. GOP leaders chose to use that process, instead of moving the package through the regular legislative pathway, to avoid having to negotiate with Democrats to get past the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster.In the end nearly every one of the 273 Republicans in Congress approved the behemoth 870-page bill.Maine’s Susan Collins, Kentucky’s Rand Paul and North Carolina’s Thom Tillis voted against it in the Senate and Pennsylvania Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick and Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie opposed passage in the House.Fitzpatrick wrote in a statement that while he voted to approve the House's original version of the bill, he couldn't support changes made in the Senate.""I voted to strengthen Medicaid protections, to permanently extend middle class tax cuts, for enhanced small business tax relief, and for historic investments in our border security and our military.” Fitzpatrick wrote. “However, it was the Senate’s amendments to Medicaid, in addition to several other Senate provisions, that altered the analysis for our PA-1 community.”Massie posted on social media that he couldn’t vote for the measure because it would exacerbate the country’s annual deficit.“Although there were some conservative wins in the budget reconciliation bill (OBBBA), I voted No on final passage because it will significantly increase U.S. budget deficits in the near term, negatively impacting all Americans through sustained inflation and high interest rates,” Massie wrote. GOP holdouts delay passageFloor debate on the bill in the House, which began around 3:30 a.m. Eastern Thursday and lasted 11 hours, was along party lines, with Democrats voicing strong opposition to changes in the package and GOP lawmakers arguing it puts the country on a better path.GOP leaders didn’t originally plan to begin debate in the middle of the night while most of the country slept, but were forced to after holdouts refused to give their votes to a procedural step.When the House did finally adopt the rule, Pennsylvania’s Brian Fitzpatrick was the sole member of his party to vote against moving onto floor debate and a final passage vote.Fitzpatrick had posted on social media earlier in the day that he wanted Trump “to address my serious concern regarding reports the United States is withholding critical defense material pledged to Ukraine.”“Ukrainian forces are not only safeguarding their homeland—they are holding the front line of freedom itself,” he wrote. “There can be no half-measures in the defense of liberty. We must, as we always have, stand for peace through strength.”Tax breaks and so much moreHouse Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., made significant promises to middle-class Americans during floor debate about the tax provisions in the bill that many voters will be watching for in the months ahead. “Households making under $100,000 will see a 12% tax cut compared to what they pay today. The average family of four will see nearly 11,000 more in their pockets each year,” Smith said. “Real wages for workers will rise by as much as $7,200 a year. A waitress working for tips will keep an extra $1,300, a lineman working overtime after a storm will keep an extra $1,400.”Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Richard Neal, ranking member on the tax writing panel, said the legislation’s benefits skew largely toward the very wealthy.“If you made a million dollars last year, you're going to make a plus of $96,000 in the next tax filing season,” Neal said. “If you made under $50,000 last year, you're going to get 68 cents a day in terms of your tax relief.”The extension of the 2017 tax law would predominantly benefit high-income earners. The top 1% would receive a tax cut three times the size of those with incomes in the bottom 60% of after-tax income, according to analysis from the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.Some other tax incentives that critics say skew toward wealthier families include a $1,000 deposit from the federal government for babies born between 2024 and 2028, known as a “Trump account.” The program would track a stock index and gain interest accordingly and families with disposable income could contribute additional funding.And while Republicans included an extension of the child tax credit to $2,200 per child, it requires the parents to have a Social Security number to claim the tax credit.The bill will give the president more than $170 billion to carry out his campaign promise of mass deportations of people in the country without permanent legal status. The package would give the Department of Homeland Security $45 billion for the detention of immigrants and give its immigration enforcement arm another $30 billion to hire up to 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.Food aid, higher educationThe legislation will overhaul federal loans for higher education and how states pay for food assistance that roughly 42 million low-income people rely on, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.The bill would cap federal graduate loans to $100,000 per borrower and $200,000 per borrower who is attending law school or medical school. It would also cap the ParentPLUS loans to $65,000.Under the SNAP changes, the package would require states to shoulder more of the burden in food assistance. Currently, the federal government covers 100% of the cost. The legislation tightens eligibility for SNAP, requiring parents with children aged 6 and older to meet the work requirements when they were previously exempt.The SNAP changes would reduce federal spending on the program by $230 billion over 10 years.The GOP megabill cuts clean energy tax credits and claws back some of the funding in former president Joe Biden’s signature climate bill, known as the Inflation Reduction Act.Some of those cuts to clean energy tax credits include terminating at the end of September a nearly $8,000 rebate for the purchase of an electric vehicle, ending a tax credit by December for energy efficient home upgrades such as solar roof panels and heat pumps.The package rescinds funds to help local governments and states adopt zero emission standards, and eliminates environmental justice block grants that communities used to address health impacts due to environmental pollution, among other things.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-07-03 16:10:47.138746

Dan McKee Wednesday, July 2, 2025, promotes the free expression and free access of information by prohibiting the censorship of library materials. (Getty image)Rhode Island has joined at least eight other blue states that have taken steps against library censorship after Gov. Dan McKee signed the Freedom to Read Act into law Wednesday.
The legislation introduced by Sen. Mark McKenney, a Warwick Democrat, and Rep. David Morales, a Providence Democrat, protects libraries and their patrons from book-banning efforts and affirms the free speech rights of authors, publishers and readers in the state.
“We can decide what books we want to check out from the library, and we can decide what our own children read or don’t read. But what we can’t do is decide what everyone else gets to read or what other people’s children get to read or not read,” McKenney said in a statement. “Reading is a gift, and it is so important that we stay protective of the gift of reading and that when someone wants to take it away, whether by banning books directly or by launching lawsuits attempting to intimidate libraries, schools and librarians because of a book they have on their shelves, we fight.”
Connecticut, Oregon, New Jersey, California, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota and Washington have all passed laws in the past two years protecting access to reading materials on racial and sexual themes, including the LGBTQ+ issues. The push has come in response to efforts by conservative groups to ban books in school libraries across the country, as well as laws enacted in some red states that threaten criminal penalties against librarians.
“The passage of the Freedom to Read Act is a powerful victory for democracy, education, and the fundamental right to access knowledge,” Morales said. “After years of advocacy from librarians, educators, parents, students and community leaders, we’ve made it clear that no one should be able to censor books or intimidate those who share them. This law protects the freedom to explore, learn and grow. Most of all, this ensures our libraries remain inclusive spaces for all.”
The American Library Association’s Office for Intellectual Freedom in 2024 recorded 821 attempts across the country to censor library books and materials, down from 1,247 attempts reported in 2023, but still the third-highest number of book challenges.
Under Rhode Island’s new law, the commissioner of elementary and secondary education, in collaboration with the chief of library services, is responsible for developing policies for public and school libraries on standards for the selection and curation of library material, criteria for removing school library materials and protections against attempts to censor library material. 
Policies should support the freedom to read as a human right, encourage and protect the freedom of public libraries to acquire books and other materials without external limitations and ensure materials won’t be banned, removed, censored or have access to them restricted due to doctrinal or partisan disapproval.
The law allows any librarian subjected to discipline, termination or threats of discipline or termination for refusing to censor library materials in violation of policies established according to this legislation, to seek injunctive relief in court.

(Photo by Robin Bravender/States Newsroom)Justice Department attorneys told a federal district judge Tuesday that the Trump administration will not impose proposed restrictions on birthright citizenship for a month — but that it reserves the right to “immediately” start planning for that day.
The two-page notice was filed in U.S.District Court in Greenbelt in response to District Judge Deborah Boardman’s demand a day earlier to know “if the government thinks that it can start removing children from the United States who are subject to the terms of the executive order,”
It is the latest twist in a months-long legal battle over an executive order signed by President Donald Trump on Jan. 21, his first day back in office, that sought to deny citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. unless at least one of their parents was a citizen or a permanent legal resident.
Historically, “birthright” citizenship has been granted to anyone born on U.S. soil, regardless of their parent’s status. But Trump claimed in his executive order that that was a misinterpretation of the law, which he claimed was never intended to apply to everyone.
The order was almost immediately challenged in court by groups that said birthright citizenship is a bedrock of U.S democracy, and that denying citizenship to a child born here could make the child stateless altogether. Judges in three different districts, including Boardman, agreed and issued nationwide injunctions to block the order.
The government appeal focused on whether the district court judges had the authority to impose a nationwide ban on the order. In a 6-3 ruling Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed that the judges should not have extended the injunction beyond those people and groups that brought the suits.
But the high court’s ruling noted that a class-action suit could apply nationally. That’s why the plaintiffs in the Maryland case — CASA, the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project at 15 women who are pregnant or new mothers — were back in court Monday, seeking to get their suit certified as a class action suit for all undocumented parents and their babies.
The Supreme Court sent the cases back to the district court, but also set July 27 as the earliest date the administration can apply the executive order, to allow time for the cases to be reheard. On Monday, Boardman ordered Trump’s attorneys to clarify in writing the government’s view of what it can do under the executive order, and when.
Trump’s attorneys agreed in the filing that the earliest date the administration would apply the order is, in fact, July 27. But the the court’s ruling also provided for a 30-day ramp-up period, the notice said.
“The Court’s stay thus allows Defendants to immediately begin to ‘develop[] and issu[e] public guidance about the Executive’s plans to implement the Executive Order,’” the filing reads.
Boardman also gave Trump’s lawyers until July 7 to file a response to the plaintiffs’ motion to turn the case into a class action lawsuit.

Judges in New York and Pennsylvania disagree. Now the U.S. Supreme Court will decide. (Fran Baltzer for New Jersey Monitor)The U.S. Supreme Court will decide whether NJ Transit can be held responsible for accidents or if it has sovereign immunity from lawsuits as an arm of the state.
The nation’s top court agreed Thursday to hear arguments on two conflicting state rulings over NJ Transit’s liability in bus crashes that left two men injured.
In Pennsylvania, the state Supreme Court determined the transit agency is an arm of the state and consequently dismissed a lawsuit filed by Cedric Galette, who was a passenger in a car that collided with a NJ Transit bus in August 2018 in Philadelphia.
In New York, courts came to the opposite conclusion and found the agency operates independently from the state, so allowed a lawsuit over a Manhattan collision to proceed. In that case, Jeffrey Colt was injured after a NJ Transit bus hit him in February 2017.
A spokesman for New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin declined to comment Thursday, and an NJ Transit spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.
But Platkin filed a brief in April welcoming the U.S. Supreme Court’s review, calling the conflicting rulings an “untenable split in which New Jersey finds itself.”
“When an NJ Transit train leaves Morrisville, Pennsylvania, bound for New York City, its sovereign immunity toggles on and off at different points along the route,” Platkin’s brief says. “If NJ Transit is sued for conduct in Morrisville, in Pennsylvania state court, it enjoys sovereign immunity. But if NJ Transit faces suit for the same conduct in New York City, in New York state court, its sovereign status suddenly evaporates. Same public service, same day, same train — yet a different answer on the same state entity’s immunity.”
A ruling promises to have a huge financial impact on the state, whichever way it goes.
Public transit typically fuels the most lawsuits against the state, with officials paying out millions every year to resolve them.
Lawsuits have been filed on behalf of passengers, pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists injured or killed in bus and rail accidents, as well as workers hurt, harassed, or discriminated against on the job.
Some have resulted in seven-figure payouts, or more.
The state paid $10 million in 2022 to end a lawsuit filed by Xuefang Zhong, a bus passenger who was retrieving her luggage from an under-carriage compartment when the bus drove away and dragged her with it in New York City. She was injured so severely she needed a leg amputation and multiple surgeries. The family of Siham Hajbi got almost $1.8 million in 2023 to settle a wrongful death lawsuit they filed after a NJ Transit bus turned a corner and hit Hajbi as she walked in a Haledon crosswalk.
Lawsuit payouts in 2021 included $2 million to a pedestrian, Kiliek Anthony, who suffered a traumatic brain injury after he was hit by a NJ Transit bus in December 2015 in Irvington, and $7.4 million in three separate settlements to people injured when an empty NJ Transit bus ran a red light in August 2016 and collided with another NJ Transit bus in Newark, killing the bus driver and a passenger and injuring a dozen other passengers.

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)Over the last five years, while local jails in the United States have been holding fewer people, New Mexico’s largest jail has been detaining nearly one-third more people while they await their day in court.
That’s according to a recent study of the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC), located just outside Albuquerque in Bernalillo County.
Even though MDC hasn’t been as crowded in the last 10 years as it was historically, it’s been slowly holding more and more people, said Paul Guerin, director of the Center for Applied Research and Analysis at the University of New Mexico Institute for Social Research, which has studied the jail’s population since the 1990s.
Between 2019 and 2024, jail populations in the U.S. decreased by 15.3%, while the MDC’s population has grown by 30.3%, the report states.
Police-reported crime peaked in the U.S. in the 1990s and has generally decreased since, according to the report. While trends in police-reported crime in New Mexico, Bernalillo County and Albuquerque have always exceeded national trends, they have also gone down overall, the report states.
Over the last 10 years, local and state policymakers have affected how many people are booked into MDC and how long they stay there, according to the report. State policies and laws that have reduced these figures include voters’ approval of bail reform in 2016; the state Supreme Court’s case management order in 2015; and the statewide stay-at-home order in March 2020 that slowed the spread of COVID-19, according to the report.
On the other hand, policies that have packed more people into the jail have included New Mexico State Police “surges” in Bernalillo County in 2019 and 2021, and NMSP’s “North Star” operations with the Albuquerque Police Department, the report states.
Local prosecutors seek lawmakers’ help in lifting court deadlines

On any given day last October, MDC held an average of 1,803 people, the highest figure since December 2014, the report states.
While the MDC was designed to hold as many as 2,236 people, it’s not allowed to exceed a cap of 1,950 people under a 2017 settlement agreement between the City of Albuquerque and people incarcerated in the jail who sued more than two decades earlier.
However, the report states that MDC “is closer to the McClendon Cap than ever in the last eight years.”
Guerin told Source NM in an interview that authorities are holding more people in MDC because they’re booking more people into the jail, and holding them there for longer periods of time under more serious charges.
Guerin said people in MDC should primarily be there under lower-level charges because those who are charged with more serious crimes are out of their communities for longer periods of time, so they have fewer chances of returning to jail.
In a given year, approximately 40% of the people held in MDC are there two or more times under less serious charges, the report states.
“The jail is consistently receiving people who are cycling in and out of jail,” Guerin said.
A prior report on pretrial detention found that more than 40% of people who are held in jail while facing felony charges stay in the jail for 120 days on average, only to have their cases dismissed, Guerin said.
The problem, Guerin said, is that these are people the system believes are the most serious offenders, and more than 40% of them don’t receive a conviction, for various reasons, good and bad.
This results in not only wasted money holding people in MDC, but also social costs like people being away from their families and losing their jobs, Guerin said.
The report suggests that policymakers consider whether people in MDC should be there or not.
“We should be more efficient in prosecuting cases if we think they’re guilty,” Guerin said. “I don’t know why we don’t.”
Guerin and co-author Senior Research Scientist Elise Ferguson published the report in June, and it has received disappointingly few reactions, he said.
“We and others who produce information that’s useful for policymakers, often that information is not used,” he said.
Guerin said he thinks what is driving policy instead are people’s impressions, anecdotal stories, politics and sensationalized media coverage.
“Information should drive policy,” he said. “My hope is that information would just inform policy, but I don’t even think we see that oftentimes.”

Steve Erdman of Bayard leads a news conference at the Nebraska State Capitol on his EPIC Option tax proposals at the Nebraska State Capitol. May 21, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The petition campaign to eliminate Nebraska taxes on property, income, inheritances and corporations is returning for the 2026 election, hoping to capitalize on recent legislative failures and rising property valuations.
The “EPIC Option” group is back with what supporters are calling “EPIC Option 2.0” to ban state or local governments from collecting property, income and inheritance taxes after Jan. 1, 2028. Rather than proposing a broad consumption tax as replacement revenue, the Legislature would need to come up with a fix on its own.
“It’s time for the people to be in control of this situation, and the only way we can do that is when the people vote,” former State Sen. Steve Erdman of Bayard, a spokesperson for the campaign, said this week.
The ballot measure would add to the Nebraska Constitution: “No governmental entity in the state of Nebraska shall collect property tax, income tax or inheritance tax beginning January 1, 2028.”
In the hands of the people
Erdman said the EPIC team had been considering what to do after falling short of securing the necessary signatures to reach the ballot in 2024.

There were hopes the Legislature or Gov. Jim Pillen could do more than “incremental changes” for property tax relief, said Erdman, who was term-limited in January after eight years. But he said the 2024 special session dedicated to property taxes retroactively raised taxes because of the so-called “missing year” of income tax credits for property taxes paid. Then, lawmakers failed again in 2025. Erdman tried many times to legislatively pass the EPIC Option.
“Even when we try to do incremental changes, sometimes it winds up coming and biting us in the butt,” Erdman said.
State Sens. Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County and Kathleen Kauth of the Millard area are continuing work on their own constitutional amendment to tackle rising property taxes and valuations. Kauth’s Legislative Resolution 12CA stalled in the Legislature’s Revenue Committee this spring.
Erdman said he and others can’t think of any other option than EPIC and that voters have reached a similar “tipping point” as in 1966. That’s when the Legislature sought to create and use state income and sales taxes to lower state property taxes. In response, voters in 1966 also successfully led a campaign to abolish state property taxes.
“I have spoken with people who circulated that petition in ‘66 and asked what their plan was to replace the revenue. And they said the outcry of how high taxes were, there was no plan,” Erdman said. “They said, ‘We are tired of paying these taxes.’”
‘The revolt is becoming more sustained’
Sixty years later, the EPIC approach would be slightly different, providing approximately a one-year window for the state to find a solution if EPIC is advanced to and passed on the ballot.

The 2024 EPIC Option team faced resistance from a counter movement named “No New Taxes Nebraska,” an organization that included former State Sens. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha and Dan Hughes of Venango, former colleagues of Erdman, as well as the League of Nebraska Municipalities, Nebraska Chamber of Commerce, Nebraska Hospital Association, Nebraska Realtors and Nebraska Health Care Association.
The EPIC Option ballot question committee has raised about $175,000 and spent $140,000 since 2023, according to filings with the Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure Commission.
The No New Taxes group, formed in February 2024, raised and spent $58,165 last year. The group filed in February to dissolve its committee with the NADC.
Erdman said his group was continually “chastised” for pushing a consumption tax plan, criticisms he says were incorrect, so advocates are now looking to force the Legislature to act.
“The revolt is becoming more sustained and longer and, right now, because the valuation hearings protests are going on at the local courthouse, these people are fired up,” Erdman said. “And rightfully so, because this Legislature, nor any since 1967, has not had the intestinal fortitude to make changes to a broken system to make it fair for the taxpayer.”
The campaign would need valid signatures from 10% of Nebraska voters, including from 5% of voters in at least 38 of the state’s 93 counties, by July 2026 to reach the November 2026 ballot.

(Photo: Dana Gentry/Nevada Current)Bad blood between Windsor Park residents, whose homes have been sinking for 35 years, and North Las Vegas, the city that residents say has turned a blind eye to their plight, surfaced Wednesday as the City Council approved a zoning change that will allow the neighborhood to relocate to homes built on solid ground.
State Sen. Dina Neal, the driving force behind the effort to relocate some 93 families from Windsor Park, called out the North Las Vegas City Council for its inaction on behalf of their constituents and for its alleged attempts to discredit her.
“I want to thank you for every low down action you took, because I found deeper courage to stand up for what I believe in and continue to fight for these families,” Neal said during public comment. “I want to thank the city for fighting with me because you enlarged my capacity. I want to thank you for lying on me because you increased my faith. I want to thank you for using your city emails last year to talk about how you were going to conspire, collude and plan against me during my campaign. I thank you because it made me believe deeper in my purpose.”
 History seeped in neglect

Windsor Park, built during the segregation era of the 1960s as a premier neighborhood primarily for Black residents, is today a patchwork of vacant lots and dilapidated structures. Its residents pay taxes, but don’t enjoy the benefits afforded others in North Las Vegas. Street lights are in disrepair. Stop signs are faded. Weeds grow through the cracked sidewalks.

More than half of the homes in the neighborhood, which was built on a depleting aquifer, have been demolished in the decades since the earth beneath them began to crumble. 
In 1994, North Las Vegas received $14.5 million from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to relocate homeowners. About half, including some who spent decades paying off mortgages, took the city up on the relocation offer, and got $50,000 for their trouble.     
But in recent years, the city has used federal money to attract new buyers, who were unaware they were purchasing worthless properties.  
Laquanna Sonnier, a single mother of three, obtained down payment assistance from the city to purchase her Windsor Park home in 2021 for $230,000. She didn’t know the home, which she thought was merely a fixer upper, was sinking until she was contacted by the Nevada Current in 2023.
Sonnier was shocked to learn the city, since 1991, has prohibited Windsor Park homeowners from remodeling or adding on to their properties, yet took no action to notify potential buyers or lenders of the subsidence. 
“I felt like my world was falling apart, knowing that I wouldn’t be able to even fix things around my house that needed to be fixed, especially with young children,” Sonnier, accompanied by her children, told the council.
“Explain to me how I was able to buy this home that’s sinking in 2019, when it’s been going on for how long?” homeowner Eli Valdez asked the council. 
“I can’t explain, nor will I try to explain why you all had to live in houses like that, whether it be in North Las Vegas or anywhere else. I think it’s abominable,” Councilman Richard Cherchio said, adding “nothing compares to what you had to endure all of these years. I could say for myself, I apologize for that as a council member now.”
Councilman Isaac Barron attempted to minimize the city’s role in Windsor Park’s tortured history, casting the city as a bit player.
“The state has taken the project out of the hands of the City of North Las Vegas. Is that not correct?” he asked city management, referring to state legislation sponsored by Neal in 2023 to relocate the residents en masse to a new neighborhood. The effort relies on $25 million in American Rescue Plan Act money, and a $12 million contribution from the state.
 Shaky ground

Had North Las Vegas forced residents from their homes it would have been on the hook for eminent domain awards, likely resulting in residents receiving higher than market value for their properties. Instead, homeowners allege, the city has engaged in a sort of reverse condemnation, by neglecting the neighborhood.
In 2019, Mayor Pamela Goynes-Brown, then a councilwoman representing the ward that includes Windsor Park, claimed ignorance during a council meeting when asked by a resident why the city has failed to maintain the neighborhood for decades. 
“That’s a good question,” Goynes-Brown said at the time. “The last thing I want to do is not take care of Windsor Park. That is a priority. It also takes a partnership.” 
Without the ability to make improvements, residents say they’ve done the best they could.    
Windsor Park resident Pamela Neal (no relation to the state senator) said during public comment Wednesday that Goynes-Brown “knows the story as well as anyone” but failed to assist her constituents.
“Ms. Goynes, thank you. Finally,” Pamela Neal said after the first of two votes Wednesday to amend zoning to make way for a new Windsor Park to be constructed at Carey and West streets.
“It’s Ms. Goynes-Brown,” the mayor retorted.
Goynes-Brown, who once championed building warehouses that would have blocked the neighborhood’s one redeeming characteristic – its view of the Las Vegas valley — has frustrated residents and state Sen. Neal. 
“Senator Neal brought us hope,” Sonnier told the council.  
In 2023, Neal fought to pass state legislation to bail out the forgotten homeowners. When Gov. Joe Lombardo intended to veto the bill, Neal resurrected it.
The state’s selection of Frank Hawkins, a former Oakland Raider and former Las Vegas City Councilman, as the project’s developer, prompted allegations of cronyism directed at Neal. 
Hawkins told the council he didn’t want to “belabor the point,” but noted the Nevada Housing Division issued a request for proposal for the project.
“We responded, and we were successful in winning,” he said. “I’m a proud product of North Las Vegas, and I was raised in Windsor Park, so I have a commitment to do all I can to help make that project successful.” 
Leslie Vega of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada told the council their vote “is a chance to shift the moral compass of North Las Vegas and show that North Las Vegas is ready to correct a historical wrong.”

Barbara Carter, who has lived in Windsor Park since 1965, hopes she and her neighbors “can see the homes starting to be built before we die and leave this world, because this is a long time, and it should not have taken these many years…”
Sonnier says the likelihood of moving her children into a new, safe home is sinking in, though she has at times feared the effort would fall apart. 
“I knew it was important for my children to be here today to see this because they play in these streets that are cracked and damaged, sidewalks that are torn apart, and for them to know that they’re going to be in a safer environment,” Sonnier told the council. 
State Sen. Neal says the vote brings the residents closer to the end of the long and winding road they’ve been on for more than 30 years, adding its especially meaningful coming on the eve of the nation’s birthday. 
“This action will help them create generational wealth for their children and their grandchildren,” she said. “Why was America even created in the first place? It was to give opportunity. It was supposed to be a place where people could build their dreams.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/8F725BB1-DBC6-497D-BF4C-2B2DAA10B5E2-scaled-e1751564879525-1024x784.jpeg,,,2025-07-03 14:12:20.685040

They made history. Revolutionary, to say the least. Even before then, tea has been a soul soother the world over. 
Whether sipped from dainty cups, pinkies out accompanied with giggles; or whispered secrets or on hot, sunny days over ice, lazing on a front porch; or as spiritual satisfaction after an elaborate ceremony steeped in tradition, tea offers a quiet revelation.
Christina Berry, owner and chief tea officer of ‘Sippsi Good Tea in Jackson, has a desire to be a revelation.

(Courtesy of Idahoans United for Women and Families)The rallying calls were familiar.
Despite dangerous pregnancy complications, women are being denied emergency abortions. Doctors are leaving the state. And politicians shouldn’t be involved in sensitive health decisions.
But one part of the pitch was new: Instead of asking state lawmakers for a fix, Idahoans can sign on to establish their own state law.
“Idaho has been living under the trigger ban for nearly three years,” Melanie Folwell, lead organizer for the group behind Idaho’s abortion rights ballot initiative, told a Boise rally on Saturday. “And we have seen — and you’ll see in the stories you hear today — that it simply does not work for Idaho. It doesn’t work for anybody. So, today is the first step we are taking to end the ban.”
The effort to collect signatures for the proposed ballot initiative comes nearly three years after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. That reversal lifted federal court protections for abortions, letting states regulate abortion — which activated trigger abortion bans in several states, including Idaho.
Despite calls for change in the three years Idaho’s ban has been in place, including by the state’s top medical association, Idaho lawmakers have largely refused to modify Idaho’s strict abortion laws.
The ballot initiative, a power outlined in Idaho’s constitution, allows voters to propose their own policies that carry the power of law — if approved by a majority vote.
But qualifying an initiative for the ballot is a tough hurdle in Idaho.
In the past decade, only three ballot initiatives have had enough signatures to qualify for the ballot: a successful Medicaid expansion initiative in 2018, a failed historical horse racing initiative in 2018, and an unsuccessful primary election reform initiative in 2024.
The group Folwell leads, Idahoans United for Women and Families, is hoping to qualify the abortion ballot initiative for the ballot in the November 2026 general election. That gives organizers about a year to collect the nearly 71,000 signatures needed.
They already collected 1,200 signatures on Saturday, when hundreds of people turned out for the rally, organizers say. And organizers are gearing up for signature collection efforts across the state soon, Folwell told the Sun, helped by their 1,000 volunteers.
 Initiative could mean doctors won’t ‘be afraid to move to Idaho,’ doctor says

The initiative could mean doctors and other medical professionals “will not be afraid to move to Idaho and take care of us,” Dr. Becky Uranga, an Idaho doctor, said at the rally.
That could mean several things might get better, she explained between cheers from the audience — like your longtime doctor “will stay and keep caring for you and thousands of others,” that you may be able to avoid a six-month wait to see a doctor or other medical professional, and that Idaho doctors can “again provide the needed care without the risk of criminalization hanging over our heads.”
“And most of all, this could restore the sacred space between doctors and our patients. And I can honor all of your beliefs and privacy in the exam room — without any external pressures,” Uranga said.
Kate Campbell-Covell, a pregnant mother with two kids, told the rally about how she had to travel to Utah after she learned her son wouldn’t survive her pregnancy.
“With tears in their eyes, our extremely compassionate and loving medical team explained that due to the laws in Idaho, they were unable to render the care they deem necessary to save my life and protect my future fertility,” she said.
Then she was airlifted out of state, she said.
After federal court protections, St. Luke’s has said the health system hasn’t had to air transport any patients for pregnancy complications. Before those protections, St. Luke’s transported six patients out of state in the first four months of 2024. The federal court protections only allow emergency abortions for doctors at St. Luke’s.
Campbell-Covell later learned that she had a severe placenta infection. If left untreated, she would have died, she said.
She had her son’s ashes sent home.

 Ballot initiative backers explain why they signed

Krista Doubleday signed the initiative Saturday. She says she thinks people need to understand more about how an unwanted pregnancy affects people.
For years, she worked in social work, and now works as a local therapist.
“The amount of children that I saw living in absolutely horrid conditions, and from individuals that were forced to bear them from other countries, is really what radicalized me and made me pro choice,” Doubleday said.
Ken Harris, a local musician, also signed. He said he wants abortion access in Idaho to return to how it used to be.
“That was what the case was in Idaho for 50 years. Male politicians — politicians have no business dictating to people about their private medical decisions and feelings,” Harris told the Sun. “A woman’s opinion about what she should do with her body — for her own health, for her family — should be her decision alone.”
 Signature gathering starts — after delay from redrafting state’s official descriptions

To qualify for the ballot, the group needs at least 70,725 qualifying signatures from Idaho registered voters. That figure is 6% of Idaho’s nearly 1.2 million registered voters in the 2024 general election — spread across half of the state’s 35 legislative districts.
But signature gathering efforts were delayed by almost six months after initiative organizers legally challenged descriptions state officials developed about the initiative for voters to see, Folwell told the Sun. The descriptions are featured on signature gathering forms.
Last month, the Idaho Supreme Court ordered the Idaho Attorney General’s Office and the Idaho Division of Financial Management to redraft the descriptions.
The new short ballot title describes the initiative as a “measure creating right to abortion before fetus viability, and post-viability to protect health; right to privacy; healthcare provider liability protections.”
The initiative would raise state expenses by less than one thousandth of a percent of Idaho’s share of the Medicaid budget, or between $3,100 and $7,800 each year, the initiative’s redrafted fiscal impact statement says.
“This impact is derived from the costs of treating chemical abortion complications for women enrolled in Idaho’s Medicaid program,” the fiscal impact statement says. “Medicaid covers medically necessary services to treat complications from all abortions. It is anticipated that as legal abortions increase, the complications will also increase. This will likely result in an increase in Medicaid covered services and expenditures to treat complications from chemical abortions, which the State has reliable and readily available data to support.”
The new fiscal impact statement also no longer includes the entire Medicaid services budget of $850 million in fiscal year 2024.

(Photo provided by the Oklahoma State Department of Education)OKLAHOMA CITY — Those who knew Melissa Evon the best “laughed really hard” at the thought of her teaching family and consumer sciences, formerly known as home economics.
By her own admission, the Elgin High School teacher is not the best cook. Her first attempt to sew ended with a broken sewing machine and her mother declaring, “You can buy your clothes from now on.”
Still, Evon’s work in family and consumer sciences won her the 2025 Oklahoma Teacher of the Year award on Friday. Yes, her students practice cooking and sewing, but they also learn how to open a bank account, file taxes, apply for scholarships, register to vote and change a tire — lessons she said “get kids ready to be adults.”
“Even though most of my career was (teaching) history, government and geography, the opportunity to teach those real life skills has just been a phenomenal experience,” Evon told Oklahoma Voice. 
After graduating from Mustang High School and Southwestern Oklahoma State University, Evon started her teaching career in 1992 at Elgin Public Schools just north of Lawton. She’s now entering her 27th year in education, a career that included stints in other states while her husband served in the Air Force and a break after her son was born.
No matter the state, the grade level or the subject, “I’m convinced I teach the world’s greatest kids,” she said.
Her family later returned to Oklahoma where Evon said she received a great education in public schools and was confident her son would, too. 
Over the course of her career, before and after leaving the state, she won Elgin Teacher of the Year three times, district Superintendent Nathaniel Meraz said.
So, Meraz said he was “ecstatic” but not shocked that Evon won the award at the state level.
“There would be nobody better than her,” Meraz said. “They may be as good as her. They may be up there with her. But she is in that company of the top teachers.”

Like all winners of Oklahoma Teacher of the Year, Evon will spend a year out of the classroom to travel the state as an ambassador of the teaching profession. She said her focus will be encouraging teachers to stay in education at a time when Oklahoma struggles to keep experienced educators in the classroom.
Evon herself at times questioned whether to continue teaching, she said. In those moments, she drew upon mantras that are now the core of her Teacher of the Year platform: “See the light” by looking for the good in every day and “be the light for your kids.”
She also told herself to “get out of the boat,” another way of saying “take a leap of faith.” 
Two years ago, she realized she needed a change if she were to stay in education. She wanted to return to the high-school level after years of teaching seventh-grade social studies.
The only opening at the high school, though, was family and consumer sciences. Accepting the job was a “get out of the boat and take a leap of faith moment,” she said.
“I think teachers have to be willing to do that when we get stuck,” Evon said. “Get out of the boat. Sometimes that’s changing your curriculum. Sometimes it might be more like what I did, changing what you teach. Maybe it’s changing grade levels, changing subjects, changing something you’ve always done, tweaking that idea.”
Since then, she’s taught classes focused on interpersonal communication, parenting, financial literacy and career opportunities. She said her students are preparing to become adults, lead families and grow into productive citizens.
And, sure, they learn cooking and sewing along the way.
“I’m getting to teach those things, and I know that what I do matters,” Evon said. “They come back and tell me that.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-03 17:23:10+00:00,CT Mirror,"Trump administration withholds over $6 billion for after-school, summer programs and more",Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/03/trump-administration-school-summer-program-funding/,A Trump administration funding freeze could wreck summer for low-income families and wipe out some after-school programming next year.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Day camp providers and schools are warning that a Trump administration funding freeze could wreck summer for low-income American families and wipe out some after-school programming next year.
The administration is withholding more than $6 billion in federal grants for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more as part of a review to ensure grants align with President Donald Trump’s priorities.
The move leaves states and schools in limbo as they budget for programs this summer and in the upcoming school year, introducing new uncertainty about when — or if — they will receive the money. It also sets the stage for a clash with Democrats, who say the administration is flouting the law by holding back money Congress appropriated.
Without the money, schools say they won’t be able to provide free or affordable after-school care for low-income kids while their parents work, and they may not be able to hire staff to teach children who are learning English. Even classes or camps underway this summer could be in jeopardy.
For instance, the Boys and Girls Clubs of America depend on some of the withheld money to run camps and other summer programming for low-income students. If funding isn’t restored soon, the programming may end mid-season, said Boys and Girls Club President Jim Clark.
After-school programming in the fall could also take a hit. “If these funds are blocked, the fallout will be swift and devastating,” Clark said. As many as 926 Boys and Girls Clubs could close, affecting more than 220,000 kids, the group said.
Programs that rely on the money were expecting it to be distributed July 1, but an Education Department notice issued Monday announced the money would not be released while the programs are under review. The department did not provide a timeline and warned that “decisions have not yet been made” on grants for the upcoming school year.
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” Education Department officials wrote in the notice, which was obtained by The Associated Press.
The department referred questions to the Office of Management and Budget, which did not respond to a request for comment.
After-school child care at risk
In Gadsden City Schools in Alabama, officials say they’ll have no choice but to shutter their after-school program serving more than 1,200 low-income students if federal funds aren’t released. There’s no other way to make up for the frozen federal money, said Janie Browning, who directs the program.
Families who rely on after-school programs would lose an important source of child care that keeps children safe and engaged while their parents work. The roughly 75 employees of the district’s after-school programs may lose their jobs.
“Those hours between after school and 6 o’clock really are the hours in the day when students are at the most risk for things that may not produce great outcomes,” Browning said. “It would be devastating if we lost the lifeline of afterschool for our students and our families.”
Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance, said withholding the money could cause lasting damage to the economy.
Some advocates fear the grants are being targeted for elimination, which could force schools to cut programs and teachers. Trump’s 2026 budget proposal called for Congress to zero out all of the programs under review, signaling the administration sees them as unnecessary.
Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., pressed the administration to spend the money as Congress intended.
“Every day that this funding is held up is a day that school districts are forced to worry about whether they’ll have to cut back on afterschool programs or lay off teachers instead of worrying about how to make sure our kids can succeed,” Murray said in a statement.
What the money funds
The six grant programs under review include one known as 21st Century Community Learning Centers. It’s the primary federal funding source for after-school and summer learning programs and supports more than 10,000 local programs nationwide, according to the Afterschool Alliance. Every state runs its own competition to distribute the grants, which totaled $1.3 billion this fiscal year.
Also under review are $2 billion in grants for teachers’ professional development and efforts to reduce class size; $1 billion for academic enrichment grants, often used for science and math education and accelerated learning; $890 million for students who are learning English; $376 million to educate the children of migrant workers; and $715 million to teach adults how to read.
These programs account for over 20% of the federal money the District of Columbia receives for K-12 education, according to an analysis by the Learning Policy Institute, a think tank. California alone has at least $800 million in limbo, while Texas has more than $660 million.
“Trump is illegally impounding billions of dollars appropriated by Congress to serve students this fiscal year,” said Tony Thurmond, California’s state superintendent, in a statement. “The Administration is punishing children when states refuse to cater to Trump’s political ideology.
The loss of funds could “put several more school districts in extreme financial distress,” said Chris Reykdal, superintendent of public instruction in Washington state. Districts have already adopted budgets, planned programming and hired staff, assuming they’d receive the money, Reykdal said.
If the funding freeze remains, children learning English and their parents would be especially affected. Some districts use the money to pay for summer programming designed for English learners, family engagement specialists who can communicate with parents and professional development training for staff. Rural districts would be hit the hardest.
“They’re trying to send a message,” said Amaya Garcia, who oversees education research at New America, a left-leaning think tank. “They don’t believe that taxpayer funding should be used for these children.”
Umatilla School District in rural eastern Oregon — with a sizable population of migrant families and students learning English — relies heavily on federal funding for its after-school and summer school programs. Superintendent Heidi Sipe says she is meeting with state officials soon to find out if the district will have to plan an early end to summer school, an option 20% of students are using. Come this fall, if federal money stays frozen, she’ll have to lay off staff and eliminate after-school programs attended by around half the district’s students.
“It’s an essential service in our community because we don’t have any licensed child care centers for school-age children,” she said.
Sipe said it’s particularly frustrating to deal with these funds being put into limbo because the school district was in the middle of a five-year grant period.
“It feels preventable,” she said, “and it feels as though we could have done a better job planning for America’s children.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25182731277420-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-03 14:12:20.685040

The ban was challenged by Becky Pepper-Jackson (pictured) a teenage transgender student athlete from West Virginia. (Billy Wolfe | ACLU photo)The Supreme Court of the United States will take up a challenge of a West Virginia law prohibiting transgender athletes from participating in school sports in a case that could decide the legality of other such bans around the country.
The high court is expected to hear West Virginia vs. B.P.J. during its fall term.
The lawsuit was brought by the mother of Bridgeport student athlete Becky Pepper-Jackson against the West Virginia Board of Education. At the time the federal lawsuit was filed in 2021 Pepper-Jackson was an 11-year-old student athlete who wanted to run for her middle school’s cross-country team but was prohibited from doing so.
The lawsuit alleges the state’s 2021 Save Women’s Sports Act, signed by former Gov. Jim Justice, is unconstitutional.
In a ruling last year, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals blocked the state from enforcing the ban, finding the law violated Pepper-Jackson’s rights. Pepper-Jackson, a freshman during the last school year, qualified to participate in two events during the West Virginia High School State Track & Field Championships in May, according to reporting by West Virginia MetroNews.
Since 2020, 27 states, including North Carolina, have banned transgender youth from playing school sports, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. The Supreme Court will also take up a lawsuit challenging Idaho’s transgender athlete ban.
State attorney general J.B. McCuskey celebrated the news that the high court would take up the case, saying that “female athletes in West Virginia will have their voices heard.”
“The people of West Virginia know that it’s unfair to let male athletes compete against women; that’s why we passed this commonsense law preserving women’s sports for women,” McCuskey said. “We are confident the Supreme Court will uphold the Save Women’s Sports Act because it complies with the U.S. Constitution and complies with Title IX. And most importantly: it protects women and girls by ensuring the playing field is safe and fair.”
Pepper-Jackson is represented by the ACLU, Lambda Legal and Cooley LLP.
In a statement, Joshua Block, senior counsel for the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project, said that school athletic programs should be accessible to everyone regardless of sex and transgender status.
“Trans kids play sports for the same reasons their peers do — to learn perseverance, dedication, teamwork and to simply have fun with their friends,” he said. “Categorically excluding kids from school sports just because they are transgender will only make our schools less safe and more hurtful places for all youth. We believe the lower courts were right to block these discriminatory laws, and we will continue to defend the freedom of all kids to play.”
In a statement Thursday, Gov. Patrick Morrisey, who represented the state in the case in his prior role as attorney general, said he is pleased to hear the high court will take up the case.
“I am optimistic that after hearing the case, the Supreme Court will restore sanity to athletics and allow West Virginia to enforce its commonsense law that prevents boys from competing in girl’s sports,” Morrisey said.

The court will also take up a lawsuit related to a similar ban in West Virginia. 
Idaho in 2020 became the first state in the nation to implement this kind of ban, which prohibits transgender athletes from participating on any team designated for women or girls, from public K-12 schools to universities. Similar laws are in place in 27 states. 
The ACLU of Idaho and the national American Civil Liberties Union challenged Idaho’s law immediately, arguing that it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment — which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex. The West Virigina case additionally challenges the other law based on Title IX, the federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in educational programs.

Federal courts initially blocked Idaho’s law from taking effect. But the block was later narrowed to only protect the suing athlete, Linsday Hecox. That came after the U.S. Supreme Court, in another Idaho case called Poe v. Labrador, narrowed the scope of preliminary injunctions. 
“We are confident that the U.S. Supreme Court will agree with federal court rulings that this ban is unconstitutional.” ACLU of Idaho spokesperson Rebecca De León said in an emailed statement. “Despite this ruling, Idaho remains an incredibly hostile state for transgender people, despite a national trans athlete ban failing to pass Congress earlier this year. Idaho will be on the wrong side of history on this issue, and transgender people are the ones paying the price for it.”

Last week, Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador urged the U.S. Supreme Court to take up Idaho’s case, called Hecox v. Little, Idaho Education News reported. 
In a statement Thursday, Labrador said he was thrilled that the Supreme Court would hear Idaho’s case. 
“For too long, activists have worked to sideline women and girls in their own sports,” Labrador said. “Men and women are biologically different, and we hope the Court will allow states to end this injustice and ensure that men no longer create a dangerous, unfair environment for women to showcase their incredible talent and pursue the equal opportunities they deserve.”
Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a Tennessee state law that bans gender-affirming care for minors. Idaho has a similar state law. 
The case will be argued in the fall and decided in 2026, ABC News reported.

The state of New Hampshire has long blamed the plastics manufacturer with contaminating the air and water in Merrimack, Londonderry, Bedford, Litchfield and Hudson. In 2016, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, were discovered in hundreds of wells in the area surrounding the company’s Merrimack facility and many more have been discovered in the years since. 
Saint-Gobain did not admit to wrong-doing but in 2022, the company agreed in court as part of a consent decree to provide clean drinking water to approximately 1,000 homes whose water was contaminated. The following year, it announced it was closing the facility, which had been operating since 1986, ostensibly as part of a corporate restructuring across the company’s North American operations.
“Over the course of the past 18 months, the company has been working to diligently and responsibly wind down operations at the facility in Merrimack and complete the facility demolition in line with our decommissioning and demolition plan,” Saint-Gobain said in its statement. “The demolition process is now complete. We have coordinated closely with state and local authorities and regulators throughout this process and will continue to fulfill our remediation commitments in the region.”
PFAS chemicals, often referred to as “forever chemicals” because they are so hard to break down, have been linked to cancer risk, reproductive complications and other health issues. The state Department of Health and Human Services found elevated rates of kidney cancer in Merrimack from 2009 to 2018, according to a 2023 report. Further analysis found that kidney cancer rates were rising in Merrimack and across New Hampshire while those rates remained stable across the rest of the U.S. DHHS wrote there was “a statistically significant, albeit modest excess of cases of kidney cancer in Merrimack.”

(Hadley Barndollar | New Hampshire Bulletin)For the second year in a row, a bill aimed at helping people wrongfully convicted of a crime get out of prison didn’t become law in New Hampshire, but advocates of the proposal say they’re not giving up.
“It’s incredibly frustrating to see this bill stall in the legislature for another year,” Winnie Ye, a state policy advocate with the Innocence Project, said. “This is an issue that is ultimately about liberty at the end of the day.”
The Innocence Project provides pro bono legal services, forensic testing, and investigative work to people believed to be wrongfully incarcerated.
Currently, under state law, people convicted of a crime have three years to request a new trial. This applies even if new evidence of their innocence emerges after that time period.
Cynthia Mousseau, staff attorney at the New England Innocence Project — a similar but independent regional organization — said in a release that it takes, on average, 11 years to uncover and correct a wrongful conviction. This, she said, makes the three-year deadline “particularly troubling.”
Senate Bill 141, sponsored by Sandown Republican Sen. Bill Gannon, would’ve eliminated that three-year deadline for cases in which new evidence emerges.
Ye described the bill as a “common sense fix” to a barrier for the wrongfully convicted.
“It was narrowly tailored,” she said. “It really was about giving people an opportunity to just file a petition if they had discovered evidence of their innocence. The courts would still have to review their positions, it would still go through that process, but this was really just about getting in the door and cracking the door open for innocent Granite Staters.”
Gannon’s bill sailed through the Senate with bipartisan support before being considered by the House. In the House, the bill was amended to add unrelated provisions that would expand confidentiality requirements for New Hampshire public libraries and their records. With that amendment, the House approved the bill in a 343-19 vote. However, when the bill returned to the Senate to consider the new provision, Senate negotiators killed the entire bill during a committee of conference.
Similar legislation last year actually made it to then Gov. Chris Sununu’s desk. But Sununu vetoed it, writing in his veto note that the “sentiment is sensible in the context of considering scientific and/or forensic breakthroughs, but the text of this legislation is problematic in that it is overly broad in allowing, if not inviting, an unending procession of frivolous petitions and appeals.” 
With the 2025 legislative session over, advocates say they plan to push for the legislation again when the Legislature reconvenes next year.
“Post-conviction mechanisms like this one are incredibly important to revealing wrongful convictions,” Ye said. “Without it, unfortunately, people will still be languishing behind bars.”
There have been 3,701 exonerations across the U.S. since 1989 as of Wednesday, according to the National Registry of Exonerations. Only three of those have occurred in New Hampshire, according to the New England Innocence Project.
“This disparity isn’t because innocent people are not being wrongfully convicted in New Hampshire,” the organization wrote in a release, “but because outdated barriers in the law prevent them from proving their innocence.”

A study published Wednesday in the medical journal JAMA Network Open found that emergency room clinicians were much less likely to refer Black opioid overdose patients for outpatient treatment compared with white patients.
The researchers looked at the medical records of 1,683 opioid overdose patients from emergency rooms in nine states: California, Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Oregon and Pennsylvania.
About 5.7% of Black patients received referrals for outpatient treatment, compared with 9.6% of white patients, according to the researchers, who received a federal grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse to conduct the analysis.

While the nation saw a decrease in opioid overdose deaths in white people between 2021 and 2022, overdose death rates increased for American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian, Black and Hispanic people. Patients visiting ERs for opioid overdoses are more likely to die from an overdose after the visit, the authors wrote, underscoring the importance of gaining “an improved understanding of disparities in [emergency department] treatment and referral.”
In total, roughly 18% of the patients received a referral for outpatient treatment, 43% received a naloxone kit or prescription, and 8.4% received a prescription for buprenorphine, the first-line medication for treating opioid use disorder.
The researchers used records from 10 hospital sites participating in a national consortium collecting data on overdoses from fentanyl and its related drugs. The patient records were from September 2020 to November 2023.
Another study in JAMA Network Open, released Thursday, found similar disparities: Black and Hispanic patients were significantly less likely than white patients to receive buprenorphine. Black patients had a 17% chance, and Hispanic patients a 16% chance, to be prescribed the therapy, compared with a 20% chance for white patients.
The authors of that study, from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, looked at data from 176,000 records of opioid-related events between 2017 and 2022 across all 50 states.

(Getty Images)A new state report recommends stepped-up enforcement of Indiana’s near-total abortion ban, including financial penalties for noncompliant hospitals and expanded oversight by senior health officials.
Much of the Indiana Department of Health (IDOH) report, released Tuesday, emphasizes existing policies and requirements, like mandated abortion reporting and informed consent forms.
But several enforcement changes go further, including possible financial penalties for noncompliant hospitals and formal escalation of abortion-related issues to top IDOH leadership.










Indiana is a state that supports Life, and the people’s representatives have enshrined those protections for the unborn into state law.


– Republican Gov. Mike Braun


In a letter published Wednesday, Gov. Mike Braun framed the effort as an extension of his broader “pro-life means pro-family” agenda. 
In January, he directed all state agencies to ensure Indiana’s abortion laws are “fully and faithfully executed,” including mandatory cooperation on terminated‑pregnancy reporting, as well as a health department review of enforcement practices. Findings were due by July 1.
“Indiana is a state that supports Life, and the people’s representatives have enshrined those protections for the unborn into state law,” Braun wrote in his recent letter. “We are taking the necessary steps to make sure those laws are properly implemented.”
Internal, enforcement changes at IDOH
Under state law, abortion care providers must submit Terminated Pregnancy Reports (TPRs) to the IDOH after each abortion procedure. 
Providers must report within 30 days if the patient is 16 or older and within three days if younger than 16. Each of the reports should include demographic, medical and procedural information.
But State Health Commissioner Lindsay Weaver pointed to ongoing challenges with enforcement — namely two hospital systems, IU Health and Eskenazi Health, “that have refused to file TPRs.”

“This is a significant challenge for IDOH because it does not allow the agency to fully capture data regarding provision of abortions in Indiana and ensure appropriate compliance with Indiana’s laws,” Weaver wrote in the new report. 
The hospitals have based their refusal on a national reproductive health privacy rule, which was recently vacated by a federal judge in Texas.
Weaver said IDOH “is currently working with the hospitals and the Indiana Attorney General’s Office to resolve the dispute” over TPR filings.
To “address noncompliance swiftly and proportionately,” the health department has also started to develop new rules that would allow the agency to impose financial penalties on hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers that fail to comply with abortion-related reporting laws, Weaver noted. It’s not yet clear how much those fines could be or when exactly they could be imposed.
Currently, enforcement primarily centers around punitive licensing actions or criminal referrals.
IDOH also pledged greater collaboration with other state agencies, including the Professional Licensing Agency (PLA) and the Department of Child Services (DCS), as well as new continuing education efforts to help providers better understand Indiana’s abortion statutes.
Weaver said collaboration with the Office of the Attorney General would include increased data sharing and more efficient communication around legal referrals. Joint efforts with PLA seek to address provider noncompliance through disciplinary action, and “strengthen(ed) communication” with DCS will especially focus on cases involving minors under the age of 16.
Ensuring “consistent and timely submission” of TPRs to DCS “will support child welfare investigations and ensure compliance with mandatory reporting laws,” Weaver wrote.
Abortions down statewide
Indiana Right to Life praised Braun’s actions, calling the new report “encouraging.”
“Hoosiers, in which so many want to love and support both moms and babies, will gain clarity on many issues from this report that underscores IDOH’s intent to work closely with other agencies, including the Office of the Attorney General, and to ensure Gov. Braun’s directive is carried out,” said Mike Fichter, the group’s president and CEO.
The release comes as Indiana marks its first full year under a near-total abortion ban enacted in 2022 and upheld by the state Supreme Court in 2023. An IDOH report released in May showed that just 146 abortions were reported statewide in 2024, down from thousands annually in prior years.
Despite the drop, Braun’s office said changes at IDOH and other state agencies are necessary to ensure “full compliance” and transparency post-Roe v. Wade.

Gov. Tina Kotek on Wednesday issued an executive order to Oregon’s 197 school districts, requiring they adopt a policy for banning student cellphone use by Oct. 31, 2025. Those policies must be fully implemented by Jan. 1, 2026, the order reads.
The move follows the Legislature’s failure to pass a similar, bipartisan bill — House Bill 2251 — during the recent legislative session.
That bill would have, with some exceptions, required districts to ban cellphones for all grades, and enforce penalties on students who violate cellphone policies. But it failed to clear a key Senate committee vote. It faced opposition from powerful school board and school administrator groups, which expressed concerns about the state mandating policies that they felt school districts themselves should handle. Some school district leaders testified that enforcing the ban would be prohibitively expensive for them to do.
But State Rep. Lisa Reynolds, D-Beaverton, a doctor and chief sponsor of the bill that failed to pass, said in a news release that she was glad Kotek stepped in.
“By getting cellphones out of our schools, Governor Kotek is putting students first,” she said. “Every Oregon student deserves a distraction-free, harassment-free learning environment that fosters curiosity and community.”
The order technically bans all “personal electronic devices,” which includes any portable, electrically powered device capable of making and receiving calls and text messages, and that can access the internet independently from the school’s wireless network, such as a smart watch. It does not include laptops or other devices that support classroom activities.
In November, the Oregon Department of Education issued guidance to districts on limiting or ending cellphone use in schools. State law currently requires every school district to have policies about cellphones and personal electronic devices, but each district gets to set its own rules.
At least eight Oregon school districts have already either banned use in individual classes or in schools altogether, according to the state education department. Full bans have been enacted at some middle and high schools in the Lincoln County School District, Portland Public Schools, and in the Nyssa School District. The Lake Oswego School District bans cellphones for students in all K-12 schools.
Kotek in a news release said that model policies for schools that already have prohibitions in place will be made available, and the state will offer some flexibility in implementation.
“The research is clear,” Korek said, “cellphone use can create a trifecta of consequences for our young people – mental health issues, safety in school, and distraction from learning.”
A growing body of research and teacher surveys show student cellphone use in schools is hindering more than helping the school experience.
In a May 2023 advisory, then-U.S. Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy recommended parents set limits on phone use, and in June 2024, Murthy called for health warnings on social media platforms for younger users, who research shows are suffering from higher rates of mental health issues when spending hours on the platforms each day.
A Pew Research Center survey from October 2023 found that more than two-thirds of U.S. adults favor banning cellphones during class, and almost two-thirds of high school teachers said cellphones have become a major distraction and impediment to learning.
The order makes Oregon one of at least 19 states that have adopted statewide cellphone bans in schools.

(Official White House Photo by Daniel Torok)The federal government is disavowing responsibility for Florida’s Everglades immigration center the morning after people awaiting deportation arrived.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security neither funded nor authorized the 3,000-capacity tent and trailer detention center, counsel for the department wrote in a filing opposing environmental groups’ request that a federal court halt the site.
DHS also denied any authority over the immigrants, stating that Florida had decided to hold people at the detention center, rushed to completion in eight days.
Before Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced that hundreds of immigrants would arrive Wednesday night, DeSantis’ communications director, Bryan Griffin, told reporters the timing of the arrival of detainees was up to DHS. Griffin also said the Florida Division of Emergency Management (FDEM) was in charge of the detention center with oversight from the federal government.
DHS’ Thursday filings contrast what Kristi Noem, the department’s head, and the president have said about FEMA’s funding of the detention center, which is projected to cost the state $450 million to run annually.

“We took the FEMA money that Joe Biden allocated to pay for the free luxury hotel rooms where he’s paying hundreds of millions of dollars in New York City, and we used it to build this project,” President Donald Trump said Tuesday during his tour of the detention center at the Miami-Dade Collier Training and Transition Airport.
While in public, the Trump administration has touted the use of FEMA funds to reimburse Florida, its attempt to stave off the legal challenge to the Everglades site includes arguing that federal funding hasn’t and may never come. Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity filed suit Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against DHS, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), FDEM, and Miami-Dade County.
The environmental groups are challenging the legality of the detention center because it has not gone through any environmental review as required under federal law, and the public did not get an opportunity to comment.
“Florida has received no federal funds, nor has it applied for federal funds related to the temporary detention center,” counsel for DHS and ICE wrote. “Courts cannot adjudicate hypothetical future funding decisions or render advisory opinions on contingent scenarios that may never materialize.”
Another top ICE official described in a declaration to the court the agency’s role in the development of the detention center as limited to an inspection to ensure compliance and meeting with state officials to discuss operational matters.
The DeSantis administration relied on a January 2023 emergency declaration against illegal immigration to commandeer the land owned by Miami-Dade County. The governor and Uthmeier have described the detention center as “Alligator Alcatraz,” a “one-stop shop” for deportations, stating that the flights would be handled by the federal government.
Oversight visit from Dems
Democrats at the state and federal levels have called out the lack of transparency or answers about the operation of the detention center. State Democratic lawmakers (Sens. Shevrin Jones and Carlos Guillermo Smith and Reps. Anna Eskamani, Angie Nixon, and Michele Rayner) planned to visit the center on Thursday afternoon.
“As lawmakers, we have both the legal right and moral responsibility to inspect this site, demand answers, and expose this abuse before it becomes the national blueprint,” they wrote in a press release. “So much of this is also a distraction from the everyday issues all Floridians are facing, like housing affordability and the property insurance crisis. DeSantis should be focused on solving those issues, not creating even more chaos.”
Earlier in the week, FDEM Director Kevin Guthrie argued in a filing to the court that the detention center is necessary to alleviate overcrowding in ICE detention centers. Five people have died in ICE custody in Florida this year, according to agency press releases. As of June 15, ICE held 56,397 people in detention, exceeding the 41,500 it has the funds to detain in the 2024 fiscal year.
Neither FDEM nor the governor’s office immediately responded to the Florida Phoenix’s request for comment.

The photo was taken in Helena (Photo courtesy of Maria Pacheco).It began with a search for Anderson DeJesus Bastidas Linares, a man Immigrations and Customs Enforcement wanted for assaulting a family member with a weapon.
It ended with Christopher Martinez, a 31-year-old Helena man who authorities said looked a lot like Linares, in custody, pulled away from his wife and four children, facing deportation even though he’s lived in the country for years. 
Originally, Helena Police said that Martinez was being detained because he was an associate of Linares — a statement they’ve now walked back. 
Now, Martinez may face removal from Helena, Montana and America, because a law enforcement officer thought he looked like Linares, and his license plate was expired. 
Martinez first came to the United States as a minor in 2008. He’s attempted to attain citizenship since turning 18, a process his wife, Maria Pacheco, describes as “very difficult.” He’s been living in Helena with Pacheco and their four children since July 2022.
“We love Helena. He loves the cold,” said Pacheco. “We’d put on our winter coats and walk around the parks. We always go to the lakes in the summers, grill hot dogs and hamburgers, just let the kids run. We have fun.” 
On Monday, Martinez was stopped for speeding by Lewis and Clark County Patrol Division. He received a citation for driving without a license, a notice to appear in court, and was sent on his way. 
On Tuesday, while driving home during his lunch break, he was stopped again – this time by a combination of the U.S. Marshals Service, Homeland Security Investigations, and U.S. Border Patrol, with assistance from the Helena police.
“The long version is federal marshals and HP task force officers were hunting for a guy that had a felony warrant. During surveillance, they saw a male that essentially one of the federal agencies said, ‘Hey, this might be the guy. He matches a description. He’s getting in a red truck. He’s leaving,’” said Lt. Adam Shanks, of the Helena Police Department. “So they looked at the red truck. They ran the license plate. It came back as an expired license plate. That’s when they requested our assistance.” 
Shanks said that Helena Police may assist federal agents in tasks such as traffic control or peacekeeping, and their policy does not prevent them from cooperating with various federal agencies in specific circumstances. He emphasized the Helena Police Policy is open to the public. 
“Our officers were actually just going to give him citations and he was going to leave and cut him loose,” Shanks said. “They were then informed by the Border Patrol agents that happened to be along with the Federal Marshals that day that they were going to take custody of him because of his immigration status.” 
In their official press release, Helena Police confirmed the initial target was Anderson DeJesus Bastidas Linares. 
“Although the individual (Martinez) was determined not to be the primary suspect, he was believed to be an associate,” the press release said. 
The Helena Police no longer stand by that. 
“From what I understand and from what I’ve been told, it’s not clear enough to say that he was,” Shanks said.  
News of the arrest and ICE’s presence in Montana’s capitol city caused alarm and outrage.
The arrest lit up social media and soon it had blossomed into a full-scale panic as news the arrest translated into a belief that ICE was trying to transport Martinez out of state. From there, community members started planning a rally at the courthouse for Martinez’ release. 
The Lewis & Clark County Sheriff’s Office shared the post on their own Facebook page, labeling it “pure propaganda” and “false information.” 
“I stand by that,” said Sheriff Leo Dutton. “The reason I did that is I did not want a bunch of people trying to rush around security and causing a public safety issue.” 
Nearly 31 hours later, the original post was removed and a correction has been made. 
Regarding future cooperation with Border Control, Dutton confirmed that going forward, Lewis & Clark County would not be detaining anyone who doesn’t hold local charges.  The county does have some experience partnering with federal immigration agencies.
As the community sits on edge, Pachecho told the Daily Montanan that her husband loves Montana, loves his family and has tried for years to get through the cumbersome and confusing naturalization process.
With a short drive of only four minutes, Pacheco said Martinez comes home from work every chance he gets. 
“He doesn’t like to have lunch at work because he wants to spend time with us,” she said. “And he knows I always have a hot meal for him here.” 
“He has fun with me,” said 4-year old Aurora Martinez. “He watches movies with me.”

“We watch a lot of ‘Madagascar,’” explained Maria Pacheco, wife of Christopher Martinez and mother to their four children. “That song ‘Move It, Move It’ – every time we’re in the car, every time he comes home on lunch breaks, that’s the go-to song. All three of the little ones start dancing.” 
Even as Martinez was continuing citizenship paperwork, Pacheco was surprised how “quick and in the dark” his detention was. 
“They took my husband without any rights, with nothing,” she said. “They took him in a van that wasn’t even labeled. The people that took him were dressed in black, had no logo on their clothes either. He didn’t get a chance to talk, he didn’t get his right to have an attorney during the time he was held. The way they just stopped him because he looks similar to one of them, and just automatically sent him to ICE makes no sense to me.”
Martinez is being represented by Upper Seven Law and has filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus that challenges his detention as a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights and asks the court to prevent him from being removed from Montana or the United States until his claims can be heard. 
“Mr. Martinez was arrested and detained by Helena police and federal authorities based on what appears to be racial profiling,” said Andres Haladay, an attorney with Upper Seven Law. “Consistent with normal court procedure and the federal Constitution, the Montana District Court ordered federal authorities not to transfer Mr. Martinez out of Montana while we challenge those actions.
“Shared racial or ethnic characteristics are not a reasonable basis for determining that someone has committed a crime or is in the United States unlawfully.” 
Haladay said even communicating with his client has been difficult. 
“We got notification that he was there,” said Haladay. “Lewis and Clark County was relatively unhelpful in not confirming his presence, confirming his presence, agreeing to let us speak with him and then preventing us from speaking with him. In all of that, another unmarked vehicle with Washington plates arrived and took him away from the detention center while we were still trying to secure access to him.” 
According to Lewis & Clark Sheriff Leo Dutton, mistakes were indeed made. 
“That’s the first time in 41 years that it’s ever happened,” said Dutton, regarding cooperation with Border Control. “My staff may or may not have done everything right. We just have never had this before.” 
A hearing for Mr. Martinez is scheduled for 1:30 p.m., July 10 at the Russell Smith Federal Court in Missoula. 
“We are zealously challenging an apparent unconstitutional exercise of federal power in our hometown,” said Haladay. “In Montana, we stand by our neighbors.”
For now, Haladay believes that Martinez will remain in Montana, based on an order from U.S. District Court Judge Dana Christensen, who will oversee the case.  
“I have received representations that they are honoring this order,” Haladay said. 
Pacheco is still awaiting news from her husband, and while she does, her focus remains on her children. 
“You know as a mother I try to look for solutions, and not having a solution is heartbreaking. I just tell them we’re going to go through this, we just pray to God that everything works out,” she said. 
A community fundraiser for the family has raised nearly $5,700 to help with additional costs. Pacheco expressed gratitude to those in the community. 
“I appreciate everything everyone is doing. Just to know that I have a lot of people who care is amazing,” she said. “I was so overwhelmed, you know, I have no solution. I heard a lot of people, when they’re detained, it takes like months for people to get to talk to them. I was really worried. I thank everybody in the community that is helping us.” 
Her children are thinking only of their father.

The average cost for a 10-person Fourth of July will cost $70.92, which is 30 cents less than last summer, but the second highest cookout cost since 2013 when American Farm Bureau Federation began its annual survey on the topic.
Beef, canned goods and hand-picked crops have the highest price increases from last year, due likely to low domestic cattle inventory, aluminum tariffs and the cost of labor.
The American Farm Bureau survey assumes a gathering of 10 people who will consume: cheeseburgers, chicken breasts, pork chops, potato chips, canned pork and beans, fresh strawberries, homemade potato salad, fresh-squeezed lemonade, chocolate chip cookies and ice cream.
Canned of pork and beans had the steepest increase, 8.2% or 20 cents, from last year. The bureau said labor costs along the supply chain and steep tariffs on aluminum are likely to blame.
Homemade lemonade will also cost 20 cents more per pitcher this year, and strawberries 8 cents more per pound, due to a continued trend of high labor costs in the specialty crop sector.
The cost of ground beef also increased to $13.33 for two pounds, which is nearly 60 cents more than the $12.77 cost in 2024. While normally a crowd favorite, it will cost families nearly $20 to make 10 cheeseburgers this weekend, according to the survey prices.
The bureau survey also breaks prices down by region and found cookouts in the Northeast are the cheapest this year at $63.79, about the same as last year, followed by the South where hosts can feed a party of 10 for $68.93. Gatherings in the West average at $73.50 and Midwestern gatherings come in as the second most expensive at $69.87.

U.S. cattle herd size has been declining since 2019, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported the 2025 herd size was 8% lower than 2019 herd. The amount of beef imported to the U.S. has also gone up in the time frame.
Pork chops, on the other hand, had the largest decrease in price from last year. Three pounds of pork chops this weekend should run consumers about $14.13, which is nearly 9% less than the cut cost last year. The survey concludes this is due to high domestic pork supplies.
The cost of chicken breasts declined slightly from last year’s cookout prices but the cost of eggs increased, which made potato salad about 20 cents more expensive this year. Poultry have been affected by the ongoing highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has caused fluctuating prices as the supply chains are impacted.
Since January, U.S. has imported about 10 times the amount of shell eggs it imported in the same period in 2024 as part of the administration’s plan to combat the bird flu. Wholesale egg prices have declined by more than 60% since January, but the American Farm Bureau report shows the cost for consumers for just four eggs is up 54% from last summer.
Farmers not pocketing fair share, advocates say
Consumer increases don’t necessarily mean higher prices for farmers, however. On average, farmers and ranchers receive about $0.16 per consumer dollar spent on food, according to the latest “Farmer’s Share” report from National Farmers Union.
Rob Larew, the organization’s president said it’s important to highlight the “growing imbalance” in the food system.
“Family farmers and ranchers are working harder than ever, yet taking home less, while corporate monopolies in processing, distribution, and retail rake in record profits,” Larew said. “Farmers deserve a fair share of the food dollar, and consumers deserve a food system that works for everyone, not just a handful of powerful corporations.”
According to the report, a rancher takes home $2.08 on a one pound package of ground beef sold for $5.99. A lettuce farmer gets an even lower cut, receiving about 8.2% of the consumer dollar.

However, it’s unclear what part of the court order the state will contest. 
The three-member state Board of Election Commissioners on Thursday filed a court document declaring it intends to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court an order issued by a federal three-judge panel. 
A representative in Attorney General Lynn Fitch’s office, which is filing the appeal on behalf of the state, said the appeal will not disrupt the upcoming elections. Fourteen legislative districts around the state are preparing to conduct the election based on the lower court ruling.
Fitch’s office has not yet filed a substantive briefing outlining what portion of the lower court’s order it intends to appeal. But an official within Fitch’s office said the appeal will only present a narrow legal issue to the nation’s highest court and not appeal the entire lower court order that required the state to conduct do-over elections this year.
Still, the appeal is notable because it comes in the middle of special elections that the lower court ordered the state to conduct to allow Black voters in Mississippi a realistic chance to elect candidates of their choice. The party primaries are scheduled for August.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/03124913/Voting-Tuesday-6.jpg,,,2025-07-03 13:16:56.727750

(Billy Wolfe | ACLU photo)The Supreme Court of the United States will take up a challenge of a West Virginia law prohibiting transgender athletes from participating in school sports in a case that could decide the legality of other such bans around the country.
The high court is expected to hear West Virginia vs. B.P.J. during its fall term.
The lawsuit was brought by the mother of Bridgeport student athlete Becky Pepper-Jackson against the West Virginia Board of Education. At the time the federal lawsuit was filed in 2021 Pepper-Jackson was an 11-year-old student athlete who wanted to run for her middle school’s cross country team but was prohibited from doing so.
The lawsuit alleges the state’s 2021 Save Women’s Sports Act, signed by former Gov. Jim Justice, is unconstitutional.
In a ruling last year, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals blocked the state from enforcing the ban, finding the law violated Pepper-Jackson’s rights. Pepper-Jackson, a freshman during the last school year, qualified to participate in two events during the West Virginia High School State Track & Field Championships in May, according to reporting by West Virginia MetroNews.
Since 2020, 27 states have banned transgender youth from playing school sports, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. The Supreme Court will also take up a lawsuit challenging Idaho’s transgender athlete ban.
State attorney general J.B. McCuskey celebrated the news that the high court would take up the case, saying that “female athletes in West Virginia will have their voices heard.”
“The people of West Virginia know that it’s unfair to let male athletes compete against women; that’s why we passed this commonsense law preserving women’s sports for women,” McCuskey said. “We are confident the Supreme Court will uphold the Save Women’s Sports Act because it complies with the U.S. Constitution and complies with Title IX. And most importantly: it protects women and girls by ensuring the playing field is safe and fair.”
Pepper-Jackson is represented by the ACLU, Lambda Legal and Cooley LLP.
In a statement, Joshua Block, senior counsel for the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project, said that school athletic programs should be accessible to everyone regardless of sex and transgender status.
“Trans kids play sports for the same reasons their peers do  — to learn perseverance, dedication, teamwork and to simply have fun with their friends,” he said. “Categorically excluding kids from school sports just because they are transgender will only make our schools less safe and more hurtful places for all youth. We believe the lower courts were right to block these discriminatory laws, and we will continue to defend the freedom of all kids to play.”
In a statement Thursday, Gov. Patrick Morrisey, who represented the state in the case in his prior role as attorney general, said he is pleased to hear the high court will take up the case.
“I am optimistic that after hearing the case, the Supreme Court will restore sanity to athletics and allow West Virginia to enforce its commonsense law that prevents boys from competing in girl’s sports,” Morrisey said.

A growing number of states have more older adults than children, making it likely there will be fewer young residents to care for their elders as their ranks continue to grow (Anna Claire Vollers/Stateline).Montana, Oregon and Pennsylvania have joined the ranks of states where older people outnumber children, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.
The ratio of people older than 65 to children younger than 18 grew in every state, according to a Stateline analysis of the estimates released June 26, which measure age changes in mid-2024 compared with earlier years.
Other states where older people already outnumbered children in 2023: Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia. That grew from just four in 2020: Florida, Maine, Vermont and West Virginia.
The trend bodes poorly for the future number of young adults who can help care for older relatives, according to a report published last year by the Maxwell School of Citizenship & Public Affairs at Syracuse University.
“America’s health and aging care system is unprepared to support its large and growing older adult population,” the report concluded. It said health care likely will become scarcer and more unequal if the nation’s older population grows to 73 million as projected by 2030, from the roughly 61.3 million in the latest 2024 estimates.
The new census estimates show Maine and Vermont have the highest ratios: about 1.3 older people for every child, followed by New Hampshire (1.2), Florida and West Virgina (each about 1.1).
New England’s labor force has been slow to recover since the pandemic, partly because of an aging population, according to a report published in January by the New England Public Policy Center at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
Florida has many of the counties with the highest ratios of older people to children, the census estimates show.
Among larger counties with 100,000 people or more, older adults outnumber children the most — by 8 to 1 — in Florida’s Sumter County, home to most of The Villages with its fast-growing retirement communities.
The ratio is 3 to 1 in Florida’s Charlotte and Sarasota counties, as well as North Carolina’s Brunswick County and Massachusetts’ Barnstable County, where Cape Cod is located.
The ratio is 2 to 1 in New Mexico’s Santa Fe County, Arizona’s Mohave and Yavapai counties, and in five Florida counties.
The nation’s median age reached a new historical high at 39.1, up from 38.9 in 2023, the census also found. The median age was below 30 until 1980 and below 20 until 1870.
Maine’s population in 2024 was the oldest of any state, with a median age of 44.8; Utah’s was the youngest at 32.4 as of 2024.

Lyme disease was first identified in 1975 in Lyme, Connecticut, after a group of children and adults reported unusual arthritis-like symptoms. By 1977, 51 cases of what became known as “Lyme arthritis” were documented. In 1982, scientists discovered the cause: the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, transmitted by black-legged ticks.
The Connecticut Department of Public Health, along with Yale University, the University of Connecticut, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, helped define and track the disease, shaping early research and response efforts. Since 1995, the state has averaged about 2,700 reported cases each year.
According to the CDC, Connecticut ranked among the top 10 states for reported Lyme disease cases nationally in 2023. New York reported the most, with 22,173 cases that year. Factors like suburban development and reforested land contribute to Connecticut’s high risk.

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Provisions in the new tax and spending bill passed by the U.S. Senate early Tuesday would go even further than the House bill in removing health care and other benefits from immigrants with legal status.
The House version of the massive tax and spending bill penalized states providing health care for some immigrants with legal status as well as those that chose to spend state money to enroll immigrants without legal status in Medicaid.
But the Senate bill is even tougher on immigrants here legally and illegally, reducing benefits for most refugees and immigrants on humanitarian parole, including Afghans and Ukrainians who helped the United States in wars overseas and in return were promised safe haven and a safety net in the United States.
The Senate bill also cuts state reimbursement for emergency care in the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That would force those states to pay more for emergency care for immigrants, cut back services or drop out of Medicaid expansion, a potentially catastrophic move for low-income U.S. citizens as well as new immigrants.
The bill passed with three dissenting Republican votes, from U.S. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Vice President JD Vance broke the tie. The bill, officially the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” now returns to the House for final passage before going to President Donald Trump to be signed.
Advocates and experts see repercussions as refugees and other legal immigrants lose health insurance and turn to already-stressed hospitals and charities for help. It could be a nail in the coffin for some rural hospitals that are in financial trouble and scaling back services. Hospitals are required to serve anyone who arrives for emergency care, regardless of their ability to pay.
“In our state, it’s going to be absolutely devastating for rural hospitals,” said Kate Woomer-Deters, a senior attorney at the North Carolina Justice Center’s Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Refugees are not going to go home just because they lost their health care coverage. They’re still going to be showing up at the door of hospitals and clinics needing care.”
Some groups, such as Afghans, Ukrainians and Iraqis, were often brought here after helping the U.S. in war efforts, putting their lives in danger and making life in their home country untenable.
“In the case of the Afghans, this is pretty much a knife in the back to those folks who helped the United States when the United States needed help in their country,” said David Meyer, a board member of the Bloomington Refugee Support Network in Indiana, where he personally helps seven refugee families from Afghanistan, Honduras, Iraq, Nicaragua and Syria.
The Senate bill takes Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and even food stamps off the table for most refugees. There are a few narrow exceptions for people with green cards, some Cuban migrants waiting for citizenship, and some Micronesians and Marshall Islands natives with treaty rights, said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
That also applies to immigrants with legal status who don’t have green cards: people with asylum, immigrant victims of domestic violence, immigrant victims of sex trafficking and parolees — such as Afghans — admitted due to urgent humanitarian reasons, as well as to refugees.

“There’s going to be more emergency health care needs because uninsured people will be delaying care,” Gonzales said. “It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.”

The bill also cuts funding for expansion states to pay for emergency care in hospitals. Increased costs could force some states to drop Medicaid expansion altogether, spreading the pain to low-income U.S. citizens as well, Gonzales said.
“It’s one more reason states are looking at their budgets and they’re having to make decisions about their Medicaid expansion program,” Gonzales said.
In Indiana, Meyer said, Afghan women especially often need food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to get by at first. It takes them a long time to learn to read and write since they were not allowed to attend any school under the Taliban.
“They arrived in our community totally illiterate in their native language and starting from scratch learning English, so that’s a huge impediment to being gainfully employed,” Meyer said. Even once they’ve become self-sufficient enough to get off food stamps and Medicaid, many still need the support of the Affordable Care Act to get health care.
Removing all subsidized health care “would have a devastating effect on those families, and not just Afghans but Syrians, people from the Democratic Republic of Congo and others that have been relocated to south-central Indiana,” Meyer said.
Indiana hosted more than 10,500 of the nearly 460,000 refugees who arrived in the United States between 2013 and 2023, according to a 2023 report from the nonprofit Immigration Research Initiative. In fiscal 2024, another 1,380 arrived in Indiana, mostly from Congo and Burma, but including 90 people from Afghanistan, according to State Department records.
In North Carolina, there were 276 new Afghan refugees in fiscal 2024 among 2,730 total new refugees. Even professional Afghans such as doctors and lawyers struggle at first in low-wage jobs, said Woomer-Deters, of the North Carolina Justice Center. It takes time for them to get accreditation and language skills to practice their professions here, she said.
“A lot of these folks need their food stamps, Medicaid — they need these programs for an adjustment period when they get here. And these are people we’ve invited to come and have vetted,” she said.
A Congressional Budget Office report June 29 estimated that almost 12 million people, including 1.4 million immigrants covered by state-only programs, would lose health insurance under the Senate plan.
A Republican response to an earlier CBO report emphasized that the bill would save states $13.1 billion in Medicaid spending over 10 years, “freeing up resources they can choose to reinvest to further strengthen care for the most vulnerable Americans.”
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, however, called that conclusion misleading in its own response in turn.
“These savings would largely result from millions of people losing health coverage — hardly an outcome worth celebrating,” the response said.
Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, said there was one small positive change in the Senate version compared to the House version.
States will no longer be penalized for using the option to cover some immigrant children and pregnant women.
And the Senate version would not penalize expansion states for offering Medicaid to immigrants on humanitarian parole, but only because that help for parolees was ended in entirely, along with help for refugees and other kind of immigrants with legal status who lack green cards, Cuello said.
“In other words, they are blocking all paths to health care,” Cuello said in an emailed statement. “This is not an attack on the undocumented. It’s an attack on lawfully present immigrants.”

Josh Stein on Thursday vetoed three Republican-sponsored bills that seek to ban diversity, equity and inclusion in public schools, universities and state government, calling the legislation a distraction from more pressing issues facing the state. 
The bills — Senate Bill 227 targeting K–12 education, Senate Bill 558 focused on UNC System schools and community colleges, and House Bill 171 aimed at state and local government agencies — had all passed along party lines in recent weeks. Each sought to bar DEI offices, training programs, and what Republicans called “divisive concepts” related to race and gender from public institutions.
In a news release announcing the vetoes, Stein accused lawmakers of fueling “culture wars” and neglecting urgent state business.
“At a time when teachers, law enforcement, and state employees need pay raises and people need shorter lines at the DMV, the legislature failed to pass a budget and, instead, wants to distract us by stoking culture wars that further divide us,” Stein said in a statement. “These mean-spirited bills would marginalize vulnerable people and also undermine the quality of public services and public education. Therefore, I am vetoing them. I stand ready to work with the legislature when it gets serious about protecting people and addressing North Carolinians’ pressing concerns.”
These measures are part of Republican-led efforts to restrict diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the public sector — in government, higher education and K-12 education.
Republican lawmakers say the legislation is meant to restore fairness and ideological neutrality in classrooms, and that DEI programs promote a worldview that “stifles opportunity” and “stokes division” by encouraging students to judge others based on race or sex. 
But opponents say the language in the bills is overly broad and would have wide-ranging consequences, chilling speech in classrooms and dismantling DEI offices that support students, workers, and communities who have long faced structural barriers.
In a recent NC Newsline story, educators expressed concern that the measures would prevent them from teaching essential parts of American history.

Josh Stein on Thursday vetoed three Republican-sponsored bills that seek to ban diversity, equity and inclusion in public schools, universities and state government, calling the legislation a distraction from more pressing issues facing the state. 
He also vetoed House Bill 805 — a catchall bill that includes a collection of conservative social agenda priorities, including provisions that target transgender individuals and provide parents with expanded rights to challenge school library books.
The DEI bills — Senate Bill 227 targeting K–12 education, Senate Bill 558 focused on UNC System schools and community colleges, and House Bill 171 aimed at state and local government agencies — had all passed along party lines in recent weeks. Each sought to bar DEI offices, training programs, and what Republicans called “divisive concepts” related to race and gender from public institutions.
In a news release announcing the vetoes, Stein accused lawmakers of fueling “culture wars” and neglecting urgent state business.
“At a time when teachers, law enforcement, and state employees need pay raises and people need shorter lines at the DMV, the legislature failed to pass a budget and, instead, wants to distract us by stoking culture wars that further divide us,” Stein said in a statement. “These mean-spirited bills would marginalize vulnerable people and also undermine the quality of public services and public education. Therefore, I am vetoing them. I stand ready to work with the legislature when it gets serious about protecting people and addressing North Carolinians’ pressing concerns.”
The DEI measures are part of Republican-led efforts to restrict diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the public sector — in government, higher education and K-12 education.
Republican lawmakers say the legislation is meant to restore fairness and ideological neutrality in classrooms, and that DEI programs promote a worldview that “stifles opportunity” and “stokes division” by encouraging students to judge others based on race or sex. 
But opponents say the language in the bills is overly broad and would have wide-ranging consequences, chilling speech in classrooms and dismantling DEI offices that support students, workers, and communities who have long faced structural barriers.
In a recent NC Newsline story, educators expressed concern that the measures would prevent them from teaching essential parts of American history.
House Bill 805 raised a special level of ire among Senate Democrats who objected to the fact that the measure started out as a noncontroversial House proposal targeting revenge porn and was only amended to include several controversial culture war provisions in the Senate.
Republicans hold a supermajority in the Senate and could override Stein’s vetoes there without Democratic support.

(File photo by Getty Images)Duke Energy is again seeking to increase electricity rates, this time for all of its 857,000 South Carolina customers across the upper third of the state.
Less than a year after the utility last raised rates in the Upstate, power bills for those Duke Energy residential customers there could go up, on average, by $10.38 a month in March 2026. In the Pee Dee, residential customers could see a $21.66 monthly hike starting February 2026, roughly three years since the utility last raised rates for those customers.
“We know families and businesses are juggling a lot and we do not take a request to increase rates lightly but being upfront and timely with our request is the right thing to do and in the best interest of our customers.” Duke Energy’s South Carolina president, Tim Pearson, said in a statement.
In filings with state regulators, the North Carolina-headquartered company said it built 600 miles of new power lines and 6,800 transformers in 2023 and 2024.
It’s also seeking to charge South Carolina customers for a $90 million share of maintenance to its nuclear power plants, a $34 million share of its gas plants, a $43 million share of hydropower and an $11 million share of batteries for a solar farm.
In addition, the company wants to replenish its storm response fund in the wake of Hurricane Helene. Three months after the massive storm swept across the Southeast, knocking out power to 4.7 million customers in nine states, the company’s reserve fund had a negative balance of $23 million, the company wrote in documents filed with the state Public Service Commission.
“Duke Energy Carolinas just raised its rates less than a year ago, and now they are asking to hike bills once again. If its request is approved, residential customers’ bills will be nearly $23 a month higher than July 4th of last year,” said Southern Environmental Law Center Senior Attorney Kate Mixson.
All of SC’s major power providers could receive approval to hike rates by year’s end

Not to mention, the new rate hike, if approved, could take place before the old rate increase even goes fully into effect.
Rates are already set to bump again in the Upstate on Aug. 1, 2026, as federal tax credits are set to expire and the second stage of the last rate hike kicks in.
Tax credits passed during the first Trump administration would be extended as part of Republicans’ massive tax and spending package titled the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which could receive a final vote Wednesday.
But it’s unclear whether Duke would continue to pass any new savings from an extension on to its customers.
The pair of rate hikes also come on the heels of a mammoth new energy law signed by Gov. Henry McMaster in May.
Within that legislation is a provision making it easier for power companies to raise rates on an annual basis.
Utility executives say the process, coined as rate stabilization, raises rates on a smaller-but-more-frequent basis, making it easier for those on a fixed income to adjust. It also guarantees companies continue to receive the maximum rate of return allowed by regulators.
Utilities still go before regulators annually for up to five years to seek permission to raise prices. Rate payers can still protest, and regulators still have the final say over whether expenses meet the necessary requirements for an increase.
But the process is less in depth than the rate cases Duke is currently undertaking because it doesn’t call into question a utility company’s allowed profit rate.
Mosier said Duke has not invoked the new process and has “not yet created a plan as to how and when to use this new tool.”
Still, in regulatory filings, company representatives wrote that Duke is “pursuing a strategy of more timely, incremental rate requests.”
“While this rate case stands on its own, it reflects the spirit of that legislation, which promotes making proactive, thoughtful investments that strengthen energy security and help keep South Carolina attractive to new businesses and families and well-positioned for the future,” Mosier said in a statement.
The company is asking regulators to approve a 10.85% profit rate in both the Upstate and PeeDee, compared to the 9.94% rate it locked in last year in the Upstate.
Mixson, whose organization was among several environmental and consumer groups to negotiate down Duke Energy’s last rate hike proposal, called it “striking but not surprising.”
“There is no incentive for efficiency. There is no incentive for them to be sharp with their pencil now. And there’s no incentive to make sure they’re getting the lowest bid. It does not matter anymore because they will get their set profit,” said Frank Knapp, president of the Small Business Chamber of Commerce.
The Pee Dee rate change is scheduled to be considered by the state Public Service Commission in October 2025. A date has not yet been set for the Upstate rate change.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-932311582-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-03 13:16:56.727750

(Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Provisions in the new tax and spending bill passed by the U.S. Senate early Tuesday would go even further than the House bill in removing health care and other benefits from immigrants with legal status.
The House version of the massive tax and spending bill penalized states providing health care for some immigrants with legal status as well as those that chose to spend state money to enroll immigrants without legal status in Medicaid.
But the Senate bill is even tougher on immigrants here legally and illegally, reducing benefits for most refugees and immigrants on humanitarian parole, including Afghans and Ukrainians who helped the United States in wars overseas and in return were promised safe haven and a safety net in the United States.
The Senate bill also cuts state reimbursement for emergency care in the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That would force those states to pay more for emergency care for immigrants, cut back services or drop out of Medicaid expansion, a potentially catastrophic move for low-income U.S. citizens as well as new immigrants.
The bill passed with three dissenting Republican votes, from U.S. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Vice President JD Vance broke the tie. The bill, officially the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” now returns to the House for final passage before going to President Donald Trump to be signed.
States face hard choices as budgets expected to tighten

Advocates and experts see repercussions as refugees and other legal immigrants lose health insurance and turn to already-stressed hospitals and charities for help. It could be a nail in the coffin for some rural hospitals that are in financial trouble and scaling back services. Hospitals are required to serve anyone who arrives for emergency care, regardless of their ability to pay.
“In our state, it’s going to be absolutely devastating for rural hospitals,” said Kate Woomer-Deters, a senior attorney at the North Carolina Justice Center’s Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Refugees are not going to go home just because they lost their health care coverage. They’re still going to be showing up at the door of hospitals and clinics needing care.”
Some groups, such as Afghans, Ukrainians and Iraqis, were often brought here after helping the U.S. in war efforts, putting their lives in danger and making life in their home country untenable.
“In the case of the Afghans, this is pretty much a knife in the back to those folks who helped the United States when the United States needed help in their country,” said David Meyer, a board member of the Bloomington Refugee Support Network in Indiana, where he personally helps seven refugee families from Afghanistan, Honduras, Iraq, Nicaragua and Syria.
The Senate bill takes Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and even food stamps off the table for most refugees. There are a few narrow exceptions for people with green cards, some Cuban migrants waiting for citizenship, and some Micronesians and Marshall Islands natives with treaty rights, said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
That also applies to immigrants with legal status who don’t have green cards: people with asylum, immigrant victims of domestic violence, immigrant victims of sex trafficking and parolees — such as Afghans — admitted due to urgent humanitarian reasons, as well as to refugees.










It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.


– Shelby Gonzales, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities


“There’s going to be more emergency health care needs because uninsured people will be delaying care,” Gonzales said. “It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.”
The bill also cuts funding for expansion states to pay for emergency care in hospitals. Increased costs could force some states to drop Medicaid expansion altogether, spreading the pain to low-income U.S. citizens as well, Gonzales said.
“It’s one more reason states are looking at their budgets and they’re having to make decisions about their Medicaid expansion program,” Gonzales said.
In Indiana, Meyer said, Afghan women especially often need food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to get by at first. It takes them a long time to learn to read and write since they were not allowed to attend any school under the Taliban.
“They arrived in our community totally illiterate in their native language and starting from scratch learning English, so that’s a huge impediment to being gainfully employed,” Meyer said. Even once they’ve become self-sufficient enough to get off food stamps and Medicaid, many still need the support of the Affordable Care Act to get health care.
Removing all subsidized health care “would have a devastating effect on those families, and not just Afghans but Syrians, people from the Democratic Republic of Congo and others that have been relocated to south-central Indiana,” Meyer said.
‘Big Beautiful Bill’ dings states that offer health care to some immigrants here legally

Indiana hosted more than 10,500 of the nearly 460,000 refugees who arrived in the United States between 2013 and 2023, according to a 2023 report from the nonprofit Immigration Research Initiative. In fiscal 2024, another 1,380 arrived in Indiana, mostly from Congo and Burma, but including 90 people from Afghanistan, according to State Department records.
In North Carolina, there were 276 new Afghan refugees in fiscal 2024 among 2,730 total new refugees. Even professional Afghans such as doctors and lawyers struggle at first in low-wage jobs, said Woomer-Deters, of the North Carolina Justice Center. It takes time for them to get accreditation and language skills to practice their professions here, she said.
“A lot of these folks need their food stamps, Medicaid — they need these programs for an adjustment period when they get here. And these are people we’ve invited to come and have vetted,” she said.
A Congressional Budget Office report June 29 estimated that almost 12 million people, including 1.4 million immigrants covered by state-only programs, would lose health insurance under the Senate plan.
A Republican response to an earlier CBO report emphasized that the bill would save states $13.1 billion in Medicaid spending over 10 years, “freeing up resources they can choose to reinvest to further strengthen care for the most vulnerable Americans.”
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, however, called that conclusion misleading in its own response in turn.
“These savings would largely result from millions of people losing health coverage — hardly an outcome worth celebrating,” the response said.
More states offer health care coverage for certain immigrants, noncitizens

Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, said there was one small positive change in the Senate version compared to the House version.
States will no longer be penalized for using the option to cover some immigrant children and pregnant women.
And the Senate version would not penalize expansion states for offering Medicaid to immigrants on humanitarian parole, but only because that help for parolees was ended in entirely, along with help for refugees and other kind of immigrants with legal status who lack green cards, Cuello said.
“In other words, they are blocking all paths to health care,” Cuello said in an emailed statement. “This is not an attack on the undocumented. It’s an attack on lawfully present immigrants.”

(Courtesy of Pheasants Forever)Pheasants Forever has enrolled a new landowner in its Public Access to Habitat (PATH) program that will open nearly 30,000 new acres of private land to public hunting and recreation in northwestern South Dakota.
Pheasants Forever is a nonprofit conservation group that works to improve habitat and expand public access to hunters and other outdoor enthusiasts. The group’s Ziebach County project is the largest single enrollment of the PATH initiative, which launched in South Dakota and Nebraska in 2023. 
With this addition, the program has opened 62,581 acres of privately owned land to public access across South Dakota through 59 contracts in 31 counties.
The program complements the South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks Walk-In Area program, which pays landowners $1.50 to $2 per acre to open land for public access.

Public Access To Habitat offers landowners up to an additional $25 per acre to further incentivize high-quality habitat to be enrolled in the state’s Walk-In Area program. Landowners must enroll eligible acres in PATH for 10 years.
Habitats — including shelterbelts, wetlands, conservation easements and grasslands — enrolled in the program must remain untouched, except for necessary management tasks (such as emergency grazing for livestock). Biologists work with landowners to ensure enrolled acres are productive for wildlife.
 South Dakota Tourism and onX Hunt, a hunting GPS service, funded the initiative’s first year in the state with a $250,000 grant. South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks and onX continue to support the project.
The newly enrolled 29,725 acres of rolling plains support pheasants, grouse, deer and pronghorn, according to Pheasants Forever.
“Since we launched PATH in South Dakota, the program has proven we can have a profound impact on the quality of both access and habitat across the entire state,” said Casey Sill, a spokesman for Pheasants Forever.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The average cost for a 10-person Fourth of July will cost $70.92, which is 30 cents less than last summer, but the second highest cookout cost since 2013 when American Farm Bureau Federation began its annual survey on the topic. 
Beef, canned goods and hand-picked crops have the highest price increases from last year, due likely to low domestic cattle inventory, aluminum tariffs and the cost of labor. 
The American Farm Bureau survey assumes a gathering of 10 people who will consume: cheeseburgers, chicken breasts, pork chops, potato chips, canned pork and beans, fresh strawberries, homemade potato salad, fresh-squeezed lemonade, chocolate chip cookies and ice cream.
Canned of pork and beans had the steepest increase, 8.2% or 20 cents, from last year. The bureau said labor costs along the supply chain and steep tariffs on aluminum are likely to blame.

Homemade lemonade will also cost 20 cents more per pitcher this year, and strawberries 8 cents more per pound, due to a continued trend of high labor costs in the specialty crop sector. 
The cost of ground beef also increased to $13.33 for two pounds, which is nearly 60 cents more than the $12.77 cost in 2024. While normally a crowd favorite, it will cost families nearly $20 to make 10 cheeseburgers this weekend, according to the survey prices. 
  The annual cookout cost survey from American Farm Bureau shows a slight decline from 2024, but still a high cost for the holiday gathering. (Graphic courtesy of American Farm Bureau Federation)
U.S. cattle herd size has been declining since 2019, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported the 2025 herd size was 8% lower than 2019 herd. The amount of beef imported to the U.S. has also gone up in the time frame. 
Pork chops, on the other hand, had the largest decrease in price from last year. Three pounds of pork chops this weekend should run consumers about $14.13, which is nearly 9% less than the cut cost last year. The survey concludes this is due to high domestic pork supplies.
The cost of chicken breasts declined slightly from last year’s cookout prices but the cost of eggs increased, which made potato salad about 20 cents more expensive this year. Poultry have been affected by the ongoing highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has caused fluctuating prices as the supply chains are impacted. 
Since January, U.S. has imported about 10 times the amount of shell eggs it imported in the same period in 2024 as part of the administration’s plan to combat the bird flu. Wholesale egg prices have declined by more than 60% since January, but the American Farm Bureau report shows the cost for consumers for just four eggs is up 54% from last summer. 
The bureau survey also breaks prices down by region and found cookouts on the East Coast are the cheapest this year at $63.79, followed by the south who can feed a party of 10 for $68.93. Gatherings in the West average at $73.50 and Midwestern gatherings come in as the second most expensive at $69.87. 
Farmers not pocketing fair share, advocates say
Consumer increases don’t necessarily mean higher prices for farmers, however. On average, farmers and ranchers receive about $0.16 per consumer dollar spent on food, according to the latest “Farmer’s Share” report from National Farmers Union. 
Rob Larew, the organization’s president said it’s important to highlight the “growing imbalance” in the food system. 
“Family farmers and ranchers are working harder than ever, yet taking home less, while corporate monopolies in processing, distribution, and retail rake in record profits,” Larew said. “Farmers deserve a fair share of the food dollar, and consumers deserve a food system that works for everyone, not just a handful of powerful corporations.”
According to the report, a rancher takes home $2.08 on a one pound package of ground beef sold for $5.99. A lettuce farmer gets an even lower cut, receiving about 8.2% of the consumer dollar.
Consumers also feel like their dollars don’t stretch as far. According to the latest food and farm index from Iowa Farm Bureau, price is the number one factor for Iowa shoppers as they fill their grocery carts, even as more consumers say they want to buy locally raised products. 
Christopher Pudenz, an Iowa Farm Bureau economist, said price changes in Iowa-grown commodities “mostly reflect” supply and demand cycles. 
“The Fourth of July is, of course, a celebration of our freedom but also a celebration of the American spirit, one embodied by our nation’s farmers,” Pudenz said in a press release. “Despite challenges like rising costs and weather impacts, Iowa farmers continue to do what they’ve always done—work hard, adapt and provide for American families.”

As drunk driving remains a deadly and persistent issue across the United States, new data reveals Delaware is leading the nation in prevention, with the lowest number of DUI arrests per capita.
According to a national analysis of drunk-driving statistics, Delaware reports just 43 drunk-driving arrests per 100,000 drivers, placing it at the very bottom of the list for DUI rates. That figure stands in stark contrast to states like South Dakota (879 arrests per 100,000 drivers) and North Dakota (833), which lead the nation in DUI arrests and are labeled as the country’s “drunk-driving capitals.”
Other low-ranking states include Illinois (70), Florida (94), and Louisiana (116). While every state has laws banning driving under the influence, the data suggests that enforcement, public awareness, access to transportation, and state-specific programs all play a role in how often drunk driving occurs.
Officials in Delaware say they are encouraged by the ranking but remain focused on prevention. Jeffrey Horvath, Deputy Director of the Delaware Office of Highway Safety, stated that the state is proud to see its efforts reflected in the data, but emphasized that the work is far from over.
RELATED STORY: Free Lyft and Uber vouchers offered to Delawareans this July 4th to prevent drunk driving
“It is very encouraging that Delaware has one of the lowest DUI rates in the nation when comparing arrests per 100,000 drivers,” said Horvath. “However, the Delaware Office of Highway Safety believes that even one impaired driver on our roadways is far too many. Impaired driving is a very serious issue that endangers lives, causes preventable crashes, and devastates families and communities across our state.”
Horvath emphasized the agency’s ongoing efforts. “The Delaware Office of Highway Safety is committed to the mission of reducing impaired driving through enforcement, education, and outreach to keep our roads safe for everyone.”
The dangers of drunk driving
Nationwide, 37 people die every day from drunk-driving crashes—that’s about one death every 39 minutes. Each year, over 13,000 lives are lost, and 300,000 people are treated in emergency departments due to alcohol-impaired driving injuries.
Despite the known risks, drunk driving remains prevalent across the U.S., with more than 1 million arrests annually and 1 in every 50 American drivers caught under the influence over the past five years. States with large rural populations tend to report higher rates, partly due to less access to public transit and fewer sobriety checkpoints.
RELATED STORY: Teen driving deaths alarmingly high with Delaware ranking among worst states
Many states are turning to ignition interlock devices, which prevent a vehicle from starting if alcohol is detected, to combat repeat offenses. These devices are now mandatory for DUI offenders in 34 states and have been shown to reduce repeat drunk driving by 67%.
Fourth of July weekend reminder: Use Sober Ride Programs
As the Fourth of July holiday approaches—a time when alcohol-related crashes often spike—Delaware’s Office of Highway Safety (OHS) is once again offering its Sober Rides program to encourage safe travel and prevent impaired driving.
Through the initiative, Delawareans can claim free ride-share vouchers worth up to $20 for use on Uber or Lyft during the holiday.

(Monty Rakusen via Getty Images)TOPEKA — American Lung Association advocacy director Sara Prem doesn’t want to internalize consequences of the Sunflower Electric Power Corp. securing a two-year exemption from tighter limits on pollution at its electricity plant in southwest Kansas.
Sunflower’s generating station at Holcomb was among 68 coal plants in two-dozen states given permission by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to sidestep elevated mercury and arsenic controls set to take effect in July 2027. The reprieve was tied to President Donald Trump’s executive order in April that said lack of technology and national security considerations could make compliance too onerous for U.S. plants generating power by burning coal.
“We’re creating the risk of more pollution in that community,” Prem said. “With these coal plants, you’re getting a lot of pollutants. It’s not just mercury. Inhaling those particulates can lead to a wide range of health effects.”
She said amplified restraints on emissions from coal plants could save lives because reliance on the fossil fuel damaged people’s lungs, made children susceptible to illness and contributed to climate problems.
The Trump administration shouldn’t have abandoned reforms President Joe Biden delivered to the country’s 200 coal-fired facilities, Prem said.
In 2024, Biden’s EPA directed utilities to adhere to elevated emission standards for toxic metals and to implement a 70% reduction for mercury releases at plants fueled by brown coal. The Democratic president required generating stations making use of coal to address 90% of carbon pollution.
To qualify for Trump’s presidential exemption, Sunflower Electric was told to send an email request to the EPA and await the president’s response. Sunflower Electric was the lone coal plant in Kansas to get an exemption, but others were awarded in Oklahoma and Missouri.
Hays-headquartered Sunflower Electric, which is owned by cooperatives serving 58 counties in central and western Kansas, didn’t respond to requests for comment about the exemption. On social media, Sunflower Electric celebrated Trump’s work to derail Biden’s amended emission rules.
“Sunflower is encouraged by the EPA’s recent actions to address regulations impacting electric cooperatives,” Sunflower Electric said. “As electricity demand soars, it’s essential to have policies that ensure reliable, affordable power while protecting the environment.”
The Holcomb plant years ago deployed scrubbers and other technology to limit release of pollution in a process that burned coal, heated water and pushed turbines to generate electricity.
In March, Sunflower Electric announced start of construction on its third solar power project. The facility near Dodge City would — if completed — be the largest solar complex in Kansas. The cooperative previously collaborated on solar projects near Russell and closer to the Holcomb coal plant in Johnson City.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported coal’s share of the nation’s power generation had fallen under 20% after supplying approximately half of the country’s electricity in 2000. Natural gas and renewable sources, including solar and wind, absorbed coal’s market share.
Jim Matheson, CEO of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, said the reprieve for coal plants addressed “unlawful, unrealistic and unachievable” rules advanced late in Biden’s term. The association said Biden’s rules would have been costly to utility companies.
“They will jeopardize the reliability of the electric grid for as long as they remain in effect,” Matheson said.
The federal Clean Air Act included provisions enabling a U.S. president to temporarily exempt industrial sites from new regulations.
Trump said the exemptions were necessary because emission-control technology required to meet Biden’s mandate wasn’t widely available in a commercially viable form. In addition, the president said adherence to his predecessor’s rules raised “the unacceptable risk of the shutdown of many coal-fired power plants, eliminating thousands of jobs, placing our electrical grid at risk and threatening broader, harmful economic and energy security effects.”
“The (Biden) rule places severe burdens on coal-fired power plants and, through its indirect effects, on the viability of our nation’s coal sector,” Trump’s order said.
A coalition of 12 environmental and community organizations filed a lawsuit in June against the Trump administration for the alleged illegal use of presidential authority for benefit of the exemptions.
The Natural Resources Defense Council, which is a plaintiff in the lawsuit, said the majority of coal plants given exemptions had cleaning equipment installed that could meet — or has met — the safer pollution limits. The council said one-fourth of coal units receiving an exemption were scheduled to retire within 5 years.
Prem, the Kansas and Nebraska advocate for the American Lung Association, said Trump’s bid to breathe life into the coal industry meant exempted coal-burning units could avoid installing continuous monitoring equipment to alert communities of excessive emissions.
The real-time data was to have been provided to regulators to track compliance with emissions restrictions, she said.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)Among the North Carolinians who will have the stability of their lives disrupted by the massive Medicaid funding cuts and policy changes making their way through Congress right now in the so-called “one big, beautiful bill” are many of the people I and my colleagues work to assist at the Raleigh-based nonprofit, Healing Transitions.
As our website explains, Healing Transitions offers innovative peer-based, recovery-oriented services to homeless, uninsured and underserved individuals with alcoholism and other drug addictions. Our program is specifically designed to rekindle a person’s desire and ability to return to a meaningful and productive life.
Over the last year, we have made some especially encouraging progress by getting clients with medical issues enrolled in Medicaid. Now, when they finish the program after a year or more, they leave with a job, drug-free housing, connectivity to the recovery community, and a relationship with a primary care physician through Medicaid coverage. The latter arrangement results in better management of chronic medical conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes. These men and women have less emergency visits and less hospitalizations.
Unfortunately, under the terms of giant budget reconciliation bill advancing in Washington, this progress is in jeopardy. Under the Medicaid changes contained in the legislation, enrollees will be subject to new work requirements and mandated to undergo periodic re-registration to verify their employment. While work requirements themselves will not be a problem for our clients, the administrative hassle of complying will undoubtedly cause problems.
The inevitable result: Medicaid coverage will lapse in some cases and so too will the patient’s relationship with their primary care physician and their management of health issues. Health care costs will inevitably increase, and health quality will decline.
In the few states where work requirements for Medicaid coverage have been previously implemented, administrative costs have exceeded savings in healthcare expenditures. Also, deficient compliance with these administrative steps have brought interruption of Medicaid coverage.
In the United States, we spend twice as much per person as other industrialized nations on health care, and we have worse health outcomes. Our average life expectancy is lower, and we have more preventable deaths. We are the only industrialized nation without health insurance in one form or another for all citizens. Why can we not learn from those examples?
Sadly, the proposed Medicaid cuts will double down on our failed model. With congressional approval of this “big, beautiful bill” our nation will move in the wrong direction when it comes to both healthcare costs and health outcomes.
Do we care? By all indications, far too many of our elected leaders do not.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/medicaidsign-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-03 10:03:55.673317

If you or someone you know may be experiencing a mental health crisis, contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by dialing or texting “988.”
Elliott Hinkle experienced depression and suicidal thoughts even before entering the foster care system in Casper, Wyoming, at age 15. 
At the time, Hinkle, who is transgender, struggled with their sexual identity and gender issues, and their difficulties continued in foster care. They felt like they had no one to confide in — not their foster parents, not church leaders, not their caseworker.
“To my knowledge, I don’t remember ever taking a suicide screening,” Hinkle said. “No one ever said: ‘Are you having thoughts of taking your life? Do you feel hopeless?’”

With their psychological and behavioral health needs left unaddressed, Hinkle’s depression and suicidal thoughts worsened.
“Do I stay in the closet and feel terrible and want to end my life?” Hinkle said. “Or do I come out and lose all my supports, which also feels dangerous?”
Children in foster care are significantly more likely to have mental health issues, researchers say. They attempt or complete suicide at rates three to four times that of youths in the general population, according to several studies.
LGBTQ+ people in foster care, like Hinkle, are at an even higher risk of having suicidal thoughts. 
Yet despite the concentration of young people at risk of serious mental illness and suicide, proactive efforts to screen foster children and get them the treatment they need have been widely absent from the system. And now, efforts underway to provide widespread screening, diagnosis, and treatment are threatened by sweeping funding cuts the Trump administration is using to reshape health care programs nationwide. 
In June, federal officials announced they would shut down a suicide hotline serving LGBTQ+ youths as part of those cuts.
Children in foster care use a disproportionate amount of Medicaid-funded mental health services. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump’s massive budget package working its way through Congress contains substantial shifts in Medicaid funding and policies that are projected to drastically reduce services in many states.
“I think anybody who cares about kids’ well-being and mental health is concerned about the possibility of reduced Medicaid funding,” said Cynthia Ewell Foster, a child psychologist and clinical associate professor in the University of Michigan psychiatry department. “The most vulnerable children, including those in foster care, are already having trouble getting the services they need.” 
A lack of federal standards and other system-level issues create barriers to psychological and behavioral care in the child welfare system, said Colleen Katz, a professor at Hunter College’s Silberman School of Social Work in New York.
“When you’re talking about anyone getting screened for suicide ideation upon entrance into the system, it’s inconsistent at best,” she said.  
Katz said all children entering foster care should have a brief, standardized suicide screening embedded into their initial medical assessment. And more screenings need to be conducted throughout a foster care stay, she said, because youths getting ready to transition out of the system are also vulnerable.  
Hinkle, now 31, said the summer before they aged out of the system was “one of the darkest periods, because I was coming to terms with the church not wanting me to be gay and I was about to lose stable housing and whatever foster care support there was.”
Katz studied transition-age youths in foster care in California, which has the highest numbers of placements in foster care nationwide. According to her analysis, 42% of study participants had thoughts of taking their life and 24% had attempted suicide, and she expects findings would be similar in other states.
Katz also examined suicide screening tools and found many that already exist could work and be easily administered by trained child welfare workers or alternative frontline service providers, or embedded in existing mental health services.
Still, the quality of services varies by state and locality and can hinder attempts to curb suicides. 
Julie Collins, vice president of practice excellence at the Child Welfare League of America, which advocates for improvements to the child welfare system, said the gap in suicide prevention in foster care mirrors the overall nationwide void of behavioral health services for children and adolescents. “The preparation of people coming into the field isn’t what it needs to be,” Collins said of the lack of training for caseworkers.
Ewell Foster is trying to change that. 
She worked with the state of Michigan to redefine and update the competencies required to earn an undergraduate certificate in child welfare in the state. Eighteen colleges and universities that offer certificate programs in child welfare in Michigan now teach about suicide prevention. 
  April Miller entered the foster care system in Minnesota at age 3 and said she endured several traumatic events in her early life, including witnessing a murder. “The child welfare system as a whole neglected me,” she said. (Couresy photo)
“It’s something the workforce has asked for,” Ewell Foster said. “They need real clear guidance on what to do when they are worried about someone.”
So far, Ewell Foster’s effort to change the wider system has not run into any roadblocks. Her work with Michigan’s child welfare agency is still being funded under a grant administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. 
Agency spokesperson Danielle Bennett said such grants will continue for up to three years. 
However, the future of the federal agency has been in question for months. The Trump administration has laid off hundreds of its employees and has proposed folding its functions into another agency. 
Some states have made changes to address the foster care gaps on their own, but often it has taken legal action to spark changes in suicide prevention efforts.
In Kansas, officials made several changes after the state settled the McIntyre v. Howard class action lawsuit in 2021 on behalf of foster children who the suit alleged were subjected to inadequate access to mental health resources and moved from home to home frequently.
The state increased salaries for social workers in the child welfare system and reduced their caseloads, among other things. 
Other states, including Texas, have implemented similar changes after facing lawsuits.
Still, experts caution that the changes taking place in foster care systems are not enough to steer outcomes. 
Lily Brown, an assistant professor of psychology and director of the Center for the Treatment and Study of Anxiety at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, said moving the needle in suicide prevention will require implementing a universal risk assessment for children in state care. 
Brown recently sought a grant to fund and implement free, universal suicide risk screening in foster care throughout Pennsylvania. She had several counties agree to the project, but not enough to support her application — the study wouldn’t have had enough participants to work statistically, she said.
Without such studies, foster care systems nationwide can’t meet the needs of children, she said. 
April Miller, 27, entered the system in Minnesota at age 3. As a Native American, she is part of a group that is overrepresented in foster care. 
“The child welfare system as a whole neglected me,” said Miller, who said she endured several traumatic events in her early life, including witnessing a murder. 
“I did a lot of self-harm and had thoughts of suicide but didn’t have access to means, which is why I am still alive,” she said.
Today, Miller is a social worker and suicide prevention coordinator in Bemidji, Minnesota.
Similarly, Hinkle’s experience in the system made them driven to change the trajectory of other young people.
Hinkle provides training, consultation, and policy development services at Unicorn Solutions in Oregon in support of youths and young adults affected by systems such as child welfare, with a particular focus on the LGBTQ+ community. 
They said they are committed to making sure that sexual identity and gender topics are not avoided in the system.
“I think every young person should feel loved and cared for,” Hinkle said.

According to a press release by the American Pyrotechnic Association, U.S. firework companies rely almost entirely on China to produce 99% of consumer fireworks and 90% of professional fireworks displays. The release also states that the current rate “remains unmanageable for most industry operators,” and adds that currently there is “no viable domestic manufacturing alternative at scale.”
 Many of the tariffs for 2025 arrived so late in the fireworks season that businesses were not “contractually able,” to pass on costs to customers but future tariffs could lead to an increase in consumer costs according to APA.
“Fireworks are an iconic part of America’s celebration of freedom,” said Julie L. Heckman, APA executive director. “This isn’t about politics. It’s about making sure communities can continue to celebrate while giving small businesses a path forward through supply chain challenges.”

(Photo by Emily Grason/Washington Sea Grant)On a sandy beach in a state park in Ketchikan, a group of local beachcombers encountered something ominous: shells of two invasive European green crabs, shed as part of the creatures’ growth process.
That discovery, made during a June 6 beach survey that was part of a class held by the University of Alaska Southeast Ketchikan campus, led to more in the community.
It makes Ketchikan the newest known Alaska beachhead in a northward invasion of non-native crabs that are known to wreak havoc on native species and habitats.
European green crabs, first confirmed to be in Alaska when their shells were discovered in 2022 on Annette Island in the far southeast corner of the state, are likely here for good, said the UAS professor who was one of the class instructors and helped lead the beach surveys.
“They have continued to spread. They will continue to spread,” said Barbara Morgan, who is based in Ketchikan. “They are expected to spread through Southeast Alaska, probably most of Southcentral — kind of the southern coast of Southcentral. And maybe, depending on water temperature and how tolerant they are to the colder water temperatures, they might go up into the really southern part of the Bristol Bay area, too.”
In time, they could threaten some of Alaska’s most important habitats for salmon and other fish.
The crabs eat salmon fry, juvenile native crabs like Dungeness and other fish, and they mow down eelgrass beds that are important Alaska fish habitat.
“Green crab could potentially damage Alaska’s multi-billion dollar fisheries industries, especially for salmon, crab, and mariculture operations,” the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has warned.
European green crabs were first found in waters of the U.S. East Coast in the 1800s, believed to have been transported in ships’ ballast water. In 1989, the first green crabs were discovered in U.S. West Coast waters, also believed to have been carried accidentally in ballast water. Over the following years, they spread northward. The first sightings in British Columbia were in 1998.
The Alaska first discovery, at Annette Island, was about 30 miles south of the beach site where Morgan’s class found the crab shells in June. And last summer, green crab shells were found at Gravina Island, just west of Ketchikan.

	An eventual discovery in Ketchikan was largely expected. But the precise site of the June 6 discovery — at Refuge Cove State Recreation Site — was a bit surprising because of the nature of the site, Morgan said.
Green crabs generally prefer estuarine areas, places where freshwater and saltwater meet, and places with thick eelgrass, she said. But the Refuge Cove beach site is sandy and not an estuary, and thus not considered to be a prime spot for the crabs.
Crabs’ upper shells, called carapaces, are discarded periodically as the animals grow and need larger shells. Discovery of the molted shells suggests that the invasive crab were in the larval stage when they were pushed by currents north to Alaska, Morgan said.
After the first two shells were found during the class survey, the discoveries in the community “snowballed,” with additional shells found at Refuge Cove, plus more at other sites along the Ketchikan road system, she said. It is likely that there are more at other sites that are less accessible for surveys, she said.
How to respond?
The species’ name can be confusing because the crabs are not necessarily green, Morgan said. They can be brown or yellow or reddish, or a mixture of colors, she said. Meanwhile, some native crabs that do belong in Alaska are green, including kelp crabs, and should not be mistaken for the invaders, she said.
The “European” part of the name is not accurate, either, she said. “Yes, they came from Europe; they’re not in Europe anymore,” she said.
Morgan and other invasive species experts are trying to spread awareness — and the message about what the crabs look like. Telltale signs come from the shape of the shells, which have three bumps between the crabs’ eyes and five spikes on either side.
The Metlakatla Indian Community, a Tribal government on Annette Island, has been particularly active in combatting European green crabs.
The Tribe established a detection program in 2020 and made the first discovery of shells in 2022, as well as the Gravina Island discoveries last year.
Through its program, the Tribe has also trapped thousands of European green crabs. The total had reached about 3,000 as of last summer, according to the Department of Fish and Game, and it continues to grow.

After that first discovery, the Metlakatla Indian Community-NOAA Fisheries team found more carapaces, some dead crabs and dozens of live crabs. (Photo by Linda Shaw/NOAA Fisheries_
 

	In just the past month, the Tribal team trapped over 300 of the live crabs on Gravina Island, said Ian Hudson, a fisheries biologist who coordinates the Tribe’s European green crab program.
“This year there has been an explosion in numbers, and we’re not at all surprised that Ketchikan is finding carapace,” he said by email.
Metlakatla’s efforts are highlighted in the Alaska Department of Fish and Game’s 2023-2028 plan for combatting European green crabs. That plan lays out steps for prevention, early detection, rapid response and control.
But by now, full prevention may not be possible anymore, Morgan said.
With millions of European green crabs on the West Coast, and with currents that continue t send their larvae north, it is highly unlikely that all incursions could be prevented, she said.
“Even if we get rid of all of them in Alaska, we would need to build a fence across Dixon Entrance, a fine net. And that’s obviously not going to happen,” she said, referring to the maritime border site between Canada and Alaska.
Instead, she said, “functional eradication” like what the Metlakatla Indian Tribe is doing with trapping is likely to be increasingly important, with focuses on key sites important to native species like salmon and Dungeness crab. Baseline surveys can help identify those areas that need to be most protected, she said.
Part of a wider invasive threat
While the European green crab is considered to be among the world’s most damaging invasive species, it is not the only one that threatens Alaska’s environment and fishing industry.
Another example is elodea, a freshwater plant often used in aquariums. First found in Eyak Lake in Cordova in 1982, it has spread to other lakes and streams in Southcentral and Interior Alaska. Potential economic losses — to commercial sockeye salmon and to recreational floatplane pilots — could be well over $1 billion, Tobias Schwoerer, a University of Alaska Fairbanks economist, estimated in a 2017 study.
Invasive northern pike in Southcentral Alaska, which have proved to be persistent, also pose ecological and economic threats. The fish prey on salmon, trout and other native species. The Department of Fish and Game has a program to remove invasive pike and try to limit their spread.

	For now, much of the work to combat nonnative species is coordinated by the Alaska Invasive Species Partnership, a coalition of government agencies, university experts, nonprofits and community organizations.
The partnership has advocated for years for the establishment of a more robust organization within state government, an invasive species council, to organize wider protection and rapid response, if needed.
Bills pending in the Alaska Legislature would do that. One measure, House Bill 191, made it through one committee. A Senate version, Senate Bill 174, has not had a hearing, however.
In past years, similar bills progressed through the Legislature but failed to make it to final passage. The most recent was in 2022, when a bill to establish a state invasive species council passed the House by 33-2 margin but failed to reach the Senate floor before that session’s adjournment.
Proponents hope results in the coming session will be more successful.
The sponsor of the current House bill, Rep. Rebecca Himschoot, I-Sitka, worries not only about green crabs moving their way through Southeast Alaska but also invasive plants like knotweed that have appeared in important community spots like Harbor Mountain.
“Each year, there’s more knotweed and less salmonberries,” she said in an interview late in the session. She hopes the bill will win final passage next year, she said.
Sen. Forrest Dunbar, D-Anchorage, is another proponent of an invasive species council.
He said he has been aware of invasive species since his childhood in Cordova, where he and a friend earned money from a neighbor by killing invasive black slugs at about a nickel apiece. Later, as a member of the Anchorage Assembly, he worked on efforts to remove invasive chokecherry trees, which were introduced as ornamentals but have since crowded out native species along the city’s greenbelts.
Dunbar acknowledged concerns that an invasive species council would cost the state money because it would require a dedicated employee in the Department of Fish and Game. But he argues that failing to set up such a council would cause more expense in the long run.
“I would say, we can’t afford to not prevent invasive species from entering Alaska,” Dunbar said in an interview near the end of this year’s session. “It is very expensive to have invasive species to start pushing out native species.”

Scheduling note: WhatMatters is celebrating the Fourth of July and will return to your inboxes on Monday.
Faced with steep budget cuts, phone lines that provide free mental health support to tens of thousands of residents across California have begun layoffs and the elimination of crucial services, reports CalMatters’ Jocelyn Wiener.
These so-called “warm lines” assist people during non-emergencies, offering emotional support and mental health resources. Parents Anonymous’ helpline, which serves about 24,000 people a year and is endorsed by First Partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom, has already laid off staff. The organization requested $3 million a year from the state, but the budget deal Gov. Gavin Newsom and lawmakers hammered out last week did not include funding.
Pomona resident Antonia Rios said she contacts the helpline as much as seven times a week. Rios is a mother of seven, and lives with anxiety, depression and other mental health afflictions. For Rios, “it breaks my heart they want to cut” the helpline.

Rios: “The helpline was a safe haven for me. It saved my life on many occasions.”

In Orange County, the warm line for the National Alliance on Mental Illness fields 900 calls a day, according to its Chief Executive Amy Durham. The organization is now preparing to let go of 127 staffers, many of whom used the warm line themselves and later became peer counselors. 

Durham: “Now we’re going to wait until everyone’s in crisis. I can’t imagine it’s cost effective or humane.” 

The nonprofit that oversees the California Peer Run Warm Line, which I reported about in June, requested $15 million a year in renewed funding. Because it received only $5 million this budget year, it will shut down its Spanish-speaking helpline that it also provides, writes Jocelyn.

To save the state a projected $1 billion in the next few years, Newsom and the Legislature approved a state budget deal that also includes a provision, in the form of a trailer bill, to freeze new Medi-Cal enrollment for adult immigrants who do not have legal status. 
The Legislature approved the budget mostly along party lines, but four Democrats who are part of the 35-member Latino Caucus voted against the Medi-Cal cuts or abstained from voting, writes CalMatters’ Kristen Hwang.
Their opposition shines a light on the fine line Latino Caucus members must walk between cutting state spending and expanding health care access for immigrants. The caucus is one of the most influential political blocs in California, and has historically championed bills related to health care, labor and education that support immigrants without legal status. 

Sen. Caroline Menjivar, a Van Nuys Democrat who voted against the Medi-Cal cuts: “It’s the ‘othering,’ … we’ve created a hierarchy of what human is eligible and what human is ineligible.”

Lawmakers shelve eviction relief bill

Underscoring how difficult it is to pass renters’ rights legislation in the face of big spending from business and landlord groups, a bill that would have given renters more time to pay past-due rent before being evicted failed to advance out of committee last week.
As CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow explains, renters are currently allowed three days to pay their past rent before landlords can begin the eviction process. A proposal by Sen. Aisha Wahab, a Fremont Democrat, would have extended that to two weeks. 
The measure didn’t get enough votes to pass through the Assembly’s judiciary committee — highlighting the rift between progressive Democrats who support more rental protections and those concerned with the rights of landlords.
Landlord associations, groups representing the building industry and business groups including the California Chamber of Commerce, opposed the measure. Since 2015 these groups have donated at least $13.7 million to state lawmakers since 2015.

Ron Estes of Kansas honored the memory of one of his congressional interns who was shot to death in Washington, D.C.
Estes offered condolences to the family of Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, 21, of Granby, Massachusetts. The Metropolitan Police Department reported Tarpinian-Jachym was the victim of a shooting Monday night in northwest D.C.
Law enforcement officials said multiple people stepped from a vehicle and opened fire on a group of individuals, striking Tarpinian-Jachym, an adult woman and a teenager. All three were taken to a hospital, where Tarpinian-Jachym died Tuesday.
“I will remember his kind heart and how he always greeted anyone who entered our office with a cheerful smile,” Estes said in a joint statement with his wife, state Rep. Susan Estes. “We are grateful to Eric for his service to Kansas’ 4th District and the country.”
The Kansas congressman asked for prayers on behalf of Tarpinian-Jachym’s family and asked that the family’s privacy be respected.

The Connecticut Department of Transportation has proposed fare increases to all Metro North and CT Rail services in the state. (Photo by Dana Edwards/CT Mirror)Connecticut is planning to raise fares on Metro-North Railroad and CT Rail transit throughout the state later this year in order to cover the increased cost of operating rail services.
Fares are slated to rise by 5% beginning Sept. 1, and another 5% on July 1, 2026. That means a rush-hour one-way trip between New Haven and Stamford on Metro-North, for example, would rise from $8.75 to $9.50 by July of next year. An off-peak one-way trip between Hartford and New Haven on CT Rail would rise from $8.25 to $8.75, and a one-way trip from Stamford to Grand Central Terminal on Metro-North during peak hours would rise from $16 to $17.75 by this time next year. 
Officials with the state Department of Transportation said the fare increase was necessary to keep the trains running.
“The cost to operate the existing level of service has increased year over year,” said Dan Baker, a transportation supervising planner with the department during a public meeting in Stamford on fare increases. “So in order to maintain the current level of trains and rail service and account for rising costs, fares needed to increase to offset a funding gap.”
DOT had requested $327 million from the state to cover the cost of rail services in fiscal year 2026, which began July 1, but the legislature’s budget only included $316 million. The increase in fares will make up for that gap, officials said.
Connecticut last increased fares in 2023 when the Hartford line, New Haven line and Shore Line East faced a 4.5% increase. Before that, fares had stayed the same since 2018.
Baker said even with the planned increases this year and next, inflation will still have surpassed rail fare increases. Since 2018, inflation has driven up consumer prices by approximately 28%, whereas by 2026 rail fares will have increased by 14% to 15%, according to DOT data.
Fares account for roughly half of Metro-North’s operating costs, but a far smaller slice — less than 10% — of the Hartford and Shore Line East rail lines’ operating costs. Most of the rest of the funding comes from the state.
Many lines faced service and funding cuts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ridership has rebounded unevenly across lines since then.
Over that same period, the state has invested in new transportation and development projects, like the Connecticut River bridge connecting Old Saybrook and Old Lyme.
Commuters’ concern

	
Some commuters expressed opposition to the state’s plan to raise fares, noting problems with the current service, including its delayed restoration after the Covid cutbacks, and general frustration about the rising cost of living throughout the state.Susan Feaster, a frequent commuter on Shore Line East rail, said riders shouldn’t be on the hook for the state not fully funding rail transit. “Fare increases are never good, and doing a complete 10% by next year is a lot,” said Feaster, who also founded the Shore Line East Riders Advocacy Group in 2018.
Feaster said lawmakers boosted funding for child care and education in the coming biennium budget, which will enable many parents to work. “But you know, they should probably put some of that money into mass transit to help the people trying to get to work to pay those taxes, right?” she said.
Jim Gildea, Chairman of the Connecticut Public Transportation Council, said, “While I recognize the necessity of increasing rail rates and the fact it’s been a while since the last increase, I have serious reservations about raising bus and transit fares.” (Currently, bus fares aren’t slated to increase, though the Governor proposed bus fare hikes earlier this year.)
“These services are vital for many individuals facing economic challenges, and now may not be the right time to impose additional financial burdens on them,” he said.
DOT officials said they performed a service and fare equity analysis to assess the effects fare increases would have on low-income and minority customers. “We found that the proposed fare increases for 2025 and 2026 for Hartford line, Shoreline east and New Haven line do not have a disparate impact on minority customers, nor a disproportionate burden on low income customers, whether analyzed individually or in aggregate,” Baker said.
DOT held several public meetings to hear concerns from riders about the fare increases, but turnout was low. In Stamford last Monday, two residents attended. In New Haven last Tuesday, only one resident was there. And in Hartford last Thursday, only a small handful of residents were present.Jon Bonci, a CT Rail passenger who attended the Hartford event, said he wasn’t confident his presence would change the state’s plans. “We’re gonna have to pay it, so what can you do? It doesn’t matter what we say in the public hearing,” he said.Stamford resident Nicole Howerton expressed concern at the DOT’s public meeting at the Ferguson Public Library there.
“As a resident of Stamford and a sole [commuter] for my family, it plays a major role in being able to get around and enjoy the community,” Howerton said. “When we’re presenting an increase of some nature, we need to look at the schedule and see if and how that’s meeting the community.”A frequent commuter through the Metro-North’s West Haven station, she added that when rail service is down she has to take Ubers, which is another additional cost.Chris Irby, the only registered speaker at the New Haven public meeting, pointed to Bridgeport as an urban area that would be significantly affected by the fare hikes. As a Bridgeport resident and a frequent commuter, he said that Bridgeport residents already struggle to find money for the fares.
“Bridgeport is not a business city like New Haven is,” Irby said. “Everybody has to take the train to go to other towns, to go to work.”
Irby also called on DOT to do a better job of advertising the events, stating that he would like to see more of DOT’s presence and advertising in downtown New Haven.
The department held additional public hearings virtually on June 30 and July 1. Commissioner Garrett Eucalitto will consider public comments through July 6, via email to dot.proposedtransitchanges@ct.gov or by leaving a voicemail at (860) 594-3612. DOT will take all comments into consideration before finalizing the proposed fare changes, officials said.

UVM Medical Center, Burlington


Tom Whitney died on June 21 following a stroke. Tom was the oldest of five siblings born to Bill and Alli Whitney of South Burlington. Tom liked to say he learned about hard work doing farm chores, though future endeavors suggest that kind of work was not for him. Tom’s story reflects a series of grand passions that resulted in an interesting life.
While in high school, Tom developed a passion for photography and set up a darkroom. Tom left home after graduation, looking for what the world had to offer. He joined the Navy for three years, then settled in Los Angeles with his wife, Elvie Moore, and their two sons. Tom and Elvie became social justice advocates: Elvie was a published playwright highlighting racial inequalities, and Tom became part of The Grantsmanship Center, publishing an award-winning magazine about applying for grants.
Tom lived in Sacramento and taught at Folsom Prison, then worked as graphic designer for Regional Transit. He volunteered with many environmental and urban planning and development projects. His efforts caused enough “good trouble” for Tom to earn an Environmentalist of the Year award. While in Sacramento, Tom met and married Betsy Palmer, who established a company that translated text into Braille, while Tom managed graphic design.
Tom later moved to Hilo, Hawaii. He documented Hawaiian culture and had several museum exhibitions of native spiritual practices on Mauna Kea. Photography, reading, and writing dominated this period of his life. He published several books: The Book of Years and Celebrating the Hawaiian Culture.
Tom is survived by his son, Abdullah Taalib Sankofa and wife, Dina; his sisters Mary Campbell and Sara Denny; and several nieces and nephews. He was predeceased by two siblings, Alice and David, his son Julien, and his wives.
In 2019, Tom returned to Vermont. He was pleased to find a welcoming community at Three Cathedral Square. The family wants to thank Tom’s many friends at Cathedral Square for their kindnesses near the end of Tom’s life.

One of the most powerful political blocs in California, the Latino Caucus had to balance reining in Medi-Cal’s rising costs with helping undocumented immigrants. All but four overcame their misgivings and voted to freeze new enrollment and make other cuts to immigrant health insurance.



Moments before an important budget vote last week, state Sen. María Elena Durazo stood on the Senate floor and spoke passionately about the plight of immigrants’ health care in California. She lambasted the Legislature’s choice to freeze Medi-Cal enrollment for immigrants without legal status and charge monthly premiums.
The Senate’s budget negotiations and headlines had long since turned toward a different crisis — housing reform — but Durazo stayed firm. 
Durazo said she was joyful when the state opened Medi-Cal to all low-income residents regardless of immigration status just a year and a half ago. Now “that joy has turned into pain, that joy has turned into shame, and that joy has turned into betrayal,” Durazo told her colleagues on the Senate floor.
The Democrat from Los Angeles issued a clarion call to the public and to her colleagues: “Remember today’s date and what the Senate is doing.”
Durazo’s stand and subsequent vote against the Medi-Cal cuts stood out among a sea of Democratic yes votes. She was joined in opposition by three other members of the state Latino Caucus who voted against or abstained from the measure.
For more than a decade, the 35-member Latino Caucus has championed the expansion of Medi-Cal to immigrants, passing the baton from each new class of lawmakers to another. No one has been more outspoken about the proposed cuts than its members, Democrats who self-identify as Latino or Hispanic, many of whom spent the past month joining rallies on the steps of the Capitol and fiercely debating the impacts.
But the state’s $12 billion deficit put the Latino Caucus in a bind, forcing them and their party to make difficult decisions about walking back health care during a year when the state has too little revenue and too many expenses. 
Many legislators in the caucus say that California is cruelly balancing its budget on the backs of poor immigrants. They’ve argued that California is creating a state-sanctioned, two-tiered health system where some residents are considered “less than.”
Yet, despite some misgivings, the emotional nature of the cuts and the fervor of the rhetoric, nearly all of the caucus — 30 members — voted to approve them within the larger health care budget package.
Under the agreement finalized last week by the Legislature and Gov. Gavin Newsom, in six months, California will freeze new enrollment of adult immigrants who do not have legal status in Medi-Cal, the state’s health insurance program for low-income residents. In one year, non-citizens 19 and older will lose dental benefits, and in two years, most of the adults must pay a $30 monthly premium. Combined, these changes are projected to save California about $1 billion in their initial implementation years, growing to more than $4.3 billion ongoing.
The Latino Caucus, whose members make up 36% of Democratic Assemblymembers and 43% of senators, is one of the most powerful political blocs in California. The caucus historically carried bills to support immigrants without legal status through changes in health care, labor and education.
The decision to cut medical benefits for immigrants was an agonizing one for the Latino legislators as they’ve watched the Trump administration wage an aggressive deportation campaign against immigrants in Southern California and the Central Valley, calling them criminals and reportedly rounding them up at job sites, bus stops and their homes. More than 75% of unauthorized immigrants in California are from Mexico and Central America, according to a 2019 analysis from the Migration Policy Institute.
“There are so many members who share my feelings about needing to maintain health care for all, while also ensuring we’re fighting for everything else on the budget we voted on.”ASSEMBLYMEMBER CELESTE RODRIGUEZ, DEMOCRAT FROM ARLETA
The lawmakers wrestled with the bleak necessity of Medi-Cal cuts after multiple years of deficits. Some say the programs that they were able to save in the budget, such as home care for immigrants and other Medi-Cal enrollees, are worth defending even if the other cuts are painful.
“There are so many members who share my feelings about needing to maintain health care for all, while also ensuring we’re fighting for everything else on the budget we voted on,” Assemblymember Celeste Rodriguez, a Democrat from Arleta who voted for the Medi-Cal cuts, said in an interview with CalMatters before the final budget was approved.
Sen. Caroline Menjivar, a Democrat from Van Nuys who joined Durazo in voting against the Medi-Cal changes, has consistently opposed cutting benefits for immigrants. “Our actions have consequences and those consequences will cause people to lose health insurance,” she said.
Her outspoken opposition apparently landed her in hot water with some in the party leadership. Last month, her office said Menjivar was removed from a key budget subcommittee because she opposed the Medi-Cal cuts. 
Menjivar said she can’t support policies that single out a specific demographic. “It’s the ‘othering,’ where we’ve created a hierarchy of what human is eligible and what human is ineligible,” that she can’t stomach, she said.
For Durazo, “it’s the specific targeting of immigrants. That’s the problem.”

Health advocates rallied against the cuts for weeks and pressured lawmakers to walk back even deeper cuts proposed by Newsom. A coalition of groups representing health advocates, immigrant rights groups and labor lined the sidewalks on a recent day as lawmakers walked into the building to vote on an earlier version of the budget that mirrors some of the final provisions. Their chant of “health for all” has been a rallying cry for the expansion since 2013.
“We can’t say we believe in universal health care…and say we’re going to make exceptions for this one population,” said Mar Velez, director of policy for the Latino Coalition for a Healthy California.
Undocumented immigrants “not only pay nearly $8.5 billion in taxes in California, they build businesses, and raise the next generation of lawyers, doctors, and elected officials… They too, deserve to be treated with dignity by ensuring their health is prioritized.”SEN. LENA GONZALEZ, DEMOCRAT FROM LONG BEACH 
Caucus chair Sen. Lena Gonzalez, a Long Beach Democrat who abstained from voting on the Medi-Cal cuts, told CalMatters that her “conscience couldn’t bear freezing Medi-Cal benefits for hard working immigrants” especially in the face of immigration enforcement raids throughout Southern California. Assemblymember Sade Elhawary, a Democrat and Latino Caucus member from Los Angeles, also abstained, along with Sen. Lola Smallwood-Cuevas from Los Angeles, who is not a Caucus member.
Gonzalez said the cuts represent a “huge setback” for Californians struggling with affordability, especially when immigrants are “at the core of our economy.”
Undocumented immigrants “not only pay nearly $8.5 billion in taxes here in California, they build businesses, and raise the next generation of lawyers, doctors, and elected officials, just like the members of this California Latino Legislative Caucus,” Gonzalez said in a statement. “They too, deserve to be treated with dignity by ensuring their health is prioritized.”
During emotional debates, some legislators who voted in favor of the cuts characterized them as a best-case scenario that prevents anyone from getting kicked off of Medi-Cal, while others said many people will lose coverage as they struggle to make payments and drop off the rolls.
Some of the compromises worked into the budget include provisions to delay the cuts and try to prevent current enrollees from losing coverage. Under the new law, the freeze  includes a three-month grace period for re-enrollment should someone fall off of Medi-Cal because of paperwork errors or temporary income increases. Youths who are already enrolled in Medi-Cal will not “age out” once they turn 19. 
The monthly premium and cut to dental benefits apply to non-citizens, including some with legal status like visa or green card holders, but only adults aged 19 to 59 will be required to pay the premium while all adults will lose dental.
Few other options to cut the deficit as Medi-Cal costs surge
The state spends more than $190 billion a year on the entire Medi-Cal program, about 60% of which comes from federal funds. About $12 billion of state-only revenue pays for immigrant health care.
Lawmakers have been grappling with funding the state’s Medi-Cal program, which insures 15 million Californians, for months. Earlier this year, legislators injected billions of emergency dollars into Medi-Cal to keep it solvent.
Rising health care costs and increased senior enrollment fueled a majority of the $6.2 billion shortfall. But finance officials indicated that about $2.7 billion resulted from higher spending on immigrant health care, which the state pays for without federal assistance.
Paired with the deficit Democrats had few options to balance the budget.
Elana Ross, a spokesperson for Newsom, defended the budget as one that preserves the state’s “commitment to immigrant communities.” In a statement, she blamed the increasing cost of health care, more people enrolling and President Donald Trump’s economic policies, including tariffs, for causing the state’s projected revenues to decrease by about $16 billion.
“Because of these outside factors, the state must take difficult but necessary steps to ensure fiscal stability and preserve the long-term viability of Medi-Cal for all Californians,” Ross said.
“This is not about whether you support or oppose immigrants. We are a nation of immigrants. We value that. But I think a lot of Californians have concerns about prioritizing non-citizens with scarce taxpayer resources.”ASSEMBLYMEMBER CARL DEMAIO, REPUBLICAN FROM SAN DIEGO 
The move to cut immigrant benefits and bail out Medi-Cal earlier in the year gave political leverage to the state’s Republican lawmakers, most of whom have opposed the expansion for years. Ahead of the budget vote, many Republicans criticized the state for irresponsibly expanding a program that was already stretched thin and is frequently plagued by long wait times, lack of specialists and other access challenges.
All Republican legislators voted against the Medi-Cal bill and every budget bill despite their criticisms of Medi-Cal expansion, citing other fiscal concerns with the Democrats’ budget deal.
The state simply can’t afford the program for immigrants, said Republican Assemblymember Carl DeMaio of San Diego, one of the most outspoken critics of the expansion, last week during the budget vote. 
“Let’s be very clear. This is not about whether you support or oppose immigrants. We are a nation of immigrants. We value that,” DeMaio said on the Assembly floor. “But I think a lot of Californians have concerns about prioritizing non-citizens with scarce taxpayer resources, at the same time that we’re cutting services for the neediest citizens in our communities.”
Voting for immigrant cuts with mixed emotions
Rodriguez, who voted yes on the cuts, said she was torn over the budget decisions because she feels responsible for protecting immigrants in her community. When she was younger, Rodriguez said she used Medi-Cal and knows the program is essential for many people in her district.
She grew emotional during budget debates while speaking about the cuts, but told CalMatters her support ultimately hinged on recognizing that she and her colleagues fought successfully to save many safety net programs, including home care and reproductive health services. She said the deal to delay some of the Medi-Cal cuts is a partial win because it gives the Legislature time to contemplate additional revenue streams. 
Assemblymember Joaquin Arambula, a doctor and Democrat from Fresno, voted no on a previous version of the budget that cut immigrant health but voted in favor of the final budget agreement.
Arambula, who worked as an emergency room physician before becoming a lawmaker, said many of his past patients would come in with serious but preventable conditions related to diabetes or heart disease because they could not access primary care.
“I remember their stories. I remember their faces,” Arambula said in an interview before the final budget vote. “I would see these patients in their last minutes of life, and knew that there was so much more that we could be doing in advance.”
Arambula declined to comment on his yes vote.
Looking toward the future of medical care
Velez said the fact that several Latino Caucus lawmakers voted no matters because without their voices, it telegraphs to constituents that everyone believes “It’s OK to do this” when many people oppose it. But in the end, there weren’t enough votes to stop the cuts from happening and she said that will irrevocably damage the trust built over years between advocates, government officials and immigrants.
“We’re at a crossroads where legislators, the governor and the state of California can put us back on the right track to make sure California is seen as a sentinel for protecting immigrants.”CARLOS ALARCON, CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER 
Some lawmakers have floated the idea of requiring large employers whose employees primarily use Medi-Cal to contribute to the program though no details have emerged. 
“I know I have colleagues who are committed to ensuring health care is truly accessible to all,” Rodriguez said. “We’ll get back to a place where we can fulfill the commitment that was made.” 
Carlos Alarcon, a health policy analyst with the California Immigrant Policy Center, said now that the budget is final, it’s time for the lawmakers who initially said they want to stop the cuts to “put their money where their mouth is” and find solutions.
“We’re at a crossroads where legislators, the governor and the state of California can put us back on the right track to make sure California is seen as a sentinel for protecting immigrants,” Alarcon said.

(File photo by Angela Breck/Maryland Matters)It’s no secret that President Donald Trump and his allies in Congress are trying to decimate climate programs and environmental protections. We see evidence of this every day, in executive orders, public pronouncements, policy initiatives and funding decisions.
But in Maryland, we take comfort knowing that many state and local elected officials see themselves as a bulwark against the worst of Trump’s positions and impulses. Whether they’re filing lawsuits to reverse Trump edicts, enacting legislation that serves as a counterbalance to regressive federal policies, promoting the use of clean energy or outlining bold goals to confront climate change, Maryland leaders are often at the forefront of environmental advocacy.
So why now are Gov. Wes Moore (D) and Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) dragging their feet when it comes to advancing and protecting aggressive vehicle emissions standards and mandates regarding the sales of clean cars and trucks?
On June 12, Trump signed three measures striking down waivers that allowed Maryland and several other states to impose stricter emissions standards on cars and trucks than federal laws allow. The rules have also allowed Maryland and the other states to set a timeline for phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars and trucks.

Within hours after the president signed these measures, setting into motion Congress’ use of the Congressional Review Act to revoke the three waivers, 11 of the 12 states that were impacted by his action, led by California, filed a federal lawsuit to preserve their right to use more stringent vehicle emissions laws.
The only hold-out? Maryland. That’s a disappointing and dangerous development that, given the state’s history and rhetoric about the imperative of climate action, requires an explanation. So far, we have yet to hear any.
California has long been the acknowledged leader on state-based climate policy. And for more than two decades, the Golden State’s vehicle emissions regulations have been stronger than federal rules. Starting with New Jersey in 2004, 11 other states and the District of Columbia have elected to follow California’s emissions standards; Maryland signed up in 2007, requiring cars beginning with the 2011 model year to have stronger emissions standards than vehicles sold in most other states.
Former Gov. Larry Hogan (R) briefly paused the state’s participation in the multistate alliance, but as soon as Moore took office, he renewed Maryland’s commitment to California’s more stringent standards for autos, signing up for a new initiative known as Advanced Clean Cars II, and also ensured that Maryland would follow that state’s lead on strict emissions standards for trucks. Among other things, the rules mandate phasing out the sale of new gas-powered vehicles by 2035, with the phase-out beginning with model year 2027.
The logic behind stricter emissions standards and more aggressive goals for electric vehicle sales is irrefutable. Vehicle emissions are a primary cause of air pollution in the state, and reducing them has myriad public health benefits.
By the state’s own estimates, between 2027 and 2040, Maryland’s participation in Advanced Clean Cars II would dramatically scale back emissions of nitrogen oxides, a precursor to ground-level ozone; particulate matter, which creates significant respiratory problems; and carbon dioxide, a major driver of climate change. By 2040, the state projects that these reductions will create a public health benefit of $603.5 million a year due to decreases in respiratory and cardiovascular illness and associated lost work days.
So Maryland’s retreat from these tougher standards is puzzling and distressing – and sadly, it did not begin with the state’s decision not to sign on when other states sued the Trump administration earlier this month. During the most recent General Assembly session, the legislature came close to passing a bill that would have paused penalties for two years on auto dealers who did not meet the state’s aggressive standards for selling electric and hybrid vehicles. Ultimately, the governor issued an executive order with the same result.
Maryland officials have said they’re as committed as ever to clean car standards. But when meeting the goals becomes voluntary, without strict state enforcement and penalties, those statements ring hollow. The governor’s executive order, coupled with the state’s decision not to join other Advanced Clean Cars states in the new lawsuit against the federal government, must, for now, be seen as a retreat in Maryland’s commitment to fight climate change and air pollution.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EV-charging-station-1.jpg,,,2025-07-03 09:05:41.845781

Tony Evers signed the budget, now 2025 Wisconsin Act 15, at 1:32 a.m. in his office Thursday, less than an hour after the Assembly passed it. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Gov. Tony Evers signed the $111 billion two-year state budget bill into law overnight following a marathon day of overlapping Senate and Assembly floor sessions where the bill received bipartisan support from lawmakers. The budget cuts taxes by $1.3 billion, makes investments in the University of Wisconsin system, boosts public schools’ special education reimbursement rate to 45% and allocates about $330 for child care. 
Evers signed the budget, now 2025 Wisconsin Act 15, at 1:32 a.m. in his office Thursday, less than an hour after the Assembly passed it. Just before signing it, he thanked legislative leaders for working with him and said the budget reflects the fair legislative maps that he signed into law in 2024 and that were in place during November elections. 
“We need to work together,” Evers said. 
As the Assembly and Senate prepared to meet for debate Wednesday evening, Evers was outside of the east wing of the Capitol for Concerts on the Square and telling people not to “drop meatballs” on themselves. 
“I was actually chatting with people about tonight outside,” he said. “Many of them were saying ‘How about that? Compromise.’ Compare that to what’s going on in Washington, D.C., and it’s significantly different, so I’m very proud to sign it.”
The passage and signing of the state budget comes two days after the end of the fiscal year.
Following months of negotiations and the announcement of a deal between Evers, Republican legislative leaders and Senate Democrats on Tuesday, the Legislature worked for about 15 hours Wednesday to get the bill over the finish line.
Their goal was to get the bill signed by Evers before the federal reconciliation bill made it to President Donald Trump’s desk.
One reason for the rush was a provision in the state budget that increases a Medicaid-related hospital assessment from 1.8% to 6%, the current federal limit, to supplement the state’s Medicaid resources. It’s estimated to result in over $1 billion in additional Medicaid revenue that will go back to Wisconsin hospitals, but the state’s ability to make that change is set to be restricted under the federal bill.
“We want our health care system to be in good shape, and in order to do that, we’re going to need help from the federal government,” Evers said. 
Governor uses partial veto
In addition to signing the budget, Evers exercised his partial veto on 23 items . He had agreed not to partially veto any part of the deal that he came to with lawmakers, but other pieces of the legislation were fair game. 
Evers vetoed language that set 2029 for closing Green Bay Correctional Institution. He said he supports closing the facility, but said more needs to be done before a date is set.
“We need more compromise on that. We need to get things going before we start taking people out of Green Bay,” Evers told reporters. “Saying that we’re going to do Green Bay by ’29 doesn’t mean a damn thing.”
He also partially vetoed $750,000 in grants to the Lakeland STAR Academy, a Minocqua charter school that specializes in serving students with autism and diverse learning needs; vetoed language excluding two of Wisconsin’s 11 federally-recognized tribes from a grant program; and vetoed $25,000 for a street project in the village of Warrens. 
In addition, he vetoed funds for five projects that would go through the Department of Natural Resource. 
“I object to providing an earmark for a natural resources project when the Legislature has abandoned its responsibility to reauthorize and ensure the continuation of the immensely popular Warren Knowles-Gaylord Nelson Stewardship program,” Evers stated in his veto message. 
Lawmakers said they are still working on legislation to continue the program. “Instead of renewing the program and helping the many, the Legislature has opted to benefit the politically connected few,” Evers wrote.  “The Legislature must do its job and renew the Warren Knowles-Gaylord Nelson Stewardship program.”
Evers said if he would change anything about the budget, he would have wanted “more in the area of specificity in child care.” The budget will spend about $330 million on child care including $110 million to extend direct payments to providers for another year, $65 million to a new program for providers serving 4-year-olds and $123 million to increase the reimbursement for child care costs for low-income families under the Wisconsin Shares program.
Evers also rejected the calls of some advocates that he veto the entire budget, noting the uncertainty that could result and the funding that could be put at risk by starting from scratch on a budget.
“Failing to reach consensus and vetoing this budget in its entirety was an untenable option, not just for me, but for the people of our state,” Evers wrote in his budget message. 
Evers told reporters he wasn’t caught off guard by the number of Democratic lawmakers who didn’t support the budget.
“They have to do what they think is right, and everybody’s kind of looking for what’s going to happen in a couple years, and so I’m not surprised,” Evers said. “But there’s a whole bunch of Republicans that supported it so God bless them.” 
Republican lawmakers also said throughout the day that the prospect of losing hospital funding if the budget wasn’t signed ahead of the federal reconciliation bill moving through Congress played a role in wanting to get the budget done as quickly as possible.
“That’s why we’re working really fast to get it done,” Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) said during a press conference Wednesday morning. “We will get the bill to the governor’s desk prior to the President [Trump] signing the Big Beautiful bill.”
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) said at a mid-afternoon press conference he expected Evers would sign the legislation late Wednesday or early Thursday.
“It’s about a billion dollars that will be able to flow to an awful lot of rural hospitals, people who are taking care of those with urgent needs,” Vos said. “We want to get it done and we want access to those dollars.”
Senate approves budget 19-14  
The Senate took action on the bill first, passing it 19-14 shortly after 9 p.m. Five Democratic senators, including Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton), joined 14 Republicans to pass the bill. Four Republicans, including Senate President Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk), voted with the 10 Democrats against the legislation. 
Democrats’ votes were needed to pass the budget bill in the Senate after several Republicans expressed concerns about the legislation. Hesselbein was at the negotiating table as a result. 
The hospital funding, which led to lawmakers rushing work to pass the budget in one day, was also the top reason that Felzkowski voted against the budget.
Democrats voting yes, in addition to Hesslebein, were Sens. Kristin Dassler-Alfheim (D- Appleton), Brad Pfaff (D-Onalaska), Jeff Smith (D-Brunswick) and Jamie Wall (D- Green Bay).  Republicans voting no, in addition to Felzkowski were Rob Hutton (R- Brookfield), Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield) and Steve Nass (R Whitewater).
Felzkowski said she felt bad because there were good things in the budget, but that she was appalled the budget didn’t address the cost of health care, noting Wisconsin has the fifth highest health care costs in the country.
Felzkowski said that there should be other health care reforms if hospitals were going to get a “windfall” of over $1 billion a year and blamed Evers and hospital lobbyists for opposing those, including additional hospital price transparency measures.
“Gov. Evers, you failed Wisconsin,” Felzkowski said. “You failed constituents. You failed employers.” 
Evers rejected the claims, calling them “bulls – – t.”
“The people that work in those hospitals are working real hard,” Evers said. “The last thing we need is to have hospitals going belly up in the middle of the pandemic or something.” 
Sen. Rob Hutton (R-Brookfield), who voted no, mentioned Evers’ previous vetoes of Republican tax cuts and said the current budget bill leveraged those vetoes “to hide the 12% increase in spending” as well as a structural deficit.
“In a time of economic uncertainty, when our spending decisions warrant further restraint and discernment, we need a budget that creates proper spending priorities and puts taxpayers first,” Hutton said. 
Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) called the budget an “orgy” of spending in a statement explaining his “no” vote. Implicating fellow Republicans, he criticized lawmakers for spending the state’s $4.3 billion surplus on one-time earmarks and “funding for special interests” instead of larger tax cuts.
Despite the handful of opponents, the majority of Senate Republicans supported the budget, touting the tax cuts that they secured and some of the investments.
LeMahieu called it “a responsible budget that invests in core priorities” and touted the $1.4 billion tax cut. 
At the Senate GOP press conference Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) singled out some of the University of Wisconsin system funding that will “put the thumb on the scale…to help some of those campuses like UW Platteville that have had declining enrollment over the last decade.” The budget allocates $53 million for UW system funding, distributed through two formulas: one for declining enrollment and another for the number of credit hours undergraduates complete.
The University of Wisconsin system will also get $840 million for capital projects, $94 million for staff wage increases, $54 million for recruitment and retention and $7 million for virtual mental health services.
Sen. Dan Feyen (R-Fond du Lac), who voted yes, said the budget didn’t do everything he wanted it to do and included some things he didn’t support. 
“I always have, and always will, advocate for a smaller, smarter state government,” he said in a statement. “I’m glad to see that this budget cuts over 300 vacant positions from state government.”
Feyen highlighted his support for special education funding and child care provisions in the document. He said if people want a more “conservative” budget, then Republicans would need to expand their majority and elect a Republican governor in 2026.

Senate Democrats, whether they voted for or against the bill, all had a similar message: it doesn’t do enough. 
“What we have on the floor today is better than it would have been if Senate Dems had not been at the table, but let me be clear, it is not perfect,” Hesselbein said at a Wednesday morning press conference. She described the budget as a “bipartisan deal” where “everybody left the table wishing it was different, but this is something that we can agree on trying to move forward.”
Asked about the advocates who called for lawmakers to vote against the budget and Evers to veto it, Hesselbein said she knew some people were upset.
“I’m glad they’re making their voices heard,” she said. “That’s why today, we’re going to be fighting for every single Wisconsinite.”
Day of drama delayed
The Senate convened a little after 10:30 a.m., but didn’t pass the bill until after 9 p.m. 
The first several hours of debate centered on Senate Democrats’ 25 proposed amendments  that ranged from increasing funding for the UW system, K-12 education and child care to expanding postpartum Medicaid. The body got through about half of those amendments before pausing for several hours to caucus.
During the delays, Republicans were working on a 35-page “technical amendment” with several changes, including an added requirement that the UW system conduct an efficiency study on declining student enrollment and future operations. 
When the Senate reconvened around 7 p.m., it tabled the rest of the Democratic amendments and started debate on the full budget bill. 
Sen. Mark Spreitzer (D-Beloit) said Democrats helped improve the budget but that it l would not allow people in Wisconsin to thrive.
“We understand the urgency to act. Congress is actively restricting our future funding. This budget must move forward, but that does not make it a good budget,” Spreitzer said.
The budget broke the “rule of 17” — the Senate Republicans’ practice of making sure 17 members support a measure before it’s put on the floor — Spreitzer said, and criticized them for not breaking the rule to pass other measures, including postpartum Medicaid expansion or funding for the Knowles-Nelson Conservation program in a bipartisan way. “Wouldn’t it be easier to just get it done today?” he said. 
Spreitzer said the Democratic votes on the budget were not an endorsement, but were rather an acknowledgement that it was better than it would have been without bipartisan negotiations. Asserting that the budget didn’t deserve one more vote than was necessary to pass it, he voted against it.
Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) said the optimism after Evers introduced his budget in February soon faded and criticized the governor for not fighting harder for his priorities.  The result is “grossly” insufficient and “will do more harm than good,” he said
“It’s a ‘failure to fight’ budget,” Larson said. “This budget is cowardice. We all deserve so much better.” 
Assembly passes budget 59-39 
“We have a guarantee that we’re going to have a transformation budget that works for everyone,” Vos said during the Assembly floor debate. “I assume, like in the state Senate where Democrats and Republicans are going to vote for the budget, we would have the same thing here in the Assembly, if people are serious about saying we want to work together.” 
The Assembly concurred in the bill 59-39 at around 12:40 a.m. Seven Democrats voted with Republicans in favor of the bill: Reps. Jill Billings (D-La Crosse), Steve Doyle (D-Onalaska), Jodi Emerson (D-Eau Claire), Maureen McCarville (D- DeForest), Lori Palmeri (D-Oshkosh), Sylvia Ortiz-Velez (D-Milwaukee) and Tara Johnson (D-Town of Shelby). 
One Republican  — Rep. Scott Allen (R-Waukesha) — voted with Democrats against the bill. Rep. Calvin Callahan (R-Tomahawk) was not voting.

Assembly Co-Chair Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) said the budget process this time was different from any other that he’s worked on. This is his fourth as co-chair of the Joint Finance Committee. 
“We did spend more time working with the governor’s office, the governor and Democrats,” Born said, and called the budget  “more conservative”  than the state’s 2023-25 budget, to his surprise. He noted that the $1.3 billion tax cut will get signed into law, unlike previous tax cuts that Evers has vetoed. 
The budget spends the state’s estimated $4 billion budget surplus down to about $800 million, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. The budget also has a 6% increase in general purpose revenue spending and a 12% increase overall.
While Republicans highlighted the bipartisan nature of the budget and measures included, Democrats throughout the day focused on their critiques and the measures that didn’t make it in.
Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) said at a press conference Wednesday morning that she was appreciative of Evers and Hesselbein for being at the negotiating table and getting what they could — but it wouldn’t be enough to win her vote. 
“This proposal is a far cry from the budget that Assembly Democrats would have written,” said Neubauer. She said she was not at the table when the budget deal was made.  With a 54-45 majority, Assembly Republicans had the votes to pass the budget without the Democrats, Assembly Majority Leader Tyler August (R-Walworth) said at a GOP press conference.
Neubauer said that as a consequence, the Assembly Democrats “were not part of those negotiations.”
School districts will get an increase in the special education reimbursement rate from about 32% to 42% in the first year of the biennium and 45% in the second year. It will be the highest that the rate has been in many years, but still lower than the 60% advocates and Democrats wanted.
Democratic lawmakers said that without increases in general aid or schools, districts will have to continue relying on property tax increases to keep up with costs.
“You didn’t set out to stop the cycle of [property tax increase] referendums, you set out to continue it,” Rep. Robyn Vining (D-Wauwatosa) said on the Assembly floor. “When 96 of 99 Assembly districts have gone to referendum recently and the statewide demand for public school funding increases isn’t partisan for our constituents, why are we fighting so hard to get Republicans to adequately fund our schools? This isn’t a Democrat versus Republican issue across the state, and it shouldn’t be a Republican versus Democrat issue in the state Capitol.”
The four-member Wisconsin Legislative Socialist Caucus — including Reps. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee), Darrin Madison (D-Milwaukee), Christian Phelps (D-Eau Claire) and Francesca Hong (D-Madison) — voted against the bill. In a joint statement they called the agreement between Republican lawmakers, Senate Democrats and Evers a “catastrophic failure of leadership that surrenders to Republican austerity.” They cited the lack of a general school aid increase for public schools, the special education reimbursement not meeting 60% and the failure to expand Medicaid.
“This is not a compromise, this is capitulation,” the caucus said.
Assembly Republicans mostly focused on the parts of the state budget they were appreciative of but also took jabs at Democrats for saying they would vote against the bill. 
The Agriculture Roads Improvement Program, which was created in 2023 to support local agricultural road improvement projects statewide, will get an infusion of $150 million. 
“That’s a big deal in my community and up in the rural part of the northwest,” Rep. Clint Moses (R-Menomonie) said. “It helps our state’s largest industry by improving the quality of our roads to get their products and goods out and inputs and services that farmers need into the field as well.” 
Rep. Jessie Rodriguez (R-Oak Creek) said lawmakers committed to providing tax cuts for seniors and Wisconsinites as a whole through the elimination of the utility tax, a policy Evers had advocated for. 
“I know that some people on the other side of the aisle said that people are not seeking tax relief,” Rodriguez said. “Yes, they have been. You just haven’t been listening.”
The Office of School Safety, housed in the Department of Justice, will get 13 permanent staff positions and $1.57 million in the budget.
The office provides training and grants to schools for safety and runs the Speak Up, Speak Out tipline where students can anonymously report safety concerns. Funding for the office became a flashpoint of criticism in the 2023-25 budget debate. 
Rep. Todd Novak (R-Dodgeville) touted the new budget’s provision for the office and spoke about working with Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul on getting the funding in this year’s budget. He also credited lawmakers on the finance committee for helping to keep the office going.
“The process is ugly, but working together to get something done is a really great thing, so I will defend this budget. I will run on this budget,” Novak said.
Rep. Tony Kurtz (R-Wonewoc) said on the floor that lawmakers who voted against the budget shouldn’t take credit for any of its accomplishments in the budget later  or attend groundbreakings for projects it funded.“If you vote against this, do not show your face,” Kurtz said. “You didn’t have the courage to vote yes.”

WINDSOR — First responders recovered what is believed to be the body of a missing 14-year-old girl from Kennedy Pond on Wednesday evening.
An investigation into the death is ongoing, Windsor Police Chief Bill Daniels said.
The girl is from the Burlington area, according to Lt. Charles Winn from the Vermont State Police dive team. Further information about the girl’s identity was not immediately available.

The girl is believed to have been at the pond with “friends of the family,” Daniels said while on the scene.
The VSP team recovered the body less than 100 feet offshore between the docks and a yellow floating raft at about 5:30 p.m., after 45 minutes of searching.
In addition to the VSP team, the Hanover dive team responded to the call at about 12:15 p.m. for a water rescue, as did Windsor fire and police departments.
Emma McCumber, who grew up in Windsor but now lives in Massachusetts, was swimming at the pond with her kids when she heard screams from the beach from those who noticed the girl was missing.
“Immediately the lifeguards hopped into action,” McCumber said when she returned to the pond hours later to check for updates.

Before police cleared the water of all swimmers, McCumber, along with some dozen other bystanders, searched for the girl herself for about 45 minutes.
“It was an amazing community effort,” she said.
Without any diving equipment besides goggles, the bystanders attempted to do a grid search. “We went down as deep as we could but it was pretty useless. There’s really long weeds in that area. You can’t see your hands in front of your face.”
Told the girl had pink hair, the bystanders searched for the distinctive feature in the water.
“We just kept looking for pink hair,” McCumber said.

Wednesday’s incident was the latest water-related death in Vermont this summer.
Late last month, there were three drownings in Vermont in the span of five days, VTDigger reported.
An 18-year-old Burlington High School student died after jumping into the water at Bartlett Falls in Bristol on June 21.
A 30-year-old employee of Basin Harbor Club in Ferrisburgh drowned in Lake Champlain on June 24.
Another man was found dead further north in Lake Champlain near Red Rocks Park in South Burlington on June 25.

,California,2025-07-03 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,"Mental health support centers are reeling from California budget cuts, with layoffs expected",Jocelyn Wiener,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/mental-health/2025/07/mental-health-support-budget-cut/,Operators of mental health support lines are laying off staff and ceasing or curtailing services due to California budget cuts and a 2024 ballot measure.,"In summary
Operators of mental health support lines are laying off staff and ceasing or curtailing services due to California budget cuts and a 2024 ballot measure.


Phone lines that provide mental health support to tens of thousands of Californians say they are on the verge of shutting down or dramatically scaling back as a result of cuts in the state’s new budget. 
Representatives from the support lines, which are distinct from hotlines that serve people in crisis, say they help thousands of Californians with mental health needs each month.
And with more people than ever calling or texting for help, they say, the so-called warm lines are falling victim to both the budget shortfall and, in some cases, the roll out of Proposition 1, a 2024 ballot measure that redirected some tax revenue from mental health services toward housing.
“We save lives every day,” said Dr. Lisa Pion-Berlin, chief executive of Parents Anonymous, whose California Parents & Youth Helpline serves about 24,000 people a year. “Without that safety net there, where are people going to go?”
Pion-Berlin said the organization had requested $3 million a year from the state; the budget Gov. Gavin Newsom signed last week didn’t provide any of it. Layoffs have already begun.
The landscape of state-funded mental health services has been shifting in California. In 2022, the state rolled out 988, a free mental health crisis line that has a dedicated funding stream and is not dependent on the state general fund. Then, last year, the state launched free mental health apps for youth and families through private companies Soluna and Brightline. 
But organizations that operate the phone support lines argue their services are different, and critical, in a state still reeling from the effects of the pandemic, the Los Angeles fires and a political climate targeting transgender people and immigrants. 
Antonia Rios, a mother of seven in Pomona, said she reaches out to the Parents’ Anonymous Helpline between four and seven times a week. Rios lives with anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, addiction and PTSD from years of trauma and abuse in the foster care system. Prior to finding the helpline, she said, she often felt judged or cut short when she tried calling other places.
“The helpline was a safe haven for me,” she said. “It saved my life on many occasions.”
The helpline has also provided her friends and family with life-saving support on many occasions, she said.  “It breaks my heart they want to cut it.”
The San Francisco Peer Run Warm Line, which serves people all over the state, managed to hold onto $5 million this budget year. That still marks a significant drop from the $10 million a year they received previously and the $15 million they had requested. 
H.D. Palmer, the Department of Finance spokesperson, said that because the previous funding was one-time and due to sunset last month, there is technically no reduction in funding for the support line.
Meanwhile, the support line’s numbers have been spiking in recent months. This spring, they received about 40,000 calls a month; with their new, smaller budget, they anticipate connecting with the same number of people in an entire year.
Mark Salzar, chief executive of the nonprofit that operates the support line, said the group also runs a Spanish-speaking line that will now need to be shut down. 
In addition, it provides infrastructure support, training and technical assistance to a variety of other warm lines serving Chinese, Ukrainian, Russian and Black communities. The San Francisco Peer Run Warm Line is also the exclusive operator of a statewide service that Gov. Newsom has promoted, called CalHOPE, which targets young people and families on digital platforms. 
“With the budget cuts we’re not sure where these folks are going to go, honestly,” he said.
Amy Durham, chief executive of the Orange County chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said her warm line fields 900 calls a day and provides support to the sheriff’s department and local hospitals. 
She now has to lay off 127 people, many of them former warm line callers who never worked in the past and were now thriving as peer counselors.
She said she’s trying to rally donors to help keep some semblance of a warm line operating, even if hours would be scaled back.
“Now we’re going to wait until everyone’s in crisis,” she said. “I can’t imagine it’s cost effective or humane.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/070125-988-Help-Line-MG-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-03 09:05:41.845781

It’s hard to shake the feeling that half the nation is, along with Trump, relishing scenes of Los Angeles suffering.","Los Angeles approaches Fourth of July weekend wounded and anxious. 
One of its more questionable traditions — nightly explosions of illegal fireworks in residential neighborhoods beginning around Memorial Day, ostensibly to practice for the big night — have been noticeably quieter than in past years. Perhaps it’s because the January fires that killed 30 people and wiped out much of Altadena, Pacific Palisades, Malibu and adjacent areas have dampened the local taste for sparks and combustion.
But it’s not just the fireworks. Independence Day parades, parties and other celebrations have been canceled or postponed in one community after another: Downtown Los Angeles, East Los Angeles, Boyle Heights, El Sereno, Lincoln Heights, Cudahy, Bell Gardens, Rowland Heights, Huntington Park, Whittier. In those cities and neighborhoods, each with sizable populations of immigrant families from Latin American countries, many people who otherwise would be waving American flags along parade routes and lining up for grilled hot dogs are avoiding public places for fear of being targeted by federal immigration agents as they continue their campaign of arrests.
Across the region, once-crowded swap meets are desolate, taco and raspado carts are abandoned, Home Depot parking lots — where homeowners routinely hired day laborers on the spot — are empty.
It’s in some sense a reverse of the spring of 2020, when coronavirus lockdowns cleared freeways, offices, schools, churches, courthouses, restaurants, beaches, parks. The difference is that five years ago a swath of the population kept coming to work, notwithstanding the health risk, to continue delivering the food, mowing the lawns, cleaning the houses and watching the kids for those with the means to follow the stay-at-home orders. Now some of those same essential workers are the ones in hiding, not from COVID-19 germs, but from immigration agents masking their faces, covering their badge numbers, removing their license plates and sometimes arresting U.S. citizens as well as lawful asylum seekers and refugees. 
Federalized National Guard troops and U.S. Marines are deployed but don’t actually patrol the streets, and in fact they are rather hard to find. But the point is, they are here, part of Trump’s do-over of another 2020 episode. Perhaps he wishes he had sent the Marines into Minneapolis, Portland and Seattle during the George Floyd protests. Perhaps he sees Los Angeles in 2025 as his second chance. He has hinted at sending troops into every city governed by Democrats.
This city has seen more than its share of natural and human-made disasters, but to see Marines deployed against illegal entrants before now, you’d have to turn to the movies. In 2011’s “Battle: Los Angeles,” American audiences got two things they seem to crave: Scenes of L.A. being destroyed, followed by Marines destroying aliens. 
It’s a rich genre. Martians blew up L.A. City Hall in the 1953 version of “War of the Worlds” before being felled by a COVID-like microbe (the Marines, in this one, did not prevail). In 1996, aliens obliterated the Marines’ air station at El Toro and the Library Tower in downtown L.A. before being destroyed by a Marine and a cable TV guy in “Independence Day,” a movie that no doubt will be televised this week, as it is every Fourth of July. 
Trump’s policies treat gardeners, dishwashers and others as though they were those kinds of aliens. Invaders, rather than Angelenos and an essential part of the local economy, as well as neighbors, friends, family. The sweeps and round-ups are real injuries to real people, real traumas to communities, and not some summer blockbuster. 
Still, consider one more L.A. movie. There is a scene in “E.T. the Extraterrestrial” in which federal agents surreptitiously monitor a suburban San Fernando Valley home and then invade, with no warrant and with identities obscured and faces covered. The message is clear — the feds are the real aliens.
That’s how it feels in Los Angeles. Yes, we are a nation of laws, but must they be enforced with such contempt, such heartlessness?

Who will rebuild Altadena? What will become of the local workforce and customer base? Who will cook the food and wash the cars? Who will take care of all those homes and yards in the neighborhoods depicted in ET, and then who, in the next neighborhood over, will raise their kids to be engineers and U.S. senators, as Alex Padilla was? And when they are in the Capitol, will their dignity, and ours, be demeaned and assaulted as Padilla’s was?
Trump responded to the Eaton Canyon and Palisades fires by lecturing us that we had it coming, for reasons that are indecipherable or just fictional — we didn’t rake the forests, we didn’t turn the spigot on the half-pipe. He said he would withhold disaster relief unless we do something about illegal immigrants who cast illegal votes, although there’s no evidence for any of that nonsense.

Yet he is targeting, along with a slice of our population, our efforts to limit the emissions that heat the globe and lead to drought, flooding, wildfire and other climate disasters — not just here, but from North Carolina and Kentucky to Hawaii and around the world.
And on Monday, his administration sued Los Angeles, claiming its policies to steer clear of federal immigration enforcement was the cause of rioting that accompanied protests against the sweeps.
The twin assaults — January and June, nature and nativism, fire and fear — nip at L.A.’s soul. It’s hard to shake the feeling that half the nation is, along with Trump, relishing scenes of Los Angeles suffering. 
On this particular Fourth of July, it’s a challenge to gin up much enthusiasm for hosting the nations of the world next year in World Cup soccer. Same with the 2028 Olympics, which so far generates little of the anticipation leading up to the 1984 games, when L.A. reveled in its self-discovery as a multicultural city of the future. Both looming events now feel eerily like they are meant to be capstones on Trump’s drive to subdue the city. 
Los Angeles is resilient, and will eventually recover its spirit, as it has many times before. But summer is just starting, and it threatens to be long, hot and combustible.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/010725_PalisadesFire_TS_CM_020.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-03 09:05:41.845781

It’s the latest setback for progressive lawmakers seeking renter protections.,"In summary
California Democrats were split on a proposal that would have extended an eviction grace period for tenants who fall behind on their rent. It’s the latest setback for progressive lawmakers seeking renter protections.


Sen. Aisha Wahab implored her colleagues to think of hospitalized patients and struggling families as she pitched a proposal to give tenants a full two weeks to pay their past due rent before their landlords could start the eviction process.
“This is a very small ask from the state of California,” Wahab, a Democrat representing the Fremont area, recently told her fellow lawmakers. “(It’s) very small to allow people 14 days to either ask for family members and loved ones to give them money to stay housed, to ask their cities or any of the other nonprofits that help people with rental assistance stay housed, or to even be able to wait for their check.”
Despite Wahab’s pleas, her Senate Bill 436 failed to advance out of the Assembly Judiciary Committee last week.
It was the latest example of progressive Democrats’ struggles to add protections for California’s 17 million renters, despite lawmakers otherwise taking aggressive steps this year to address the state’s housing and homelessness crises.
Just this week, after a decade of failed efforts, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation to reform the state’s signature environmental law to stop activists from using it to block housing construction. The proposal easily passed the Senate and Assembly, despite angering the state’s influential environmental groups.
But when it comes to giving tenants more power and easing some of the nation’s highest rents, California voters and the 120 senators and Assembly members who represent them have largely balked.
Last fall, California voters decisively shot down a rent-control initiative that would have allowed local governments to block landlords from raising rents. A more aggressive rent-control measure never received a hearing this spring in the Assembly Judiciary Committee, even though it was authored by San Jose Assemblymember Ash Kalra, the committee chair.
Another bill to limit fees landlords can charge tenants on top of monthly rent was held until at least next year, despite the author being San Francisco Assemblymember Matt Haney, the chair of the Assembly Housing Committee.
The stalled bills were a remarkable display of how difficult it is for lawmakers to pass rental protection measures since committee chairs usually are influential. Wahab chairs the Senate Housing Committee. 
Her measure, which would have extended the start of the past due eviction process from three days to two weeks, is the latest setback for the Legislature’s 10-person legislative Renters’ Caucus, which counts Wahab and Haney as members.
Renter protections divide Democrats
What makes the death of Wahab’s bill especially unusual is that it happened during a committee hearing in public view and featured Democrats joining Republicans to shoot it down. As CalMatters reported, most legislation killed in the California Legislature dies quietly behind the scenes, without a vote. It’s also rare for Democrats to vote “no” on a fellow Democrat’s bill.
The Assembly Judiciary Committee’s debate highlighted the tensions between the Democratic supermajority’s progressive and more moderate members on rental protections.

Downey Assemblymember Blanca Pacheco, an attorney, said she used to represent landlords in eviction proceedings, and said the current three-day rule is just the start of an “eviction process can easily take two months, three months, four months.”
“I worry about these mom and pop landlords,” she said. “I worry about these seniors who are going to have a hardship because they rely on this money for their expenses, for their mortgage, for whatever they need. And we’re putting them in a very bad situation.”
Kalra, the committee’s chair, is also an attorney, but he saw things from the renter’s point of view. 
“They’re renters because a lot of those in the previous generations were able to buy homes 30, 40, 50-plus years ago that are completely unaffordable now,” he said. “Was that their fault (previous generations) were able to do that? Absolutely not. Is it their fault that they now can rent those properties out for a handsome sum? Absolutely not, but that’s the reality of the situation we’re in.”
Noting that Consumer Affairs recently ranked California as one of the worst states for renters, he said the proposed extra 11 days “actually allows the problem to be resolved before you even get to that (eviction) process, which is to everyone’s benefit.”
Landlord advocacy groups and other critics of the bills also note that California already has among the strongest state renter protection laws in the country.
Landlords and bankers spend big
The bill needed seven votes to pass. It got six. Kalra voted for the measure, joining five other Democrats on the committee, including Isaac Bryan of Culver City and Alex Lee of Milpitas, both members of the renters caucus. 
Pacheco cast a “no” vote, one of only seven times she’s done so in 2,271 voting opportunities so far this year, according to the Digital Democracy database. 
The three Republicans on the committee also voted “no.” Two Democrats, Diane Papan of San Mateo, and John Harabedian of Pasadena, didn’t vote, which counts the same as voting no.

The death of the eviction relief measure also points to the David vs. Goliath-sized discrepancies in the political spending between renters’ and landlords’ advocates.
The bill’s supporters included around two dozen legal aid, social services and renters’ advocacy organizations, but those groups have spent next to nothing on state politics, according to the Digital Democracy database. 
Opposing the bill were some of the state’s biggest political spenders from the business industry, including the California Chamber of Commerce and various landlord, banking and building associations. In total, those groups have given at least $13.7 million to legislators since 2015.
Wahab said in a written statement that landlords’ “money still speaks the loudest,” despite tenant advocates who represent millions.“Companies that benefit from keeping protections weak for tenants have billions of dollars to fund an army of lobbyists in the Capitol every single day,” she said. “That same machine mobilizes at the drop of a hat to pump millions into elections – even in districts during the legislative process – to scare and intimidate policymakers into voting their way, shaping the playing field long before a bill even gets a hearing.”
During the hearing, Kalra urged his colleagues to remember that just because renters are less politically active than landlords, lawmakers should not forget their plight.
“They don’t show up to your community coffees; they don’t have time to send letters in,” he told his committee moments before its members killed Wahab’s bill. “They’re trying to survive, and I think we need to also have that in the front of our mind as we consider these kinds of policies.”
The legislative session hasn’t been a complete bust for tenant-minded lawmakers – or for Wahab. Her Senate Bill 681, which includes new tax credits for renters, was tucked into a budget-related housing bill the governor signed Monday.
The advocates pushing for Wahab’s eviction relief measure also hope it comes back later this session, which is a possibility – albeit a slim one – since members of the judiciary committee voted to grant the proposal “reconsideration,” meaning it can be resurrected later if lawmakers choose. They almost never do.

He was exonerated in February and awarded more than $2.7 million in compensation. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)A Baltimore City man who was wrongly convicted of a murder nearly three decades ago will receive almost $3 million from the state — compensation for 27 years locked in prison for a crime he did not commit.
The Board of Public Works unanimously approved the payment Wednesday — and offered a public apology — to James Langhorne, who was exonerated in February in the 1996 death of Lawrence Jones.
Langhorne, in comments to the board, said the compensation is welcome, but that more should be done to help those trying to reenter society after decades behind bars.
“There’s not a lot of resources for people in our situation,” said Langhorne, who said he felt ill-prepared for his abrupt release. “You come home different from people who are generally released. You’re just let out. There’s no preparation.
“You didn’t even really know you were getting released. The moment comes up, they realize that you really didn’t commit the crime. They file something. You go to court and you just come home,” he said.
But years in prison meant Langhorne — and other exonerees — are released with no savings, no credit, no insurance or other support.
  James Langhorne said that he and others who are released after being exonerated are often retraumatized after being abruptly released with no preparation for life outside. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)
“You come out exonerated but you’re facing so many difficulties,” he said. “I’ve known of people who were exonerated who couldn’t maintain and now they’re back in prison for crimes they did commit. So that in itself is a travesty.”
Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller (D) recounted her meeting with Langhorne, in which he described going to prison for a crime he did not commit as “a trauma” and being retraumatized by being released without preparation or assistance.
Miller, chairing the board meeting  Wednesday in place of Gov. Wes Moore (D), told Langhorne she was “really sorry to hear you were faced with a situation” where assistance “wasn’t waiting for you as we should have been.”
“Your comments that you shared with me are noted and I assure you we will follow up on behalf of the state,” she said.
The settlement approved by the board includes compensation for the time Langhorne spent in prison as well as housing costs and attorney’s fees.
The payments follow funding formulas established in the Walter Lomax Act, a 2021 law named for a man who was wrongfully convicted of murder and spent nearly four decades in prison. Under the law, compensation for proven or pardoned wrongful incarceration is determined by the length of time served and the state’s median income.
Currently, that formula sets the payment at $101,652 annually, or more than $2.7 million for the 27 years Langhorne served.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
People can also get housing, vocational training and health care. The board approval included $99,720 in housing assistance for Langhorne from the state Department of Housing and Community Development and a nearly $4,700 payment to Flowers Keller LLP, the law firm that represented him.
“Nearly three decades were stolen from Mr. Langhorne, depriving him of the opportunity to pursue a career, to build a family, to contribute to our state,” Miller said.
Langhorne was arrested in 1996 and charged with the murder of Lawrence Jones. He was convicted in Baltimore City two years later despite several problems in the case against him, including witness testimony that was either unreliable or conflicting. Another witness recanted their account and prosecutors were found to have withheld information about other potential suspects.
That conviction was vacated in February after a review of the case by the conviction integrity unit of the Baltimore City Office of the State’s Attorney. Langhorne had spent 9,870 days in prison by that time.
Langhorne said he has attempted to move past his wrongful conviction.
“It’s wonderful to hear people say how sorry they are for what we went through. I myself, I don’t hold you at fault. I understand that things go wrong,” Langhorne said. “Yes, I am angry at those who violated their trust as public servants to go above and beyond to ruin a man’s life, a father’s life, to obtain a conviction, so that is what I am angry at. But to be angry overall serves no purpose. That’s something you have to let go.”
  Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller (D) apologized to Langhorne and said the state should do more to help those who are wrongfully convicted to rejoin society. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)
Miller, in her apology to Langhorne, added “there are no words to express how deeply sorry we are for what was taken from him and for the failure of our justice system.”
“And again, while no amount of money can raise the injustice you face over the time that was stolen from you, I hope today’s action by the sport provides meaningful support, healing and comfort as you step into the next chapter of your life. May peace be with you.
While the money paid to Langhorne and his attorneys comes entirely from the state, that is about to change. The state budget that took effect Tuesday includes a requirement that jurisdictions where someone was found to have been erroneously convicted have to share equally in the cost of compensation.
Because Langhorne’s case before an administrative law judge was finalized and sent to the board before July 1, however, Baltimore City will not have to pay any of the costs.
‘Discrepancy’ adds $25 million to software contract
The board also unanimously approved — with little discussion — a request to amend a software purchase that increases the cost to the state by 63%.
Two years ago, the board approved a contract to license software valued at more than $40.4 million. The contract piggybacked off a deal by the city of Mesa, Arizona.
Documents filed with the Board of Public Works said that problems with internal financial systems used by the Department of General Services and the Maryland Department of Transportation led to “financial discrepancies” in the cost of the contract. The problem resulted in an additional $18.1 million in retroactive costs and another $7.5 million for the contract that runs through the end of September.
“While DGS and MDOT have not yet been able to resolve these challenges due to technical limitations of the FMIS system, both agencies are aware of the situation and are working towards a resolution,” according to information provided to the board by the Department of General Services. “We will continue to monitor the situation and take necessary steps as appropriate to help ensure these matters are resolved.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSC_0485-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-07-03 09:05:41.845781

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The federal funding for several public school programs was scheduled to come by Tuesday. But this week instead of money, states received a notice saying that the $6.8 billion allocated for different K-12 programs were on hold and under review. 
Now, a network of summer care and after-school programs in Utah, funded by the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Grants, is under an existential threat, and the families of 10,000 children in 83 Utah programs could potentially lose their plans not only for educational opportunities, but also for child care for working parents.
The grants approved by Congress are typically distributed in April or May each year to fund high-in-demand programs offered in public and charter schools, as well as other community centers such as libraries and faith-based institutions. 
But the Trump administration is still studying whether these school programs align with other presidential initiatives, said Ben Trentelman, executive director at Utah Afterschool Network.
“Programs depend on that funding in order to be able to operate, and so if they can’t bill the state for reimbursement, these programs are unsure of exactly how long they’re going to be able to operate,” Trentelman said on Wednesday.
Trump administration tells states it’s freezing $6.8 billion for K-12 school programs

The programs may use registration fees or other means to pay for a portion of their operating costs up front. While there is other funding for the after-school and summer services, federal money is the top source, Trentelman said, accounting for over $6 million. Currently, there’s no state investment for the program.
“This enables programs to be able to operate at a higher capacity, to have higher ratios with the number of staff that they have in the number of youth that they’re able to serve,” he added. 
The Utah State Board of Education, which administers the funds locally, notified program managers they can continue using any remaining funds through August. But there’s no guarantee of funding after that, Trentelman said. At this point, most programs have already spent most of their budget for the 2024 fiscal year.
Some administrators may decide to take the risk to continue to pay for programs hoping for later reimbursements, he said. But, some smaller ones, especially in rural communities, may not have enough reserves to do that, and may have to decide whether to continue operating at all.
Because the Trump administration didn’t provide a timeline of when schools may hear more about the funding status, Anna Thomas, policy director at Voices for Utah Children, foresees that if the funds don’t get released soon, many Utah children will get kicked out of their summer programs within weeks.
“Our after-school programs in Utah are already tragically underfunded. If we were willing to serve every child that wanted to be served, our programs would be eight or nine times as large as they are right now. The only restraint on that is funding. The funding creates all the restraints,” Thomas said. “So these programs are already used to paying their staff next to nothing. They are already operating on a shoestring. They are already accepting donations in kind support from community partners.”

For the state, stopping them would represent a big employment and education disturbance, Thomas said. And without them, Utah families with school-aged children will see “incredible disruptions and stress” and other ripple effects.  
Looking at the potential repercussions, Thomas said she is, at best, disappointed by the funding freeze and the lack of consideration on its effects on communities across the county.
“When did we get to the point where kids having a safe, educational place to be in the summer with access to food that they might not get at home is somehow political? It’s not political, it’s humanitarian, it’s community service,” Thomas said. “We are leaving these families out in the cold on purpose, knowing fully how hard it will be on them in the immediate moment and how much difficulty it will create for all of us in the future.”
The programs are increasingly popular in Utah
One of the programs’ goals is to ensure that children have access to a safe place to go and to get meals outside of school hours. For many, they are a way to get their children involved in  free activities like fine arts, sports, computer science, or college and career readiness, among others.
The activities have grown especially popular over the years. For every child in a Utah after-school program, there are eight more waiting to get in, according to a survey from Afterschool Alliance. 
“These programs are actually very intentional in making sure that they’re aware of what trends are for growth in our workplace, making sure that we’re gearing kids up for whatever future opportunities may be,” Trentelman said. 
They have even partnered with different universities to mentor students interested in engineering or medical careers.
For some families, it is also a way to keep their kids out of trouble while parents are away.
“These programs operate typically between 2 and 6 p.m., when working parents are typically unavailable, and kids are also found to be engaging in riskiest behaviors at those times,” Trentelman said. “During those hours is when we typically see the highest rates of youth that are engaged in things like experimenting with drugs and alcohol, getting involved in gang activity.”

A federal court Wednesday heard arguments in a lawsuit brought by UA system professors and students against an anti-DEI law signed by Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey last year. (Will McLelland/Alabama Reflector)BIRMINGHAM — A federal judge heard arguments Wednesday in a lawsuit alleging that anti-diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) law signed by Gov. Kay Ivey last year violates the constitutional rights of professors and students.
The lawsuit, brought by professors and students in the University of Alabama System against Gov. Kay Ivey and the University of Alabama Board of Trustees, alleges that SB 129 stifled instructional activity and violated the First and Fourteenth amendment rights of the plaintiffs. 
A two-day evidentiary hearing was held last week. SB 129 bans public funding of DEI and the teaching of so-called “divisive concepts,” such as people of one race are “inherently responsible” for past crimes committed by members of that race. Critics say the legislation was vaguely written and threatened the teaching of Black history in schools.

Antonio Ingram, counsel for the plaintiffs, began oral arguments Wednesday by arguing that SB 129 prevents debates from happening in the classroom and prevents students from learning, citing as an example a course that could bring up the idea of paying reparations to Black Americans for centuries of slavery, segregation and voting disenfranchisement.
“Let’s say you’re in that reparations course, can a professor now not divide the class into two and have people take different positions?” Ingram asked.
Ingram specifically mentioned a project Cassandra Simon, a social work professor at the University of Alabama, had students complete for a grade involving a sit-in objecting to SB 129 which was cancelled while other protests on the campus were permitted by the college.
U.S. District Judge R. David Proctor, who is presiding over the case, said there could have been an “opt out provision” in place because it wasn’t clear if all of the students in the class agreed on the topic or not.
“Didn’t the administration give Dr. Simon feedback on how you can avoid that?” Proctor asked Ingram. “You can have opt out options, you can have students do a different protest.”
Jay Ezelle, an attorney representing the UA Board of Trustees, said some students could have been pressured to do the sit-in protest that was canceled.
“Where I would disagree and do disagree with Dr. Simon, is I don’t think that appreciates the pressure of the majority of students in class and the minority of students in class,” he said.
The professors in the University of Alabama system have a “credible fear of enforcement” of the law because of student complaints and investigations that have been conducted by the universities on their professors, Ingram said.
He cited testimony from Dana Patton, a political science professor and director of the Witt Fellows Program at UA, who said she was investigated over the books she assigned for her courses and due to not wanting to be investigated again, she is now afraid to teach certain topics.
Proctor pushed back, saying there was no adverse action taken against Patton and that there is always going to be a potential for student complaints.
Dan Cantor, another counsel member for the plaintiffs, argued on behalf of the students who had been affected by SB 129.
Cantor clarified statements made during Sydney Testman’s, a former financial coordination for the UAB Social Justice Advisory Council (SJAC), testimony last week stating that not only did the SJAC lose $10,000 and their University Funded Organization Status, but Testman also lost her $600 stipend due to her role as a financial coordinator being dissolved due to SB 129.
Cantor also said in court that while SJAC could have still applied to be a Registered Student Organization (RSO), it would have only been $100 the organization could receive and this funding was not secure.
The attorney also cited testimony from UAB employee Mary Wallace, who said  some RSOs cannot get funding because of the University of Alabama Birmingham’s guidance following the passing of SB 129 which states that the institution cannot provide funding for “DEI related organizations.”
Cantor also provided clarification on testimony from UAB student Miguel Luna, who testified last week that his organization, Esperanza, lost funding due to SB 129. The attorney said Wednesday Esperanza also lost funding when SJAC did due to Esperanza using funding from SJAC to host events.
Counsel for Ivey did agree with the plaintiffs that Testman suffered due to the removal of her stipend, but argued Luna’s claim wasn’t reasonable because it’s more difficult to determine.
Cantor said the UA chapter of the NAACP has also been negatively impacted by SB 129 due to the closure of the Black Student Union and Safe Zone spaces which were used by multiple members of the organization. He argued these two spaces were closed due to UA assuming they would violate the bill because of the vague wording.
“UA doesn’t have to provide space, but once they do, they can’t discriminate based on viewpoint,” Cantor said.
The UA chapter of the NAACP is worried it might be completely shut down due to SB 129 according to Cantor. He said the organization is at risk of not receiving funding and they aren’t able to recruit members and leaders because of the BSU space being closed.
In their presentation, lawyers for Gov. Ivey argued that the professors are not advocating to teach divisive concepts, but instead are worried about student complaints and not actual enforcement.
Defense for Ivey also said the language in the bill isn’t vague and certain topics like political and social science need limits.
“You can always talk yourself into thinking a statute is vague,” counsel said.
Proctor is still indicating that he wants to decide whether an injunction should be issued before classes start in August. He also told both sides to discuss institutional neutrality and implementations to be on the same page.

,California,2025-07-03 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,Presidential election reveals big shift in California voting patterns. Will it last?,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/07/presidential-election-shift-california-voting/,Kamala Harris' poorer than expected performance with key demographic groups and increases in young voters registering Republican are signs of political change in California.,"For the last eight months, ever since Donald Trump walloped Kamala Harris to reclaim the presidency, Democratic politicians, political interest groups and media pundits of all stripes have debated what happened and why.
Deep dives into who voted, and sometimes why, have generally concluded that Harris lost decisive ground — compared to Joe Biden’s 2000 unseating of Trump — among younger male voters, especially Latinos and Blacks, and could not generate enough support among other demographic groups, such as women, to offset the losses.
“Overall, Harris performed six points worse among men than Biden did,” an extensive analysis by the Cook Political Report declared. “But that falloff was significantly more pronounced among Latino men (-12) and Black men (-7). Among white men without a college degree — a group that is traditionally the least friendly to Democrats — the slippage was least dramatic (-3).
“Despite the historic nature of her candidacy as the first woman of color to be nominated for president, women greeted that fact with more of a shrug,” Cook continued. “Harris’ vote share among women was basically the same as the share Biden got in 2020, except for a noticeable decline in support from Latinas. She also slightly underperformed Biden among Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) women (-4) and failed to do any better with Black women than Biden did.”
California, one of the nation’s bluest states, was not immune to the political hemmorhage that doomed Harris’ campaign, even though she is a Californian who was the state’s attorney general and a U.S. senator before becoming Biden’s vice president.
Voters in 10 California counties which had backed Biden against Trump in 2000, switched to Trump last year, and a new analysis of California’s vote indicates that the state saw the same dynamics as the nation as a whole.
“After years of declining shares of registered voters selecting Republican as their party registration, young Californians have begun to move towards the Republican party in recent election years while older Californians continue to move away,” the analysis by the Center for Inclusive Democracy at the University of Southern California declares.
 “Young registered voters of all racial and ethnic groups saw notably larger shifts towards the Republican party compared to their older counterparts. Latino youth, however, saw particularly large growth in Republican party registration between presidential elections.”
It continued, “While Vice President Kamala Harris received 58.5% of all votes cast in California’s 2024 general election, President Donald Trump received 38.3% of the votes, the smallest difference in the vote by party (20.2 percentage points) since before 2008.”
While Republicans obviously gained ground in California last year — and did reasonably well in congressional and legislative elections — the new data generate two questions: Why did it happen, and what does it bode for the future?
“Inflation is probably the biggest thing,” Eric McGhee, a political analyst for the Public Policy Institute of California, said during a webinar to introduce the study.
That comports with the widespread belief that sharp increases in the cost of living during the Biden-Harris administration were a big factor in the pro-Trump shift, as younger voters felt the pinch of inflation more than their elders.
Make no mistake. California is still a very blue state. It’s highly unlikely that Republicans, who were once dominant themselves, would regain enough ground to again award the state’s electoral votes to a GOP presidential candidate in the foreseeable future.
However, were the rightward surge of young voters of color to continue, for whatever reason, as baby boomer Democrats exit the political stage, California politics could become a lot less predictable and a lot healthier.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/110624-President-Donald-Trump-AP-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-03 08:04:57.481541

One of the worst racial massacres in U.S. history ended after three days in East St. Louis, Illinois. After Black workers were given jobs in a factory that received government contracts, white workers began stabbing, beating and killing them. As many as 100 or more were killed, hundreds more were injured, and 6,000 were driven from their homes. 
“My father … witnessed … horrible things: People’s houses being set ablaze, . . .  people being shot when they tried to flee, some trying to swim to the other side of the Mississippi while being shot at by white mobs with rifles, others being dragged out of street cars and beaten and hanged from street lamps,” said Dhati Kennedy, whose father was one of the survivors.

But that hasn't made watching the debate any less worrisome.","Transgender advocates say that the cost to provide gender affirming care under Medicaid is small, but meaningful for those who need that care.(File photo by Amy-Xiaoshi DePaola/Cronkite News)As Congress wrangles over a budget reconciliation bill that would deny federal funds to pay for gender-affirming care, Lee Blinder appreciates the fact that they live in Maryland, which would likely cover any federal shortfall if it came to it.
But that hasn’t made watching the debate any less worrisome, said Blinder, the executive director for Trans Maryland.
“There’s the practical impact — and then there’s the emotional impact,” Blinder said. “The emotional impact of watching elected officials, and those who are in these positions of authority over our lives, attempt to eliminate people’s access to life-saving care is a stressful process — the emotional devastation that occurs when you see your government making these steps to try to eliminate your access to basic care.”
Blinder’s remarks come as Congress is engaged in an on-again, off-again debate over transgender care funding as it fights over the budget reconciliation bill, a massive combination of tax and budget cuts that President Donald Trump has called the one, big beautiful bill. The measure would extend tax cuts, increase defense and homeland security spending, and slash spending on Medicaid and food assistance programs.
The House also included a provision to prohibit the use of federal funds for gender-affirming care, when the House originally sent the bill over to the Senate last month. That provision had been stripped out by the time the Senate sent its version of the 1,000-page bill back to the House this week, thus allowing federal funds for such care — not because senators had a change of heart, but because the Senate parliamentarian said that keeping the ban in the bill would require more than a simple majority for approval.
So far, the bill has passed by one-vote margins in both the House and Senate.

The bill stalled briefly in the House this week, when fiscal hawks complained about the cost of the bill, which could add as much as $3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates. But among their problems with the bill was the fact that it would again allow federal funds for gender-affirming care.
“It’s an extraordinarily stressful time for transgender Marylanders,” said Blinder, who says there should not be a “poor tax” for transgender people who can’t afford gender-affirming care.
Unlike other states that have worked to restrict access to that medical care, Blinder noted that Maryland lawmakers have worked to protect gender-affirming care for some 24,000 transgender Marylanders.
In 2023, Gov. Wes Moore (D) approved the Trans Health Equity Act which says Maryland Medicaid “shall” cover gender-affirming care, granting lower income Marylanders access those procedures that they may not otherwise have been able to afford.
The state currently receives federal dollars to support those services. But under the Trans Health Equity Act, the state is expected to fund gender-affirming care, with or without federal support.
The Maryland Department of Health reports that in 2024, Maryland Medicaid spent $1.7 million to fund more than 1,600 unique office visits for gender-affirming care services. That figure currently includes about $900,000 in federal funding. A health department spokesperson said that the federal match for gender-affirming care “varies by eligibility group but is generally a 50% match.”
Senate Budget and Taxation Chair Guy Guzzone (D-Howard), said that it’s a cost that Maryland could probably absorb if federal funding was lost.
“It’s not insignificant … but the state could cover it,” he said.
Last week, Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said the General Assembly would likely have tried to backfill those dollars, among other cuts, “whatever we can and however we can.”
“Medical decisions are best made between a patient and their doctor,” he said. “I believe that in the state of Maryland, we protect people’s right to privacy and their relationship with their doctor, and we are covering medical care that is appropriately determined between that patient and their doctor. “

But Del. Kris Fair (D-Frederick) said that it’s not the size of the missing dollars that matters but the message toward the transgender community.
“It wouldn’t even make a small, teeny tiny dent in the question of our budget, which should tell you everything you need to know about what they’re actually doing here,” Fair said.
“The amount of money that’s spent on gender-affirming care is a pebble in an ocean of money.” he said. “People are trying to politicize a community that is simply trying to live and survive.”
While it was a “sigh of relief” when the gender-affirming care prohibition was cut from the Senate version of the bill, significantly increasing the chance that federal funds could still be used, Fair noted that the transgender community will still be affected by other provisions of the legislation, such as major cuts to Medicaid funding that could knock thousands of Marylanders off their health care coverage.
“If it goes through the way the Senate has passed that, the impact is still going to be deeply felt by the trans community, by other LGBTQ+ people, just because of the disproportionate percentages of people that rely on Medicaid,” he said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/08-sex-cape-full-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-07-03 08:04:57.481541

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Provisions in the new tax and spending bill passed by the U.S. Senate early Tuesday would go even further than the original House bill in removing health care and other benefits from immigrants with legal status.
The House version of the massive tax and spending bill penalized states providing health care for some immigrants with legal status as well as those that chose to spend state money to enroll immigrants without legal status in Medicaid.
But the Senate bill is even tougher on immigrants here legally and illegally, reducing benefits for most refugees and immigrants on humanitarian parole, including Afghans and Ukrainians who helped the United States in wars overseas and in return were promised safe haven and a safety net in the United States.
The Senate bill also cuts state reimbursement for emergency care in the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, which includes Maryland. That would force those states to pay more for emergency care for immigrants, cut back services or drop out of Medicaid expansion, a potentially catastrophic move for low-income U.S. citizens as well as new immigrants.
The bill passed with three dissenting Republican votes, from Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Vice President JD Vance broke the tie. The bill, officially the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” is currently in the House, where it has stalled briefly on procedural votes. Legislative leaders had hoped to pass the bill and send it to President Donald Trump for his signature by July Fourth.
Advocates and experts see repercussions as refugees and other legal immigrants lose health insurance and turn to already-stressed hospitals and charities for help. It could be a nail in the coffin for some rural hospitals that are in financial trouble and scaling back services. Hospitals are required to serve anyone who arrives for emergency care, regardless of their ability to pay.
Rural hospitals, SNAP cuts, Medicaid: Democrats force tough votes on GOP megabill

“In our state, it’s going to be absolutely devastating for rural hospitals,” said Kate Woomer-Deters, a senior attorney at the North Carolina Justice Center’s Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Refugees are not going to go home just because they lost their health care coverage. They’re still going to be showing up at the door of hospitals and clinics needing care.”
Some groups, such as Afghans, Ukrainians and Iraqis, were often brought here after helping the U.S. in war efforts, putting their lives in danger and making life in their home country untenable.
“In the case of the Afghans, this is pretty much a knife in the back to those folks who helped the United States when the United States needed help in their country,” said David Meyer, a board member of the Bloomington Refugee Support Network in Indiana, where he personally helps seven refugee families from Afghanistan, Honduras, Iraq, Nicaragua and Syria.
The Senate bill takes Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and even food stamps off the table for most refugees. There are a few narrow exceptions for people with green cards, some Cuban migrants waiting for citizenship, and some Micronesians and Marshall Islands natives with treaty rights, said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
That also applies to immigrants with legal status who don’t have green cards: people with asylum, immigrant victims of domestic violence, immigrant victims of sex trafficking and parolees — such as Afghans — admitted due to urgent humanitarian reasons, as well as to refugees.
“There’s going to be more emergency health care needs because uninsured people will be delaying care,” Gonzales said. “It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.”
The bill also cuts funding for expansion states to pay for emergency care in hospitals. Increased costs could force some states to drop Medicaid expansion altogether, spreading the pain to low-income U.S. citizens as well, Gonzales said.
“It’s one more reason states are looking at their budgets and they’re having to make decisions about their Medicaid expansion program,” Gonzales said.
In Indiana, Meyer said, Afghan women especially often need food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to get by at first. It takes them a long time to learn to read and write since they were not allowed to attend any school under the Taliban.

“They arrived in our community totally illiterate in their native language and starting from scratch learning English, so that’s a huge impediment to being gainfully employed,” Meyer said. Even once they’ve become self-sufficient enough to get off food stamps and Medicaid, many still need the support of the Affordable Care Act to get health care.
Removing all subsidized health care “would have a devastating effect on those families, and not just Afghans but Syrians, people from the Democratic Republic of Congo and others that have been relocated to south-central Indiana,” Meyer said.
Indiana hosted more than 10,500 of the nearly 460,000 refugees who arrived in the United States between 2013 and 2023, according to a 2023 report from the nonprofit Immigration Research Initiative. In fiscal 2024, another 1,380 arrived in Indiana, mostly from Congo and Burma, but including 90 people from Afghanistan, according to State Department records.
In North Carolina, there were 276 new Afghan refugees in fiscal 2024 among 2,730 total new refugees. Even professional Afghans such as doctors and lawyers struggle at first in low-wage jobs, said Woomer-Deters, of the North Carolina Justice Center. It takes time for them to get accreditation and language skills to practice their professions here, she said.
“A lot of these folks need their food stamps, Medicaid — they need these programs for an adjustment period when they get here. And these are people we’ve invited to come and have vetted,” she said.
A Congressional Budget Office report June 29 estimated that almost 12 million people, including 1.4 million immigrants covered by state-only programs, would lose health insurance under the Senate plan.
A Republican response to an earlier CBO report emphasized that the bill would save states $13.1 billion in Medicaid spending over 10 years, “freeing up resources they can choose to reinvest to further strengthen care for the most vulnerable Americans.”
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, however, called that conclusion misleading in its own response in turn.
“These savings would largely result from millions of people losing health coverage — hardly an outcome worth celebrating,” the response said.
Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, said there was one small positive change in the Senate version compared to the House version: States will no longer be penalized for using the option to cover some immigrant children and pregnant women.
And the Senate version would not penalize expansion states for offering Medicaid to immigrants on humanitarian parole, but only because that help for parolees was ended in entirely, along with help for refugees and other kind of immigrants with legal status who lack green cards, Cuello said.
“In other words, they are blocking all paths to health care,” Cuello said in an emailed statement. “This is not an attack on the undocumented. It’s an attack on lawfully present immigrants.”

(Photo: Ronda Churchill for Nevada Current)Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto is warning Nevadans that President Donald Trump’s spending and tax cut bill will ripple through every aspect of the state’s health care system, going far beyond those who directly rely on Medicaid.
Hospitals are already assessing whether they may need to cut staff or reduce services, said Cortez Masto during a Wednesday virtual roundtable with representatives from University Medical Center, Nevada Hospital Association, and Northern Nevada HOPES to discuss the legislation. 
They all agreed such cuts would have a cascading effect on anyone needing medical treatment.
Lee derides Big Beautiful Bill’s Medicaid cuts: ‘People will lose their health care’

That is on top of the direct impact of the proposed Medicaid cuts, which providers have warned will result in delayed care, lost access to lifesaving medical treatments and possible closures of facilities.
“It is going to devastate health care in Nevada,” Cortez Masto said.
The House is expected to vote on the amended version of “Big Beautiful Bill,” which narrowly passed the Senate on Tuesday. Cortez Masto and the entire Senate Democratic caucus voted against the bill, as did three Republican senators.
Among the GOP-backed megabill’s various provisions are $930 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next 10 years.
“All of this is happening so that Republicans and President Trump can pay for billions of dollars in tax giveaways for the wealthiest Americans,” Cortez Masto said.
The legislation is estimated to kick around 17 million Americans off Medicaid or Affordable Care Act coverage, with about 114,500 Nevadans at risk of losing their health care, she said.
Among the nearly 738,000 enrolled in Medicaid in Nevada, 39% are children and 15% have chronic conditions, according to KFF. 
Nevada has a long history of low Medicaid reimbursement rates for healthcare providers.
Republicans target a tax that keeps state Medicaid programs running

In 2023, Nevada’s private hospitals agreed to pay what’s known as a “provider tax” that funds Medicaid and helps the state access additional federal matching dollars.
The current rate brings Nevada around $830 million each year.
That would change if the bill is passed. According to Nevada Hospital Association President Pat Kelly, payment amounts would be reduced “by about 30%, starting in 2028,” resulting in a reduction of around $618 million in funding annually.
“When you get to this low level, the program may need to be terminated by about January 1, 2030 to avoid major cash flow risks for our acute care hospitals,” Kelly said. “We agreed to pay 15% of the provider fee money to support behavioral health care services, and that will get cut as well.”
Because of many last-minute changes to the bill that were introduced in a 27-hour voting session, Kelly said the association is still assessing just “how devastating the impact is going to be to the provider fee program.”
Beatrice Nortey, a pediatric nurse who relies on Medicaid to treat her sickle cell disease, said these cuts go beyond numbers.
Many of the children in her care rely on Medicaid to pay for the oxygen tanks, suction tubes, and mobility devices.  
These “items that aren’t optional but necessary to keep them alive and out of the hospital,” she said. “When Medicaid is cut, these children face delays or denials in getting equipment they need, which can lead to unnecessary suffering, emergency room visits and even death.”
 ‘Ultimately gets paid by taxpayers’

Nevada has long faced a shortage of health care providers and consistently “ranks near the bottom nationally for primary care doctors and mental health care professionals per capita,” said Dr. Ketan Patel, the medical director of UMC.
The bill, he said, would make those deficits even more pronounced.
“When Medicaid gets cut, reimbursement rates drop,” Patel said. “That drives even more doctors to opt out of seeing these patients entirely.”
Jennifer Wakem, the CFO of UMC, said around 42% of patients that come in for inpatient care rely on Medicaid.
“To stay afloat financially, it would mean we potentially would cut services offered,” Wakem said. “If we chose not to go down that path, we would likely reach out to” Clark County “for additional subsidies to keep UMC open. That, of course, ultimately gets paid by taxpayers.”
The bill will likely hurt people who use private insurance. 
In a strained health system, those individuals would likely see premiums and out-of-pocket costs soar, Cortez Masto said, adding that Nevadans receiving coverage through the Affordable Care Act “could see premiums rise by $705 per year.”
“More people now are going to be showing up in our emergency rooms with acute care because they now have lost the health care that they need to even provide preventative care for them,” she said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/UMC_RC_002.JPG-ronda-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-03 08:04:57.481541

Photo by Patrick Donnelly/Center for Biological Diversity.A conservation group is suing the federal government for delaying its decision on whether to list a rare wetland wildflower that grows in Nevada and California as an endangered or threatened species.
The lawsuit, filed by the Center for Biological Diversity, alleges the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service violated the Endangered Species Act when the agency failed to issue a timely 12-month finding on a petition to list the Tecopa bird’s beak, as required by federal law.
“The agency’s failure to meet the deadline delays crucial, lifesaving protections for Tecopa bird’s beak, increasing its risk of extinction,” the lawsuit reads.
The Tecopa bird’s beak is a rare wildflower that is only known to grow at three alkali wetland sites in western Nevada and eastern California. The plant has pink to pale lavender flowers and relies entirely on shallow groundwater that feeds wetlands in Nevada’s Esmeralda and Nye counties, and California’s Inyo County.
According to the lawsuit, the rare wildflower faces threats from groundwater pumping for agricultural use, geothermal energy development, mining, utility-scale solar development, and residential sprawl.
“As a groundwater-dependent species in the nation’s driest state, the Tecopa bird’s beak is uniquely vulnerable to extinction and needs to be protected,” said Patrick Donnelly, Great Basin director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “The Fish and Wildlife Service has delayed long enough.”
The conservation group filed a petition to list the wildflower under the Endangered Species Act in October 2024, kicking off a yearlong review after the agency signaled the wildflower could potentially qualify for federal protections. 
Groundwater levels in Esmeralda County’s Fish Lake Valley, where the rare wildflower grows, have steadily declined due to overpumping. If the groundwater continues to decline, the Tecopa bird’s beak could face extinction, said Donnelly. 
The aquifer under Fish Lake Valley feeding the groundwater-dependent wetland ecosystem is heavily over-appropriated, meaning more water is taken out of it than goes into it each year. The aquifer’s water level has dropped two feet a year, the overuse drawing it down 75 feet since the 1960s.
Most of that water has been used to grow alfalfa in the region, a water-intensive crop that primarily feeds cattle in the beef and dairy industries, according to state documents.
The entirety of the plant’s habitat in Fish Lake Valley is allocated for solar energy development under the Bureau of Land Management’s Western Solar Plan, exposing it to development pressures, according to the lawsuit.
“As groundwater levels decline the species will experience reduced vigor, reduced reproductive capacity, and eventually population declines or extirpation,” reads the lawsuit.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/RSTecopa-birds-beak-Esmerelda-County-Patrick-Donnelly-FPWC-lpr-1024x709.jpg,,,2025-07-03 08:04:57.481541

It's been transformational.","This story was originally published by The Trace, a nonprofit newsroom covering gun violence in America. Sign up for its newsletters here.
On a rainy day in early May, a COMPASS Youth Collaborative van cruises down Wethersfield Avenue in Hartford, Connecticut. The thoroughfare, with its historical ties to the Colt firearms family, is an epicenter for gun violence in the city. From the driver’s seat, Diego Lopez, a Peacebuilder with the violence interruption nonprofit, points out the invisible borders that define life and death for the city’s young people. 
This is the territory of 420 GMS, a loosely organized street crew. A few streets over, it’s the Latin Kings, and further down, Los Solidos — a street gang formed in Hartford in the 1990s that’s experiencing a resurgence today, Lopez says. The groups form fault lines in a landscape dotted with persistent poverty and frequent violence, where teenagers have access to Glocks with switches for automatic fire or assault-style pistols equipped with drum magazines.
Hartford isn’t known nationally as a hotspot of gun violence, but it has one of the highest rates in Connecticut. Though its homicide rate declined from a high of 32 per 100,000 residents in 2022 to 18 in 2024, its rate is still roughly three times the national average. 
“Our worst enemy out here is the high-volume weapons — war weapons,” Lopez, a former Latin Kings member and four-time gunshot survivor who completed a 16-year prison sentence before becoming a violence interrupter more than a decade ago, tells me. “We’re talking young people as young as 14 or 15 years old having access to this stuff. These kids don’t even got access to PlayStations.”
In this high-stakes environment, interrupting violence requires more than just good intentions. It demands precision, consistency, and information. For the team at COMPASS, their most powerful weapon isn’t worn on a vest or carried in a holster. It’s an app on their phone.
It’s called Navi.
COMPASS was established three decades ago — during the early days of widespread internet adoption. For years, the vital work of COMPASS’s violence interrupters, case managers, mentors, and social workers was a whirlwind of paper notes, binders, and memory. A Peacebuilder might have 25 young people on their caseload, each with a complex web of needs, rivalries, court hearings, and appointments. Tracking it all was a nightmare. 
That changed in 2021 when COMPASS decided to build its own case management solution. The organization came up with Navi, a custom, secure, mobile-first platform designed by the Peacebuilders themselves and engineered with the help of a contractor. “I was begging for this for maybe 12 years,” Lopez recalled. He even won an internal competition to name the app.
“If you’re in the middle of a crisis, paperwork becomes the last thing you want to do because you have to go sit down and write,” Jacquelyn Santiago Nazario, the organization’s CEO, said. “Here it’s just, click. There’s less room for error.” The goal was a system that was easy to use on the go, secure and HIPAA-compliant to protect a vulnerable population, and most importantly, useful.
Today, Navi is the digital backbone of COMPASS’s entire operation. It’s a real-time intelligence hub that transforms how Peacebuilders engage with young people at risk of being involved in violence, giving the violence interrupters access to live data wherever they are.
“It’s amazing,” Lopez said. “It tells me everything I need to know in real time. If there’s an update put in there five minutes ago, I’ll be able to go in there and see it.”
This real-time data is the key to navigating often dangerous social dynamics of the street. Before engaging a young person or bringing them to COMPASS’s youth center, a Peacebuilder can check Navi. A “red” safety assessment may, for example, signal an active conflict between the young person and another participant. 
In other words, the app prevents potential eruptions of violence — creating another layer of safety for both Peacebuilders and the young people they work with.
“I’ll be able to look at all youth safety assessments and know if they can be together or not,” Lopez said. “Those are being updated on a constant basis.”
The platform is more than a conflict web or network analysis. It’s a comprehensive support system. Peacebuilders log every interaction, from a missed phone call to a deep conversation on a street corner, contributing to nearly 2,800 notes entered into Navi each month. It helps the Peacebuilders, social workers, and other staff ensure the participants are actually getting what they need.
Peacebuilders can submit “basic needs requests” — say, for a participant who needs deodorant or clean clothes for a job interview — which are immediately routed to a program coordinator who makes sure the need is met. They track “major life events,” both positive and negative. The system then alerts the entire team to provide collective support when a youth is arrested or experiences the death of a loved one, or to celebrate when they land a job. In the end, Navi helps them track participants’ readiness and skills they’ve learned from the organization’s use of cognitive behavioral interventions, education, and support.
Navi also helped COMPASS realize that they needed more Peacebuilders and to reduce the caseload of each person from 25 participants down to between 15 and 18. “We’re high-touch,” said Ayelet Chozick, the director of organizational advancement. “We’d like our Peacebuilders to see you three times a week. We were seeing that they were not being able to see all these kids in this amount of time, and we made the strategic decision to get the funding to add more.”
That data-driven approach helps the team to be relentlessly consistent, Diamond Cooper Jenkins, a COMPASS Peacebuilder, told me. For young people who have been repeatedly let down by the systems and adults in their lives, having a reliable “someone” may be what finally breaks through.
“It’s all about accessibility,” Jenkins said. “If they try to call us, and we don’t come through, then you’re building barriers. If you say you’re going to be there for them, you’ve got to follow through.”
The Navi data doesn’t replace the human touch or the lived experience that defines what credible messengers do, but it does empower the work. It allows the Peacebuilders to focus their energy on building relationships, knowing that logistical details are managed and essential information is logged.
Navi also helps COMPASS comprehensively track the efficacy of their programming, a barrier other grassroots anti-violence programs often struggle with. It’s showing promising results.
According to that data, 79 percent of their roughly 200 participants saw a reduction in their risk levels, and 73 percent reduced their engagement in violence. The recidivism rate for participants under 18 — most of whom have already faced the criminal legal system before they got involved with COMPASS — is just 26 percent, compared to the Connecticut state average of more than 70 percent. For young adults in the program, it’s 20 percent versus the state’s 55 percent. 
In addition to its Peacebuilder street-based outreach program, COMPASS’s hospital-based violence intervention program, which responds to every violent injury of a person under 25 in Hartford, has seen more than 95 percent of its clients avoid returning to the hospital with complications from their original injury and avoid revictimization.
COMPASS’s approach could serve as a model for other violence intervention programs. Santiago Nazario said the organization is exploring ways to share the lessons it’s learned from Navi — and possibly the platform itself — with other organizations.
Their work to prevent violence not only saves lives but also taxpayer dollars. It costs about $12,000 a year to put a participant through the COMPASS program, Chozick said. The cost to incarcerate one person in Connecticut runs over $60,000 a year.
Yet the ground is shifting beneath them. Federal funding for community violence intervention and prevention programs has been slashed since President Donald Trump took office in January, leaving organizations like COMPASS in a precarious position as they await word on whether their grants will be affected. One of the organization’s federal grants is set to expire in September, and after the Trump administration’s cuts, fewer new grants are opening up that COMPASS could apply for.
“To see this work getting cut is devastating,” Santiago Nazario said. “What happens when we can’t serve more kids, or we don’t have enough to support the kids that we have?”
Back in the van, Lopez pulls up to a curb to meet a young man who has experienced a catalogue of challenges, including the loss of two best friends in separate, traumatic events. The losses, less than two years apart, threw him off, he said, and he found himself involved with the wrong people. 
When the Peacebuilders first approached him, the now 18-year-old was skeptical. But their relentless outreach — though it sometimes verged on annoying — eventually won him over.
“They helped me,” he told me. “Two years ago, I really couldn’t see where I would be in the future. Now, a year later, I already know what I’m going to be doing. I already got plans set out.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/thumbnail_image001-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-03 08:04:57.481541

(Photo by Kate Horne)There’s a tradition that when someone sings Handel’s “Hallelujah Chorus,” everyone has to stand. So please rise as I warble several heartfelt hallelujahs over what the Manatee County Commission did last week.
The headline in the Sarasota Herald-Tribune tells only half the story: “Manatee County commissioners deny development of hundreds of homes in Parrish.”
Missing words from this summary include “in a flood-prone area.” Also missing: “Wetlands were going to be wiped out” and, most surprisingly, “The developer is one of the most politically powerful people in the state.”
Oh, and, “The commissioners were unanimous in rejecting it.”
  Developer Pat Neal via his website
Of course, the developer, former state senator Pat Neal, told the Herald-Tribune he plans to fight the decision: “Standby. This is not over.” I picture him singing this like King George III in “Hamilton” telling the rebellious Americans, “You’ll be back!”
We’ve seen a lot of discouraging environmental news lately. Gov. Ron DeSantis has decided that reviving his national political profile by building a detention center with a catchy nickname is more important than saving the Everglades. He also vetoed money to tear down the old Rodman Dam and restore the Ocklawaha River. Meanwhile, the Legislature slashed the funding for buying more land to preserve it.
In so dark a world, a move like Manatee County’s shines like a rare beacon of hope.
“The board’s denial … is the first time commissioners have outright denied a project pitched by one of the region’s most prominent developers,” the Herald-Tribune reported.
Here’s how it happened: “A few of us strangers who are neighbors banded together; that’s what made it possible,” one of them told me this week.
 ‘Make me an offer’
Neal’s Linkedin page says he’s been the CEO of Neal Communities since 1970, which is a loooooong time to be doing just one thing. He’s built 25,000 homes so far.
He’s also taken control of a lot of land. In 2014, the Bradenton Herald reported that Neal was trying to snap up as much ranch and farmland as he could to convert it to residential and commercial buildings, regardless of size, location, or zoning.
“If you have land, we want it,” Neal told the paper. “You can even put my personal cellphone number in the newspaper. Make me an offer.”
Forbes magazine ran a more recent profile of Neal noting the current economic slowdown. The headline said, “He made a billion building bouses for Florida’s ‘Marvelous Middle.’ Now things aren’t so marvelous.”
Yes, you read that right. The business magazine estimates Neal’s company, Neal Communities, is worth $1.2 billion-with-a-b.
He hasn’t been shy about sharing his wealth with quite a few political entities. In just the last three years he’s donated $50,000 to the Florida Republican Party and $45,000 to Senate President Ben Albritton — ironic, considering Albritton claims to be a champion of the state’s remaining rural areas.
His biggest contribution of all, $200,000, went to a PAC named Better Roads for Florida that’s — surprise! — headed by an executive of Neal Communities. I wonder if he just moved the money from his left pants pocket to his right one.
Because of his generosity, when Neal wants something, he usually gets it.
For instance, he wanted this year’s Legislature to block local governments from making any changes in their development codes that would better protect people from hurricane damage. With Senate Bill 180, he got what he wanted. Gov. DeSantis, apparently feeling he hadn’t done enough horrible things to our state this week, signed it into law on Monday.
Like the Wizard of Oz, though, Neal prefers not to be seen pulling the levers of power. He deploys a cadre of consultants to speak for him. In April, when he made a rare personal appearance at a Manatee County Commission meeting to talk about more road construction as a solution to developer-caused traffic congestion, he admitted it was his first time standing before the board since 1979.
He didn’t show up in person to push Porter Ranch. Instead, the petitioner was one of Neal’s companies, this one named SimplyDwell, which had requested a rezoning of 217 acres of agricultural land.
SimplyDwell would use that rural land to build a new subdivision of 440 homes. But the board said a word Neal seldom hears: No.
“The county commission is correct to reject Pat Neal’s proposal to build in a flood zone,” Glenn Compton of the venerable environmental group ManaSota-88 told me. “It’s encouraging to see locally elected officials place the public’s interest ahead of a developer’s profits, something that rarely happens.”
 Parrish is perishing
Parrish is an old farming community, named for a pioneer rancher named Crawford Parrish. Like a lot of Florida farming communities in recent years, parts of it have been smacked by sprawl.
Cows got moved out as developers moved in, building 1,000-home subdivisions. Out went the pastures, in came the pickleball courts and dog parks. Longtime residents fear their quiet, old Parrish is perishing.
The previous version of the county commission threw their door open wide to allow in all of that change. They approved every developer request, no matter how damaging to its neighbors.
They even voted 6-1 to get rid of the county’s strict wetlands protections, despite how important wetlands are for flood control and groundwater recharge.
Voters could see what was going on. Many had turned out to oppose the wetlands rollback, only to see their commissioners ignore their wishes and kowtow to developers.
Meanwhile, all the new development made their traffic and stormwater problems much worse, especially when Hurricane Debby hit last August.
  Ariel Lowe via screengrab
“My whole house had a moat,” recalled Ariel Lowe, whose Parrish property backs up to the site of the Pope Ranch development. She keeps goats, chickens, and other livestock: “My animals looked like they needed snorkels.”
The Pope Ranch property fared about the same as she did, she told me: “Where they were trying to build got saturated from being totally flooded.”
The neighbors could all picture Neal’s development pushing the floodwaters off the Pope Ranch property and onto their own.
  Abbey Tyrna via Suncoast Waterkeeper
After the storm, “there was a flooding forum and I was a part of that,” said Abbey Tyrna, executive director of the environmental group Suncoast Waterkeeper. “A lot of the people who showed up seemed surprised to see that they weren’t alone.”
The forum, organized in part by the East Manatee Preservation Association, drew a packed house, said other participants. County officials at the forum acknowledged that much of their floodplain data are outdated and obsolete, which was far from comforting.
Tyrna told me her main message to the forum attendees was how important wetlands are for soaking up flooding. Get rid of them and the flooding is bound to get worse.
  Kate Horne via screengrab
Another of the neighbors of Pope Ranch, Kate Horne, told me that they’ve already lost too many wetlands because “the previous commission just approved everything.” She could tell the loss of wetlands has gone too far because “I’ve had flooding on days when we had no rain.”
 Snow in Florida
Whenever I have questions about Manatee County, I call up former commissioner Joe McClash, who publishes the Bradenton Times. He told me the unpopularity of the wetlands rollback, followed by the flooding, helped doom the pro-development county commission.
Then, making the voters even angrier, DeSantis appointed one of the pro-developer county commissioners to be the new supervisor of elections, despite having zero experience at running elections.
  Joe McClash via Manatee County
McClash joked that DeSantis, by removing one of the commissioners, deserves the credit for allowing the voters to flip a majority of the commission seats during the fall election. So did the decision by the most pro-development incumbent to run against the lone anti-sprawl commissioner  –  and then he lost.
Suddenly, there was a new commission majority — still all Republicans, but for a change willing to listen to their constituents. The new commissioners were talking about imposing a one-year development moratorium and requiring developers to pay much more in impact fees.
The developers, not accustomed to such independence, made noises about not negotiating.
“They told me it would have to snow in Florida before I could get the builders to come and see me,” one of the new commissioners said.
Meanwhile, when the commissioners tried to restore the wetlands rules that had been in place before, they were slammed against the hall lockers. The bullies were four, count ’em, FOUR state agencies that answer to DeSantis, each one questioning whether being so protective of wetlands could possibly be legal.
“This is bat s*** crazy,” one of the newer commissioners said in disbelief.
This should give you a good idea of why the commissioners reacted the way they did to seeing the proposal from Neal to build more than 400 new homes at Pope Ranch.
The ranch, by the way, is in a designated Coastal High Hazard Area. And the plans called for destroying wetlands to make room for the entrance and exit roads, Lowe told me.
If the plans had been approved, Lowe said, she knew what would happen during the next flood. The roads in and out would have been underwater.
“He would’ve left everybody in that development landlocked,” she said.
 Selling swampland
To speak for this unpopular project, Neal dispatched a platoon of planners, consultants, and engineers, plus his longtime attorney, Ed Vogler. Vogler insisted that the development wouldn’t make the region’s flooding worse.
“We sympathize, we empathize, we understand” the objections of the neighbors, he told commissioners during a May meeting. He said Neal was willing to take “extraordinary measures” to deal with the flooding, adding, “We can’t solve the historical problems, but we can make it better.”
  Mark Van De Ree via screengrab
Nobody bought it, though. One opponent, Mark Van De Ree, joked, “I’ve lived in Southwest Florida almost my whole life, but I didn’t know we were still selling swampland to Yankees.”
Indeed, Tyrna pointed out to me that the Porter Ranch plans submitted to the county showed no buffers along Gamble Creek, the source of much of the flooding. Instead, she said, “they showed some Adirondack chairs lining the creek.”
Those chairs look nice, but they don’t do much to soak up floodwaters.
Because Neal was asking the county for a rezoning, that made it easier for the commissioners to tell him no, McClash said.
The developer knew that land was zoned for agriculture when he bought it. There was no legal guarantee that he would be able to change the zoning to build a subdivision.
That’s something for other counties to bear in mind when destructive projects like this come up. Given how the governor and Legislature have tied their hands to keep them from restricting development, the smart thing to do is to stick to what’s in their growth and zoning plans. Don’t let builders build in places that have been deemed inappropriate.
Another is to focus on the needed infrastructure, such as roads, stormwater ponds, and sewage lines. Urge your county to require those facilities be built upfront.
“We know we can’t stop development, but we can slow it down long enough to get everything in place,” said Lowe.
Several people mentioned to me the importance of networking for pulling the neighbors together to fight damaging development. Whether meeting in person or virtually over social media, connect the community so they can all rise up together.
Another piece of advice: Stick to what the evidence shows.
“We can’t fight with emotion,” Horne told me. “We have to fight with facts.”
If you live in another part of Florida that’s being inundated by a flood of poorly planned development, follow these steps in shoring up your defenses.
Then, if you succeed in saving your slice of paradise, feel free to cut loose with a whole chorus of hallelujahs. I promise that when you do, I’ll stand up, and so will everyone else who really cares about our state.

The new Social Security Commissioner would be well served by re-committing the Social Security Administration to providing timely, efficient and effective customer service.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Beth Stern: Recognizing the power and promise of Social Security at 90.","This commentary is by Beth Stern of Marshfield, volunteer state president for AARP Vermont.


The vital lifeline for tens of millions of Americans everywhere — including 161,841 people in Vermont — used for housing, groceries, gas, and other everyday necessities is about to mark its 90th birthday.
And with that anniversary comes a responsibility to strengthen the program — and find ways to help it age in the healthiest way. As the foundation of retirement in America, our financial future depends on protecting Social Security for decades to come.
Social Security will face challenges in the years ahead, but it’s our responsibility to make sure the program continues to serve the 67 million Americans who depend on it. 
The history of the program shows how vital it is for Americans’ secure retirement. On Aug. 14, 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act, and in January 1935, Ida May Fuller, the first person to receive Social Security (and a Vermonter!), collected a monthly check of $22.54 — that’s $518.58 in inflation-adjusted dollars.
From that start, the program now provides $1.4 trillion in retirement security. It is the only inflation-adjusted retirement program, giving Americans confidence to plan their retirements. That’s nationwide.
Nearly one in four (161,841) Vermont residents collect Social Security benefits, and 42,000 Vermonters are lifted out of poverty every month. Social Security helps Vermonters live and retire with dignity, offers crucial support to those with disabilities, and serves as a financial lifeline for families navigating the loss of a loved one.
Social Security will never “go broke.” That’s a fact. Social Security operates as a pay-as-you-go system. As long as workers continue to contribute, there will be Social Security for those collecting.
Funded by payroll taxes, the program will keep paying beneficiaries. However, it does face funding challenges. The latest Social Security Trustees’ Report indicates that the surplus will be exhausted by 2035. To prevent that shortfall, Congress must again take action — just as it did during the 1983 reform — before millions of Americans are left with less than they’ve earned.
Customer service is another area where Social Security is facing challenges. Administrative chaos at the Social Security Administration this year has contributed to a customer service crisis that has been ongoing for years.
SSA has struggled with call wait times, hold times, customer service resolutions and staffing issues, according to SSA’s own data. Many Americans who need access to the program face hours on the phone or in line at their local offices. And budget and staffing levels have strained SSA’s ability to provide vital services.
This year, wait times are increasing, fewer people can reach a Social Security representative to get assistance, and this issue arises just as about 10,000 people retire every day.
The new Social Security Commissioner would be well served by re-committing the Social Security Administration to providing timely, efficient and effective customer service. SSA needs to be clear when communicating any possible changes and what effects lower staffing levels will have. And Congress needs to provide oversight to ensure that customer service is prioritized at an agency that has struggled to serve Americans everywhere.
Throughout our history at AARP, we have worked with every Administration and Congress, regardless of party, to protect and strengthen Social Security. More than 67 million Americans rely on this vital program, and for 90 years, Social Security has been the foundation of retirement in the United States.
It’s imperative to ensure the strength of this Social Security not just for another 90 years, but for generations upon generations to come.

We need leadership to keep all of us in the same lane.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  John Bossange: Moving forward in Vermont after June 14.","This commentary is by John Bossange of South Burlington. He is a retired middle school principal and a board member of Better (not bigger) Vermont.


Like many Vermonters, I’ve been waving my American flag and holding signs at various locations in demonstrations against the authoritarian rule of President Trump. I’ve been at the Statehouse in Montpelier, at City Hall in Burlington and most recently along Route 7 in South Burlington to show my resistance to the president, and his MAGA cabinet, close advisors and supporters.
My friends and I were encouraged by the large turnout for the June 14 rally held at Waterfront Park in Burlington but left the demonstration with mixed feelings and confusion over the focus and purpose of this important demonstration.
When we first arrived there were mostly American flags flying with a variety of signs expressing what the “No Kings” meant to them. That was expected and good to see.

But once the rally began there were as many Mexican flags as there were American flags. After the welcoming introductions, speeches and protest songs were sung in Spanish with dancing and Mexican flags waving on the stage. For 45 minutes I felt I was in Mexico or at a migrant justice rally. That was unexpected!
From there, the presenters on stage turned the demonstration into a Palestinian rights rally with Palestinian flags and speakers who have experienced the brutality of ICE, and the oppressive violation of our First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments. I began to wonder when there would be Ukrainian speakers on stage also using this platform to rally the crowd around their specific concerns.
These and many others are all important causes, and it was good to see people voicing their opinions and demanding their rights. I am in support of all of them.
But the rally was billed as “No Kings” to focus on Trump, who wants to rule like an authoritarian. For too much of the time, the demonstration did not feel like that, and for me and my friends, the rally lost its intended focus. We left early.
There are so many issues which impact most citizens that the “king” is taking away from all of us like Medicare, Social Security, public education, a free press, free speech, not addressing the climate crisis, or budgeting that does not include a fair tax policy. Speakers, no matter their cause, should have been instructed to address these topics to unify each group under one common cause: Trump’s assault on the Bill of Rights, and his attempt to rule like a king and change the face of America.  
Instead, the day felt like an identity protest rally. Just as the big-tent Democrats have become a floundering and splintered identity party with no focused lens for action, the small tent Progressives have become an ideological party who see the world primarily through their own narrow lens. Both are failing to unite the country, and here in Vermont where our Progressive Party is often as strong as the Democratic Party, the division is even more evident. In Burlington on June 14, indivisible we were not.
The June 14 rally at Waterfront Park, organized primarily by Indivisible Burlington, was symbolic of the lack of unity between legitimate causes and unfortunately illustrated our ineffectiveness in dissent, resistance and protest when measured against a unified, stronger and much more focused MAGA party. Indivisible, they are.
In comparison, I had friends who attended rallies in Boston, New York City and Philadelphia, and the photos they sent me showed mostly American flags. They said the speeches were centered on President Trump, his executive orders, and his authoritarian rule. There were flags representing multiple causes, but the focus was on the president and his king-like behavior.
I fear the Waterfront Park rally could easily make Burlington a poster city and Vermont a poster state for the MAGA party to use against us, and for their dominant media networks that are always busy looking for ways to distract others from our “No Kings” message.
At the same time, they will have an easier time trashing our collective resistance by only focusing on our failed identity politics and splintered individual group causes, and not on the most important issue of a dictator wannabe.
Organizers at Indivisible Burlington and elsewhere need to put on their “political smart hat,” and be sure that future rallies stay focused on what’s happening in D.C. that will eventually impact all of us, not just identity groups. We need leadership to keep all of us in the same lane.
Those with specific issues, no matter how passionate they feel, now more than ever, need to see the big picture. To have a real impact moving forward, indivisible we must be.

The latest move has renewed worries from advocates that the information could be used for immigration enforcement as President Donald Trump ups the pressure for more deportations.
Last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture filed a notice in the Federal Register about creating a new database of information from states and the third-party payment processors that help the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program run. 
The agency wants states’ data on SNAP participants and transactions. This follows Trump’s executive orders seeking to get data from state programs that receive federal funding and to stop that money from going to immigrants without legal status.
The Department of Agriculture plans to use the database to “ensure the integrity of Government programs, including by verifying SNAP recipient eligibility against federally maintained databases, identifying and eliminating duplicate enrollments, and performing additional eligibility and program integrity checks,” according to the Federal Register notice.
Records shared would include names, social security numbers, dates of birth and addresses.
The Trump administration has made strides in recent months to obtain state-level data that could be used to target immigrants without legal status. Washington and other states this week sued the White House over sharing personal data of Medicaid recipients with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
“This administration is looking for a lot of data that it shouldn’t have,” said Claire Lane, director of the Seattle-based Anti-Hunger and Nutrition Coalition.
To apply for SNAP, applicants must give names and demographic information for the other people who live in their household, but they can omit information for family members not eligible, like immigrants without legal status.
“We want to make sure that people have confidence that when they ask for help, they’re not going to get in trouble, and other people they care about aren’t going to get in trouble,” Lane said. “The chilling effect is real, and we want to make sure that people aren’t going hungry because of fear.”
In March, the most recent month for which data is available, over 908,000 Washingtonians received a total of $168 million in SNAP benefits. That’s more than 10% of the state’s residents. Nationwide, the program serves upward of 42 million people.
The federal government funds SNAP, which helps low-income residents pay for food with monthly benefits loaded onto Electronic Benefits Transfer, or EBT, cards. States run the program, with the assistance of third-party processors.
Washington also provides state-funded food assistance to legal resident immigrants who aren’t eligible for SNAP benefits.
The Trump administration is already in hot water over a request in May for states and their processors to hand over personal data of SNAP recipients and applicants going back five years. The agriculture department backed off after nonprofits and others sued over privacy and presidential overreach concerns.
Washington’s processor, Fidelity Information Services, had told its state clients it planned to cooperate with the Trump administration. But the state’s Department of Social and Health Services, which runs SNAP here, told Fidelity not to share Washington data. Other states similarly did not comply.
The department specifically cites “verifying eligibility based on immigration status” as a rationale for the new database.
The agency, which didn’t respond to a request for comment, believes the system complies with federal privacy law.
Plans for the system opened for public comment last week.
A spokesperson for the state Department of Social and Health Services said the agency was drafting comments to send to the federal government, but declined to comment further.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/snap-ebt-food-stamps-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-03 07:01:58.243765

(Photo courtesy of Connecticut Harm Reduction Alliance, formerly known as Greater Hartford Harm Reduction Coalition)A study published Wednesday in the medical journal JAMA Network Open found that emergency room clinicians were much less likely to refer Black opioid overdose patients for outpatient treatment compared with white patients.
The researchers looked at the medical records of 1,683 opioid overdose patients from emergency rooms in nine states: California, Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Oregon and Pennsylvania.
About 5.7% of Black patients received referrals for outpatient treatment, compared with 9.6% of white patients, according to the researchers, who received a federal grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse to conduct the analysis.
While the nation saw a decrease in opioid overdose deaths in white people between 2021 and 2022, overdose death rates increased for American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian, Black and Hispanic people. Patients visiting ERs for opioid overdoses are more likely to die from an overdose after the visit, the authors wrote, underscoring the importance of gaining “an improved understanding of disparities in [emergency department] treatment and referral.”
In total, roughly 18% of the patients received a referral for outpatient treatment, 43% received a naloxone kit or prescription, and 8.4% received a prescription for buprenorphine, the first-line medication for treating opioid use disorder.
The researchers used records from 10 hospital sites participating in a national consortium collecting data on overdoses from fentanyl and its related drugs. The patient records were from September 2020 to November 2023.
Another study in JAMA Network Open, released last week, found similar disparities: Black and Hispanic patients were significantly less likely than white patients to receive buprenorphine. Black patients had a 17% chance, and Hispanic patients a 16% chance, to be prescribed the therapy, compared with a 20% chance for white patients.
The authors of that study, from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, looked at data from 176,000 records of opioid-related events between 2017 and 2022 across all 50 states.

In June media organizations, including The Associated Press, confirmed that the Trump administration had greenlit immigration officials obtaining personal data about individuals receiving Medicaid health coverage, including immigration statuses.
The lawsuit Nessel signed onto says that even though the Trump administration deported more than 140,000 U.S. residents in the first four months of this year, it’s understood that Trump is not satisfied with the number of deportations. With Trump’s own admission that he wants to deport millions of residents, the lawsuit said it’s expected that the administration will use the Medicaid data to accomplish that end.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Medicaid personal health care data is private and sharing information outside the purview of preserving public health and the Medicaid system is unlawful on multiple fronts including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, which outlines protections for medical data. 
“Our personal healthcare data is exactly that: personal,” Nessel said in a news release Wednesday. “It should remain confidential and be accessible only to agencies directly involved with Medicaid. This unlawful move by the Trump Administration to grant access to unrelated entities will undoubtedly harm the health, privacy, and well-being of all Michiganders. I remain committed to protecting our privacy rights.”  
The news release from Nessel’s office outlines concern that through the Trump Administration’s actions there will be fear from Medicaid-eligible noncitizens and their loved ones that will keep them from enrolling.

(Getty Images)The Indiana Department of Environmental Management identified a handful of regulations that could clash with a gubernatorial order to eliminate “unduly burdensome” or costly rules, though nearly all of them appear to be relatively minor tweaks. 
Still, Sam Carpenter, executive director of the Hoosier Environmental Council, said Gov. Mike Braun’s mandate to review the agency seems like a decision that “environmental protections are bad for businesses before really, fully understanding and researching the issues.
“… we just need to keep in mind that protections are in place because, often, an event has occurred and we realized that the protections that were currently in place were not sufficient,” he continued. 
Indiana Senate approves sweeping administrative rulemaking overhaul

For example, Carpenter pointed to IDEM’s new recommendation to streamline the process for alternative thermal effluent limits. Carpenter said that those processes were established in response to a 1999 chemical spill that killed more than four million fish — something not acknowledged in the review. 
Just 14 facilities fall into this regulatory category, according to the state agency, but the process for meeting those water quality standards and getting approval “can be burdensome and create(s) uncertainty.”
The report recommended the agency revisit the guidelines.
The 17-page regulatory review, submitted by IDEM Commissioner Clint Woods and General Counsel William Anthony on July 1, stems from dual March 12 executive orders from Braun that targeted environmental justice and overregulation. While one focused on burdens and cost, the other sought to align the state’s rules with federal regulations. The latter report is due later this year. 
“IDEM is committed to ensuring that its regulatory actions are consistent with statutory authority, supported by the best available science, and not unduly burdensome,” read a July 1 letter in response to the governor’s mandate. “IDEM has identified several opportunities to clarify or rescind existing policies and regulations, and intends to complete the additional reviews identified above and submit additional reports…” 
The agency said it also hopes to collaborate with its federal counterparts to find ways to meet Braun’s orders. Another half dozen executive orders impact IDEM’s operations, including ones related to supporting coal generation and advancing nuclear development. 
Carpenter criticized the former for being a “more expensive … (and) dirtiest form of energy” that doesn’t meet sustainability or affordability goals set in state statute. 
“It’d be interesting to the pose the question to some of the utilities, ‘Would it be burdensome to you to keep open a coal plant that you had scheduled to close?’” posited David Van Gilder, the senior policy and legal director of the Hoosier Environmental Council. 
 More on the rules

In a Tuesday release, Braun painted his actions as business friendly, saying it would create jobs and economic growth while balancing “responsible environmental protection and stewardship.” 
“Government naturally drifts toward over-regulation, and it’s important to go through these regulations to make sure they aren’t stifling innovation and raising the cost of living for no benefit. My agencies have been directed to identify regulations that are raising the cost of living without benefiting our environment so they can be changed or rescinded; we can grow our economy while also safeguarding Hoosiers’ health and preserving our natural resources,” Braun said.










We need to unleash the productive side of our economy, while protecting and preserving our state’s natural resources.


– Gov. Mike Braun


But the report and environmental advocates noted that Indiana’s environmental regulations have been curtailed for decades, leaving little for IDEM to revisit or eliminate. 
Rescinding certain rules will be a lengthy process, the agency adds, because it will need approval from the Environmental Rules Board, a period of public comment and a regulatory analysis. 
At least two actions would need to go through the rule reversal process but may not need any federal approval, according to IDEM. 
Current state law requires resubmitting underground storage tank notification forms for any change — beyond federal rules surrounding ownership changes or new tank installations. If not properly maintained, such tanks can leak into their surrounding communities, contaminating the ground and nearby water sources. 
IDEM also wasn’t sure if eliminating or revising requirements for submitted emissions reduction plans following malfunctions would require federal approval. But this rule depends on the source, and thus could be modified to be less burdensome, the agency said. 
Just one change — allowing fire departments to conduct burns for training purposes without prior approval — would explicitly need the federal government to approve a revised state plan.
 Meshing state, federal requirements

The state agency did identify a handful of rules that wouldn’t require any federal action, such as streamlining the permit schedule for pollution discharge elimination and allowing “appropriate feedstock” only in permitting.
Rules for the first are inconsistent throughout the state, differing between water in the Great Lakes basin and downstate waters. Rather than having some areas with three-year schedules, IDEM recommends clarifying the state statute to allow for five-year schedules that align with the Environmental Protection Agency. 

Read the full report. 

As to the latter, current code requires a land application permit for appropriate feedstock waste but not for waste that’s a mix of appropriate feedstock and biomass — or only biomass — when it comes to certain classes of crops. 
Also in terms of permitting, solid and hazardous waste permits currently ranged from three to five years, but could be expanded to ten to “reduce paperwork burdens … and improve Indiana’s competitiveness.” The agency is already reviewing this as part of an unrelated review of its fees.
And while the federal government doesn’t dictate the state’s requirements for certain tax deductions, IDEM also noted that it didn’t have expertise in this area either. The agency determines if certain systems or devices qualify for tax deductions — an “unnecessary” requirement that officials say could be moved to another entity. 
The state division devoted to electronic waste registration and recycling is limited to the expenses of administering the associated fund, but state statute could expand that authority in a way that enhances collection activities, according to IDEM. 
The tenth and final recommendation would seek to codify some of IDEM’s policies.
The agency received thousands of public comments and included two dozen in the Tuesday report. 
“I’m really looking forward to seeing the release of those comments,” said Van Gilder. “It’s important that our elected officials represent us and those concerns and there is a lot of concern (around) having environmental protections in place.”
Carpenter added that he’d like to see unfiltered comments that weren’t “hand picked” for the report.
Though Braun railed against states with stricter environmental regulations than federal standards — saying he believed the nationwide requirements are an “appropriate baseline” — Indiana hasn’t been in that category in years.

Like many states, Indiana has “no more stringent than” laws that align the state’s rules with the federal government, including air and water quality protections — as reflected in IDEM’s report.
“… (IDEM) anticipates, based on prior review with related executive orders, that this universe of regulations is relatively small,” the accompanying letter summarized. “Indiana Code, as well as previous Gubernatorial administrations, have limited IDEM’s ability to promulgate rules that are more restrictive than federal regulations for decades.” 
Citing this, the state agency said it would identify specific federal rules requiring regulations that potentially clash with Braun’s order and work with the appropriate federal agencies to identify solutions. 
But the EPA has also been a target for criticism and deregulation at the federal level, meaning that their rules could change as well — triggering a potential ripple effect in Indiana.
“The fact that there is this significant push to roll back environmental protections on the federal level undermines the alignment that we current have,” said Carpenter. “It’s really important for the state to be independent and be able to make independent guidelines.”

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)The $4 trillion GOP budget bill that squeaked through the U.S. Senate this week yesterday would “help usher in a golden age for American workers, farmers and families,” according to House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith, R-Missouri.
One nonpartisan think tank disagrees, strongly. Energy Innovation says the bill will kill nearly 23,000 Minnesota jobs, slash state gross domestic product by $22 billion and raise household energy bills by $2.7 billion — a 28% increase — over the next decade.
The principal culprit: a rapid phaseout of federal tax credits for wind and solar power, which are cheaper and faster to build and operate than “baseload” gas, coal and nuclear power plants. Along with batteries, they account for the vast majority of recent additions to the U.S. grid.
“Minnesotans are struggling to pay the bills in the face of rising inflation,” Energy Innovation Senior Director of Modeling and Analysis Robbie Orvis said in a statement. “Congress has decided to kneecap utilities’ ability to build new generation to meet demand and impose billions in new energy costs on households and businesses.”
By damaging wind and solar, the Republican bill hands a win to fossil fuel industries, with whom President Donald Trump and the GOP are closely aligned. Oil and gas interests donated more than $75 million to Trump’s 2024 campaign, the Republican National Committee and other related committees. Trump told a gathering of oil and gas executives gathered at Mar-a-Lago last year that he’d give them their policy wish list in exchange for $1 billion in campaign donations, the Washington Post reported.  
Given the newly important role of wind, solar and other alternative power sources, the GOP bill would hamper development of new electricity generation. Energy Innovation says the GOP budget will slow power plant construction in Minnesota by nearly 25% over the next decade as the AI boom drives electricity demand growth to levels not seen since the early 2000s. Some grid experts believe that will increase the risk of power outages in the coming years; one Democratic lawmaker called the GOP budget “the Big Blackout Bill.”
Less supply and increasing demand almost always means higher prices for consumers. 
In a statement calling the bill “a huge step in the wrong direction,” Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota Executive Director Annie Levenson-Falk suggested utility service shutoffs could further increase from already-elevated levels.
“More than 91,000 Minnesota households had their utility service shut off for nonpayment last year,” the highest annual count by far in at least a decade, she said. 
As of March, Minnesota utility customers collectively were $150 million behind on their utility bills, adding to what Levenson-Falk characterized in a Wednesday interview as a multifaceted affordability crisis challenging lower-income folks.
“You’re seeing increasing divides between people who can pay their bills and those having trouble,” she said.
Energy Innovation’s modeling showed Minnesota industrial businesses would be even harder-hit by the GOP budget. They face a 46% increase in electricity bills by 2034.
Though Minnesota has not had a front-row seat for the manufacturing boom spurred by the Biden-era climate law that the GOP budget all but repeals, Energy Innovation’s modeling raised the specter of tens of thousands of job losses due to “decreased investments in clean energy projects…from lower demand for the inputs to those projects, and (indirect job losses) from lower induced economic activity.”
Those include jobs manufacturing high-efficiency appliances at local factories run by companies like Trane Technologies and Daikin; installing those appliances in homes and businesses; weatherizing existing buildings; and building new homes to modern efficiency standards. These employees, whose work helps Minnesotans save millions on their utility bills each year, account for three in four “clean energy” jobs statewide, said Gregg Mast, executive director of Clean Energy Economy Minnesota, in an interview Wednesday.
“The bill in its current form is certainly a job killer and is undermining one of the fastest growing sectors of our economy,” Mast said.
The small, independent installation businesses that dominate Minnesota’s growing solar sector will also suffer under the GOP budget, Mast said. Consumer demand will drop due to the loss of a tax credit for residential solar arrays, but perhaps even more significantly, contractors will face “the loss of a decade of certainty on the federal policy side,” he said.
Minnesota’s mandate to produce electricity from 100% carbon-free sources by 2040 is a faint silver lining in all of this, Orvis said in an interview Wednesday. 
Even without federal subsidies, Energy Innovation expects states like Minnesota to build more wind, solar and batteries than states without clean electricity mandates. That buildout will increasingly insulate ratepayers from volatile fossil fuel prices, which make up a significant portion of utility bills, Orvis said.
Still, “this bill makes electricity more expensive everywhere,” he said, pointing to a recent analysis by investment bank Jefferies that sees grid-scale solar farm construction nearly doubling in cost in the coming years.
Mast agreed.
“The Trump administration has warned of an energy crisis, and this bill is helping to create one by putting up roadblocks to deploying clean and affordable energy,” Mast said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oil.jpg,,,2025-07-03 07:01:58.243765

As Gov. Mike Kehoe signed the budget bills passed by lawmakers this year, he vetoed $310 million in general revenue spending and issued a warning that the next budget won’t have any extra money.
“The Office of Administration’s Division of Budget and Planning estimates a nearly $1 billion shortfall in general revenue starting in (fiscal year 2027),” Kehoe’s news release stated.
The biggest portion of that shortfall will be in the Medicaid program, which became a prime target for cuts in the federal budget bill. According to KFF, Missouri could lose approximately 14% of its federal Medicaid funding over the next decade, or approximately $17 billion.
Part of that reduction is due to people leaving the program. An analysis prepared at Princeton University estimates that 130,000 of the 1.25 million people currently covered by Medicaid would lose coverage over the next 10 years. 
But a large part of the 10-year impact would be costs shifted to the state. Missouri would either have to replace those funds, cut the range of services offered or end coverage for tens of thousands of people.

“The bill being debated is going to blow a hole in our budget that will be hard to recover from,” said state Rep. Betsy Fogle of Springfield, the ranking Democrat on the Missouri House Budget Committee.
Missouri ended the 2025 fiscal year on Monday with a healthy $4.3 billion in the general revenue fund, plus another $1.3 billion that can be spent like general revenue. But the $50.8 billion budget for the current fiscal year consumes most of the money that can be spent like general revenue and about $2 billion more in general revenue than expected receipts.
Fogle said she opposed Kehoe’s vetoes and said worries about future spending needs should prompt him to veto a tax cut measure on his desk, which he has said he will sign.
“I do not understand why we are continuing to push that as a priority if the governor thinks he cannot pay his bills in future years,” Fogle said.
Missouri spends about $15 billion on Medicaid annually, but most of the money comes from the federal government. For every dollar from Missouri taxpayers, the state receives $1.80 to $9 of federal matching funds.
Missouri minimizes its use of general revenue in Medicaid by taxing hospitals, pharmacies, nursing homes and ambulance providers.
Missouri was already facing a shortfall of funding for Medicaid in the next fiscal year. Lawmakers this year used $778 million remaining from federal COVID-19 health care support that will have to be replaced in future years to maintain the program.
The changes in federal policy include in the budget bill that will add to the direct costs on Missouri taxpayers are:

Lower federal match starting in federal fiscal year 2030 for adults ages 18 to 64 covered by the Medicaid expansion amendment passed by voters in 2020. The federal government currently covers 90% of the cost, pegged at $4.6 billion in the current budget.
A cap on how much provider taxes can contribute to state Medicaid costs starting in federal fiscal year 2028. The budget approved by Kehoe appropriates $1.1 billion from provider taxes.
Cost-sharing for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, that is popularly known as food stamps. Starting in federal fiscal year 2028, Missouri would have to pick up a larger share of administrative costs, plus a portion of benefit costs based on the state’s payment error rate.

Some states have laws repealing participation in the Medicaid expansion program for working-age adults, enacted in 2010, if the federal government does not maintain its 90% cost share promise. Missouri must cover that group because it is in the state Constitution.
Missouri currently pays about 35% of the cost of covering about 900,000 people covered by traditional Medicaid.
Anyone who is enrolled now in the expansion group would be covered with a 90% federal share. For new enrollees after 2030, Missouri would have to pay 35% of the cost.
Every 10% of the total cost for Medicaid expansion shifted to Missouri would increase the cost for state taxpayers by about $460 million.
The cost of expansion could escalate quickly, said Timothy McBride, co-director of the Center for Health Economics and Policy in the Institute for Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis.
“The churning in that population is pretty high,” he said in an interview with The Independent.
The bill would impose an 80-hour-a-month work requirement for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children 14 and older would have to meet the program’s work requirements.
The state will also have to verify eligibility every six months instead of annually.
“We’re going to lose some people who are not going to either be qualified because of the work requirements, or they’re going to just not fulfill paperwork requirements,” McBride said.
The Senate bill freezes provider taxes at their current levels and reduces them for the states that have expanded Medicaid.
The hospital provider tax is the largest of the four in Missouri, accounting for about $900 million of the total.
“We have been very consistent in our message that deep cuts to provider taxes will harm enrollees, access to care for all Missourians, hospitals and other providers, and the state’s budget,” said Dave Dillon, spokesman for the Missouri Hospital Association. “We’re also committed to working with all partners at the state and federal level to minimize the harm if this framework is adopted.”
Current federal law caps the provider taxes at 6%. Starting in federal fiscal year 2028, the cap would be lowered by 0.5 percentage points a year — stopping at 3.5% — for the 41 states like Missouri that have expanded Medicaid coverage to working age adults.
Missouri House passes Medicaid provider tax bill, preventing major budget cuts

The current hospital tax rate for Missouri is 5%.
The second-largest provider tax is on nursing homes, but the reconciliation bill exempts the provider tax from cuts, said Nikki Strong, director of policy at the Missouri Health Care Association, the nursing home lobbying group.
The exemption helps, she said, but nursing homes are struggling to maintain adequate staffing and, in many cases in rural areas, are considering closing. Pressure on state revenue hurts the chances of getting increased rates, she said.
“From our perspective, any cuts that are going to impact general revenue in the budget, without replacement revenues, are not good at this point in time,” she said. “It is not going to benefit us.”
The SNAP program has been paid for exclusively from the federal treasury since it was launched in the 1960s. 
Under the bill, states will be required to contribute a percentage of those costs if their payment error rate exceeds 6%. The U.S. Department of Agriculture counts benefit underpayments and overpayments as errors. 
Missouri’s error rate of 9.4% in 2024 would mean it would pick up about $160 million of the cost, plus an extra portion for administrative expenses.
“Missouri will struggle to pick up these costs,” said Amy Blouin, executive director of the Missouri Budget Project, “and state lawmakers will face extremely difficult choices, like whether to get rid of SNAP in Missouri, eliminate optional benefits like home- and community-based services that keep people living in their communities, or cut funding for services like education.”

(From Morales' official X account)Following months of scrutiny over millions in no-bid contracts, the Indiana Secretary of State’s Office has quietly started issuing formal requests for proposals (RFPs).
The move also comes on the heels of a new law adopted by the General Assembly earlier this year to increase transparency requirements around state contracting.
As of July, nearly a dozen RFPs were listed on the Secretary of State’s (SOS) ”contracting opportunities” webpage. They include requests for vendors to handle call center services, maintain and modernize cloud-hosted software platforms, and redesign division websites.

Most of the RFPs were posted in late May with submission deadlines in early to mid-July. 
One RFP calls for a third-party call center to manage tens of thousands of calls annually across the agency’s Business Services and Auto Dealer Services divisions, including responding to 6,500 to 11,000 monthly customer calls; escalating complex cases; and storing call recordings that include sensitive personal data. The vendor would be expected to meet daily performance benchmarks and provide regular reporting to the state, according to the RFP.
Multiple proposals also seek vendors to maintain and upgrade “critical” software systems that run key parts of the office’s work — ranging from business filings and notary applications to securities oversight. 
The office is requesting applications from firms with experience in cloud-based architecture, cybersecurity, workflow automation and artificial intelligence to help reengineer its existing tools and build new ones with an emphasis on performance and user accessibility.
Another RFP asks for help creating content for a redesigned INBiz portal, while others seek outside firms to evaluate and strengthen the office’s IT security protocols; develop website infrastructure; manage project compliance; and monitor contract execution. 
Morales defends previous no-bid contracts
The new listings follow reporting by the Indiana Capital Chronicle in December that revealed Secretary of State Diego Morales had awarded more than $3.3 million in contracts without a competitive bidding process. Some of those contracts went to politically connected vendors who gave tens of thousands of dollars to Morales’ reelection campaign.
Morales and his office have defended those arrangements, previously telling the Capital Chronicle that the agency “opted to pursue vendors with strong track records, and commercially competitive proposals in lieu of public bidding.”
Secretary of state spending includes millions in no-bid contracts

But during a June 18 State Budget Committee meeting, he faced further scrutiny from state lawmakers about the no-bid contracts — along with a myriad of other controversies — while seeking more than $10 million in funds for his office.
The other controversies included Morales’ purchase of a $90,000 car with taxpayer money from a campaign contributor and hiring his brother-in-law.
Morales emphasized that no-bid agreements were awarded by the secretary of state’s office before he was elected. He said they were legal — sometimes necessary, when on tight deadlines — and that under his watch, only “companies with experience” received contracts.
Even so, Republican Sen. Chris Garten pressed Morales on previous no-bid contracts awarded to companies that made campaign contributions, saying “Indiana constituents deserve to know” such details.
Morales held that “lots of people” donate to his political efforts.
“We’ve been following no-bid contracting that has been done for the past 20 years. I’m not doing anything different,” Morales said. “This let us look for companies that are experts in what they do … and they’re getting the job done … and we’re saving taxpayer money by hiring the best of the best in the business.”
New contracting expectations
Following passage of Senate Enrolled Act 5 — a new law that bans non-public, no-bid state contracts and increases oversight of agency spending — the secretary of state said the agency is overhauling its internal processes to ensure compliance.
Chief Legal Counsel Jerry Bonnet told the state budget committee that while the secretary of state’s office “historically (was) not bidding” contracts or IT work or other services, “they’re all now going up for the bid process.”
“We’re taking a considerable amount of time talking to vendors now,” Bonnet said. “So, we’ve embraced the emergency that was declared by Senate Bill 5 to start putting all these contracts out for public procurement.”

The bulk of the agency’s latest funding request, nearly $8.2 million, is earmarked for technology and security improvements.
Bonnet said a new chief information officer, who joined the office in 2023, assessed the IT systems and concluded that the “antiquated systems … (were) in danger of failing.” Improving that part of the office has created “a high spending curve” that Bonnet said would fall at the beginning of next year to between $4-5 million.
It’s not yet clear how much the new RFPs will be settled for, but Bonnet said the office has “already been able to negotiate discounts with some vendors.”
“The bidding process is great, but it takes quite a bit of time to then take something and pick it apart and do all those details, specifications, advertise it, talk to all the different vendors,” he added. “We’re trying to do more with less.”
Bonnet said the office is also seeking to contract with a consultant to help navigate and manage new requirements enacted under Senate Enrolled Act 5.
“Before we make any new contracts, we’re going to hopefully have a professional contractor … an independent expert, to make those contract assessments,” he noted. “It’ll be a rush, but we’ll be working in the coming weeks and months to try and keep our IT projects on track.”

(Courtesy of Idahoans United for Women and Families)The rallying calls were familiar.
Despite dangerous pregnancy complications, women are being denied emergency abortions. Doctors are leaving the state. And politicians shouldn’t be involved in sensitive health decisions. 
But one part of the pitch was new: Instead of asking state lawmakers for a fix, Idahoans can sign on to establish their own state law. 
“Idaho has been living under the trigger ban for nearly three years,” Melanie Folwell, lead organizer for the group behind Idaho’s abortion rights ballot initiative, told a Boise rally on Saturday. “And we have seen — and you’ll see in the stories you hear today — that it simply does not work for Idaho. It doesn’t work for anybody. So, today is the first step we are taking to end the ban.”
The effort to collect signatures for the proposed ballot initiative comes nearly three years after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. That reversal lifted federal court protections for abortions, letting states regulate abortion — which activated trigger abortion bans in several states, including Idaho.
Idaho banned abortion. Three years later, minors and seniors struggle to get routine care.

Despite calls for change in the three years Idaho’s ban has been in place, including by the state’s top medical association, Idaho lawmakers have largely refused to modify Idaho’s strict abortion laws. 
The ballot initiative, a power outlined in Idaho’s constitution, allows voters to propose their own policies that carry the power of law — if approved by a majority vote. 
But qualifying an initiative for the ballot is a tough hurdle in Idaho. 
In the past decade, only three ballot initiatives have had enough signatures to qualify for the ballot: a successful Medicaid expansion initiative in 2018, a failed historical horse racing initiative in 2018, and an unsuccessful primary election reform initiative in 2024. 
The group Folwell leads, Idahoans United for Women and Families, is hoping to qualify the abortion ballot initiative for the ballot in the November 2026 general election. That gives organizers about a year to collect the nearly 71,000 signatures needed. 
They already collected 1,200 signatures on Saturday, when hundreds of people turned out for the rally, organizers say. And organizers are gearing up for signature collection efforts across the state soon, Folwell told the Sun, helped by their 1,000 volunteers.

 Initiative could mean doctors won’t ‘be afraid to move to Idaho,’ doctor says

The initiative could mean doctors and other medical professionals “will not be afraid to move to Idaho and take care of us,” Dr. Becky Uranga, an Idaho doctor, said at the rally.
That could mean several things might get better, she explained between cheers from the audience — like your longtime doctor “will stay and keep caring for you and thousands of others,” that you may be able to avoid a six-month wait to see a doctor or other medical professional, and that Idaho doctors can “again provide the needed care without the risk of criminalization hanging over our heads.”
“And most of all, this could restore the sacred space between doctors and our patients. And I can honor all of your beliefs and privacy in the exam room — without any external pressures,” Uranga said. 
Kate Campbell-Covell, a pregnant mother with two kids, told the rally about how she had to travel to Utah after she learned her son wouldn’t survive her pregnancy. 
“With tears in their eyes, our extremely compassionate and loving medical team explained that due to the laws in Idaho, they were unable to render the care they deem necessary to save my life and protect my future fertility,” she said.
Then she was airlifted out of state, she said.

After federal court protections, St. Luke’s has said the health system hasn’t had to air transport any patients for pregnancy complications. Before those protections, St. Luke’s transported six patients out of state in the first four months of 2024. The federal court protections only allow emergency abortions for doctors at St. Luke’s.
Campbell-Covell later learned that she had a severe placenta infection. If left untreated, she would have died, she said.
She had her son’s ashes sent home.

For years, she worked in social work, and now works as a local therapist.
“The amount of children that I saw living in absolutely horrid conditions, and from individuals that were forced to bear them from other countries, is really what radicalized me and made me pro choice,” Doubleday said.
Ken Harris, a local musician, also signed. He said he wants abortion access in Idaho to return to how it used to be.
“That was what the case was in Idaho for 50 years. Male politicians — politicians have no business dictating to people about their private medical decisions and feelings,” Harris told the Sun. “A woman’s opinion about what she should do with her body — for her own health, for her family — should be her decision alone.”
 Signature gathering starts — after delay from redrafting state’s official descriptions

To qualify for the ballot, the group needs at least 70,725 qualifying signatures from Idaho registered voters. That figure is 6% of Idaho’s nearly 1.2 million registered voters in the 2024 general election — spread across half of the state’s 35 legislative districts.
But signature gathering efforts were delayed by almost six months after initiative organizers legally challenged descriptions state officials developed about the initiative for voters to see, Folwell told the Sun. The descriptions are featured on signature gathering forms.
Last month, the Idaho Supreme Court ordered the Idaho Attorney General’s Office and the Idaho Division of Financial Management to redraft the descriptions.
The new short ballot title describes the initiative as a “measure creating right to abortion before fetus viability, and post-viability to protect health; right to privacy; healthcare provider liability protections.”
The initiative would raise state expenses by less than one thousandth of a percent of Idaho’s share of the Medicaid budget, or between $3,100 and $7,800 each year, the initiative’s redrafted fiscal impact statement says.
“This impact is derived from the costs of treating chemical abortion complications for women enrolled in Idaho’s Medicaid program,” the fiscal impact statement says. “Medicaid covers medically necessary services to treat complications from all abortions. It is anticipated that as legal abortions increase, the complications will also increase. This will likely result in an increase in Medicaid covered services and expenditures to treat complications from chemical abortions, which the State has reliable and readily available data to support.”
The new fiscal impact statement also no longer includes the entire Medicaid services budget of $850 million in fiscal year 2024.

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Gross assessed values for commercial, industrial and residential properties throughout Indiana collectively rose 12% from 2024 to 2025, according to a statewide comparison chart assembled by the Department of Local Government Finance for property taxes due and payable in 2026.
In comparison, gross assessed value grew 13.2% in 2022-23 and 8.9%.
The data is sourced from ratio studies performed annually by state’s 92 county assessors.
“It is essentially a test of each assessor: how well are you doing? Are you doing this right?” said Larry DeBoer, a retired Purdue University agricultural economics professor and tax expert.
  Purdue University emeritus professor Larry DeBoer on Sept. 30, 2024. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
“Not very many … elected officials actually face a test like that. They’re being held accountable.”
Agricultural land, meanwhile, will be assessed at a lower base rate than the previous year, thanks to a provision in the behemoth tax plan Indiana lawmakers approved in April.
That’ll likely shift property tax burden toward other property types, DeBoer noted.
Local residential trends reemerge
Commercial assessed value grew 16.07% in total, according to the study, ahead of industrial assessed value, which increased 15.59%.
Values for Hoosier houses collectively rose by less: 10.42%.
Lawmakers have, for years, promised cash-strapped homeowners that high assessed values and resulting skyrocketing property tax bills would naturally come down.
“I think we’re seeing some evidence” that values are growing more slowly, DeBoer said.
Relief could be on the horizon at last.
Gross assessed values don’t translate perfectly to property tax bills, however. County auditors will apply all deductions and credits to certify net assessed values, according to DLGF spokeswoman Jenny Banks.
DeBoer also observed a bigger variety in residential value growth than in recent years.
“Covid was a nationwide trend that affected every place — so maybe we’re not seeing a big nationwide or even statewide trend affecting home values now,” he posited.
“We’re back to: assessed value is a local issue,” DeBoer added. “And a local economy, and the local assessing practice, is what seems to be influencing the changes.”
Tax bill eases pressure on farmland
Indiana’s farmland is assessed differently.
DLGF calculates a rolling average using six years of capitalized net operating income and net cash rent. The highest value of the six is dropped from the formula, and the remaining five years are averaged to determine a base rate.
Another increase was in the cards for the base rate, to $2,390 per acre.
That would’ve come after several straight years of big jumps: from $1,500 in assessment year 2022 to $1,900 in 2023 and $2,280 in 2024.
Lawmakers intervened via Senate Enrolled Act 1, increasing the capitalization rate in the formula’s denominator to lower the base rate. Now, it’ll be $2,120 per acre, according to a DLGF memo.
“Yep, that was a victory for the (Indiana) Farm Bureau,” DeBoer quipped.
The formula averages six years to “iron out the blips,” he said, but it also can create a delay where assessed values may keep rising even as farm incomes and commodity prices are falling. The last high pandemic-era value, for example, won’t drop out of the formula until the end of the decade.
The average price of top-quality farmland was $14,392 per acre in 2024, according to a Purdue University Farmland Values survey. Average- and poor-quality farmland prices averaged $11,630 and $9,071, respectively.

(Photo by Darrin Klimek/Getty Images)Oklahoma has a decision to make: Will we continue clinging to a pretrial system that punishes poverty and fails to deliver public safety? Or will we move toward a smarter, fairer, and actually effective alternative?
The evidence is mounting, and the verdict is clear: cash bail — the dollar amount a court determines you must pay to be released from jail before your trial — doesn’t work. It doesn’t improve court appearance rates, and it doesn’t make our communities safer. What it does is lock up thousands of legally innocent Oklahomans every year simply because they can’t afford to buy their freedom. Reform is long overdue.
A new study out of Tulsa County offers a case in point.
 The Bail Project, a national nonprofit that provides free bail assistance and pretrial support to low-income people nationwide while advocating for a system based on safety rather than wealth, tracked more than 3,300 individuals booked into the county jail over the course of a year. They found that those who received non-financial support — reminders, transportation, and service referrals — still showed up to court. In fact, people whom The Bail Project supported showed up to every hearing nearly twice as often as those who paid bail out of pocket, and 33% higher than those using a bail bond agent. And it didn’t cost them a dime.
So why does Oklahoma continue relying on a system that fails to deliver safety, fairness or accountability?
One answer: the commercial bail industry. The industry collects billions each year, including millions from struggling Oklahoma families. These nonrefundable fees — often 10% of the total bail amount — are gone for good, even if the court drops the charges or the person is found not guilty. It’s a predatory system that lines the pockets of a few while destabilizing many.
But it’s not just about economics, it’s about recognizing a broken and harmful system, and then fixing it. Oklahoma has one of the highest incarceration rates nationally and globally. Jailing people before trial for weeks or months — often for low-level, nonviolent offenses and sometimes unaffordable bail — has devastating consequences. In the Tulsa County study, nearly a third remained in jail until their case concluded, spending an average of 105 days behind bars. That’s more than three months of lost jobs, housing instability, and family separation, all before a court ruling. Despite a presumption of innocence, people who remain in jail are more likely to plead guilty, just to go home.
Consider the story of Nicole Rodgers, a 31-year-old Black medical social worker in Tulsa. She was wrongfully accused of armed robbery based on mistaken identity and faced a $50,000 bail she couldn’t afford. As a single mother of three, she risked losing her job, home and custody of her children. With help from The Bail Project and a public defender, the judge reduced her bail, she was released, and her case was later dismissed — but not before experiencing deep trauma. To this day, Nicole lives with anxiety and fear of rearrest.
In counties across Oklahoma, pretrial detention decisions are made based not on risk but on resources, and depending on your county, two people charged with the same offense can have vastly different outcomes. Nonviolent felony bond amounts ranged from $5,000 in Rogers County to $10,000 in Logan, Ellis, and Pushmataha counties.
Meanwhile, the public foots the bill. Tulsa County’s incarceration rate has ballooned nearly 200% since 1970, costing taxpayers more than $30 million a year.
There is a better way. Pretrial support services, like court reminders, transportation help, and voluntary referrals, are just as, if not more, effective than financial bail at ensuring return to court. These approaches cost less, preserve due process, and avoid the devastating ripple effects of unnecessary jail stays.
Oklahoma could consider limiting or eliminating cash bail for low-level and nonviolent offenses, investing in non-financial pretrial support systems, and using pretrial detention only when absolutely necessary, based on risk, not wealth. We can’t claim to uphold the presumption of innocence while routinely jailing people for being poor. We can’t talk about public safety while using a system that destabilizes families and communities.
The lesson from Tulsa is simple but urgent: the bail system is not doing its job.
Cash bail doesn’t keep Oklahoma safe — it just keeps people down.

In the state where Trump won by the largest margin in the 2024 election, grassroots unity helped keep public lands off the auction block.
The post Conservative Wyoming couldn’t stomach Republican public land sale appeared first on WyoFile .","Although Donald Trump won Wyoming by a wider margin than any other state in the 2024 presidential election, Equality State residents broke sharply from his party as Republicans sought to sell off 2-3 million acres of public land in the West.
Across a state that often supports and promotes conservative initiatives, there was scant support in recent weeks for the sell-off provision in the Republicans’ Big Beautiful Bill. The Equality State opposed this GOP budget initiative with criticism from many angles.
That opposition came despite Utah Sen. Mike Lee repeatedly revising his “mandatory disposal” plan. The Republican chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that advanced the measure.
From a one-man logging operation in Cora to a high-grade compass and optics company in Riverton, individuals, businesses, advocacy groups and nonprofits knitted together a coalition that helped kill the sales.
“Even [Sublette commissioners] didn’t know this fast-paced land sale was in the bill.” Karla Bird
“Not for sale!” hundreds of protesters yelled at the steps of the Capitol in Cheyenne a week ago.
“It’s one of the first times I’ve seen businesses and individuals come across party lines and unite,” said Addi Jenkins, executive director of the Wyoming Outdoor Recreation Business Alliance, a group that rallied against the sell-off. “It’s moving to see something still connects us all.”
Land mine
Lee proffered the plan as a solution to unaffordable housing — an issue many communities in the West are grappling with. Critics said it funded a tax break for the wealthy. Importantly, the sell-off would establish the practice of auctioning away unique assets belonging to all Americans, detractors said.
The Beehive State lawmaker, in the face of mounting resistance, reshaped his plan to squeeze through public roadblocks. Protected lands like national parks wouldn’t be touched, he said. He withdrew national forests from the list of eligible sale lands. He trimmed the plan to exclude all but Bureau of Land Management property within five miles of population centers.
But the idea still wouldn’t fly. “I think he stepped on a land mine,” said Buzz Hettick, co-chair of the Wyoming chapter of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers.
Lee surrendered. His Appomattox Courthouse was X.
“I’ve made the decision to withdraw the federal land sales provision from the bill,” he posted Saturday evening on the social media platform.
Opposition came from across the West. The land sale provision was “one of the only big-ticket issues everybody agrees with,” said Jess Moore, a musher who grew up surrounded by the Gros Ventre Mountains. She runs sled dogs there and along the Greys River, making a living on property belonging to all Americans.
Outdoor Alliance, a coalition of disparate organizations from the American Alpine Club to the Surfrider Foundation, said it generated more than half a million letters to lawmakers. “This victory is because of your voices,” Adam Cramer, the group’s CEO, said in a statement.
It’s clear, the group said, that senators “were responding to pressure from their constituents.”

Tribes were active. “Indian Country and our allies were paying attention, and we came together to shut it down,” said Judith LeBlanc, executive director of Native Organizers Alliance Action Fund. The group gathered and sent 23,574 letters to the Senate asking that lawmakers reject the legislation, she said in a statement.
Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance and the Center for Biological Diversity assembled 148 high-profile regional conservation groups who characterized Lee’s effort as deeply unpopular and reckless.
Hettick, flying back to Wyoming after a fishing trip to Alaska, sat next to two people who brought up Lee’s measure and criticized it. “To me, that says a lot,” he said, “that two random people on an airplane would say the same thing.”
Businesses on board
Jenkins’ Wyoming outdoor business group collected signatures from 85 businesses who called on Republican Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming to oppose Lee’s measure.
“I think this is a great example of issues that fire up and unite people,” said Taylor Phillips, owner of Jackson Hole EcoTour Adventures, who signed Jenkins’ letter.
Threats to public land get “people off the couch and they’re willing to stand up and speak out,” said EcoTour guide Mark Gocke, who moved to Wyoming decades ago for the unencumbered outdoor access. “It’s not partisan,” he said of the sentiment.
In Sublette County, a crossroads of energy development and wild lands where Trump received 79% of the 2024 vote, elected officials stood against Lee’s plan.

“The bill removes the requirements for ‘public involvement’ [and] ‘protection of areas of critical environmental concern,’ among others,” county commissioners and seven other elected officials wrote Barrasso in June. Provisions already exist for the sale of such lands, they said, whereas Lee’s measure “effectively eliminates any shred of input from local citizens.”
Sublette’s county seat, Pinedale, is a community that uses neighboring public lands and “is very vocal” when somebody wants to develop them, resident Karla Bird said. She urged the commissioners to get involved.
“Even [commissioners] didn’t know this fast-paced land sale was in the bill,” Bird said. “It wasn’t just this year’s proposal. What was going to be happening next year and the year after that — sales every 60 days?”
Bird had only asked commissioners to engage with Gov. Mark Gordon over what lands might be sold. It was “a bonus,” she said, when the elected officials wrote a letter opposing the measure outright.
Another Sublette resident — logger and sawmill operator Mark Domek of Cora — supported his local elected officials and the Outdoor Recreation Business Alliance he belongs to.
“I’m glad the commissioners had the backbone,” he said. “It is the wrong way to go,” he said of the proposed sales. “We want our public lands so everyone can use them.”
Hageman blames critics
Wyoming’s U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman was unswayed by the wave of public opposition. The congresswoman said Wyomingites were being duped by Lee’s critics.
“A lot of the talk surrounding [Lee’s] efforts has been misleading or flat out untrue,” the Republican wrote in a statement ahead of his decision to back  down. She suggested voters didn’t understand the issue, blaming activists who are ignorant or “willfully distorting [the bill’s] contents to cynically spread unwarranted fear among citizens.”
Lee’s mandatory disposal provision, “does not authorize the mass sale of federal lands,” Hageman wrote, only “about two to three million acres.”
“It is apparent that those organizations and individuals who oppose Senator Lee’s proposal recognize the vast majority of Americans would support it as being a common-sense and reasonable approach to managing a tiny fraction of BLM and USFS lands,” Hageman stated.
That theory was tested at a town hall Hageman convened in Greybull last month. “Often throughout her presentation, Hageman was interrupted by shouts of protest,” the Greybull Standard reported.
“This is a pivotal piece of legislation that could change the landscape,” Lovell Mayor Tom Newman said at the town hall, “maybe not in my lifetime, but it could change the landscape of the western United States.”
In Wyoming, 58% of respondents oppose giving state government control over national public lands, let alone selling the property for development, according to a Colorado College survey published earlier this year.
Barrasso said in a statement that he listened to mayors, county commissioners, legislators as well as hunters and fishermen, friends and neighbors. “The people of Wyoming deserve to have their voices heard on such an important matter,” he said.
He didn’t comment on existing law that allows federal agencies to sell land in a studied manner. But, if a Lee-like bill is to be considered again, “it must be thoroughly debated through regular order with committee hearings and with input from all concerned,” Barasso said.
Lummis didn’t respond to a request for comment on the land-sale provision. But on Tuesday, she issued a list of 25 “wins” in the Big Beautiful Bill as passed by the Senate. Preserving public lands was not among them.
For business owners who make a living off public lands, that property is their supply chain, business alliance leader Jenkins said. “The idea of losing access is pretty scary,” she said.
Musher Moore said the land sale issue had been percolating for a while. “This proposal kind of pushed it into the spotlight and made everybody say ‘No, thank you,’” she said.
EcoTour Adventures owner Phillips said Americans recognize the value of the wide-open West and want to keep that as part of their national identity.
“We are incredibly unique in that we have these large tracts of lands that are protected and managed by the federal government,” he said. “Most places around the world can’t say that.”
Wildlife guide Gocke sees that sentiment in his clients after they spot a moose five minutes from town. He talked about wide-eyed children looking through spotting scopes at bighorn rams, bison on the grasslands, perhaps even a bear or wolf.
“People are just floored,” he said. “People are craving it and can’t get enough. I don’t recall any tour that I went on where people were disappointed.” 
Backcountry hunter Hettick said lawmakers are now on notice. “The American public will jump right down your throat if you continue this.”

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy want you to believe they’re “fiscally conservative.”
That’s adorable. Really.
I mean, if giving $4 trillion in tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires while detonating the national debt like a Fourth of July firework is “conservative,” then I’m a bald eagle in a MAGA hat.
Let’s be clear: the Republicans’ “One Big Beautiful Bill” is neither big-hearted nor beautiful. It’s one more sleazy giveaway to the ultra-rich wrapped in red, white and bologna. And our senators? They’re all in—like kids at a billionaire birthday party hoping for a gold-plated goody bag.
This monstrosity of a bill hands out tax breaks to the people who least need them while cutting Medicaid, food assistance, Pell grants, and anything else that keeps working Montanans afloat. Oh, and bonus points: it’ll add at least $3.3 trillion to the national debt and increase our interest payments by more than $55 billion per year. Because what could possibly go wrong with borrowing money to fund yachts?
Meanwhile, we’re already paying over a trillion a year in interest alone—more than our entire defense budget. But don’t worry, Daines and Sheehy have a plan: Just kick poor kids off food stamps and tell grandma to take her chances without Medicaid.
They call this “reform.” I call it cruelty with a calculator. It is offensive and morally repugnant.
This bill will:

 Strip healthcare from nearly 12 million Americans—because apparently preventative care is a luxury.
 Carve $1.2 trillion out of Medicaid and food stamps—because what better way to show fiscal responsibility than by yanking healthcare and groceries from the poor while handing tax breaks to the uber-rich?
Eliminate 800,000 jobs—because what’s a little unemployment among friends?
Spike energy bills and gut future clean energy development—because the planet isn’t dying fast enough.
Slash food and nutrition programs—because nothing says “compassionate conservatism” like taking groceries away from low-income families. Republicans want to gut SNAP benefits for 1.3 million Americans. Why? Because apparently, hungry children build character, and cutting food assistance makes billionaires feel even more full.
Make it harder for low-income students to access Pell grants—because education should be for those who can already afford it.

Oh, and let’s not forget the bill’s all-out assault on immigrants, formerly incarcerated individuals, and anyone who thought AI should be regulated before it starts deciding who gets hired, arrested or evicted.
All this is packed into more than 900 pages of what really ought to be titled “The Oligarch Protection Act.” And let’s be honest—what are the chances Daines and Sheehy actually read the whole thing? I’d bet they skimmed the donor wish-list and skipped the rest.
So why are Daines and Sheehy cheerleading this dumpster fire?
Simple: It makes Trump happy. And when Trump’s happy, Republican Senators wag their tails and roll over. If it hurts Montana? Collateral damage. If it bankrupts the country? Oopsie!
Daines once claimed he went to Washington to “rein in the debt.” Apparently, he meant he’d saddle it up and ride it straight off a cliff. And Tim Sheehy, Montana’s most recent Trump ventriloquist dummy, is already proving he’s ready to abandon working families for champagne fundraisers and Fox News soundbites.
Let’s be honest: This isn’t conservative governance. It’s corporate feudalism. And if you’re not in the top 1%, you’re the serf.
So the next time Sheehy and Daines talk “Montana values,” remember this: They sold you out to billionaires and called it beautiful.  No wonder they refuse to face Montana citizens at a real town hall meeting.

 News of $300K in cuts to county’s libraries had patrons up in arms. County officials warn it’s just the beginning as more Wyoming tax cuts could be on the way. 
The post Fremont County library flap, a symptom of broader property tax pains, angers patrons appeared first on WyoFile .","This story is part of a WyoFile series looking at the impacts of property tax reductions across the state. 


Belt tightening was the mandate in Fremont County this spring in response to a multi-million-dollar drop in tax revenue. Commissioners, the bearer of bad news, asked county departments to contemplate 10% budget cuts with measures like leaving open positions vacant, raising fees or eliminating costs. 
So when news broke that the library system — which operates facilities in Lander, Riverton and Dubois — was facing a 23% cut of $300,000, library patrons were up in arms.  
“The community would really like to understand why the library specifically is being asked to cut its budget so significantly compared to other departments,” former library staffer Sarah Reilley told the commission during a public hearing. She was among several people who criticized the cuts as undue and harmful.
“What does $300,000 look like, as a cut?” Cody Beers, president of the Fremont County Library Foundation, asked the commission in the same hearing. “We’re talking services, we’re talking people, we’re talking lessening the ability of our young people and readers in our community to access our library.” 
Others urged the preservation of services like story times and adult educational programming they called crucial for healthy communities. 
Commissioners defended their process, saying they did not target the library for comparatively larger cuts as some kind of punishment. The library, they said, portrayed the budget cut as some kind of statement of disapproval, which panicked its ardent supporters. 
“We did not mandate it,” Commission Chair Larry Allen said. “We asked for options to explain what the impacts of cuts would be.”
Interpretations aside, the library ultimately received a $100,000 donation from the Fremont County Library Foundation and obtained county approval to re-allocate an additional $100,000 earmarked for collection development in order to backfill. The library also identified special revenue funds to fill in holes. That left it short roughly $53,000, according to a county budget spreadsheet. 
The cut will be reflected by a reduction of 64 staff hours per week, Fremont County Libraries Director Anita Marple said, meaning two vacant positions at its libraries in Dubois, Lander and Riverton will remain unfilled and another part-time library assistant will be laid off. The libraries may reduce operating hours as well, she said, but those changes have not been finalized.

The county approved its final budget in late June with a total of $2.5 million in cuts. Department cuts ranged from 19% from the commissioners’ budget, 35% from the county clerk’s election budget, 2% from the county attorney’s office and 88% from courthouse security. Positions were left vacant, contracts reassessed and fees hiked. 
Though a library solution was reached, discussions were fraught with hand-wringing and accusations — and library supporters still maintain the cut was unjust. 
The flare-up is the latest in long-running library tensions in central Wyoming. But it’s also a symptom of the struggles local governments and special tax districts around the state face as they reckon with significant property tax cuts ushered in by a new state law. 
Senate File 69, “Homeowner property tax exemption,” applies a 25% exemption on the first $1 million of a single-family home’s fair market value. This translates into smaller pools of funds for a myriad of special local districts — from hospitals to ambulances, museums and school districts. And with more tax-cutting proposals on the horizon, budget crunchers like the ones in Fremont County are warning that this is just the beginning. 
Commissioner Allen pointed to a measure on the November ballot that could bring further cuts. If passed, he said, “we’re looking at over a third of our budget just disappearing,” he said. 
If that happens, he warned, “we will probably only just have one library. And we’re not just picking on the library. We are picking on everybody.”
Number crunching
Several factors made budget projecting, never an easy task, more difficult in Fremont County this year. The 25% property tax drop certainly spelled cuts, but new tax exemptions, ongoing property assessments and fluctuations in mineral revenues also created a moving target.
Not all special districts in Wyoming had to deal with the same complicated puzzle, but they all saw tax generation drop. That’s because special districts are funded by mill levies, which draw from property taxes. 
Senate File 69 was among a raft of homeowner relief bills brought to the Wyoming Legislature in the last two years. Lawmakers were prompted, they said, by vociferous constituent concern that property taxes are too high in the state. 
Dozens of special district representatives, including first responders, community colleges and fire departments, urged lawmakers to reconsider, given the drastic service cuts the measure would require due to millions of dollars in lost revenue. 
Those pleas were not enough to sway lawmakers, and special districts have been wrestling with budget cuts since.

In Fremont County, a finance team started in January to prepare for a worst-case-scenario $5 million drop in taxes. With that number in mind, they asked county departments to contemplate a 10% cut. The commission also extended a wage and hiring freeze, meaning departments cannot hire for open positions or raise an employee’s pay without requesting an exemption.
“So the question to everybody was: Do the best you can in your budget, and then if you are able to raise your revenues, your user fees, we will do that,” County Clerk Julie Freese said in a presentation to the commission. 
Encompassing more than 9,000 square miles, Fremont is a huge county, with departments that range from roads to elections, solid waste, vital records, law enforcement and courts. Talking through and finalizing the departmental budget cuts ate up hours of meetings and public hearings. 
The commission used a priority system, said Commissioner Mike Jones, who is the library board liaison. The highest priority for funding included services the county is required by law to provide, such as roads, titles and a sheriff’s department. Second was the groups that support the statutory mandates. Third was non-statutory services like the fair, recreation board or museums that not everyone uses. While Wyoming counties are mandated to operate one library in their county seat, Fremont County has three — which is why they consider it in the last, he said. 
“We’ve been asking our non-statutories over the last six years … to grow their own self-generated revenue,” Jones said. “So the claim that [the libraries] were being picked on is not really true.” 
Commissioners asked all their departments how far they could stretch and reduce their budgets, Jones said. They asked for scenarios showing how services would be impacted, he said, but the library board didn’t satisfy that request. 
The library board didn’t see it that way.
Doors, staff
“At the very beginning, Commissioner Mike Jones wanted to know what a $300,000 reduction to the library board would look like,” Marple said. She interpreted that as the county’s intention, she said, not really up for negotiation. She also aimed to preserve library services as they are. 
Marple crafted eight options for the commission contemplating cuts ranging from 10% to 23%. 
“I wanted them to see the difference that even 1% makes to our budget and what we can do,” she said of her options. “I was also very specific in how we would accomplish this reduction with the primary goal of preserving library services for the community as much as we could.”
To do that, she found sources to patch many of the holes. One: The Fremont County Library Foundation changed its bylaws in order to give $100,000 to the county library system for operations. Two: Marple identified $100,000 of library funds earmarked for collections that she wanted to transfer to the general funds. The library board needed commission approval to transfer those funds.

Commissioners, however, appeared frustrated with Marple and the library board, citing a lack of specificity on how the options would translate to public impacts. In a June 9 budget work session, they agreed to ask for the full $300,000 cut — and deny the library the option of transferring that $100,000 in earmarked monies. 
Days later, the library board called an emergency meeting to discuss the situation. Without the $100,000 transfer, they agreed, the libraries would be open fewer days a week, programs would be reduced and services would suffer. 
Library board member John Angst was openly upset with what he called a disproportionate cut. “We were disrespected and the fact is we didn’t get a justification for the $300K in the first place,” he said. 
The following week, the library board came back before the commission officially asking for approval of the $100,000 transfer. Library supporters also showed up in force to defend the library and criticize the proposed cuts. 
“I don’t understand why the library is being cut 23% versus all other agencies or departments’ 10%,” Linda Barton said. 
Jones doubled down on his request for specifics.
“I see a little shuffling here and shuffling there, that to me is not really what I was after in terms of impact,” Jones said. “Here is the underlying question of the whole thing: If we pull $300,000, are you going to have to close one of the doors?”
Without the $100,000 transfer, multiple libraries will close one day a week, library board member Kristen McClelland said. Meeting rooms won’t be as available, programs like story times, Lego clubs and afterschool programs will be reduced and some computers will probably go dark, she continued. 
That answer finally satisfied Jones, who said he had been seeking that level of specifics. Commissioner Clarence Thomas, meanwhile, admonished the library board for not advocating for a lower cut that it could reasonably maintain. 
“We had all these people come in and get after us about the 23%,” Thomas said. “Those people should be yelling at you, not us.”
Freese, the county clerk and budget officer, clarified that she “sent the message to them to cut $300,000 from its budget because that’s what you asked me to do.” 
The board was under the impression that $300,000 was a mandate, McClelland said. 
“Shame on us as a board for having this miscommunication or not understanding, but we thought that this is the option that we were given,” McClelland said.
In the end, the commission then voted 3-2 to approve the full $100,000 fund transfer.
Future actions 
Fremont County library patrons won’t experience the more drastic service cuts that were laid out. At least, not yet. 
But if Wyoming continues down the path of tax reductions, libraries — along with services that range from museums to irrigation and cemeteries — may not be so fortunate. A citizen-led property tax initiative will ask voters in November to cut 50% of residential property taxes. Lawmakers also are discussing abolishing property taxes entirely. 
Commissioner Allen said the county’s budget scenario will become dire if the ballot initiative passes, with huge impacts to things like transportation, emergency services and roads.

“It’s going to impact everything in the county,” Library board member Perry Cook agreed. “It’ll be a disaster.” Cook suggested a concerted effort to inform county voters about what their property taxes actually fund and what’s at stake. 
Because while the library was able to find extra sources of funds this year, including the one-time gift from the Fremont County Library Foundation, Marple said it can’t simply count on that level of generosity going forward. 
“We now have a year to plan for what comes next,” she said, adding that the property tax cuts are detrimental in many ways. “It’s devastating municipal and county government budgets. And ultimately, it’s harming citizens.”

Legislative plans to do away with property taxes would mean greater inequality in the Equality State, writes columnist David Romtvedt.

Opinion

Property taxes in Wyoming have risen dramatically, and in an attempt to provide relief to residential homeowners, the Wyoming Legislature passed several bills earlier this year. One offered a 50% reduction for homeowners over 65 who have paid residential property tax in Wyoming for 25 years or more. But the reduction is only for two years, only applies to the first $200,000 of fair-market value, and requires an application process with the assessor’s office. The Legislature also passed a bill giving a permanent 25% reduction to all homeowners for the first $1 million of fair-market value, but you can’t get this reduction if you request the 50% exemption on up to $200,000 fair-market value. In some cases, the 25% reduction would save a homeowner more than the 50%. You’ll have to figure it out yourself.
Less than a year after passing these property tax relief laws, many of the same legislators who voted for them now say the system is too complicated and confusing for taxpayers. To solve the problem they created, they now suggest abolishing property taxes altogether — residential, commercial, industrial, and personal — by repealing most of Article 15 of the Wyoming Constitution and raising the sales tax rate.
As sales tax is a flat percentage on all purchases, regardless of the buyer’s income, it puts a greater burden on lower-income households. Because there are certain things we must buy, we can’t simply cut back on purchases to save on our tax bill. This systemic advantage for those with higher incomes makes sales tax the least equitable tax system we could devise.
Another problem is that abolishing property tax would hurt municipalities and counties more than the state. That’s because property taxes do not fund state government. Rather, they provide the money we need for local fire and police departments, K-12 schools, roads and sidewalks, senior centers, hospitals, water and sewer systems, community colleges and libraries.
But here’s the real rub — property taxes brought in about $2 billion in 2024 while sales and use taxes provided $1.4 billion. If you abolish property tax, you still have to raise that $2 billion along with the $1.4 billion that the sales tax now generates, arriving at a total of $3.4 billion. To do this, the state’s 4.0% sales tax rate would have to more than double to 9.7%. Since the sales tax amount generated by counties is wildly uneven, ranging from $821.34 per person in Fremont County to $3,754.86 per person in Teton County, it would be very hard to provide equitable services throughout the state. It’s a formula for lawsuits.
Progressive income and property taxes were initiated to help us provide uniform public services to all, independent of wealth. For over a hundred years, we’ve accepted that the percentage at which one is taxed should be higher for those with higher incomes and greater wealth. I should say: sort of accepted. Some people ask, “You’re going to charge me at a higher rate just because I have more money?” Well, yes, we are because we need to provide public services for everyone and because some can afford to pay more and still have plenty.
Watching my father work so hard to earn so little, I can remember as a kid thinking it was wrong for some people to have great wealth while others scraped by. I didn’t know anything about politics or economics — I just had that feeling. Later, I learned that in the Bible’s Acts of the Apostles 4:32-35, Jerusalem was said to be a place where people were of one heart and one soul with property held in common and goods and services distributed to all according to need.
The late historian Ramsay McMullen, author of “Corruption and the Decline of Rome,” was asked by an interviewer if he could summarize the evolution of Rome in a single sentence. He said he could do it in three words — fewer have more. That’s what I see happening where I live, and it’s not good for me or my community. I hope we can create a tax system that will be fair to all while fully funding the needs of all, one that doesn’t place the greatest burden on those with the least wealth. We live, after all, in the Equality State.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)It took a riot and multiple indictments, but the chorus of calls is growing to boot the state’s private-prison operator out of a Hartsville correctional center.
Republican state Rep. Michael Hale of Smithville, saying in a social media post he is “deeply concerned” about recurring problems at Trousdale Turner, joined District Attorney General Jason Lawson in calling for the Tennessee Department of Correction to take over operations at the facility run under contract with Brentwood-based CoreCivic.
The Trousdale County grand jury recently returned 41 indictments for incidents at Trousdale Turner, 12 of them connected to the June 8 riot when inmates stabbed a staffer and took over an inner yard. Lawson said more indictments will be issued as investigators review video footage.
In seeking a new operator, Lawson said crimes at the prison have added hundreds of cases to Trousdale County’s court docket over the last few years, roughly one every four days. Yet adding time to inmates’ sentences doesn’t improve inmate safety at the prison.
“The continued problems demonstrate that CoreCivic is unable to address the issues. I understand that Tennessee needs the bedspace at Trousdale Turner to house state prisoners, however, it is long overdue that the state of Tennessee shifted the management of Trousdale Turner from CoreCivic into the direct hands of the Tennessee Department of Correction,” Lawson said in a statement.
The legislature passed a measure this year designed to penalize CoreCivic by removing inmates from the prisons it operates if the death rate at any of those facilities exceeds the rate at state-run prisons.










The continued problems demonstrate that CoreCivic is unable to address the issues. . . It is long overdue that the state of Tennessee shifted the management of Trousdale Turner from CoreCivic into the direct hands of the Tennessee Department of Correction.


– District Attorney General Jason Lawson


The early June riot is causing a greater awakening.
But Gov. Bill Lee remains slow to act and doesn’t appear to be anywhere near putting the state over Trousdale Turner.
“The state has an obligation to hold CoreCivic accountable,” Lee said this week in response to questions. Lee acknowledged, though, the state is responsible for making sure the prison operates correctly.
He declined to discuss details or whether CoreCivic should make changes as authorities investigate. 
The state has penalized the company $44.78 million since 2022 for contractual shortfalls, including $15 million in late 2024 and early 2025. Liquidated damages total $570,825 this year alone.
Those are mainly for personnel shortages at CoreCivic-run prisons, which were 7 percentage points higher than at state-operated facilities early this year and cause problems with overseeing inmates.
The state pays CoreCivic about $240 million annually despite audits detailing low staffing, violence and deaths, and a federal civil rights investigation into Trousdale Turner, which hasn’t stopped, even under the Trump administration.

Republican Sen. Ferrell Haile of Gallatin said he and other lawmakers, as well as constituents, are “fed up” with the problems at Trousdale Turner, according to the Hartsville Vidette.
Haile isn’t quite ready for the state to take over the prison and noted he isn’t certain what steps the Department of Correction would have to take since operations involve a three-way contract of sorts between Tennessee, Trousdale County and CoreCivic. He plans to visit prisons to get a better understanding.
“I’m not at that point. I won’t say that I might not get there. But there’s got to be some drastic changes up there, and I know they’ve made some,” Haile said.
Republican Sen. Mark Pody of Lebanon, who sponsored the bill to penalize CoreCivic for high death rates, told the Lookout he wants a review of the entire prison system. He is set to tour the facility with Correction Commissioner Frank Strada, who has called CoreCivic a “partner” with the state.
“I’m going up there to hammer out what this looks like and what the options might be,” Pody said. “We definitely can’t have what just happened with that riot and guards being taken hostage.”
Trousdale Turner is the most “visible” problem, Pody said, but he believes the issues run “deeper” than Trousdale.

Add Lee to the list of Republican state leaders who believe Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell should be oblivious to ICE sweeps in the city he governs.
Following the dragnet of a South Nashville neighborhood in early June when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents swept up nearly 200 immigrants, O’Connell updated an executive order requiring Metro Nashville personnel to notify his office within 24 hours of an ICE encounter. Former Mayor David Briley issued the original order five years earlier, but O’Connell is taking the political heat these days from people such as House Speaker Cameron Sexton, who urged him to rescind it. O’Connell came under federal scrutiny, too, when Metro accidentally posted the identities of ICE agents involved in the roundup.
Lee isn’t fond of the executive order.
House Speaker demands Nashville mayor ax order to report federal immigration interactions

“I don’t think it’s helpful that they report that. I think anything that impedes the assistance toward the federal government’s efforts, anything that impedes that is not helpful,” he said during a short press conference this week.
Oddly enough, Lee and other Tennessee lawmakers frequently say the federal government should keep its nose out of state business such as educating kids, including special needs children, and taking care of the poor – until the state is overwhelmed by something such as a massive flood.
Once President Donald Trump started his deportation program, Lee jumped at the opportunity to spend money helping the feds pull immigrants off the streets, putting $200 million toward grants for local law enforcement to join the battle and creating a secretive immigration enforcement bureau within the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security. Interestingly enough, it hired a director before the fiscal 2025-26 budget took effect July 1. 
Is that jumping the gun? 
Either way, Lee appears to love the feds more than one of his own mayors.
Nevermind, go ahead
The legislature’s Fiscal Review Committee approved a three-year $30.6 million contract this week with Fast Enterprises to run the Department of Revenue’s tax collection system despite lawmakers’ reservations that it signaled a 40% cost increase.
Republican Rep. Rush Bricken of Tullahoma raised the biggest fuss, saying the state is paying substantially more for 15 Enterprise employees than it is for the computer program.
Bricken told Revenue officials the state “doesn’t need 15 folks sitting around waiting for direction.” 
A department representative responded that those people are not twiddling their thumbs, instead responding yearly to multiple legislative changes in tax collections and, in fact, are “more cost-effective than state employees.”
“I hope they do work hard,” Bricken said, considering their salaries are costing the state about $466,000 per person.
But as Bricken and other lawmakers questioned the expense, they were notified the state had moved forward with the contract on Monday, the day before the Fiscal Review meeting, using a waiver to execute it.
Fiscal Review Director Bojan Savic told lawmakers the state had to work quickly because its contract with Fast Enterprises was expiring.
Rather than send the contract back to the drawing board, lawmakers took a voice vote to forge ahead.
After this tempest of sorts, everybody came out happy, especially those making nearly half a million a year.
Bring your cushions
Former Tennessee House Speaker Glen Casada is seeking a new trial after being convicted in a four-week political corruption case.
Casada’s attorneys say prosecutors inadvertently played audiotape of his initial interview with FBI agents when he said co-defendant Cade Cothren, his former chief of staff, couldn’t “deal” because Speaker Sexton didn’t like him. The playing of that unredacted recording, which nearly led to a mistrial, is the basis for the new trial request, according to The Tennessean.
Cothren was convicted on 19 counts and Casada on 17 counts of bribery, kickbacks, fraud and money laundering connected to a secret political vendor named Phoenix Solutions that operated from late 2019 to mid-2020. 
Casada and Cothren were expected to appeal the verdict anyway. The question is whether anyone can stand to sit on those federal court benches for another four weeks. They will put a body in traction.

In or out?
Rumors have been flying for more than a year about a congressional run by House Speaker Sexton. But in a short chat Tuesday with the Lookout, Sexton said he is not running for Congress.
Still, he’s set to make a big announcement in August. Unless he’s admitting he lives in Nashville instead of Crossville, it won’t be much of a news event, unless, of course, he says he will be seeking the governor’s office. That would put him head-to-head with U.S. Rep. John Rose and, possibly, U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, who has been crowned the next governor but hasn’t officially entered the race. 
According to news reports, she pushed a moratorium on state oversight of artificial intelligence out of Trump’s budget plan, proving she is worth every piece of China she smashed in a campaign ad before the last election.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)ABILENE, Texas — Bolstered by $3.2 million from a former Midland oilman, this West Texas city of 130,000 people is helping the Lone Star State lead a national nuclear energy resurgence.
Doug Robison’s 2021 donation to Abilene Christian University helped the institution win federal approval to house an advanced small modular nuclear reactor, which might be finished as soon as next year. Small modular reactors are designed to be built in factories and then moved to a site, and require less upfront capital investment than traditional large reactors.
The company Robison founded, Natura Resources, is investing another $30.5 million in the project. Only two small modular reactors are in operation, one in China and another in Russia. Natura Resources is one of two companies with federal permits to build one in the U.S.
“Nuclear is happening,” said Robison, who retired from the oil business and moved to Abilene to launch the company. “It has to happen.”
Robison’s words are being echoed across the country with new state laws that aim to accelerate the spread of projects that embrace advanced nuclear technology — decades after the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl calamities soured many Americans on nuclear power.
In the past two years, half the states have taken action to promote nuclear power, from creating nuclear task forces to integrating nuclear into long-term energy plans, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, which advocates for the industry.
The North Dakota Legislature this year passed a bill allowing for nuclear energy research.
Nuclear energy research gets green light in North Dakota

“I’ve been tracking legislation for 18 years, and when I first started tracking, there were maybe five or 10 bills that said the word ‘nuclear,’” said Christine Csizmadia, who directs state government affairs at the institute. “This legislative session, we’re tracking over 300 bills all across the country.”
The push is bipartisan. In New York, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul last month directed the New York Power Authority to build a zero-emission advanced nuclear power plant somewhere upstate — her state’s first new nuclear plant in a generation. In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis in April signed legislation redefining nuclear energy, which doesn’t emit a significant amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases, as a “clean energy resource.” The law will allow future plants to receive state grants reserved for other carbon-free energy sources.
But no state is more gung-ho than Texas, where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott last month signed legislation creating the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office and investing $350 million in nuclear expansion.
“Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this legislation will position Texas at the forefront of America’s nuclear renaissance,” Abbott wrote in a statement.
In addition to legislative action, the Texas A&M University System has invited four nuclear manufacturers to build small modular reactors at the school’s 2,400-acre RELLIS campus in the city of Bryan.
In Texas and other fast-growing states, rising electricity demands are fueling the push. Tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon that require a tremendous amount of electricity to power vast data centers are teaming with nuclear developers to provide it.
Last October, Google signed an agreement with nuclear energy producer Kairos Power to deploy multiple small modular reactors capable of generating a total of up to 500 megawatts by 2035. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced in December that it is also looking to reach a similar deal. Some of the largest data centers require more than 100 megawatts of power capacity, enough to power around 100,000 U.S. households.
Constellation Energy announced last September that it would reopen Three Mile Island, shuttered since 2019, as part of a deal with Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI data centers. One of the two reactors at the plant, which is located south of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, partially melted down in 1979. But the remaining reactor reliably produced electricity for the next four decades.
“Folks shouldn’t sleep on nuclear,” Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said as he welcomed back workers to the plant last month. “They should be aware of the important clean role it plays in our energy portfolio.”
But opponents say the renewed interest in nuclear energy is misguided.
Federal money could supercharge state efforts to preserve nuclear power

In Colorado, a coalition of two dozen environmental groups, including the state chapter of the Sierra Club, urged Polis to veto the bill.
“The idea that nuclear power is a clean energy source could not be further from the truth,” the groups wrote in a letter to the governor. “Nuclear power is the only energy resource that generates dangerous waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years.”
Some critics say small modular reactors are actually more expensive than traditional reactors, when they are judged per kilowatt of the energy they produce. And one 2022 study, conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the University of British Columbia, concluded that small modular reactors will produce more radioactive waste than traditional reactors.
“There’s a pretty healthy skepticism about advanced nuclear projects,” said Adrian Shelley, who heads the Texas office of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. Shelley said many environmental groups “are just deeply concerned about Texas’ ability to responsibly manage nuclear storage and especially nuclear waste in the long term.”
Ramping up
The United States currently has 94 nuclear reactors at 54 plants in 28 states. The oldest began operating at Nine Mile Point in New York in 1969; the newest reactors, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Burke County, Georgia, began operating in 2023 and 2024.
Scott Burnell, a spokesperson for the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said that between the mid-1990s and 2005, there were “no applications at all” for new reactors. In 2007, there was a surge of a dozen applications when the federal government began offering tax incentives. But interest in new reactors plunged again when the fracking boom boosted fossil fuels as an economical power source.
Over the past several years, activity has ramped up again. “There are a number of factors that we are seeing drive this increased interest,” Burnell said. “Probably the biggest one is the growth in data centers.”
The commission has approved three new nuclear projects in the past three years, including the one at Abilene Christian University. It is reviewing three other applications and is discussing potential projects with a dozen other nuclear developers, Burnell said.
Texas currently has two nuclear plants — Comanche Peak near Glen Rose in North Central Texas and the South Texas Project in Matagorda County on the Gulf Coast. The two plants, each of which has two reactors, provide about 10% of the state’s electric power, according to the Texas comptroller. The new small modular reactors would face the same safety standards as these plants.
The project at Abilene Christian began when Robison’s Natura Resources established a research alliance with that school, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at Austin. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the project in 2024.
The reactor will be constructed at a laboratory at a different site, but its home already awaits in a trench at the bottom of a cavernous room at Abilene Christian’s Dillard Science and Engineering Research Center. The trench is 25 feet deep, 80 feet long and 15 feet wide, with a radiation shield made of concrete 4 feet thick. When the 40-ton reactor is finished, possibly by the end of next year, it will be transported to its home on a flatbed truck.
“The future is uncertain, but we’re ahead of the pack and moving at an amazing clip,” said Rusty Towell, an Abilene Christian engineering and physics professor who is working on the project. “So I think that there’s a great reason for optimism.”
Towell asserted that the project will produce only “small amounts of low-level waste” and that storing it safely will not be a significant challenge.
‘What Henry Ford did for cars’
John Sharp, the outgoing chancellor of Texas A&M University, said he invited nuclear companies to build small modular reactors at the school to help meet the country’s desperate need for more power. He said it made sense to give developers access to the faculty and students at the university’s nuclear engineering department.
Sharp said his pitch was simple: “Hey, we got some land. We got it next to some really smart people. Would you like to come and build a plant?
“And four folks said, ‘You betcha.’”
Matt Loszak, the 34-year-old CEO of Austin-based Aalo Atomics, one of the companies that answered Sharp’s call, said he had two employees 18 months ago. Now he has more than 50.
“We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars,” Loszak said, “which is really make them mass manufacturable and make it economical to deploy around the world.”
Robison said he’s been speaking at town halls in Abilene, a conservative community that is home to Dyess Air Force Base, for about five years. He claims the residents are “overwhelmingly excited” about having the small modular reactors at Abilene Christian, he said.
“Texas is an energy state,” he said. “We understand energy and what happens when you don’t have it.”

(Allen Best/Big Pivots)This story originally appeared in Big Pivots.
Coal-burning for electrical generation will end in Craig before New Year’s Day of 2028 arrives. Will a new gas plant arrive in 2029 to partially replace the lost generation?
Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association says it needs a 307-megawatt gas plant there to ensure electricity will be available for its members across its four-state service territory, but particularly western Colorado.
Three conservation groups argue strenuously that Tri-State can keep the lights on without the gas plant — and at a cost that is $288 million less and with fewer greenhouse gas emissions. They instead recommend more battery storage in lieu of the gas plant.
The Colorado Public Utilities Commission is scheduled to make a decision on July 10. However, the PUC commissioners must first decide whether to order Tri-State to conduct additional modeling, as the conservation groups want. New modeling, however, would take time.
“Time is of the essence,” Tri-State said in a PUC filing on June 25. It warned of “serious risk of cost escalation” if procurement of renewables is delayed, citing snarled supply chains and rising prices caused by the tariffs imposed on imports by President Donald Trump, and a reshaped tax landscape in the budget reconciliation bill before Congress.

For example, nearly all battery cells come from China. Many photovoltaic solar components also come from China. And the budget bill would strip tax credits for most renewable projects.
New gas plants have problems, too. Rising demand has caused lengthening wait times and higher prices. Companies that have not yet reserved the giant metal turbines now face waits of three or four years, about twice as long as just a year earlier, reported the New York Times in April. The report cited rapidly increasing demand from data centers.
“With demand for gas turbines reaching new heights and tariffs further threatening international supply chains, costs for new gas plants are soaring,” said a team from Boulder- and Basalt-based RMI in a June 18 report.
Colorado in the next five years will put coal in its rear-view mirror. The state got 80% of its electricity from coal combustion at the start of the 21st century. That had slipped to 60% in 2015. By the end of 2030, the state’s last coal plant, Comanche 3, located in Pueblo, will go silent.
All the state’s largest utilities are investing heavily in wind, solar and lithium-ion batteries. They are also hedging their bets with new gas plants. Brighton-based United Power is in the lead. During July it will formally dedicate a new 162-megawatt gas plant about 45 miles northeast of downtown Denver. The electrical cooperative is currently exempt from PUC regulation.
Xcel Energy, like Tri-State, must gain approval of the PUC commissioners. In another case currently before the PUC, Xcel says it needs between 1,050 megawatts and 2,625 megawatts of new generation as it closes coal plants and gets ready for a massive increase in new demand, about two-thirds of it from data centers. How real is that projected demand? Question marks littered the testimony in recent hearings before the PUC.
Two other utilities, Platte River Power Authority and Colorado Springs Utilities, also plan new gas plants. And like United, they are also exempt from PUC regulation.
The dispute about the gas plant at Craig revolves around perceptions of risk and uncertainty. Reliability of electrical supplies remains paramount. How to achieve that without significant cost increases?
Long-distance transmission across multiple time zones and weather systems will help. That, however, is both expensive and usually takes a decade or longer.
  Banks of batteries have become integral parts of new energy resources. This is a battery bank owned by United Power located adjacent to a substation along Bromley Road in Brighton. (Allen Best/Big Pivots)
Reliable and affordable long-duration storage has become the holy grail in this energy transition. For example, Xcel Energy is partnering with Form Energy in an iron-air pilot project in Pueblo. This technology stores energy by essentially “rusting” iron during discharge and “unrusting” it during charging, making it a potential alternative to lithium-ion batteries for large-scale energy storage for up to 100 hours.
The difference this particular longer-duration technology will make in future needs is not clear. Xcel certainly is not betting its future on an outcome. It wants natural gas, too.
As for Tri-State, it views a gas plant as having 95% reliability compared to 50% for renewables. It frets that it has no experience with battery storage, although in any scenario it will soon have many of them in various parts of Colorado and New Mexico.
The question then becomes, in part, whether to delay expensive investments in a new natural gas plant for a couple years to see what new technological wrinkles may make that investment unnecessary.
Tri-State 15 years ago remained heavily dusted with coal. As former Gov. Bill Ritter noted at a recent event, Tri-State’s leaders then fervently believed their future lay in coal forevermore. It’s a substantially different utility now. It will retire the first of the three units at Craig by the end of 2025 with the remaining two in 2027. It owns another unit in Arizona, at Springerville, which it will close in 2030. After that, it will own just one coal-burning unit at the Laramie River Station in Wyoming.
As it prepares to leave coal mostly behind, Tri-State has begun building large amounts of new renewables, including a solar farm in the Axial Basin south of Craig, near a coal mine.
This plan calls for the addition of 700 megawatts of wind and solar between 2026 and 2031. On top of that Tri-State wants to add 650 megawatts of four-hour battery storage.
As for gas, it proposes to replace the five turbines at the J.M. Shafer plant near Fort Lupton, increasing the capacity from 272 megawatts to 281 megawatts. The environmental community has no quarrel with that plan.










I’ve always been climate-conscious and truly believe there’s no limit to the number of efforts we should be pursuing in an attempt to avoid the worst of what could come if we don’t do enough about climate change.


– John Clark, mayor of Ridgway 


The new gas plant at Craig is the fulcrum for the dispute. Tri-State says it needs the eight new turbines of natural gas at Craig specially for peak demands or when renewables come short. The environmental community maintains that 550 megawatts of battery storage beyond what Tri-State proposes will do the trick.
“Although battery integration is important for a balanced energy strategy, the immediate needs of the Western Colorado system, particularly in the transition away from coal, require the inclusion of reliable dispatchable resources like gas plants to ensure system reliability,” the utility said in a June 10 filing.
Just transition is another element of the conversation. In 2019, state legislators adopted goals for an 80% decrease in emissions by 2030 as compared to 2025 levels. On the coattails of that goal-setting was the declaration that “strong and comprehensive policy is … needed to invest new financial resources in coal communities that are seeking to diversify and grow their local and regional economies in a manner that is both sustainable and equitable.”
In a settlement agreement reached in June 2024, Tri-State committed to paying $22 million to Craig and Moffat County from 2026 through 2029 to aid the community’s energy transition.
Tri-State is also on the hook for an addition $48 million in the next decade for lost property tax base — unless it adds new tax base. In that case, the new tax base will be deducted from the utility’s obligations. Part of its plan is to place 200 megawatts of battery storage in the Craig area by 2030. A gas plant would help even more, as Craig and Moffat County point out in their comments in support of Tri-State.
Once again, does Tri-State really need the gas plant to ensure the lights stay on during hot summer days and winter weeks when wind wanes as it did during Storm Uri in February 2021.
The conservation coalition — Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council and Western Resource Advocates — insist Tri-State has not proven the need. In a June 18 filing with the PUC, they raised what they call “serious questions about the accuracy of Tri-State’s modeling.” They want the PUC to order Tri-State to conduct new modeling, a move that Tri-State resists because of the added time. Again, it says, time is of the essence.
Costs of the gas/no gas choices can be measured in several ways. Tri-State prefers a financial measuring stick called present value of revenue requirements to assess the cost of the extra-batteries option. This tool provides the total costs over the next 19 years.
By this measure, the heavier investment in batteries will require Tri-State to generate $88 million over the next 19 years. That difference is just 0.5% more in revenue spread across the more than $16 billion in revenue Tri-State projects is needed for both portfolios, say the conservation groups. A small price, say the conservation groups, of just 0.5% of increased cost in an outlay of more than $16 billion in capital outlays.
If the social costs of carbon and methane are factored in, the no-gas alternative will actually be cheaper, contend Western Resource Advocates and the two allied groups, the Sierra Club, and Natural Resources Defense Council. The PUC is required to consider these climate change impacts but is not required to use it as a basis for a decision. By the calculations of the conservation groups, this puts the new gas plant at $327 million — or 3.6% more expensive.
The most compelling numbers for the environmental advocates are the up-front capital costs. By that measure, building the gas plant and new transmission needed for its preferred projects will cost $288 million more than the deeper investment in batteries.
 What others had to say

Other agencies and groups at the table (called “intervenors” in PUC dockets) didn’t raise objections to the gas plant. The Office of Utility Consumer Advocate, for example, saw the benefit to Moffat County as a positive more important than the “slightly higher emissions” caused by the new gas plant. It buys Tri-State’s argument about improved reliability.
The Colorado Energy Office urged that Tri-State explore sharing gas production with Xcel Energy, which is also closing its coal plants in northwestern Colorado. (Tri-State responded that it has explored that possibility but gave no evidence that the conversations were producing anything.)
The energy office and San Miguel County also mentioned a hope that Tri-State would get electricity from enhanced geothermal. Tri-State reported it had received a bid for a 20-megawatt geothermal plant, likely the first such bid in Colorado. It did not select it.
John Clark, the mayor of Ridgway, also wrote in support of geothermal. “I’ve always been climate-conscious and truly believe there’s no limit to the number of efforts we should be pursuing in an attempt to avoid the worst of what could come if we don’t do enough about climate change,” Clark told Big Pivots in an e-mail.
“We live in a promising area for geothermal,” he added, and enhanced geothermal — created by tapping heat from deep well — is an around-the-clock source of energy.
If Tri-State is based in Colorado and has its largest number of electrical cooperatives within Colorado, it also supplies electrical cooperatives in Wyoming and New Mexico and public power districts in Nebraska. It’s one system stretched across the four states. Members from all four states wrote letters both in support and against the gas plant.
Most supportive of the gas plant were the eight member cooperatives in Wyoming. They pointed to double-digit rate increases projected by Tri-State and continued rate impacts for the next decade. They suggested that the costs are due to adding renewables and the goals for emissions reductions.
From New Mexico came exactly the opposite argument from several state legislators, county commissioners, and Navajo Nation members. The alternative favored by conservationists is a “viable — and superior — alternative to spending several hundred million dollars on a gas plant that will emit millions of tons of greenhouse gases over its expected operating life,” they said.
Colorado elected officials have also weighed in with a letter signed by 33 individuals from town, city, and county staffs as well as elected officials. That letter, too, made the economic case against a new gas plant as well as the climate benefits.
Chaffee County Commissioner PT Wood, one of the signatories, told Big Pivots that he has personal doubts the reliability of natural gas. Coal was supposed to be reliable, but the Comanche 3 generating station at Pueblo has been closed for extended periods. Plus, he sees the extraction of natural gas as being “incredibly harmful to the landscape.”
Many individual letters were filed with the PUC, obviously developed using a common template but with some localized embellishment.
From Mancos, west of Durango, Brandi Lynn Piller described a new gas-fired plant as “fraught with financial risks due to volatile market prices and high construction costs.”
From Walsh, a few miles from the Kansas and Oklahoma borders, Fred and Kay Lyn Hefley noted the installation of two 50-kWh wind generators on their farm. “We strongly urge Tri-State to achieve its goal of 100% clean energy in Colorado by 2040 using wind and solar power.”
And from Matheson, on the windy plains about 50 miles east of Colorado Springs, Jan Kochis, and her husband, Virgil Kochis, said they strongly oppose the gas plant at Craig because it “contradicts Colorado’s decarbonization goals and risks becoming an obsolete asset, potentially burdening co-op members with hundreds of millions in stranded costs, as seen in past fossil fuel missteps.” They have 30 wind turbines on their property that generate electricity for Xcel.
Martha Whitmore, of Ridgway, saw it entirely differently. Whitmore said Tri-State was going far too far into renewables. They are “not constant, not reliable and (are) expensive to develop. If the State of Colorado is hell bent on eliminating reliable fuels, then the State had better get going with permitting new nuclear facilities. And, since the same enviros who scream about carbon also scream about not wanting nuclear power either, better not decommission our existing coal and natural gas power plants. We will be on rolling blackouts …”
Following is Tri-State’s preferred portfolio for 2026 and 2031 for 1,657 megawatts:
700 MW of renewable power purchase resources:

200 MW solar in Eastern Colorado (2028)
100 MW solar/battery hybrid in New Mexico (2028)

In 1996, women from both sides of the strife tearing apart Northern Ireland, then divided along ethno-nationalist lines, formed a political party to advocate for inclusion and human rights in upcoming peace talks. Only the top 10 vote-getting parties would be part of the talks. Though they organized only six weeks in advance of the election, the women’s party came in ninth out of 24.
Their remarkable success was attributed to keeping their message simple: inclusion, human rights and equality. They also urged “transversal politics,” meaning members could keep their own identity and views on various issues while respecting those of others to advance their common goal of having a voice at the table. Their slogan was “Wave Goodbye to Dinosaurs.”
The No Kings movement could learn from those Irish women.

I consider myself part of the No Kings movement. I call it a movement because movements are collective efforts by a group of people to bring about or resist social or political change.
There were eight marches to protest the values and policies of the Trump administration in my small state of Rhode Island on June 14, which just so happened to be Flag Day.
That day, tens of thousands of people showed up for marches in New York, New Jersey and Southern California. Estimates overall suggest millions of people participated in marches across the United States. Photos of the demonstrations show some marchers waved U.S. flags, but the flags of other nations appeared as well.
Consequently, the simple message conveyed by the name of the No Kings movement can get lost in the many messages that accompany and are associated with the movement. Frankly, it needs better organizational goals and marketing.
People across Colorado ​demonstrate against Trump administration ​i​n ‘No Kings’ ​protests

As a female academic teaching security studies in professional military education for 20-plus years, the importance of “reading the room” and consequently properly “selling your message” to the audience cannot be overstated. What will make them listen? What will shut them down? The same is true for the growing numbers of Trump supporters who are disappointed — and frightened by — the actions of an increasingly authoritarian regime. Latino voters who helped Trump retake the White House, for example, are falling away, as are low-information voters, rural voters, young adults and ethnic voters. But they will not be lured to a movement that often conveys mixed messages through its rhetoric and images. The message ought to be of a tolerant, diverse, united America. But that’s not always the case.
The Fourth of July is the perfect opportunity to do better.
Rather than showing up at rallies and parades with flags from other countries and symbols of political causes, No Kings supporters should show up with American flags. Diversity makes America great, and a sea of diverse individuals all waving the same flag shows a united front. All Americans are Irish on St. Patrick’s Day, and all Americans are Mexican on Cinco de Mayo. Now all Americans and those who want to live in an American democracy need to show their support for American democracy when trying to stop an autocracy. “Make America Great Again” Trumpians have usurped the America flag as their own but abandoned American values. The No Kings movement needs to embrace and retake the American flag as its own, as a symbol of American democracy and values.
Further, rather than glorifying individuals who have been unjustly attacked after they exercised their constitutional rights to, for example, free speech — some of whom are themselves divisive for their political views — simply support the right to free speech, as well as freedoms like religion and assembly. Don’t give Trumpians the opportunity to distort the important message of the No Kings movement into one of a hyper-radicalized left where individuals can’t even get along with each other. For the movement to grow, it must attract diverse individuals who can tip the scales away from authoritarianism. It must give all individuals a safe and welcoming place to go.
And while many individuals are rightly afraid of their rights being abused by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or some other form of retribution, individuals can be identified with or without a mask if the government is determined to do so. Pictures of individuals who show up at rallies or parades wearing masks and waving flags from other countries quickly become headline news or click bait for right-wing media. That does not serve the movement well.
We are living in an era of normalized chaos, deliberately created to allow autocracy to take hold. The No Kings movement clearly shows there is opposition. Movements can learn from the success and failure of others. No Kings should take an organizational and marketing lesson from the women of Northern Ireland.

(Jon Cherry | Getty Images)Provisions in the new tax and spending bill passed by the U.S. Senate early Tuesday would go even further than the House bill in removing health care and other benefits from immigrants with legal status.
The House version of the massive tax and spending bill penalized states providing health care for some immigrants with legal status as well as those that chose to spend state money to enroll immigrants without legal status in Medicaid.
But the Senate bill is even tougher on immigrants here legally and illegally, reducing benefits for most refugees and immigrants on humanitarian parole, including Afghans and Ukrainians who helped the United States in wars overseas and in return were promised safe haven and a safety net in the United States.
The Senate bill also cuts state reimbursement for emergency care in the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That would force those states to pay more for emergency care for immigrants, cut back services or drop out of Medicaid expansion, a potentially catastrophic move for low-income U.S. citizens as well as new immigrants.
The bill passed with three dissenting Republican votes, from U.S. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Vice President JD Vance broke the tie. The bill, officially the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” now returns to the House for final passage before going to President Donald Trump to be signed.
Advocates and experts see repercussions as refugees and other legal immigrants lose health insurance and turn to already-stressed hospitals and charities for help. It could be a nail in the coffin for some rural hospitals that are in financial trouble and scaling back services. Hospitals are required to serve anyone who arrives for emergency care, regardless of their ability to pay.
“In our state, it’s going to be absolutely devastating for rural hospitals,” said Kate Woomer-Deters, a senior attorney at the North Carolina Justice Center’s Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Refugees are not going to go home just because they lost their health care coverage. They’re still going to be showing up at the door of hospitals and clinics needing care.”
Some groups, such as Afghans, Ukrainians and Iraqis, were often brought here after helping the U.S. in war efforts, putting their lives in danger and making life in their home country untenable.
“In the case of the Afghans, this is pretty much a knife in the back to those folks who helped the United States when the United States needed help in their country,” said David Meyer, a board member of the Bloomington Refugee Support Network in Indiana, where he personally helps seven refugee families from Afghanistan, Honduras, Iraq, Nicaragua and Syria.
The Senate bill takes Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and even food stamps off the table for most refugees. There are a few narrow exceptions for people with green cards, some Cuban migrants waiting for citizenship, and some Micronesians and Marshall Islands natives with treaty rights, said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
That also applies to immigrants with legal status who don’t have green cards: people with asylum, immigrant victims of domestic violence, immigrant victims of sex trafficking and parolees — such as Afghans — admitted due to urgent humanitarian reasons, as well as to refugees.











It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.


– Shelby Gonzales, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities



“There’s going to be more emergency health care needs because uninsured people will be delaying care,” Gonzales said. “It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.”
The bill also cuts funding for expansion states to pay for emergency care in hospitals. Increased costs could force some states to drop Medicaid expansion altogether, spreading the pain to low-income U.S. citizens as well, Gonzales said.
“It’s one more reason states are looking at their budgets and they’re having to make decisions about their Medicaid expansion program,” Gonzales said.
In Indiana, Meyer said, Afghan women especially often need food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to get by at first. It takes them a long time to learn to read and write since they were not allowed to attend any school under the Taliban.
“They arrived in our community totally illiterate in their native language and starting from scratch learning English, so that’s a huge impediment to being gainfully employed,” Meyer said. Even once they’ve become self-sufficient enough to get off food stamps and Medicaid, many still need the support of the Affordable Care Act to get health care.
Removing all subsidized health care “would have a devastating effect on those families, and not just Afghans but Syrians, people from the Democratic Republic of Congo and others that have been relocated to south-central Indiana,” Meyer said.
Indiana hosted more than 10,500 of the nearly 460,000 refugees who arrived in the United States between 2013 and 2023, according to a 2023 report from the nonprofit Immigration Research Initiative. In fiscal 2024, another 1,380 arrived in Indiana, mostly from Congo and Burma, but including 90 people from Afghanistan, according to State Department records.
In North Carolina, there were 276 new Afghan refugees in fiscal 2024 among 2,730 total new refugees. Even professional Afghans such as doctors and lawyers struggle at first in low-wage jobs, said Woomer-Deters, of the North Carolina Justice Center. It takes time for them to get accreditation and language skills to practice their professions here, she said.
“A lot of these folks need their food stamps, Medicaid — they need these programs for an adjustment period when they get here. And these are people we’ve invited to come and have vetted,” she said.
A Congressional Budget Office report June 29 estimated that almost 12 million people, including 1.4 million immigrants covered by state-only programs, would lose health insurance under the Senate plan.
A Republican response to an earlier CBO report emphasized that the bill would save states $13.1 billion in Medicaid spending over 10 years, “freeing up resources they can choose to reinvest to further strengthen care for the most vulnerable Americans.”
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, however, called that conclusion misleading in its own response in turn.
“These savings would largely result from millions of people losing health coverage — hardly an outcome worth celebrating,” the response said.
Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, said there was one small positive change in the Senate version compared to the House version.
States will no longer be penalized for using the option to cover some immigrant children and pregnant women.
And the Senate version would not penalize expansion states for offering Medicaid to immigrants on humanitarian parole, but only because that help for parolees was ended in entirely, along with help for refugees and other kind of immigrants with legal status who lack green cards, Cuello said.
“In other words, they are blocking all paths to health care,” Cuello said in an emailed statement. “This is not an attack on the undocumented. It’s an attack on lawfully present immigrants.”

(Julie O'Donoghue/Louisiana Illuminator)Have you dropped off some Independence Day barbecue at your favorite government office yet? 
Elected officials and government employees may now be gifted $81 worth of food and drink per individual for state holidays and religious occasions under a loosening of Louisiana ethics laws enacted last month. 
Gov. Jeff Landry signed a law that allows any person – including lobbyists, interest groups and business owners regulated by the government – to provide individual public servants “seasonal or holiday foods” and nonalcoholic beverages several times per year. 
The upper limit for the price of food and beverage gifts is set at $81 per holiday but will increase in future years. It is tied in law to the Consumer Price Index and has an opportunity to go up every July when the index changes. 
Previously, elected officials and public employees were prohibited from accepting most food and drink that wasn’t consumed in person at an event like a reception. 
The spending on in-person food and beverage consumption was limited to $50 per person in 2009 but has grown to $81 after being linked to inflation and other factors. 
Under the new law, a single government worker could receive $81 worth of food from several different people for a single holiday, without having to consume it at a party or reception. The cap on seasonal food gifts applies to the individual gift-giver, not the public servant receiving the gift. 
It also applies to a wide range of public sector workers. It covers people who work in both state and local government, everyone from the governor and town mayor to a police officer or motor vehicle office employee.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

For example, the new law would permit a wide range of government inspectors – people who monitor restaurants, industrial plants and health care facilities – to receive holiday food gifts from the entities they regulate.  
Supporters of the change have referred to the new provision as the “king cake rule,” meaning it allows government workers to receive and enjoy king cakes dropped off at their offices during Mardi Gras season. 
The Louisiana Board of Ethics has also received several complaints from public servants who aren’t certain whether they can accept small food gifts like homemade cookies from the public. For example, a group of librarians was confused about whether they could eat baked goods dropped off by their patrons, according to state Ethics Administrator David Bordelon. King cakes and cookies rarely cost $81 per person however. 
Public school teachers may also face stricter gift limits than most other government workers with the new law in place. A preexisting statute prohibits K-12 school employees from accepting any gift worth over $25 per item  – and $75 in total for the whole school year – from a student or former student. 

There are 11 state holidays that would allow for seasonal food gifts: New Year’s, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Mardi Gras, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas. 

It’s not clear what would count as a “religious holiday” under the law.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200623_085452-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-03 06:01:48.941146

As of July 2, FEMA approved 206 individual assistance applications, totaling around $948,000 in housing assistance and $871,000 in assistance for other needs.
The individual assistance funding is in addition to public assistance funds approved to help local governments pay for repairs to public property and infrastructure.
President Donald Trump approved a major disaster declaration for some Tennessee counties on June 20, more than two months after Gov. Bill Lee requested federal assistance to recover from destructive tornadoes and once-in-a-generation flooding.
The early April storms severely damaged an estimated 300 homes and 14 businesses or nonprofits and killed 10 people. McNairy County’s emergency management agency estimated that an EF-3 tornado that hit Selmer, the county seat, caused around $27.6 million in private property damage alone. 
Trump approved individual assistance for eligible applicants in Cheatham, Davidson, Dickson, Dyer, Hardeman, McNairy, Montgomery, Obion and Wilson counties. 
This type of assistance can include grants for temporary housing or home repairs, post-disaster support services and low-cost loans to cover uninsured losses. FEMA aid does not apply to losses already covered by insurance, according to the agency’s website.
FEMA recommends affected individuals file a claim with their insurance company immediately, before applying for FEMA aid.
Affected individuals can apply for individual assistance through DisasterAssistance.gov, through FEMA’s mobile app or by calling 800-621-3362. Help with applications is also available at Disaster Recovery Centers set up in each eligible county. Centers offer assistance information from FEMA and the U.S. Small Business Administration. All centers are closed on July 4. Hours for each center as well as additional resources can be found at fema.gov/disaster/4878.

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)It was an encouraging week in Wisconsin. The state Supreme Court finally invalidated a cruel 1849 abortion ban, and Gov. Tony Evers declared victory after he and state legislative leaders reached a deal on the state budget that adds back some badly needed support for schools and child care. The budget deal is not what a lot of Democrats and advocates wanted, but it’s better than the brutal austerity Republicans in the Legislature have imposed in the last several budget cycles. Most encouragingly, the end of gerrymandering forced Republicans to negotiate, since they needed Democratic votes in the Senate to get the budget passed.
Some Democrats still refused to vote ‘yes” on the budget. They pointed out that, while it includes a significant boost for special education, it leaves schools struggling with zero general state aid. A majority of school districts will see revenue go down, and most will have to beg local property owners to raise their own taxes. To make matters worse, the Trump administration is freezing billions in promised aid to K-12 schools. 
Child care advocates who fought for desperately needed state support got about one-quarter of the aid Evers had originally proposed. Some were relieved, but others told Examiner Deputy Editor Erik Gunn that it’s just not enough to save centers from going out of business and parents from losing access to care.
The health care outlook is also bleak. With the feds poised to make Medicaid cuts that could cause 60,000 Wisconsinites to lose health care, the state budget fails to expand Medicaid and won’t even cover postpartum care — making us one of only two states to refuse health care to low-income mothers of newborns.
The worrisome backdrop to all of this is the federal budget plan President Donald Trump and Republicans are pushing through Congress that simultaneously runs up giant deficits and takes an ax to safety net programs on a scale we’ve never before experienced. 
The massive bill that passed the U.S. Senate this week slashes health care and nutrition assistance and will lead to the closure of rural hospitals, decimate green infrastructure projects that have been a boon to Wisconsin and will make life harder and more expensive for most people — all to funnel millions of dollars in tax cuts to the richest Americans and to fund a chilling escalation of a militarized immigration police force. 
Our own U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson threatened to vote against the House version of the bill, which was projected to increase the deficit by $2.4 trillion, because, he said, the deficits it created were “mortgaging our children’s future.” But Johnson then voted for the Senate version, which ratchets up the deficit even more, to $3.3 trillion. So much for the self-described “numbers guy.” Kowtowing to Trump and making permanent the tax cuts Johnson personally benefits from was more important to him than his alleged concern about deficits.
It makes sense that much of the news about the Republican budget deal has centered around the devastating health care cuts and the ballooning federal deficit. But the $170 billion in the budget for immigration enforcement is sure to change the landscape of the United States — escalating raids, deportations without due process and a massive new system of private detention centers on the model of the detention camp in a Florida swamp that apparently thrilled Trump when he visited it during congressional budget deliberations.
Brace yourself for the impact of the supercharged ICE budget. Unlike Texas — where terrorized immigrant workers are staying home after raids, causing farmers to fear they’ll  go under as their labor force disappears — we haven’t experienced big workplace raids in Wisconsin. If ICE has a lot more manpower, that could change.
I spoke this week with a dairy farmer in the Western part of the state who reported that, despite the terrifying videos circulating online of violent arrests by masked immigration agents, his employees are carrying on as usual, coming to work, going out, not changing their plans. “We haven’t had any raids on dairy farms in Wisconsin,” he pointed out. 
It’s eerie how normal life continues to be in rural Wisconsin, where 70% of the labor on dairy farms is performed by immigrant workers, almost all of whom lack legal documents to live and work in this country, because Congress has never created a visa for year-round, low-skilled farmwork. The farmer I spoke with said he had just returned from watching a soccer match among immigrant workers and everyone was in a good mood.
He added that officials in Trump’s agriculture and labor departments have repeatedly reassured an industry group he’s part of that the administration understands how dependent employers are on their immigrant workers and that they don’t want mass deportation to harm them.
Wisconsin dairy farmers and other employers are hoping Trump continues to be influenced by the people in his administration who tell him he shouldn’t destroy the U.S. agriculture, construction and hospitality industries. They felt encouraged by Trump’s recent statement that “we’re going to take care of our farmers and hotel workers,” and his claim that he’s working on deportation exemptions for whole classes of immigrant workers who don’t have authorization, but on whom U.S. industries rely.
But the Stephen Miller wing of the administration doesn’t care about any of that. 
The whole narrative promoted by Miller, Trump’s anti-immigrant deputy chief of staff, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Trump himself, that the U.S. is suffering an “invasion” by a large number of immigrants who commit violent crimes is nonsense. Immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than U.S. born citizens. They are an absolutely essential part of the U.S. economy. And they are loved and valued members of our communities. Most of the people the Trump administration has been rounding up have never been convicted of any crime, let alone violent crime. They are landscapers, roofers, farmworkers, students, parents driving home from work — just like the  people Trump claims he is going to protect. As the administration ramps up its program to incarcerate and deport them, with a militarized push on a scale our country has never seen, Trump is trying to have it both ways — reassuring employers that he won’t target the “good” immigrants who work for them, while peddling the lie that there are tons of “bad” immigrants who deserve to be kept in cages in an alligator-infested swamp. 
The idyllic, peaceful atmosphere in Wisconsin, where we feel far away from violent kidnappings by unidentified, masked federal agents, could change in a dramatically dark fashion once the ICE receives the tens of billions of new dollars in the Republicans’ federal budget plan. We saw the showy arrest of Judge Hannah Dugan and immigrants who, trusting the legal system, showed up for their court dates in Milwaukee. We saw the needlessly cruel forced departure of Milwaukee teacher’s aide Yessenia Ruano and her U.S.-born little girls back to El Salvador — the country Ruano fled after her brother was murdered there by gang members and where she felt her life was threatened.
With tens of billions of dollars in new money to spend and quotas to meet for its mass deportation program, ICE could begin rounding up the hardworking immigrants who keep our dairy industry going, in parts of the state that overwhelmingly vote for Republicans.
That spectacle, along with the hideous cuts to health care, education, food assistance and other programs that make life livable in Wisconsin, will surely provoke a backlash against the politicians who enabled it. Let’s hope it’s not too late.

Workers set off implosions with a boom at each structure’s base on Saturday, at the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Bull Run Fossil Plant. The Claxton plant opened in 1967, and TVA retired it in 2023 as part of its plans to close all its coal plants by 2035 as the agency moves “to focus on clean energy.” 
The utility has already closed some facilities to focus on clean energy and plans to replace the coal-fired plants with natural gas, nuclear and solar plants and energy efficiency measures. 
The coal plants generate about 14% of the utility’s power. But, Melissa Greene, senior manager of media for TVA said the aging coal plants were less efficient than new plants the utility could build now.
“Sometimes it’s more efficient to close one source and open another source,” she said, adding that new ones would allow people to use even more power. 
TVA has announced plans to retire one unit at Cumberland Fossil Plant in Cumberland City by the end of 2026, Kingston Fossil Plant In Kingston by the end of 2027 and a second unit at Cumberland at the end of 2028, although Adam May with TVA media relations said “the retirement of the Cumberland and Kingston units is contingent upon the construction and commissioning of replacement generation.” 
May said TVA hasn’t decided on the retirement dates for Shawnee Fossil Plant in Kentucky or Gallatin Fossil Plant near Gallatin.
The coal phase-out started before President Donald Trump’s January inauguration. The Trump Administration has since ordered expanding rather than cutting back on coal. 
Trump issued an executive order “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry” in April, telling various department heads to look for and get rid of policies “that seek to transition the Nation away from coal production and electricity generation.”










We don't know if TVA's public statements really reflect their actual plans or if they're just making noise to appease the administration.


– Axel Ringe, Tennessee Sierra Club


The federal government owns the TVA corporation. While the executive order did not mention TVA, May said the utility was “carefully reviewing” it.
“TVA continues to invest in its coal fleet to sustain the reliability and resiliency of its units,” May said. “We look forward to continuing to work with the Trump Administration to unleash American energy.” These statements seem to contradict TVA’s announced coal phase-out by 2035, even though that date is still the official goal.
Axel Ringe, conservation chair of the Tennessee Sierra Club, said he wasn’t sure what to make of statements like this. 
“We don’t know if TVA’s public statements really reflect their actual plans or if they’re just making noise to appease the administration,” Ringe said. “They had committed to closing both the Cumberland and Kingston plants, but now they’re waffling and saying maybe they will keep them open indefinitely to ‘address increased future generation needs.’”
Another issue the Sierra Club has raised with TVA — predating the Trump administration — is its planned continued use of natural gas. For example, at the former Kingston Fossil Plant site, TVA will build an energy complex that will house at least 1,500 megawatts of combined cycle and dual fuel aeroderivative natural gas combustion turbines with 100 megawatts of battery storage. 
Tennessee Valley Authority faces a push to get greener and more transparent 

At Cumberland, TVA is building over 1,400 megawatts of natural gas to be operational by the end of 2026. While the utility plans to invest more in solar power —for example, building a solar field in Kingston generating four megawatts—Ringe and the Tennessee Sierra Club chapter have advocated for even more renewable energy and less use of fossil fuels. 
Ringe said that use of renewable energy would not just cut back on greenhouse gasses and improve health and safety but also reduce costs. TVA, however, has argued that using natural gas rather than coal reduces pollutants like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and carbon.
As for the Bull Run Fossil Plant site, TVA has floated many ideas, but May said it is currently only committing to two small-scale ones. The company Type One Energy will use part of the old plant’s office for an experiment which will not generate power but may pave the way for future fusion plants. A synchronous condenser which helps keep the overall grid’s power stable without generating power itself will use the old plant’s turbine. 
The utility has made no announcements about the rest of its grounds, however, specifically its coal ash storage locations. Ringe pointed out that the executive order on coal, combined with the Environmental Protection Agency’s deregulations may mean less restrictions on toxic coal ash, an issue that grabbed national attention due to the catastrophic Kingston coal ash spill in 2008. 
However, he pointed out TVA still must follow a 2015 Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation Order to clean up the ash.
“At this point, it is hard to predict what TVA will do to deal with its active and legacy coal ash deposits,” he said. “We wait and see.”

One would allow districts to make their own policies. The other would ban cellphone use in class. (Amy Zimmer / Chalkbeat)This story was originally published by Chalkbeat. Sign up for Chalkbeat Detroit’s free newsletter to keep up with the city’s public school system and Michigan education policy.
At the beginning of the year, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer asked Michigan lawmakers for a bill that will limit students’ cellphone use to improve learning outcomes after the state ranked 44th in the nation for fourth grade reading.
With two months to go before school starts for many districts in the state, there are two proposals.
One – sponsored by Democrats in the Senate – would essentially continue to allow school systems to decide their own policies. The other – sponsored by Republicans in the House – would have more specific requirements for districts to prohibit cellphone use during instructional time in all grades.
“The governor will work with anyone to ensure our students can focus on learning, and we will closely review legislation as it makes its way to our desk,” Stacey LaRouche, Whitmer’s press secretary, said this week.
Republican State Rep. Mark Tisdel, who introduced the more prescriptive bill, told Chalkbeat his goal is for new cellphone rules to be in place before the start of the 2025-26 school year.
Tisdel said both Republicans and Democrats, as well as the governor, have similar objectives and are working on the details of what will be enacted into law.
“We’re all working in the same direction,” he said.
 Here’s what the two bills propose

  Credit: Thomas Wilburn / Chalkbeat
Senate Bill 234, introduced by Democratic State Sen. Dayna Polehanki, would only require school boards to adopt policies that “seek to limit” student cellphone use on school grounds, but would leave the specific rules to the districts.
“I believe that each school district should be able to devise a policy that is right for the school community it serves, which is why my legislation provides flexibility for schools to create plans that best suit their needs,” Polehanki said at an April 22 committee meeting when the bill was introduced.
A staff member from Polehanki’s office told Chalkbeat they could not comment on whether that is still Polehanki’s position.
The bill passed May 6 in the Senate. It has not yet been taken up in the House.
House Bill 4141 would require every district in the state to ban students from using electronic communication devices during instructional time, with some exceptions.
Additionally, elementary and middle schoolers would not be allowed to use cellphones during recess, breaks, or lunch.
The bill unanimously passed on May 14 in the House Education and Workforce Committee, including support from the three Democrats on the committee. The full House has not yet voted on the bill.
Tisdel said less restrictive laws similar to Polehanki’s were passed in states like California and Ohio. California has since replaced its law with a ban. The Ohio legislature is currently considering a ban as well.
“Why don’t we skip that part and go the direction most states end up going anyway?” he said.
At least eight states have enacted bans or restrictions on student cellphone use during class. Many local Michigan districts also have put restrictions in place.
Though supporters of the restrictions cite anecdotal evidence that they have positive results, there is limited empirical evidence and new research on outcomes vary.
Tisdel said he’s been working on his bill for two years.
“I’d like to see it implemented as quickly as possible,” he said.

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)Do you remember when the Republican Party was known as the party of fiscal responsibility? Do you remember when Donald Trump promised that he would drain the swamp? Do you remember when the Republicans bragged about being the party of the working people? 
Well, those days are over, and those campaign-trail promises, as it turns out, had the short life span of a gnat. On Tuesday, after 23 hours of debate, the Republican Senate passed a bill that cuts taxes by $4.5 trillion, increases the national debt by at least $3.3 trillion, while cutting funding for low-income working Americans, children, and veterans by $1 billion.
US Senate narrowly passes GOP megabill after overnight session, sending it to House

The so-called “big, beautiful” only passed with the vote of Vice President J.D. Vance who broke a 50-50 tie. Three Republicans — U.S. Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Thom Tillis of North Carolina — voted against the bill, along with all Democratic senators. 
The “big, beautiful” bill is a betrayal of the working people of America as it gives most of the tax cuts to the richest Americans who already control 70 percent of the wealth in the country, according to Statista, a global business data company. In short, “the big, beautiful” bill turns Robinhood on his head – it takes money from the working people of America and gives it to the richest in the largest shift of wealth in American history.
In 2027, 68 percent of the tax cuts will go to the top 20 percent of American households, while 9 percent of the cuts will go to the middle class, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, a bipartisan congressional committee that since 1926 has kept the scorecard on tax policy. 
Ken Smetters, a researcher at the Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania, reports that the school’s analysis shows the top 10 percent of income holders will receive $3.1 trillion in tax cuts over the next 10 years. 
And it’s not like they need it. Just over the past year the wealth of the 10 richest men in America, and they are all men, increased by $365 billion, a remarkable $1 billion a day increase, CNN reported in May. 
 How will the Republicans’ reconciliation package affect programs in Idaho?

Meanwhile, the “big, beautiful” bill cuts at least $800 billion from the Medicaid budget, which one out of every five Idahoans depend upon for their health insurance and rural hospitals depend on to survive. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office says it will kick 12 million people off Medicaid over the next 10 years. 
And one wonders if the party of “family values” also realizes that half of all births in Idaho and at least 40 percent of births in other states are paid for by Medicaid. How will those families pay for the birth of their children if they lose their Medicaid services? 
The “big, beautiful” bill will cut another $300 billion – 30 percent – from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program which feeds millions of low-income children and senior citizens. 
Idaho runs SNAP efficiently, officials say. But Congress might make state pay millions more.

Ironically, these cuts could shift much of the cost of these programs back to Idaho if lawmakers choose to keep programs at their current level. This means any benefit average Idahoans might see in their federal taxes will be offset by increased taxes at the state level. And the timing is bad because we already know Idaho’s tax revenue isn’t coming in as expected and Gov. Brad Little is looking at budget cuts of up to 6 percent. 
Idahoans may also be shocked when their rural hospital closes because of the Medicaid cuts. Political historian Heather Cox Richardson over the weekend quoted Politico as saying every major health system in Louisiana is warning House Speaker Mike Johnson that the “big, beautiful” bill’s cuts to Medicaid “would be historic in their devastation.” 
 How will the reconciliation bill affect the federal debt?

And even budget hawks should be screeching over the bill. It will add $4.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, including interest payments on the debt, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That is a debt that our children and grandchildren will be stuck paying off, with interest, for decades to come. 
After the bill passed, Elon Musk took to social media to chastise senators like Idaho’s Sens. Jim Risch and Mike Crapo who have always criticized government spending. He said those senators “should hang their heads in shame” for supporting a bill that adds trillions to the national debt.
But Crapo will probably tell Idahoans that the bill only adds about $400 billion to the debt. That’s because he got a provision in the bill that includes an accounting sleight of hand called “current policy guidelines” that tries to hide the real increase to the debt.
But, as much as Crapo wants you to think that two, plus two equals zero, mathematics, unlike politicians, can’t lie. When you give trillions of dollars in tax cuts to the wealthy you are going to run up the national debt. 
Donald Trump and Republican supporters of the “big, beautiful” bill say that it will pay for itself with a boost to the economy. But that’s not true. Even the conservative Tax Foundation says that it will add only 0.1 percent per year on average over the next decade to the Gross National Product (GNP), thus erasing only about 19 percent of the bill’s impact on the national debt. Wharton School pegs the GNP growth even lower, a measly 0.5 percent over 10 years and 1.7 percent over 30 years. 
Americans are not stupid. They see what the president and Congress are doing. A survey by the nonprofit KFF in early June shows that 64 percent of Americans oppose the “big, beautiful” tax cut. That same survey shows that Americans support Medicaid by a whopping 83 percent.
Even some Republicans fear what the “big, beautiful” bill will do to their political future. Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley says the cuts to Medicaid are “morally wrong and politically suicidal,” even though he ended up voting for the bill. Sen. Thom Tillis says that voters will punish Republicans at the polls. Tony Fabrizio, who conducts polling for Trump, warns that voters have “no appetite” for the Medicaid cuts.
Other senators say their colleagues are overreacting – the Medicaid cuts and tax cuts for the rich will have no impact on voters. Former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told his colleagues that voters will “get over it,” according to Punchbowl News. Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst said Medicaid voters should not worry about the cuts, adding “we are all going to die.”
 Voters and identity politics v. actual policy

Donald Trump is betting that his true-blue supporters, which make up many of the voters who receive Medicaid benefits, will forget that he is cutting their health care, while providing tax cuts to the wealthy. And he may be right.
A study by Michael Shepherd, a political science professor at the University of Michigan, conducted a study that showed that rural hospital closures decreased when state legislatures expanded Medicaid, as voters did in Idaho. Meanwhile, hospital closures increased in red states where lawmakers refused to expand Medicaid. 
Yet Shepherd’s study showed that in communities that lost their hospital, support for Republicans increased 10-15 percent. 
Larry Bartels, a professor at Vanderbilt University, explained such a dichotomy by saying voters make decisions more on “identity” politics than on political “policy” decisions. In other words, when Donald Trump promises to “drain the swamp” they will vote for him even if they lose their health care in the process, while the swamp isn’t drained. 
But one wonders if that will remain true when most voters see that the president and the Republican Congress are making a clear choice to favor the rich over working people, while betraying the party’s long-standing claim that they balance the budget just the same way American families do. 
It also might not be lost on many Americans that over the past weekend, when the Senate worked overtime to pass the “big, beautiful” bill, the second richest man in the world, Jeff Bezos, got married in Venice. The wedding, which included 200 guests like fellow billionaire Bill Gates, cost $20 million, 600 times the cost of the average American wedding, according to Forbes. 
The 2025 “big beautiful” tax bill will likely make Bezos’ Amazon company even more profitable. The first four years after Trump’s last “big, beautiful” tax cut went into effect in 2017 Amazon’s effective tax rates was 5 percent, about four times lower than what the average American pays in income taxes, according to The Nation magazine. 
If the Republicans and the president really cared for the average American, if they really supported working people, they would have cut fewer programs these citizens rely on and targeted most of the tax cuts to the middle class. This would have put money in the pockets of families who need it most and add nothing to the national debt because the wealthiest Americans, who often avoid taxes thanks to highly paid accountants, would pay more of their fair share. 
Americans must be starting to ask themselves: The president and Republican Congress are looking out for the millionaires and billionaires, but who is looking out for us? 
This time Idahoans, who overwhelmingly voted for Trump, may well see that the president and Congress are not draining the swamp – they are taking a pleasant swim in it. And, for them, and their wealthy benefactors, the water feels just fine.

“Most pharmacies were just hanging on for Senate Bill 188,” said independent pharmacist Rosemary Smith, referring to the 2024 legislation sponsored by Sen. Max Wise, R-Campbellsville, meant to strengthen state regulation of PBMs.
The new law — passed with overwhelming support by the legislature and signed into law by Gov. Andy Beshear last year — takes aim at the role of PBMs in commercial health plans, such as those purchased by individuals or provided by employers.
But a year later, it has stalled, with Beshear’s Department of Insurance claiming it can’t enforce parts of it because of a conflict with federal law that regulates commercial insurance plans.

As a result, the PBMs — national companies, some owned by pharmacy chains including CVS, the nation’s largest — continue to control a significant portion of the prescription drug market, said Smith, co-founder of the Kentucky Independent Pharmacists Alliance.
“It’s a system totally controlled by the PBMs,” Smith said.
On its website, the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, which represents PBMs, defends the industry. It argues that PBMs improve efficiency and save consumers money through processing prescription claims, negotiating drug prices and reimbursing pharmacies.
“Pharmacy Benefit Companies (PBMs) are your advocates in the health care system, working to lower prescription drug costs for patients and payers,” it said.
But the PBM industry has come under fire from consumer advocates at the state and federal level. Last year, the Federal Trade Commission released a scathing report suggesting that PBMs are “profiting by inflating drug costs and squeezing Main Street pharmacies.”
And critics, including Wise, the Kentucky Senate majority leader, argue PBMs continue to squeeze small pharmacies by slashing payments and steering business away from community drugstores to their own chain stores or mail order houses.
SB 188 follows a 2020 law, also sponsored by Wise, that cut PBMs out of the state’s substantial Medicaid prescription drug business, which the state said has saved it millions of dollars.
“We had great success with Medicaid, but with the commercial side, we’ve hit a roadblock,” Wise said.
Kentucky ‘an outlier’
Frustrated by what he said is the state’s failure to enforce portions of his 2024 bill, Wise has asked Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman for an opinion on whether the Beshear administration is correct in claiming it is restricted by federal law.
“Other states, including neighboring states, have passed legislation similar to Senate Bill 188 and are enforcing all provisions of the law,” said Wise’s June 19 letter seeking an attorney general’s opinion. “It appears Kentucky’s (Insurance Department) is an outlier in its interpretation of the laws.”
States that have enacted similar laws include West Virginia and Tennessee, his letter said.
In an interview, Wise said he doesn’t understand Kentucky’s reluctance to fully enforce the law.
  Kentucky Insurance Commissioner Sharon Clark
“It looks like other states, they’re proceeding just fine,” he said.
In a recent bulletin, Kentucky Insurance Commissioner Sharon Clark cites federal court decisions from several jurisdictions. But, Smith said, none apply to Kentucky.
Coleman’s office has received the request and is researching an opinion, spokesman Kevin Grout said.
The Kentucky Department of Insurance is the agency authorized to enforce SB 188.
Asked for comment, a department spokesperson referred a reporter to the bulletin from Commissioner Clark posted on its website Monday outlining the department’s position.
In it, Clark agrees the department can enforce a provision that sets a baseline for reimbursement paid by PBMs to pharmacists per prescription, which already is in effect and which pharmacists say has provided some relief.
But Kentucky insurance officials insist that the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) prevents it from enforcing some other provisions of the law affecting commercial health insurance plans including limiting the ability of PBMs to “steer”  prescriptions to their own entities.
The “anti-steering provisions” of SB 188 “are pre-empted by federal law,” the bulletin said. 
Wise and others — including a Washington D.C. lawyer hired by the independent pharmacists and the Kentucky Pharmacists Association — disagree.
“We respectfully believe this interpretation is incorrect and urge your administration to reconsider,” said the letter to Beshear from Washington lawyer Robert T. Smith.
Rosemary Smith, the independent pharmacist, said the department’s bulletin leaves too many questions unanswered.
“It’s still not clear what this does for the pharmacy community,” she said
Meanwhile in Kentucky, delay in enforcement has added to financial stress on the about 500 independent pharmacies across the state, likely costing them “hundreds of thousands of dollars,” Rosemary Smith said.
In the past two years, 98 independent drugstores have closed, mostly from financial pressures.
“It’s a crazy business,” said Smith, who with her husband, Luther, owns six community drugstores in Eastern Kentucky.
Medicaid ‘a saving grace’
In 2020, amid growing complaints from Kentucky pharmacists, the General Assembly enacted Wise’s Senate Bill 50, which eliminated the role of PBMs as subcontractors to the multiple national health insurance companies that manage most of Kentucky’s $18 billion a year Medicaid program.
Reprieve for Kentucky’s independent pharmacies is saving Medicaid millions

Medicaid, which in Kentucky gets about 80% of its funds from the federal government, provides health coverage for about 1.4 million individuals, most low-income or with disabilities.
Under Wise’s bill, the state Medicaid Department hired its own single entity to manage prescription drug claims and set minimum reimbursement levels for pharmacists.
The bill helped pharmacists financially and saved the state about $283 million in its first two years, state officials told lawmakers in 2023, largely in proceeds previously collected by PBMs.
Because Medicaid is so huge — it covers nearly one-third of Kentucky’s population and spends about $3 billion a year on prescription drugs — it has been a  lifeline for pharmacists, Rosemary Smith said.
“Medicaid, that’s been a saving grace for us,” she said.
But she and Wise, the sponsor of the new law, said PBM reforms also are needed for the commercial health insurance market in Kentucky.
Wise said he’s hoping a favorable opinion from the attorney general will remove any roadblocks from full enforcement of the new law.
While the complexities of the prescription drug industry might seem “wonky” to most Kentuckians, they do understand when the cost of their prescriptions increase and local pharmacies close. “That’s when you have a large number of Kentuckians upset,” he said.

(Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/Maine Morning Star)Though lawmakers made progress in addressing Maine’s growing waste problem, activists and advocates were hoping for more. 
Just over half of Maine’s landfill waste ends up in Juniper Ridge Landfill that sits between Old Town and Alton. It is owned by the state through the Bureau of General Services, which has an operating contract with NEWSME Landfill Operations, a subsidiary of the waste management company Casella. Last fall, the state signaled its support for expanding the facility, which is expected to reach capacity in 2028, despite objections from environmental advocates, the local community and the Penobscot Nation.
More than half a dozen bills were introduced this past legislative session seeking to address relations between the landfill and its neighbors, as well as the waste itself as Juniper Ridge inches closer to capacity. 
Overall, Old Town resident Ed Spencer said he is “somewhat disappointed” in the work that was done in Augusta this year regarding the landfill he lives less than two miles from. Spencer is part of the grassroots movement Don’t Waste ME, which advocates for policies to protect the health of communities at risk of disposal operations, and attended multiple of the Legislature’s Environment and Natural Resources Committee meetings. 
Without action, Old Town residents worry town will be ‘sacrifice zone’ to Juniper Ridge

In early May, Spencer joined more than 50 others for a rally in Old Town to not only voice their concerns about expanding the state’s largest landfill, but also to ask the lawmakers to back bills that could address the contamination and injustice they feel local communities have endured. 
Though he was pleased with the outcome of some bills, Spencer said he is especially disappointed that LD 297 passed and was signed into law by Gov. Janet Mills. Proponents argued the bill was necessary to allow more bulky waste to be brought in to stabilize the sludge that is disposed of at the facility. However, Spencer fears it just opens the door for more out-of-state waste to fill the landfill even faster.
If that legislation didn’t pass, Spencer said he may have felt more positive about the progress this session, but “that bill is a real stinker.”
Spencer said he also hoped for the passage of LD 1349, which sought to require approval from two-thirds of the Legislature for contract or contract renewal to operate Juniper Ridge, which would have increased oversight.
The Legislature did pass a measure (LD 1782) directing the Bureau of General Services to work with the landfill contract operator and the city of Old Town to ensure that the city is “fairly and adequately compensated for the burden of hosting” the landfill. 
Despite what Spencer sees as losses, he applauded the passage of two other waste-related bills. 
“We learned it’s not a sprint, it’s a marathon,” he said. “As hard as it is to compromise, sometimes we have to accept what victories we can get.”
He was pleased that the governor signed LD 1604 into law to address forever chemicals from landfill leachate entering groundwater and surface waters. While Spencer wished the Environment and Natural Resources Committee kept language in the bill that would have imposed limits on how much leachate waste that treatment plants could discharge, he still thinks of it as a success, especially for homeowners next to landfills who will be able to have their water tested for PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances.
Spencer is also celebrating passage of a food waste ban, which he described as a “total victory.” That bill became law with the endorsement of Mills’ signature bringing Maine in line with every other New England state that already has a so-called food waste ban on the books. The law will prohibit significant generators of food waste, which could include schools, hospitals, food producers and others, from disposing of food waste if they are close to a facility that could compost or otherwise dispose of the waste. 
“The state of Maine needs to continue to push for real zero-waste solutions” like LD 1065, said Dana Colihan, co-executive director of Slingshot, a community organizing group focused on environmental threats.

Andy Beshear signs a proclamation in the Capitol Rotunda making October 2024 Domestic Violence Awareness Month in Kentucky. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)If you or someone you know has experienced domestic violence, call the National Sexual Assault Telephone Hotline at 1-800-656-4673. Call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233. You can also contact any of Kentucky’s 15 domestic violence programs. 
Most perpetrators and victims of domestic violence in Kentucky are between the ages of 25 and 39, the annual Domestic Violence Data Report shows. 
The 2024 report, released Monday, shows about 9% of domestic violence perpetrators are between the ages of 13 and 17. 
Olivia Spradlin, a policy expert at ZeroV, (formerly known as the Kentucky Coalition Against Domestic Violence), said that while ZeroV staff are still examining the report, that 9% data point stood out. 
“Oftentimes we talk about children living in domestic violence and witnessing it and getting in between parents,” Spradlin said. “That number, I think, stood out to us, though, from an aspect of: these are children who are already committing intimate partner violence. That feels like an area to think more about, in terms of prevention and healthy dating.” 
Kentucky also has high rates of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), which are traumas a person experiences before turning 18. Research published in the National Library of Medicine in 2022 suggests a link between experiencing trauma and violent behavior. 
“While risk factors can be linked to a greater likelihood of using violence, they are not necessarily direct causes,” Spradlin said. “The DV data report does not have information that can speak to those risk and protective factors; that is an area that would need more inquiry.” 
  The report shows most domestic violence perpetrators are men and most victims are women. About 9% of domestic violence perpetrators are between the ages of 13 and 17.  (Screenshot)
The report also shows most domestic violence perpetrators are men and most victims are women. Of Kentuckians who sought a protective order, the report shows 69% received some type of order and 21% were denied. 
The state began gathering this data in compliance with a 2022 Republican bill that directed agencies to annually gather and publish data on domestic and dating violence and abuse. 
Data in it comes from the Justice and Public Safety Cabinet’s Criminal Justice Statistical Analysis Center, Kentucky State Police, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services and the Administrative Office of the Courts.
At least 44.5% of women and 32.9% of men in Kentucky have experienced contact sexual violence, physical violence and/or stalking by an intimate partner during their lifetime, according to the report. 
“In Kentucky, while progress continues, challenges remain, particularly when analyzing data sourced from multiple systems designed for varying purposes,” the report says. 
Those challenges include different organizations using different terminology and definitions and the lack of a “formal statewide surveillance system” to identify domestic violence deaths. 
Because of that gap, “this report cannot provide a definitive count of Kentuckians who have died due to domestic or dating violence,” it says. 
“Far too many Kentuckians experience domestic violence,” Gov. Andy Beshear said in a statement. “That’s why it has been a top priority of my administration to make our commonwealth a safer place for all our families, and to make sure victim services are available across the commonwealth. Through working with partners, we are able to help Kentuckians in need while working together to bring justice.”
By the numbers 
  Of Kentuckians who sought a protective order, the report shows 69% received some type of order and 21% were denied. (Screenshot)
The report shows that in Kentucky last year: 

32,899 electronic JC-3 forms (documenting alleged violence) were filed. This is a small increase from 2023, when  32,885 were filed. 
Those reports resulted in 7,964 arrests, an increase from 7,759 the year prior. 
Despite more arrests, some convictions were down. 
There were 4,088 convictions for 4th degree domestic violence assault, a decrease from 4,196 in 2023. 
There were 100 convictions for 4th degree domestic violence assault by offenders facing their third or offense in five years. That is a 9% decrease from 2023, when there were 110 such convictions. 
There were 82 convictions of 2nd Degree Domestic Violence Assault, down from 105 in 2023. 
There were 12 convictions for 1st Degree Domestic Violence Assault, the same as in 2023. 
There were 17,023 emergency protective orders (EPO) and temporary interpersonal protective orders (TIPO) served in 2024, down from 17,036 in 2023. 
There were 14,187 reports of alleged child abuse/neglect to the Cabinet for Health and Family Services (CHFS) that also included intimate partner violence. 
More people got services from ZeroV’s 15 programs — 15, 386 in 2024 compared with 15,104 in 2023. 

Policy opportunities 
In 2024, a Northern Kentucky Republican unsuccessfully tried to pass a law that would have given victims of coercive control access to  protective orders without first having to experience physical violence or face immediate threat of physical violence. Coercive control is a more nuanced type of abuse in which one person exerts control over another through isolation, threats, surveillance, loss of financial freedom and medical access and more.  
The report acknowledges that “not all harmful or abusive behavior meets the threshold for criminal charges or protective orders.”
“Behaviors such as restricting access to privacy or sleep, micromanaging daily activities, threatening suicide or consistently undermining one’s parenting are profoundly damaging,” but  “may not be recognized as domestic violence in a legal context.” 
Spradlin said ZeroV “has supported adding coercive control to protective orders” but “we would remain very attentive to the implementation process for unintended consequences.” 
She said accessing housing is also a “huge barrier” for survivors of domestic violence. 
“Housing, right now, is a huge issue for survivors — and affordable housing and dignified housing and housing that folks want to live in,” she said. “If a survivor can’t find housing, they can’t financially support themselves when they leave.”

Mazza/iStock/Getty Images)A group of environmentalists have launched a legal battle to stop a logging project in the Sandwich Range of New Hampshire’s White Mountain National Forest.
The Sandwich Vegetation Management Project, which was approved by the U.S. Forest Service last year, will allow 638 acres in the Sandwich Range to be logged by private companies, reconstruct about 16 miles of roads through the area and authorize prescribed burns on 306 acres. The Forest Service has said that the project will help manage vegetation to provide a sustainable supply of timber for local economies and the burns will help diversify vegetation and wildlife. It’s one of several logging projects in the White Mountain National Forest, several of which are being challenged in court.
“The Forest Service in this project, like in recent projects, is flouting the requirements of federal law as they approve these significant logging projects across the White Mountains,” Christophe Courchese, the attorney behind the lawsuit, said in an interview with the Bulletin. “And they’re doing less than the bare minimum required reviews of these pretty significant efforts that will really change the face of these areas for decades to come.”
The Sandwich Range Wilderness spans about 35,300 acres within the southern portion of the national forest. It includes Mount Passaconaway, Mount Tripyramid, Sandwich Mountain, several rivers, and about 60 miles of hiking trails. 
An allegedly ‘shoddy’ process
In a lawsuit filed in late June, Standing Trees, Inc. — a Vermont environmental group that seeks to protect forests across New England — and attorneys with the Environmental Advocacy Clinic — a project of the Vermont Law and Graduate School — allege the Forest Service didn’t sufficiently prove logging was necessary in the area or go through the proper steps for environmental review and public input.
“If you go down the list of various resources that they were supposed to analyze, and you really look carefully at what they put together, what you see is a pattern of the Forest Service just concluding, without evidence, that the project will have no impact on those resources,” Courchese, who serves as director of the Environmental Advocacy Clinic, said. “And that doesn’t meet the requirements of federal law.”
The lawsuit argues the project runs counter to guidelines outlined in a plan for the forest established by the federal government in 2005 called the White Mountain National Forest Plan. It claims the project fails to comply with that plan because it doesn’t include any measures to protect the officially designated wild and scenic Cold River and will affect parts of the forest visible to hikers and recreationists in violation of requirements to not impact scenery. The suit also says the Forest Service failed to demonstrate that logging will help manage vegetation and won’t harm the habitats of animals in the forest, including the northern long-eared bat, a federally listed endangered species that lives in the range.










They certainly went through a process, but the process wasn't adequate.


– Don't forget to add author


It also alleges the Forest Service plans to build four times as much mileage of roads than authorized in the 2005 plan by classifying the proposed road construction as reconstruction of existing roads. The lawsuit argues those roads have been decommissioned for so long that reforestation has occurred over them.
“The public should have a right to weigh in on these uses of federal public lands, especially, these really beautiful, important areas that have major species and other important water quality benefits and all these sorts of things that that the Forest Service was supposed to take into account,” Courchese said. “And they really did a very shoddy job in analyzing these impacts.”
The lawsuit also accuses the project of violating the National Environmental Policy Act in numerous ways including by failing the so-called “hard look” test and not properly examining the impacts on forest health, climate, and endangered species.
“They certainly went through a process, but the process wasn’t adequate, especially given the types of information that they presented and the analysis that they did in that review,” Courchese said. “So it’s not that they didn’t do any review, but the review that they did really fell short of the federal requirements.”
The Forest Service’s stance
The Forest Service has not filed a response to the lawsuit, according to online court records. Officials with the Forest Service and White Mountain National Forest’s Campton office did not respond to the Bulletin’s requests for an interview or comment. However, in a letter outlining approval for the project, Jim Innis, Saco District ranger at the national forest addressed public concern over the project, writing “The National Forest System is managed under a multiple use mission, which not everyone agrees with.”
“Public opinion on forest management has and will continue to be controversial,” he continued. “Federal land management policy can be complex and difficult to understand. My staff and I did our best to explain the ‘why’ of our management actions and will continue this approach for future projects. … I have considered public comments received throughout the analysis and balanced them with the best available science in making this decision.”
The Forest Service had three 30-day comment periods and held five public meetings and five meetings with clubs and organizations on the project.
After those meetings, the Forest Service excluded 50 acres of old-growth forests from the project, Innis wrote. He also said the agency consulted with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which determined “the proposed project may affect, but not is likely to adversely affect the northern long-eared bat.”
Several contested projects
This isn’t the first time Courchese and the Environment Advocacy Clinic have sued the Forest Service. There are more than a dozen logging projects approved or proposed in the White Mountain National Forest, and the Environmental Advocacy Clinic, partnered with Standing Trees, Inc., have targeted several of them.
“We’ve been very active in this space,” Courchese said, “challenging the Forest Service and trying to hold them accountable for complying with federal law.”
That includes their lawsuit over the Tarleton Project near Gorham and Lake Tarleton in the western portion of the forest, and a lawsuit against the Peabody Project in the famous northern Presidential Range of the White Mountains. Those lawsuits are ongoing and revolve around similar disputes.
They’ve also challenged logging projects on state land in Vermont and sued chemical manufacturing giant Monsanto over its alleged harmful impacts on water in New England. 
New dynamics under Trump
The logging projects have been ongoing across multiple presidential administrations. However, when President Donald Trump retook office in January, Courchese said he noticed two major conflicting changes happening simultaneously.
“Clearly, at the presidential level and at the top of the agency, there’s a real imperative to get these logging projects going,” he said. “And there’s a real set of commands, through executive orders and other directives, to put more of these national forest lands on the chopping block, so to speak, for reasons that don’t hold up, such as the fact that we have a supposed emergency in the national forests in terms of wildfire risk, which is just not the case in the White Mountains.”
However, at the same time, he said that massive cuts in staffing and funding appear to have hamstrung the Forest Service employees’ ability to work on this quickly.
Trump has taken several actions aimed at opening up more forests to logging across the U.S. Late last month, he announced plans to end the quarter-century-old “roadless rule” and lift restrictions on road construction in nearly a third of U.S. National forest land, a necessary step to build logging infrastructure. Trump also instructed his cabinet secretaries to bypass endangered species laws and other environmental restrictions to allow loggers to tap into more areas. These actions follow a series of executive orders in early March meant to streamline timber production and bypass environmental protection laws on claims of national security and natural disaster risk.

(Screenshot from Governor’s Office X video.)Governor Josh Stein vetoed three bills Wednesday afternoon, including an expansion of the state auditor’s powers and a controversial reduction in emissions standards sought by Duke Energy.
In a slew of bill actions, Stein issued three vetoes and signed seven other bills passed by the General Assembly. The decisions bring Stein’s veto total for the term to seven, after he previously rejected bills on the permitless carry of concealed firearms, immigration enforcement, and environmental policy changes last month. That’s roughly on pace with the previous legislative session — by this point in 2023, Governor Roy Cooper had vetoed eight bills, though all were ultimately overturned.
So far, none of Stein’s vetoes have been overridden, as the legislature has a very narrow path to do so. Though Republicans hold a veto-proof, 30-20 supermajority in the state Senate, they are one seat short of the 72 votes needed in the 120-seat House, meaning any veto override would require either support from a House Democrat or absences.
Duke Energy bill
The highest-profile veto Wednesday was of Senate Bill 266, a proposal that would cut greenhouse gas emissions requirements for Duke Energy while allowing the utility monopoly to charge higher rates to fund the construction of new electric facilities.
SB 266 would eliminate a 2030 goal to reduce carbon emissions by 70% for electric companies that service more than 150,000 customers, leaving intact only a 2050 goal for carbon neutrality. It would also allow for large electric companies to raise rates to cover future generating facilities, so long as estimates show the new facilities would yield long-term savings for customers.
This bill is the most likely of the three to see a successful veto override, as it received votes from 11 House Democrats last month, meaning it already has the support of a supermajority of House representatives.
Stein took aim at the bill for its potential to raise utility costs on consumers in the short-term.










“This summer’s record heat and soaring utility bills has shown that we need to focus on lowering electricity costs for working families — not raising them. And as our state continues to grow, we need to diversify our energy portfolio so that we are not overly reliant on natural gas and its volatile fuel markets. Recent independent analysis of Senate Bill 266 shows that this bill could cost North Carolina ratepayers up to $23 billion through 2050 due to higher fuel costs. This bill not only makes everyone’s utility bills more expensive, but it also shifts the cost of electricity from large industrial users onto the backs of regular people — families will pay more so that industry pays less. Additionally, this bill walks back our state’s commitment to reduce carbon emissions, sending the wrong signal to businesses that want to be a part of our clean energy economy. My job is to do everything in my power to lower costs and grow the economy. This bill fails that test.”


– Governor Josh Stein


  Stein vetoed a bill on Wednesday that would relax emissions targets for Duke Energy and allow them to raise rates. (Screenshot from Governor’s Office X video.)
In a statement issued following the veto, a Dan Crawford of the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters praised Stein for rejecting what he called a false choice between low costs and clean power, a trade-off he said, that represented “a scam pushed by wealthy utilities to protect their profits at the expense of our communities.”
“Governor Stein continues to stand up for hardworking North Carolinians against Duke Energy’s greed,” said Crawford, the NCLCV’s director of government relations. “Senate Bill 266 would have raised residential energy bills, put ratepayers on the hook for Duke’s expansion, and gutted a key state climate goal — cutting carbon emissions 70% by 2030. An independent study found removing this target goal would cost ratepayers an additional $23 billion by 2050.”
A spokesperson for Duke Energy did not respond to a request for comment.
Republican legislative leaders in the House and Senate bashed Stein’s veto decision, with Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger labeling him a “Green New Deal Radical,” arguing that the bill would in fact save North Carolinians $15 billion in electric costs. House Speaker Destin Hall said in a statement that he expects a veto override to succeed.
“I’m disappointed in the governor’s veto of the ‘Power Bill Reduction Act,’ which would have delivered cheap, reliable energy to North Carolina, cut the red tape that is choking innovation and long-term energy solutions, and saved consumers over $12 billion dollars,” Hall said. “Considering the strong bipartisan support in both chambers, we anticipate overriding this veto.”
An analysis posted June 30th by researchers at NC State University said that the bill would lead to a $23 billion increase in fuel costs through 2050.
State auditor bill
A bill whose fate would appear cloudier is House Bill 549, which would grant broad investigative powers into any entity receiving state or federal funding to the State Auditor’s Office, while also exempting the office from several state requirements.
HB 549 comes as Auditor Dave Boliek has received broad new grants of authority from the state legislature, including oversight of the State Board of Elections, a shift that flipped the board from control by a Democratic majority to a Republican one. Stein cited the state’s commercial interests as a chief reason for vetoing the bill.










“House Bill 549 would grant the Auditor sweeping access to the data and records of any private corporation that accepts any amount of state funding. Giving the Auditor this intrusive power may undermine our state’s efforts to recruit businesses to North Carolina. Additionally, the bill would remove the Office of State Auditor from the state’s cybersecurity efforts led by the Department of Information Technology, putting North Carolinians’ personal identifying information at heightened risk of a breach.”


– Governor Josh Stein


Though state legislative leaders did not address the bill’s veto, Boliek said in a statement that Stein’s veto undermines the “autonomy and independence” of the state auditor’s office, citing a need for greater latitude to perform its watchdog function.
  State Auditor Dave Boliek urges a Senate Committee to approve legislation giving his office more power. (Screengrab from NCGA video)
“Governor Stein’s veto undercuts the important principles of accountability and transparency that taxpayers expect from their government,” Boliek said. “Further, as the governor is aware, our office already has the authority to hold those who receive tax dollars accountable. I have confidence the legislature will stand up for these principles and override the governor’s veto.”
If the legislature attempts to override Stein’s veto of HB 549, it will likely face a narrow path to success. Only a single House Democrat, Rep. Shelly Willingham of Edgecombe County, voted to concur with the Senate’s passage of the bill in June, after having previously voted against it in May. To overcome the veto, Republicans will need to retain his support while ensuring full attendance from their own caucus.
Charter school bill
In his third veto of the day, Stein rejected Senate Bill 254, an overhaul of charter school laws in the state that would delegate greater authority to the state’s Charter Schools Review Board, including allowing it to reject State Board of Education rules that would apply to charter schools.
Stein wrote in his veto statement that giving the CSRB the authority to overrule the State Board of Education would violate the North Carolina state constitution.










“Senate Bill 254 is an unconstitutional infringement on the authority of the State Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. Additionally, it weakens accountability of charter schools when every North Carolina student deserves excellent public schools, whether traditional or charter.”


– Governor Josh Stein


Objecting to the veto, the North Carolina Coalition for Charter Schools issued a statement arguing that charter schools in the state require greater independence and flexibility to operate than is currently provided.
  If passed, S.B. 254 would allow the Charter School Review Board to overrule State Superintendent of Public Instruction Maurice “Mo” Green and the Board of Education on charter school policies. (Screengrab from education forum hosted by WRAL)
“The success of public charter schools hinges on their flexibility and autonomy,” said Dave Machado, the coalition’s executive director. “The legislature rightly placed at the front line of charter schools regulation and oversight a body of public charter school experts insulated from political maneuverings that have hamstrung the charter school sector in other states.”
Machado also disputed that the state constitution prevents this change, noting that the clause empowering the State Board of Education states that its authority is “subject to laws enacted by the General Assembly.”
As with the energy bill, supporters of SB 254 appear at first blush to have sufficient numbers to override the governor’s veto. Eight Democrats joined with Republicans to pass the bill in the House, more than enough to provide a supermajority vote.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)Virginia and other states will regain the ability to use $33 million in emergency relief funds, after the federal government last week reversed course on a March decision that prohibited them from using the funds.
U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon abruptly accelerated the deadline for schools to spend all allocated funds  on March 28, leaving schools scrambling to make plans for the money. 
McMahon announced the rescission of that policy in a June 26 letter to chief state school officers, after several states sued the agency in the Southern District of New York, leading to injunctions that prevented the DOE from enforcing its policy. Virginia was not one of those states involved in the litigation, but its state education agency did file appeals with DOE.
The Virginia Department of Education said DOE’s announcement will unlock a total of $52 million for Virginia, including $26.3 million for state-level projects and $25.7 million for school projects. The state education department previously received an extension for $18 million for statewide tutoring services. 
“The original intent of the policy announced on March 28 was to treat all states consistently with regards to safeguarding and refocusing their remaining COVID-era grant funding on students,” wrote McMahon. 
She said that, given the ongoing litigation against the policy, states can submit reimbursement or route pay requests for their Education Stabilization Funds programs. The agency will review requests and evaluate them consistent with the prior process. 
McMahon wrote that states that have already submitted requests and receipts as part of the review and appeals process do not need to resubmit.
Beginning in 2020, states, including Virginia, received millions in grants through the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations and the American Rescue Plan Acts. 
Schools have used the funds to support safe operations for students and staff, and address the pandemic’s negative impacts on learning with tools such as tutoring and after-school programs.
Although the federal government extended the deadline to use the grant funds under President Joe Biden’s administration, schools were required to return all unspent funds, which were intended for immediate and short-term needs.
“We continue to work closely with impacted school divisions to ensure their reimbursements are submitted to USED to close out the ESSER III projects and funding,” VDOE said in a statement. “The continued use of the funding through the original approved late liquidation period will allow school divisions and the state to complete projects that were either almost completed or well underway.”

The state is showing a dedication to sustainable farming measures by allocating $223 million for agricultural practices that stop pollutants and sediment disturbances that lead to runoff into the Chesapeake Bay.
It is a $16 million increase over the last fiscal year, leading to the fourth year of increasing funding from the state. The program helps farmers in the commonwealth to implement projects that conserve water, help soil health through cover crops, and other sustainability goals. It is part of a larger, multistate effort to improve the water quality of the Chesapeake Bay.
“This unprecedented funding underscores Virginia’s strong commitment to environmental stewardship and agricultural resilience,” said Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources Stefanie Taillon in a statement. “Investing in voluntary conservation practices is one of the most effective ways we can protect our waterways, support farmers and meet our Chesapeake Bay restoration goals.”
Farmers can apply for up to $300,000 in fiscal year 2026 to cost-share one of over 60 projects, including stream cattle exclusion zones, cover crops, and animal waste control facilities. 
“So sometimes they would be implementing a practice, but this is kind of taking their practice to the next level from a work party perspective, and the payment structure is set up in a way to try and incentivize or offset the financial disadvantage of implementing rye over a legume for example,” said James Martin, Director of the Department of Conservation and Recreation’s division of soil and water conservation. Rye is less attractive to farmers as a cover crop because it spreads into other crops.
Martin said it is important to bring farmers to the table on these goals because they understand it is a cost to them to implement these projects. He said he has been pleased with the General Assembly’s investment in cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay.
“If we fail to meet our agricultural commitments in the Chesapeake Bay by 2027 there’s a possibility that the secretaries of agriculture and the secretaries of natural resources would mandate the implementation of nutrient management on crops,” Martin said.
Over a decade ago, Virginia joined other states in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Later, the General Assembly implemented a law that beefed up the requirements for the state to reduce its amount of pollutants running out of its waterways into the Bay. 
There are questions around how the agreement will be impacted with the Trump administration proposing major cuts to the EPA. After a brief funding pause, many of the dollars already allocated by Congress were released to the Bay cleanup programs. It is uncertain what the budget for the projects will be in the next year.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.

“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.
Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration announced the National Institutes of Health is limiting indirect-cost funding to 15%, but this has been blocked by a federal judge. 
“We’re going to lose people from Ohio to other states that might have more resources in the space that don’t rely as much on federal funding,” said Sara Kilpatrick, executive director of the Ohio Conference of the American Association of University Professors. 
“That is part of the ripple effect as well. We are going to lose faculty members. We’re going to see a decrease in research production at our institutions. … This is going to set back advancements in medicine, advancements, and all other kinds of fields potentially for decades.” 
More than 1,600 National Science Foundation grants totaling more than $1.5 billion in research investments have been eliminated since April, according to Grant Watch. 
National Institutes of Health cuts
Ohio’s seven Research 1 universities could lose more than $106 million through NIH cuts, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education. 

Ohio State University could lose nearly $50 million. 
Case Western Reserve University could lose nearly $39 million.
The University of Cincinnati could lose nearly $16 million. 
Kent State University could lose about $1 million.
Ohio University could lose about $662,000.
The University of Toledo could lose about $518,000.
The University of Dayton could lose $148,000 

“Recent federal government directives have had an immense impact on our university, especially on research funding and, consequently and unfortunately, on many teams,” Case Western Reserve University said in a statement. 
“We are grateful for the research support we receive from our federal partners as these investments literally save lives right here in Ohio,” said Ohio State Spokesperson Ben Johnson. “We are closely monitoring and managing federal notifications that have impacted a number of our faculty and laboratories.”
The NIH funding cuts were projected to be almost half a billion dollars in Ohio, Kilpatrick said. 
“Shutting down this money is going to have grave consequences,” she said. “It’s going to make not just Ohio weaker, but the entire country weaker because we have always been at the forefront of research development, of scientific discovery, so we are putting ourselves in a weaker position globally by having these kinds of research cuts.”
NASA and National Science Foundation funding 
Ohio State University’s Astronomy Chair Todd Thompson is waiting to see what will happen with the funding. 
“If those were to go forward, there would be very substantial reductions in our ability to get grants,” he said. “Those grants fund our graduate students, and they also fund some aspects of our undergraduate research program.”
The Ohio State Astronomy Department has 30 graduate students and slightly more than half of them are funded through federal grants, he said.  
“If you decrease that funding by a factor of three, then there you go,” Thompson said. “That would basically almost eliminate our ability to fund graduate students off of grants.”
Ohio State Spokesperson Chris Booker said “it would be premature to comment at this point in the process” when asked how these potential cuts could affect the astronomy department.
The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is the next flagship mission for NASA — something the Ohio State Astronomy Department is heavily involved in — but the White House’s proposed 2026 NASA budget would cut its funding in half. The telescope is almost fully built and is scheduled to launch in October 2026, Thompson said. 
“You have a mission that’s basically ready, you want to launch it, you want to get data,” he said. “You want to figure out new things about the universe. … The idea that it wouldn’t go forward, or that it would be very substantially hampered by a lower budget, by lower operating costs are all bad for science, all bad for training students in science.” 
The funding cuts would be devastating for all the astronomy programs across the country, Thompson said. 
“We would not be able to train students, which means that we would not be able to do as much research which means that we would not be putting in this steady pipeline of highly trained, very agile and very able students into the workforce to do these types of things, and we also would not produce the type of science that you see,” he said. 
That means the pace of new space discoveries — ranging from new galaxies to black holes — would substantially decrease, Thompson said. 
Scientific discoveries by Americans will slow down, said Ohio State Astronomy Professor David Weinberg. 
“Americans have become used to a steady stream of medical miracles that cure previously fatal diseases, advances in physics and chemistry that produce astonishing new technologies, and Nobel-Prize winning discoveries that rewrite our understanding of nature,” he said. “If things proceed along the administration’s proposed path, then that era is basically over.”

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)LAKE PROVIDENCE, La. — East Carroll Parish sits in the northeastern corner of the state along the winding Mississippi River. Its seat, Lake Providence, was a thriving agricultural center of the Delta. Now, the town is a shell of its former self. Charred and dilapidated buildings dot the small city center. There are a few gas stations, a handful of restaurants — and little to no industry.
Mayor Bobby Amacker, 79, says at one point “you couldn’t even walk down the street” in Lake Providence’s main business district because “there were so many people.”
“It’s gone down tremendously in the last 50 years,” said Amacker, a Democrat. “The town, it looks like it’s drying up. And it’s almost unstoppable, as far as I can tell.”
Now, East Carroll residents stand to lose even more. Like many people in Louisiana, they received a lifeline when the state expanded Medicaid to more low-income adults in 2016. Expansion drove Louisiana’s uninsured rate to the lowest in the Deep South, at 8% in 2023 for working-age adults, according to state data, despite it having the highest poverty rate in the U.S. that year.

This week, the U.S. Senate approved President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill. It includes more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint state-federal health insurance program for poor families and individuals, to help pay for tax cuts that mostly benefit the rich. The legislation would cause 11.8 million more Americans to become uninsured by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
The bill includes new work rules for Medicaid recipients and would require them to verify their eligibility more frequently. It also would limit a financing strategy that states have used to boost Medicaid payments to hospitals.
Republicans say enrollees are taking advantage of the Medicaid program and getting benefits when they shouldn’t be. They say the program costs too much and states are not paying their fair share.
The Delta region, which includes communities in both Louisiana and Mississippi, would suffer under such large cuts. But in Louisiana — where almost half of the state depended on Medicaid in 2023, the Louisiana Department of Health reported — the cuts could be ruinous. Louisiana could lose up to $35 billion in federal Medicaid support over the next decade, according to KFF, a health policy research group. Mississippi, which never expanded Medicaid, could still lose up to $5 billion.
Residents are watching with apprehension, fear and, sometimes, anger, wondering how Congress could be so blind to how much they are struggling.
“If they take that away from us and everyone that really needs it, that’s going to be bad,” said Sherila Ervin, who lives 20 minutes up the road from Lake Providence in Oak Grove and has Medicaid coverage.

Medicaid work requirements and other health care provisions in the bill ignore the reality of living in poorer rural communities, where people struggle to find the jobs, transportation and internet access required to meet the rules, according to interviews with people and providers in the Delta region.
Even though Louisiana and Mississippi have taken very different approaches to Medicaid — one expanded eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act and the other didn’t — both rely heavily on the program to sustain access to medical care for all their residents.
On a hot summer day in June, Ervin walks into the bare-bones 99-cent store in downtown Lake Providence. As she looks over some clothing, she says she’s heard about the potential Medicaid cuts. But she hadn’t heard about the work requirements, and is shocked they’re even on the table.
“I don’t like that. I don’t think they should put a stipulation on that,” Ervin says, exasperated that she would have to report her work hours. It’s hard enough as it is, she says, to thrive in this community.
In the Deep South, health care fights echo civil rights battles

Ervin, 58, has been working at Oak Grove High School in the cafeteria, serving hot plates to children for two decades. She says it’s one of the good, steady jobs available in this area, but her income is only around $1,500 per month.
Ervin’s job offers health benefits, but she can’t afford the premiums on her salary. She relies on Medicaid for care, including medications for her high blood pressure.
In East Carroll Parish, around 46.5% of people live below the poverty level, meaning the area is overwhelmingly poor, at over four times the national poverty rate, with a median income of $28,321. For Black households, the figure is a mere $16,690.
Expansion was a lifeline for people such as Ervin. Louisiana offers Medicaid to people who earn below 138% of the federal poverty line — currently about $22,000 a year for an individual.
“Sometimes you can work, but then when you work, you still can’t pay to get help,” Ervin said.
It’s a similar economic situation an hour away across the river. Poverty is about three times the national rate in Washington County, Mississippi, where residents in the city of Greenville lament the consequences of not being able to avoid destructive medical debt, which can keep them stuck in a cycle of gig work and of living paycheck to paycheck.
Greenville, the county seat, is among the fastest-shrinking cities in the U.S. It’s still one of the larger rural cities in Mississippi, with coffee shops, restaurants, hotels, a regional hospital and several big-box stores. But the downtown has just a few small businesses and a bank, and residents say jobs are hard to find.
Greenville resident April McNair, 45, remembers giving birth 17 years ago, long before Mississippi extended postpartum Medicaid to a full year. She had Medicaid coverage during pregnancy, but was kicked off shortly after giving birth, despite having post-delivery complications.

The result was a trip to the emergency room and a $2,500 bill she couldn’t cover. Right after giving birth, McNair looked for work. She said potential employers often told her that she was overqualified because she had a master’s degree.
“I had to kind of figure out how to make my ends meet,” McNair said. “I ended up with a significant bill, all because I did not have Medicaid.”
McNair feels like Mississippi leaders are making a mistake by continuing to reject full Medicaid expansion.
“That’s a selfish move. To me, they’re selfish,” McNair said, adding that now she’s worried for neighbors in Louisiana who may lose the lifeline she wishes she had.
“God forbid, hypothetically speaking, what if one of them meets their demise because of this bill that [Congress] passed?”
Hard to thrive
Mississippi experienced its first taste of equalized access to medicine in the late 1960s.
Delta Health Center, the first federally funded health center in the nation, opened during the peak of the Civil Rights Movement in the all-Black town of Mound Bayou, about an hour north of Greenville. The center vowed to care for anyone regardless of race or ability to pay in a region plagued with poverty, poor health and discrimination — and continues to do so to this day.
It was a significant opportunity for generations of African Americans who had gone without health care, in a place where people had no access to clean drinking water, running sewage systems or even food, said Robin Boyles, chief program planning and development officer at Delta Health Center.
But it wasn’t easy for the clinic to mobilize support, even though it was clearly needed. Before its opening, it faced pushback from politicians and even doctors. In a 1966 clipping from a local newspaper, the white-owned Bolivar Commercial, the editorial board railed against the new clinic, saying it would “lead further to socialized medicine.”

The situation is certainly better in Mississippi and Louisiana than it was in the 1960s, but critics say the Medicaid cuts could reverse hard-fought progress.
People who live in the Delta are fiercely proud of their communities, but conditions there make it hard to thrive.
Black residents, who are the overwhelming majority, have had a particularly hard time. After the Civil War, many were relegated to sharecropping of cotton and corn for subsistence. Meanwhile, an elite white class of plantation owners and investors amassed enormous amounts of wealth.
A 2001 report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights described the area as one with “limited economic resources; inadequate employment opportunities; insufficient decent, affordable housing; and poor quality public schools.”
“We have a lot of patients that are one health issue away from either being out of a job or being bankrupt because of a trip to the emergency room,” said Dr. Brent Smith, a physician at a primary care clinic at Delta Health System in Greenville.
Even some of the most vulnerable people, such as new moms in Mississippi, still struggle to get basic care, in part because the state has left billions of dollars in federal funding for Medicaid expansion on the table, said Dr. Lakeisha Richardson, an OB-GYN at Delta Health System.
“There are a lot of maternal [care] deserts in Mississippi where women have to travel 60 miles or more just to get prenatal care and just to get to the closest hospital for delivery,” Richardson said. “And I don’t see that getting any better in Mississippi and in rural areas.”
Richardson says nearly all her patients are working moms, many of whom would really benefit from having Medicaid expansion.
“America doesn’t realize that there are people out here struggling for no reason of their own,” she said.
That’s why Medicaid expansion in Louisiana in 2016, much like the community health center movement in Mississippi, was a bright spot in the rural South, said Smith.
“Louisiana expanded Medicaid, a surprising move in the South to see any state expand,” Smith said. “They saw it for what it was, which was a very real opportunity to assist this specific group of patients.”

In Mississippi, 20 rural hospitals are at immediate risk of closure, according to a recent report, more than double the number at risk in Louisiana. In many cases, Medicaid is the largest and most reliable payer for rural hospitals. While Louisiana’s overall uninsured rate plummeted to 8.3% by 2023, in Mississippi it was 10.5%.
“Unlike a lot of our Southern peers, we have not had the same level of closures of facilities,” said Courtney Foster, senior policy adviser for Medicaid, with the nonprofit Invest in Louisiana.
“Medicaid was like a real lifeline for people in transition. Oftentimes it was people who had lost their jobs and were just looking to get back on their feet.”
Now, the new work and reporting requirements could put that progress at risk.
In East Carroll Parish, finding a job — let alone a good-paying one with health benefits — is difficult, says Rosie Brown, executive director at the East Carroll Community Action Agency, a nonprofit that helps low-income people with their rent and utility bills. Many of the jobs available in town pay minimum wage, just $7.25 an hour.

Brown loves living in Lake Providence; this is where her family is. She doesn’t want to move but wishes the government would invest more in her community — not take away benefits that help people who are hanging on by a thread.
“We have one bank. We have one supermarket,” she said. “Transportation isn’t easy either.”
Local infrastructure is so limited, she’s even heard of some people charging residents $20 for a ride to Walmart. Some people have to hitch a ride an hour away to go to work, she said.
“There’s nowhere to go,” Brown said.
Dominique Jones works at the local library, where she helps roughly 75 to 85 people per month apply for programs such as Medicaid and food assistance. Many of the residents she helps don’t have access to the internet or even a computer, a real barrier for people who’d be required to report their working hours to state Medicaid officials.
“This town right here is made up of a lot of old people that need Medicaid and Medicare. And without it, they wouldn’t have any kind of health care at all,” Mayor Amacker said.
Even a job in local government in Lake Providence doesn’t offer affordable health insurance.
Nevada Qualls, 25, sits across from Amacker’s office. She earns just $12 an hour as a cashier at city hall. The low pay means she qualifies for Medicaid expansion coverage, which is good because she can’t afford the premiums for private insurance.
“I feel like there should be a higher threshold for people that can get Medicaid, because they’re still struggling,” she said.
At the 99-cent store, school district worker Ervin wonders whether state and federal leaders understand what it’s like to live in her community, urging them to visit and see for themselves.
“They want to do stuff for the rich people that’s already rich,” she said. “What are they doing? It’s almost like there’s no common sense with them.”
‘The tremble factors’
While leaders in the U.S. Senate were working into the night this past weekend debating Trump’s tax and spending bill, Greenville resident Jennifer Morris was praying for the pain to stay away.
Morris, 44, has hemicrania continua, a headache disorder that causes constant pain on one side of her head. There’s no underlying trigger and no cure. Her doctors help her keep the pain to a minimum with regular treatments that include dozens of injections into her head.
“It doesn’t take the pain away,” she said during a late-night gathering in Greenville’s Greater Mount Olivet Missionary Baptist Church in June. “It does reduce the pain so that I’m able to function. But it’s rough.”

Morris is worried about the looming Medicaid cuts. She qualifies for Mississippi Medicaid because her condition counts as a disability, and she depends on the coverage to afford her medications.
Morris’ Medicaid may be safer than that of her Delta neighbors in Lake Providence, as some of the most dramatic Medicaid changes being considered — such as work requirements — target Medicaid expansion states only.
But Mississippi could be hurt by a provision in the Senate bill that would target a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government.
Mississippi could see a major hit to its Medicaid funds, which “would be a tremendous decrease in revenue for the state,” harming “services and access to care,” says Mitchell Adcock, executive director at the Center for Mississippi Health Policy.
“It would be just the opposite of expansion. It would be a contraction for the Medicaid program in the state,” he said.
Leonard Favorite, a pastor who was attending the same event at Mount Olivet Church, as Morris, says he grew up on a plantation in Louisiana and worked his way out of poverty by joining the Air Force. This type of journey is hard, he said, when you’re already starting from so far behind. He thinks the “big, beautiful bill” will create more roadblocks for poor people.
Glaucoma-related vision loss is often preventable, but many can’t afford treatment

“You have people who are already living below the poverty line and they will certainly be submerged into poverty at unspeakable levels,” said Favorite, 70.“ That seems to be the trend of this administration from the point of view of looking from the outside.
“Poor people are beginning to feel the tremble factors of an administration that caters toward the rich.”
National researchers estimate that up to 132,000 Louisianans who gained health insurance under expansion could lose it under work rules.
But national reports that rely on census data likely underestimate the potential Medicaid losses. For example, while 2023 census data show 47% of East Carroll Parish was on Medicaid, state health data reviewed by Stateline and Public Health Watch suggests the number is more like 64%. Similarly statewide, census data showed about a third of Louisianans were on Medicaid. State data shows that percentage is closer to 46.5%.
Experts such as Joan Alker at the Georgetown Center for Children and Families say the undercounts nationally are a well-known issue among researchers, but it’s difficult to correct because the quality of state reporting can be so uneven.
State Medicaid funding is also at risk. For years, both Mississippi and Louisiana have relied on revenue generated through a financing tool — known as a provider tax — to draw down more federal dollars and boost Medicaid reimbursements to providers. But congressional Republicans hope to limit states’ ability to collect those taxes.
Depending on how Congress restricts provider taxes, Mississippi could lose hundreds of millions in federal Medicaid funding, crucial in a state with such a high uninsured rate, said Richard Roberson, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association.
“It’s unavoidable that when you’re taking that much money out of the system, that there’s not going to be some repercussions felt even in non-Medicaid expansion states like Mississippi,” Roberson said.
Last week, the Louisiana Hospital Association signed a statement calling the package of Medicaid cuts before Congress “historic in their devastation.”

Newton, who grew up one parish over in West Carroll, is executive director of the Family Medical Clinic, a community health center in Lake Providence and one of the few health providers in town. She says 50% of the clinic’s patients have Medicaid insurance.
Newton has worked in health care in the area for decades and watched as Medicaid expansion made it possible for more patients to access and afford health care they desperately needed, including preventive services. “It’s absolutely helped,” she said. “Absolutely.”
In 2015, the year before Louisiana expanded Medicaid, the uninsured rate among working-age adults in East Carroll Parish was nearly 35%. By 2021, that number was 12.7%.
“Why are we going back?” Newton asked. “We’ve made so much progress.”
Republican supporters of work requirements, including Louisiana representative and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, argue they will encourage people to find jobs and ensure Medicaid goes to people who need it most. But according to KFF, a majority of Louisiana adults with Medicaid — 69% — already work.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, is not concerned about eligible people losing coverage, as has happened under previous work requirement efforts. He says the bill has built in exceptions for certain people and requirements “can be met by not just work,” so “concerns seem pretty overstated.”
Medicaid recipients also can meet the requirement by volunteering or attending school for 80 hours per month.
“It’s hard for me to understand that there are areas in the country where there’s not jobs. There’s always work to be done,” Blase told Stateline. Blase said he believes Medicaid is “the government conditioning welfare for able-bodied working-age adults.”
But advocates and experts predict East Carroll, where internet access is notoriously bad, would experience results similar to when Arkansas instituted Medicaid work requirements in 2018: People disenrolled because of lack of awareness and confusion over the policy, as well as paperwork errors — not because they weren’t working enough.
“Unless the beneficiary can navigate that red tape, they’re going to lose coverage and become uninsured,” said Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
Data shows Arkansas’ experiment did not increase employment, Sommers said, and instead led to more people reporting medical debt and delaying care because of cost.
‘Take a step back’
People in the Delta — where the legacy of government neglect and discrimination are all around — want politicians to visit their towns and see the barriers people face trying to improve their lives and stay healthy.
“People spent their lives uninsured,” said Amy Hale, a nurse practitioner at East Carroll Medical clinic. “Medicaid expansion allowed them to get in here and be treated.”
Lake Providence residents are scared they may find themselves in a similar situation as McNair and other people across the river in Greenville: working, uninsured, and too poor to access health care.
Recent estimates show up to 317,000 Louisianans could lose Medicaid health insurance under Trump’s tax bill. Nearly 33,000 in Mississippi.
“People are actually trying,” McNair said. “I really wish [lawmakers] would look at it from a different lens. What if it was their kid? Or they didn’t have the salaries they have now and your baby is ill. … Like really take a step back and think about what it is that you’re doing.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)In 1996, women from both sides of the strife tearing apart Northern Ireland, then divided along ethno-nationalist lines, formed a political party to advocate for inclusion and human rights in upcoming peace talks. Only the top 10 vote-getting parties would be part of the talks. Though they organized only six weeks in advance of the election, the women’s party came in ninth out of 24.
Their remarkable success was attributed to keeping their message simple: inclusion, human rights and equality. They also urged “transversal politics,” meaning members could keep their own identity and views on various issues while respecting those of others to advance their common goal of having a voice at the table. Their slogan was “Wave Goodbye to Dinosaurs.”
The No Kings movement could learn from those Irish women.
I consider myself part of the No Kings movement. I call it a movement because movements are collective efforts by a group of people to bring about or resist social or political change.
There were eight marches to protest the values and policies of the Trump Administration in my small state of Rhode Island on June 14, which just so happened to be Flag Day.
That day, tens of thousands of people showed up for marches in New York, New Jersey and Southern California. Estimates overall suggest millions of people participated in marches across the United States. Photos of the demonstrations show some marchers waved U.S. flags, but the flags of other nations appeared as well.
Consequently, the simple message conveyed by the name of the No Kings movement can get lost in the many messages that accompany and are associated with the movement. Frankly, it needs better organizational goals and marketing.
As a female academic teaching security studies in professional military education for 20-plus years, the importance of “reading the room” and consequently properly “selling your message” to the audience cannot be overstated. What will make them listen? What will shut them down? The same is true for the growing numbers of Trump supporters who are disappointed — and frightened by — the actions of an increasingly authoritarian regime. Latino voters who helped Trump retake the White House, for example, are falling away, as are low-information voters, rural voters, young adults and ethnic voters. But they will not be lured to a movement that often conveys mixed messages through its rhetoric and images. The message ought to be of a tolerant, diverse, united America. But that’s not always the case.










The simple message conveyed by the name of the No Kings movement can get lost in the many messages that accompany and are associated with the movement. Frankly, it needs better organizational goals and marketing.


The Fourth of July is the perfect opportunity to do better.
Rather than showing up at rallies and parades with flags from other countries and symbols of political causes, No Kings supporters should show up with American flags. Diversity makes America great, and a sea of diverse individuals all waving the same flag shows a united front. All Americans are Irish on St. Patrick’s Day, and all Americans are Mexican on Cinco de Mayo. Now all Americans and those who want to live in an American democracy need to show their support for American democracy when trying to stop an autocracy. “Make America Great Again” Trumpians have usurped the America flag as their own but abandoned American values. The No Kings movement needs to embrace and retake the American flag as its own, as a symbol of American democracy and values.
Further, rather than glorifying individuals who have been unjustly attacked after they exercised their constitutional rights to, for example, free speech — some of whom are themselves divisive for their political views — simply support the right to free speech, as well as freedoms like religion and assembly. Don’t give Trumpians the opportunity to distort the important message of the No Kings movement into one of a hyper-radicalized left where individuals can’t even get along with each other. For the movement to grow, it must attract diverse individuals who can tip the scales away from authoritarianism. It must give all individuals a safe and welcoming place to go.
And while many individuals are rightly afraid of their rights being abused by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or some other form of retribution, individuals can be identified with or without a mask if the government is determined to do so. Pictures of individuals who show up at rallies or parades wearing masks and waving flags from other countries quickly become headline news or click bait for right-wing media. That does not serve the movement well.
We are living in an era of normalized chaos, deliberately created to allow autocracy to take hold. The No Kings movement clearly shows there is opposition. Movements can learn from the success and failure of others. No Kings should take an organizational and marketing lesson from the women of Northern Ireland.

North Carolina First Lady Anna Stein joined social justice advocate Kerwin Pittman on Wednesday to unveil the state’s second mobile Recidivism Reduction Center, expanding an effort to support people leaving prison as they transition back into society. 
The center is run by Recidivism Reduction Educational Program Services (RREPS), the nonprofit Pittman founded after his own experience with incarceration. In just 70 days, the group’s first mobile center has served more than 3,000 people in three cities — a pace Pittman said reflects both the urgency of the need and the effectiveness of the model. 
“Too many people have fallen through the cracks and aren’t given a second chance,” Pittman told attendees. “We’re here to change that.” 
The mobile centers — housed in customized RVs — provide case management and a suite of wraparound services, including job placement, housing assistance, mental health support, and help obtaining important documents like identification. The goal is to reduce recidivism by meeting people’s basic needs in the critical days and weeks after they leave prison. 
About 95% of people in North Carolina prisons will eventually be released, and studies show the first 72 hours after release are particularly high-risk, with many struggling to find stable housing, employment, or healthcare. 
First Lady Stein, a member of the state’s Joint Reentry Council, praised the initiative for addressing those challenges head-on. 
“Communities benefit when all residents can achieve their goals,” she said. “This work helps build safer, stronger communities by giving people the support they need to succeed.” 
North Carolina is among a half-dozen states participating in Reentry 2030, a national initiative aimed at improving reentry outcomes by the end of the decade. 
The state’s Joint Reentry Council — made up of government agencies, nonprofit groups, and directly impacted individuals — has identified reducing barriers to housing, employment, and health care as key priorities. 
RREPS opened its first mobile center in January. The vehicles are equipped with computers, private meeting space, and intake systems to connect clients with services. The organization’s goal is to deploy mobile units across the state to serve people in both urban and rural areas who might otherwise lack access to reentry support. 
Pittman said the centers are also designed to break down silos between service providers and ensure formerly incarcerated people aren’t left navigating a complex system alone. 
“Our mission is simple,” he said. “Nobody should be defined by their worst mistake.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1819-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-03 05:02:22.039483
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-03 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT Rail, Metro-North fares set to rise by 10%",Janhavi Munde,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/03/ct-rail-metro-north-transit-fares-rising/,The DOT said the hike is needed to fill a gap between how much money the agency requested for rail services and what the CT budget included.,"Connecticut is planning to raise fares on Metro-North Railroad and CT Rail transit throughout the state later this year in order to cover the increased cost of operating rail services.
Fares are slated to rise by 5% beginning Sept. 1, and another 5% on July 1, 2026. That means a rush-hour one-way trip between New Haven and Stamford on Metro-North, for example, would rise from $8.75 to $9.50 by July of next year. An off-peak one-way trip between Hartford and New Haven on CT Rail would rise from $8.25 to $8.75, and a one-way trip from Stamford to Grand Central Terminal on Metro-North during peak hours would rise from $16 to $17.75 by this time next year. 
Officials with the state Department of Transportation said the fare increase was necessary to keep the trains running.
“The cost to operate the existing level of service has increased year over year,” said Dan Baker, a transportation supervising planner with the department during a public meeting in Stamford on fare increases. “So in order to maintain the current level of trains and rail service and account for rising costs, fares needed to increase to offset a funding gap.”

DOT had requested $327 million from the state to cover the cost of rail services in fiscal year 2026, which began July 1, but the legislature’s budget only included $316 million. The increase in fares will make up for that gap, officials said.
Connecticut last increased fares in 2023 when the Hartford line, New Haven line and Shore Line East faced a 4.5% increase. Before that, fares had stayed the same since 2018.
Baker said even with the planned increases this year and next, inflation will still have surpassed rail fare increases. Since 2018, inflation has driven up consumer prices by approximately 28%, whereas by 2026 rail fares will have increased by 14% to 15%, according to DOT data.
Fares account for roughly half of Metro-North’s operating costs, but a far smaller slice — less than 10% — of the Hartford and Shore Line East rail lines’ operating costs. Most of the rest of the funding comes from the state.
Many lines faced service and funding cuts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ridership has rebounded unevenly across lines since then. 
Over that same period, the state has invested in new transportation and development projects, like the WALK rail bridge spanning the Norwalk River, and the Connecticut River bridge connecting Old Saybrook and Old Lyme.

Commuters’ concern
Some commuters expressed opposition to the state’s plan to raise fares, noting problems with the current service, including its delayed restoration after the Covid cutbacks, and general frustration about the rising cost of living throughout the state.
Susan Feaster, a frequent commuter on Shore Line East rail, said riders shouldn’t be on the hook for the state not fully funding rail transit. “Fare increases are never good, and doing a complete 10% by next year is a lot,” said Feaster, who also founded the Shore Line East Riders Advocacy Group in 2018.
Feaster said lawmakers boosted funding for child care and education in the coming biennium budget, which will enable many parents to work. “But you know, they should probably put some of that money into mass transit to help the people trying to get to work to pay those taxes, right?” she said.
Jim Gildea, Chairman of the Connecticut Public Transportation Council, said, “While I recognize the necessity of increasing rail rates and the fact it’s been a while since the last increase, I have serious reservations about raising bus and transit fares.” (Currently, bus fares aren’t slated to increase, though the Governor proposed bus fare hikes earlier this year.)
“These services are vital for many individuals facing economic challenges, and now may not be the right time to impose additional financial burdens on them,” he said.
DOT officials said they performed a service and fare equity analysis to assess the effects fare increases would have on low-income and minority customers. “We found that the proposed fare increases for 2025 and 2026 for Hartford line, Shoreline east and New Haven line do not have a disparate impact on minority customers, nor a disproportionate burden on low income customers, whether analyzed individually or in aggregate,” Baker said.

DOT held several public meetings to hear concerns from riders about the fare increases, but turnout was low. In Stamford last Monday, two residents attended. In New Haven last Tuesday, only one resident was there. And in Hartford last Thursday, only a small handful of residents were present.
Jon Bonci, a CT Rail passenger who attended the Hartford event, said he wasn’t confident his presence would change the state’s plans. “We’re gonna have to pay it, so what can you do? It doesn’t matter what we say in the public hearing,” he said.
Stamford resident Nicole Howerton expressed concern at the DOT’s public meeting at the Ferguson Public Library there. 
“As a resident of Stamford and a sole [commuter] for my family, it plays a major role in being able to get around and enjoy the community,” Howerton said. “When we’re presenting an increase of some nature, we need to look at the schedule and see if and how that’s meeting the community.”
A frequent commuter through the Metro-North’s West Haven station, she added that when rail service is down she has to take Ubers, which is another additional cost. 
Chris Irby, the only registered speaker at the New Haven public meeting, pointed to Bridgeport as an urban area that would be significantly affected by the fare hikes. As a Bridgeport resident and a frequent commuter, he said that Bridgeport residents already struggle to find money for the fares.
“Bridgeport is not a business city like New Haven is,” Irby said. “Everybody has to take the train to go to other towns, to go to work.” 
Irby also called on DOT to do a better job of advertising the events, stating that he would like to see more of DOT’s presence and advertising in downtown New Haven.
The department held additional public hearings virtually on June 30 and July 1. Commissioner Garrett Eucalitto will consider public comments through July 6, via email to dot.proposedtransitchanges@ct.gov or by leaving a voicemail at (860) 594-3612. DOT will take all comments into consideration before finalizing the proposed fare changes, officials said.

A study released this week by researchers at NC State University highlights the destructive impact that a bill sent to Gov. Stein by the General Assembly last week will have on electric ratepayers.
The bill, which bears the inaccurate and misleading title “Power Bill Reduction Act,” would repeal a bipartisan 2021 law that committed our state to reducing greenhouse gas emissions 70 percent by the year 2030, as we move to achieve carbon neutrality by mid-century.
If the proposal were only about the environmental damage it will likely cause it would be bad enough, but as the NC State professors found, the bill will also significantly increase electricity bills for average households.
This is because it will incentivize Duke Energy to build more natural gas-fired electric generation plants—the price of natural gas is notoriously volatile—and shift the allocation of fuel costs from industrial to residential customers.
The bottom line: A bill this bad for consumers and the environment is richly deserving of a gubernatorial veto.

The people behind state programs that are supposed to create jobs aren’t taking credit for Ohio’s relatively high jobless rate. 
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on June 24 released May unemployment rates. Ohio tied with Rhode Island for the fifth-highest rate at 4.9%. Exceeding them were Kentucky, at 5%, California, at 5.3%, Michigan, at 5.4% and Nevada, at 5.5%.
Ohio had the nation’s sixth-highest unemployment rate in April. 
Ohio near the top in April unemployment 

Those jobless rates come despite a long history of state lawmakers and political leaders foregoing huge amounts of tax revenue on the argument that giving wealthy people and businesses tax breaks and other perks will prompt them to make new investments and create jobs.
For example, under the guidance of then-Gov. John Kasich, Ohio in 2013 created the LLC tax break, allowing people to incorporate as “pass through” entities and avoid a big portion of state income tax.
The tax break costs the state about $1 billion a year, and there’s little evidence that it’s done much in the way of create jobs. 
Ohio’s non-farm employment in December 2023 was 112.3% of its 2010 level, according to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. That lags the national average of 121.2% by nearly nine percentage points.
Meanwhile, the group of Ohioans already doing the best have done well under the LLC tax break. Policy Matters of Ohio in 2022 reported that the top 7% claiming qualifying business income in 2020 received 39% of the overall value of the tax break — about $390 million.
Despite the fact that the LLC loophole hasn’t lived up to its promises, the Ohio legislature hasn’t repealed it.
Around the same time that program was created, the Kasich administration also led the way in creating JobsOhio. Even though it was created by the legislature and was given a deal to lease the state’s liquor franchise, the Ohio Supreme Court has allowed it to operate as a “private” corporation, exempting it from Ohio’s open-records laws. 
The agency has spent more than $1 billion in what used to be state money, providing much of it to wealthy corporations in the form of incentives to locate or expand in Ohio, or at least not to leave. 
Research has shown that such incentives rarely play a deciding role in businesses’ strategic decisions. And JobsOhio has struggled to produce data that show it has improved the state’s employment picture.
How does JobsOhio stack up? Don’t ask them

Asked if Ohio’s relatively high unemployment rate reflected poorly on the work of his agency, spokesman Matt Englehart said it would be even worse — if not for JobsOhio.
“Much of the current unemployment is the result of federal layoffs and their ripple effects,” he said in an email. “Because of Ohio’s large number of federal workers, those federal layoffs could have created a severe shock to Ohio’s economy. Still, unemployment is only slightly elevated because of JobsOhio’s focus on industrial diversity. We focus on growing 10 sectors of Ohio’s economy, accounting for 22% of jobs, 29% of payroll, and 36% of Ohio’s gross state product.”
Ohio’s per-capita federal workforce isn’t all that big, according to a March report by Columbus-based Scioto Analysis. With 10 federal employees per 1,000 workers, Ohio tied with seven other states for the 26th-highest rate of federal employees.
Englehart didn’t furnish any data showing that JobsOhio has diminished the state’s unemployment rate.
“While JobsOhio does not directly impact month-to-month swings in preliminary data, we are investing aggressively for the long term to build a highly diverse, resilient economy across strategic industries,” he said.
Despite questions about its efficacy, Gov. Mike DeWine and legislative leaders in February extended JobsOhio’s control of the liquor franchise for an additional 15 years — until 2053. And while JobsOhio agreed to pay the state $1.41 billion for its initial lease, it wasn’t required to pay anything for its lucrative extension.
DeWine this week signed another windfall to the wealthiest Ohioans that was pitched as a way to help the economy. The now flat, 2.75% state income tax was touted as an “economic driver” by Ohio Senate Republicans.
But Policy Matters Ohio said it will cost $1.1 billion a year and the wealthiest 20% of households — those making more than $138,000 a year — will reap 96% of the benefit.

And Ohio is giving up tax revenue as President Donald Trump appears poised to slash Medicaid and food assistance to the poor. Ohio would have to fill those gaps or see hundreds of thousands lose health care and go hungry, advocates say. In addition, the cuts could plunge the economy into recession, depressing state tax collections as it voluntarily foregoes part of them.
DeWine’s office was asked, in light of Ohio’s relatively high unemployment, if it was wise to keep creating windfalls for the richest people in the state. It didn’t respond.

Mike DeWine to pursue the unemployment compensation he turned down during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Attorneys challenging the state believe there could be as much as $900 million available in unclaimed benefits. They filed a motion Wednesday asking the court to compel DeWine to “take all action necessary” to reclaim those funds within the next five days.

Background
In 2020 and 2021, the federal government offered supplemental benefits worth a couple hundred dollars a week. Nervous those extra dollars were keeping workers on the sidelines, DeWine chose to forgo the added benefits. Thirteen other Republican governors did the same.
DeWine’s announcement came in May of 2021, and a group of Ohio residents including Candy Bowling challenged the move in court.
The trial court turned them down, but the appeals court took a different tack. The judges determined state law requiring the governor “secure” for residents “all available advantages” applies to the supplemental benefits.
The dispute wound its way to the state supreme court later that year. The justices rejected bids to fast-track a decision, and eventually dismissed the cause as moot in a single sentence decision in November 2022.
In a follow up filing, attorneys for the governor asked the justices to be more specific. They argued the court’s order should explicitly vacate the appeals court decision putting supplemental benefits under the umbrella of “all available advantages.”
Ohio workers want court to order Gov. DeWine to protect unused unemployment funds

The Ohio Supreme Court declined.
“In light of this ambiguity,” the trial court decided, it would interpret the Supreme Court’s decision narrowly. Instead of applying to any challenge of the governor’s action, the court determined it only related to requests for “a court order enjoining the State of Ohio from prematurely terminating participation” in the program.
The case demanding the governor seek out the benefits he turned down was allowed to continue. In those proceedings, the parties brought forward an email from a Department of Labor official explaining states that initially turned down benefits are welcome to change their mind and laying out the procedures they would have to follow.
As recently as July 2024, the same official stated those policies remain in effect.
With that in mind, the trial court decided DeWine should try to claim benefits on behalf of Ohioans. The governor appealed, arguing the Ohio Supreme Court already settled this case and it’s unlikely those unemployment dollars are still out their waiting.
“We disagree on both points,” the Tenth Circuit judges wrote Monday.
The decision and reactions
Writing for a unanimous appeals court panel, Judge Shawn Dingus noted the Supreme Court never got at the merits of the case.
“A dismissal based on mootness is not a judgment on the merits,” Dingus wrote.
“Accordingly,” he continued, “the Supreme Court’s dismissal of (the case) as moot resolved only one issue: whether Bowling’s motions for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction presented a justiciable controversy at the time of its decision.”
Because the appeals court determined way back in 2021 that state law does compel the governor to pursue the supplemental benefits, and because the Supreme Court didn’t make a peep about it, that decision still holds.
As for DeWine’s argument that the case is moot because those unemployment funds are likely gone, Dingus said that’s not good enough.
“None of those reasons establish that recovery is impossible,” Dingus wrote. “Under the proper standard of possibility rather than substantial likelihood of recovery, Bowling’s action is not moot.”
In an email, a DeWine spokesman said simply, “We have no comment at this time as the appeals process continues.”

Attorney Marc Dann, the Democratic former Attorney General representing Ohioans seeking benefits, hailed the ruling a “landmark” decision.
“We are gratified that the Court has affirmed the rights of Ohio workers and families who were unjustly denied critical pandemic relief,” Dann said in a press release. “This decision is a victory for the rule of law and for the thousands of Ohioans who continue to struggle with the economic fallout of COVID-19.”
He went on to note any chance to recoup that lost funding is “especially important” in light legislation at the state and federal level reducing food assistance and other safety net programs.
“Injecting up to $3,000 into 300,000 working class households will temporarily take the sting out of those cuts,” Dann argued.

Jerry Moran’s post-passage statement relies on narrow, legalistic arguments to pitch a package that will harm the state he purports to represent. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)Here is what we know: The gargantuan budget reconciliation package making its way through Congress will kick thousands of Kansans off Medicaid and cost the state’s hospitals billions of dollars.
Here’s something else we know: U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, doesn’t deny those facts.
But he still voted for the bill.
Moran issued a statement after the Senate voted for President Donald Trump’s “one big, beautiful bill” early Tuesday. What’s remarkable about the senator’s words are not what they say, but what they don’t say.
I encourage everyone to take a look at the text. Here’s an enlightening paragraph.
“As this legislation was being drafted, I worked to make certain hospitals in Kansas were at the forefront of these discussions. After numerous discussions with Kansas hospital leaders, my colleagues and Administrator Oz, I was able to make changes to the legislation to make certain Kansas hospitals will not face any immediate cuts upon enactment of this legislation.”
Notice, again, what Moran omits. He doesn’t deny that Kansas hospitals will face cuts. He can’t, because he knows they will. Instead, he says they won’t face any immediate cuts.
That’s like saying I don’t face an immediate risk of death from the train hurtling toward my stalled car on the tracks. I might feel fine in the moment, but I’ll be squashed in no time.
Moran goes on:
“These provisions will protect Kansas’ ability to continue pursuing its application for increased Medicaid payments for certain providers. This change ensures that as state directed payments wind down, Kansas providers will be starting at a higher percentage of enhanced payments buying them much-needed time to utilize federal dollars as payments are reduced.”
Notice how many conditionals have been piled into this paragraph. Kansas can “continue pursuing” an application for increased payments. That doesn’t mean the state is going to actually receive such payments. And who will those increased payments go to? Well, certain providers.  That doesn’t mean everyone.
And what’s with the “much-needed time”? It’s much needed because, as Moran says later in the sentence, payments will be reduced. All of this should raise the eyebrows of critical readers. Why shouldn’t Moran support the enhanced payments and oppose the other cuts? I think that “R” after his name might provide a clue.
“I also secured a one-year delay in the implementation of reductions to state directed payments to give Kansas providers more time to access these resources. Finally, I pushed for the establishment of a rural provider fund to aid rural hospitals facing significant financial challenges. These changes and investments, along with tax cuts for Kansas families, will bolster our economy and strengthen the safety of our nation.”
Yes, the legislation passed by the U.S. Senate includes a $50 billion fund for rural hospitals. However, it’s worth digging into the details. That money will be paid out over five years and available to all 50 states. Given that Kansas hospitals will experience a $2.65 billion drop over 10 years, basic math suggests that that federal money won’t go far enough.
Finally, it’s important to note two items that Moran’s statement leaves out entirely.
He does not call the piece of legislation the “one big, beautiful bill.” He instead refers to it as “Senate budget reconciliation legislation.” The senator apparently wants to distance himself from Trump and any bombast surrounding this package. However, he still voted for it.
Most disappointingly, Moran makes no mention whatsoever of the 13,000 Kansans who will lose insurance coverage through this package. Indeed, he does not mention Medicaid recipients a single time in his statement.
Farmers, yes. The border, yes. Air traffic controllers, sure.
But poor people who need health insurance? Nah.
Moran has built a lot of goodwill across Kansas. His prairie pragmatism still contrasts positively to the MAGA theatrics of U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall. But that post-passage statement relies on narrow, legalistic arguments to pitch a package that will harm the state he purports to represent.
Real people’s lives and communities are on the line here. Trump’s administration has asked lawmakers to play reverse Robin Hood, snatching benefits from the poor to benefit the rich.
All the carefully tailored language in the world won’t change that.

The 1925 Scopes trial, in which a Dayton, Tennessee, teacher was charged with violating state law by teaching biological evolution, was one of the earliest and most iconic conflicts in America’s ongoing culture war.
Charles Darwin’s “Origin of Species,” published in 1859, and subsequent scientific research made the case that humans and other animals evolved from earlier species over millions of years. Many late-19th-century American Protestants had little problem accommodating Darwin’s ideas – which became mainstream biology – with their religious commitments.
But that was not the case with all Christians, especially conservative evangelicals, who held that the Bible is inerrant – without error – and factually accurate in all that it has to say, including when it speaks on history and science.
The Scopes trial occurred July 10-21, 1925. Between 150 and 200 reporters swooped into the small town. Broadcast on Chicago’s WGN, it was the first trial to be aired live over radio in the United States.
One hundred years after the trial, and as we have documented in our scholarly work, the culture war over evolution and creationism remains strong – and yet, when it comes to creationism, much has also changed.
 The trial

In May 1919, over 6,000 conservative Protestants gathered in Philadelphia to create, under the leadership of Baptist firebrand William Bell Riley, the World’s Christian Fundamentals Association, or WCFA.
Holding to biblical inerrancy, these “fundamentalists” believed in the creation account detailed in chapter 1 of Genesis, in which God brought all life into being in six days. But most of these fundamentalists also accepted mainstream geology, which held that the Earth was millions of years old. Squaring a literal understanding of Genesis with an old Earth, they embraced either the “day-age theory” – that each Genesis day was actually a long period of time – or the “gap theory,” in which there was a huge gap of time before the six 24-hour days of creation.
This nascent fundamentalist movement initiated a campaign to pressure state legislatures to prohibit public schools from teaching evolution. One of these states was Tennessee, which in 1925 passed the Butler Act. This law made it illegal for public schoolteachers “to teach any theory that denies the story of divine creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals.”
The American Civil Liberties Union persuaded John Thomas Scopes, a young science teacher in Dayton, Tennessee, to challenge the law in court. The WCFA sprang into action, successfully persuading William Jennings Bryan – populist politician and outspoken fundamentalist – to assist the prosecution. In response, the ACLU hired famous attorney Clarence Darrow to serve on the defense team.

When the trial started, Dayton civic leaders were thrilled with the opportunity to boost their town. Outside the courtroom there was a carnivalesque atmosphere, with musicians, preachers, concession stands and even monkeys.
Inside the courtroom, the trial became a verbal duel between Bryan and Darrow regarding science and religion. But as the judge narrowed the proceedings to whether or not Scopes violated the law – a point that the defense readily admitted – it seemed clear that Scopes would be found guilty. Many of the reporters thus went home.
But the trial’s most memorable episode was yet to come. On July 20, Darrow successfully provoked Bryan to take the witness stand as a Bible expert. Due to the huge crowd and suffocating heat, the judge moved the trial outdoors.
The 3,000 or so spectators witnessed Darrow’s interrogation of Bryan, which was primarily intended to make Bryan and fundamentalism appear foolish and ignorant. Most significant, Darrow’s questions revealed that, despite Bryan’s’ assertion that he read the Bible literally, Bryan actually understood the six days of Genesis not as 24-hour days, but as six long and indeterminate periods of time.

The very next day, the jury found Scopes guilty and fined him US$100. Riley and the fundamentalists cheered the verdict as a triumph for the Bible and morality.
 The fundamentalists and ‘The Genesis Flood’

But very soon that sense of triumph faded, partly because of news stories that portrayed fundamentalists as ignorant rural bigots. In one such example, a prominent journalist, H. L. Mencken, wrote in a Baltimore Sun column that the Scopes trial “serves notice on the country that Neanderthal man is organizing in these forlorn backwaters of the land.”
The media ridicule encouraged many scholars and journalists to conclude that creationism and fundamentalism would soon disappear from American culture. But that prediction did not come to pass.
Instead, fundamentalists, including WCFA leader Riley, seemed all the more determined to redouble their efforts at the grassroots level.
But as Darrow’s interrogation of Bryan made obvious, it was not easy to square a literal reading of the Bible – including the six-day creation outlined in Genesis – with a scientific belief in an old Earth. What fundamentalists needed was a science that supported the idea of a young Earth.
In their 1961 book, “The Genesis Flood: The Biblical Record and its Scientific Implications, fundamentalists John Whitcomb, a theologian, and Henry Morris, a hydraulic engineer, provided just such a scientific explanation. Making use, without attribution, of the writings of Seventh-day Adventist geologist George McCready Price, Whitcomb and Morris made the case that Noah’s global flood lasted one year and created the geological strata and mountain ranges that made the Earth seem ancient.
“The Genesis Flood” and its version of flood geology remains ubiquitous among fundamentalists and other conservative Protestants.
 Young Earth creationism

Today, opinion polls reveal that roughly one-quarter of all Americans are adherents of this newer strand of creationism, which rejects both mainstream geology as well as mainstream biology.

This popular embrace of young Earth creationism also explains the success of Answers in Genesis – AiG – which is the world’s largest creationist organization, with a website that attracts millions of visitors every year.
AiG’s tourist sites – the Creation Museum in Petersburg, Kentucky, and the Ark Encounter in Williamstown, Kentucky – have attracted millions of visitors since their opening in 2007 and 2016. Additional AiG sites are planned for Branson, Missouri, and Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.
Presented as a replica of Noah’s Ark, the Ark Encounter is a gigantic structure – 510 feet long, 85 feet wide, 51 feet high. It includes representations of animal cages as well as plush living quarters for the eight human beings who, according to Genesis chapters 6-8, survived the global flood. Hundreds of placards in the Ark make the case for a young Earth and a global flood that created the geological strata and formations we see today.
Ark Encounter has been the beneficiary of millions of dollars from state and local governments.
Besides AiG tourist sites, there is also an ever-expanding network of fundamentalist schools and homeschools that present young Earth creationism as true science. These schools use textbooks from publishers such as Abeka Books, Accelerated Christian Education and Bob Jones University Press.
The Scopes trial involved what could and could not be taught in public schools regarding creation and evolution. Today, this discussion also involves private schools, given that there are now at least 15 states that have universal private school choice programs, in which families can use taxpayer-funded education money to pay for private schooling and homeschooling.
In 1921, William Bell Riley admonished his opponents that they should “cease from shoveling in dirt on living men,” for the fundamentalists “refuse to be buried.” A century later, the funeral for fundamentalism and creationism seems a long way off.

Cutting federal aid could also shutter some rural hospitals already in financial trouble.




Provisions in the new tax and spending bill passed by the U.S. Senate early Tuesday would go even further than the House bill in removing health care and other benefits from immigrants with legal status.
The House version of the massive tax and spending bill penalized states providing health care for some immigrants with legal status as well as those that chose to spend state money to enroll immigrants without legal status in Medicaid.
But the Senate bill is even tougher on immigrants here legally and illegally, reducing benefits for most refugees and immigrants on humanitarian parole, including Afghans and Ukrainians who helped the United States in wars overseas and in return were promised safe haven and a safety net in the United States.
The Senate bill also cuts state reimbursement for emergency care in the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That would force those states to pay more for emergency care for immigrants, cut back services or drop out of Medicaid expansion, a potentially catastrophic move for low-income U.S. citizens as well as new immigrants.
The bill passed with three dissenting Republican votes, from U.S. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Vice President JD Vance broke the tie. The bill, officially the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” now returns to the House for final passage before going to President Donald Trump to be signed.
States face hard choices as budgets expected to tighten

Advocates and experts see repercussions as refugees and other legal immigrants lose health insurance and turn to already-stressed hospitals and charities for help. It could be a nail in the coffin for some rural hospitals that are in financial trouble and scaling back services. Hospitals are required to serve anyone who arrives for emergency care, regardless of their ability to pay.
“In our state, it’s going to be absolutely devastating for rural hospitals,” said Kate Woomer-Deters, a senior attorney at the North Carolina Justice Center’s Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Refugees are not going to go home just because they lost their health care coverage. They’re still going to be showing up at the door of hospitals and clinics needing care.”
Some groups, such as Afghans, Ukrainians and Iraqis, were often brought here after helping the U.S. in war efforts, putting their lives in danger and making life in their home country untenable.
“In the case of the Afghans, this is pretty much a knife in the back to those folks who helped the United States when the United States needed help in their country,” said David Meyer, a board member of the Bloomington Refugee Support Network in Indiana, where he personally helps seven refugee families from Afghanistan, Honduras, Iraq, Nicaragua and Syria.
The Senate bill takes Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and even food stamps off the table for most refugees. There are a few narrow exceptions for people with green cards, some Cuban migrants waiting for citizenship, and some Micronesians and Marshall Islands natives with treaty rights, said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
That also applies to immigrants with legal status who don’t have green cards: people with asylum, immigrant victims of domestic violence, immigrant victims of sex trafficking and parolees — such as Afghans — admitted due to urgent humanitarian reasons, as well as to refugees.










It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.


– Shelby Gonzales, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities


“There’s going to be more emergency health care needs because uninsured people will be delaying care,” Gonzales said. “It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.”
The bill also cuts funding for expansion states to pay for emergency care in hospitals. Increased costs could force some states to drop Medicaid expansion altogether, spreading the pain to low-income U.S. citizens as well, Gonzales said.
“It’s one more reason states are looking at their budgets and they’re having to make decisions about their Medicaid expansion program,” Gonzales said.
In Indiana, Meyer said, Afghan women especially often need food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to get by at first. It takes them a long time to learn to read and write since they were not allowed to attend any school under the Taliban.
“They arrived in our community totally illiterate in their native language and starting from scratch learning English, so that’s a huge impediment to being gainfully employed,” Meyer said. Even once they’ve become self-sufficient enough to get off food stamps and Medicaid, many still need the support of the Affordable Care Act to get health care.
Removing all subsidized health care “would have a devastating effect on those families, and not just Afghans but Syrians, people from the Democratic Republic of Congo and others that have been relocated to south-central Indiana,” Meyer said.
‘Big Beautiful Bill’ dings states that offer health care to some immigrants here legally

Indiana hosted more than 10,500 of the nearly 460,000 refugees who arrived in the United States between 2013 and 2023, according to a 2023 report from the nonprofit Immigration Research Initiative. In fiscal 2024, another 1,380 arrived in Indiana, mostly from Congo and Burma, but including 90 people from Afghanistan, according to State Department records.
In North Carolina, there were 276 new Afghan refugees in fiscal 2024 among 2,730 total new refugees. Even professional Afghans such as doctors and lawyers struggle at first in low-wage jobs, said Woomer-Deters, of the North Carolina Justice Center. It takes time for them to get accreditation and language skills to practice their professions here, she said.
“A lot of these folks need their food stamps, Medicaid — they need these programs for an adjustment period when they get here. And these are people we’ve invited to come and have vetted,” she said.
A Congressional Budget Office report June 29 estimated that almost 12 million people, including 1.4 million immigrants covered by state-only programs, would lose health insurance under the Senate plan.
A Republican response to an earlier CBO report emphasized that the bill would save states $13.1 billion in Medicaid spending over 10 years, “freeing up resources they can choose to reinvest to further strengthen care for the most vulnerable Americans.”
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, however, called that conclusion misleading in its own response in turn.
“These savings would largely result from millions of people losing health coverage — hardly an outcome worth celebrating,” the response said.
More states offer health care coverage for certain immigrants, noncitizens

Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, said there was one small positive change in the Senate version compared to the House version.
States will no longer be penalized for using the option to cover some immigrant children and pregnant women.
And the Senate version would not penalize expansion states for offering Medicaid to immigrants on humanitarian parole, but only because that help for parolees was ended in entirely, along with help for refugees and other kind of immigrants with legal status who lack green cards, Cuello said.
“In other words, they are blocking all paths to health care,” Cuello said in an emailed statement. “This is not an attack on the undocumented. It’s an attack on lawfully present immigrants.”

He's seen here in 2018. Donald Page/Getty ImagesIf I wanted a failed football coach as my U.S. senator, I’d move to Alabama.
And I’m not moving to Alabama.
Seriously, what in Derek Dooley’s resume makes him think his next job ought to be serving Georgia in the U.S. Senate? At age 57, his sole asset as a political candidate is his legendary last name, gifted to him by his late father, the longtime football coach and athletic director at the University of Georgia. 
In football, that name opened a lot of doors for the younger Dooley, but once inside those doors he wasn’t able to stay long. His career peaked with a surprise hiring as head coach of the University of Tennessee, where he was fired in 2012 after building the worst record of any Volunteer coach since 1906.
Yet to hear Dooley tell it, mediocrity in other fields might be the perfect qualification for government work. He apparently aspires to be a generic candidate, spouting generic rhetoric, and in that sense at least he is already off to a grand start.
Consider his announcement of interest in the race:
“Georgia deserves stronger common-sense leadership in the U.S. Senate that represents all Georgians and focuses on results — not headlines. I believe our state needs a political outsider in Washington — not another career politician — to cut through the noise and partisanship and get back to real problem solving.”
Excited yet?
In that statement, Dooley refers to himself “a political outsider,” which is one way to put it. Another is to describe his potential candidacy as a political version of stunt casting, where producers put an unqualified celebrity in a role in hopes that name recognition will make up for a lack of actual skill or talent. It shows disrespect for the audience and disrespect for the craft, but sometimes it works, if only for a short period of time.
It worked for Republicans in Alabama, where Coach Tommy Tuberville leveraged a mediocre football career into a seat in the U.S. Senate, and now reigns as the dumbest member of that once illustrious chamber. It didn’t work so well in Pennsylvania, when TV’s Dr. Oz was the candidate. It also didn’t work here in Georgia in 2022, when the GOP ran a far more famous football celebrity, Herschel Walker, as their candidate for U.S. Senate.
As we know, Walker then proceeded to embarrass himself, his party and his state, losing what could have been a winnable race against Raphael Warnock. So, given that recent history, why would Georgia Republicans risk burning their hand again on the same hot stove, this time by considering Dooley? 
Well, there are reasons.
To Republicans, Herschel’s appeal as a candidate went beyond high name recognition. With a friendship with Donald Trump but no history in politics, he could be presented to the public, and more specifically to the GOP base, as a vacant slate, which he pretty much was.
At the time, GOP leaders feared that a highly competitive primary would unleash forces within the base that general-election voters would find disturbing, particularly with candidates competing to outdo each other for Trump’s approval. Walker was their way of side-stepping all that.
In 2025, three years later, that danger hasn’t gone away, and with Trump back in the White House it has intensified. Look at U.S. Rep. Buddy Carter of Savannah. While Dooley dithers about whether to run, Carter has jumped into the Senate race and is campaigning hard for the attention of the one man who matters most.
For example, when Trump says he wants to seize Greenland as American territory, Carter proposes to seize it and rename it “Red, White and Blue Land.” When Trump bombs Iran, Carter wants to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. It’s shameless groveling of the sort that Trump loves, that GOP primary voters love, but many other Georgia voters will not.
But if your name isn’t Dooley, that’s what you have to do to get noticed.

And no one voted for it. No one even told you. But it’s real. It starts right after July 4th.
While most people are grilling and watching fireworks, a quiet but deeply consequential operation will begin. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Connecticut’s DEEP will start injecting diquat dibromide, an herbicide banned in the European Union into public rivers and lakes.
The target? An invasive plant called hydrilla. The truth? This is a chemical shortcut. One that risks ecological collapse, damages native species, and puts public health in the crossfire.

Hydrilla stems grow up from the sediment to the surface of the water. At the water’s surface, stems are highly branched, forming dense mats of vegetation. Stems produce reproductive structures called turions (pictured at red arrow: vegetative buds that can grow into new plants).

Yes, hydrilla’s a real problem. No one’s denying that. But spraying entire ecosystems with high-collateral poisons is like napalming a neighborhood to kill weeds in one yard. It’s not management. It’s failure.
And if it feels like a sci-fi plot, it is.
This is exactly what happened to Arthur Dent in The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. Some bureaucrat signed off on demolishing his house to make way for a bypass because “the plans were posted.” Now replace the house with a river. Replace the demolition company with the Army Corps. And replace the bypass with a toxic herbicide treatment that nobody knew was coming. Some pencil pusher woke up and decided our rivers needed purging. He doesn’t live here. He doesn’t swim here. He doesn’t drink from it. But his signature just altered your ecosystem. Colonel Justin R. Pabis signed the final authorization.
Gov. Ned Lamont? He shrugs. “Not our project.” Yet if a private company tried to dump these toxins, you’d have cops and hazmat trucks blocking them within the hour. But because this came with a PDF and a federal logo, it sails through? Where’s the National Guard? If the governor gave a damn, he’d halt this right now and demand public hearings. Because no one gave consent to chemical warfare against a river.
This isn’t how a free people treat public water. This is how a collapsed bureaucracy poisons it. Because no one consented to this. No town hall. No vote. No opt-out.
This isn’t how a free people treat their water. It’s how a collapsed system poisons it.
Diquat dibromide is a bipyridyl herbicide. It kills by oxidizing plant cells on contact.It doesn’t discriminate. It destroys all green tissue it touches. And it sticks in the sediment. It lingers. 
It’s banned in Europe. It’s linked to fish kills. It’s dangerous to humans. But it’s coming to: Chester Creek, Hamburg Cove, Selden Creek, Salmon River, Deep River and Lake Pocotopaug. All of them.


These are public waterways. You use them. Your kids use them. Wildlife depends on them. There is no long-term monitoring plan. There is no consent. Just a quiet federal rollout.
And here’s the kicker: This is a pilot program. If they normalize chemical warfare on Connecticut rivers, this template spreads. To Massachusetts. To Georgia. To New York.To everywhere. 
And you know the reason why? Because its easier to poison us than do the real work to remove the plant. And the real worst part? They are not even that difficult. They make boats designed for this exact purpose. And the worst of all worst parts? They don’t even know if the plant is even that harmful in the first place. Its in their own PDF,  section 4.6 It basically says the plant might be bad, but it might not.
This isn’t management. It’s pure laziness with brute force — a bulldozer. And we don’t need more patches. We need ecological intelligence.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-03 04:01:40+00:00,CT Mirror,Chronic homelessness –we are the problem,Katherine Brown,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/03/chronic-homelessness-in-ct-we-are-the-problem/,"We judge the unhoused, we criticize, we don’t want to pay for them, and we don’t want them in our back yard, even if they have been our neighbor all along.","The stigma of poverty is deeply painful for many unhoused citizens throughout Connecticut. It influences decision making, problem solving and the personal safety of more than a thousand individuals across the state. 
Many would rather remain in unsafe conditions to avoid the shame of being found out. In many of these cases, medical emergencies go unaddressed and physical violence becomes more prevalent. Those in the crisis of poverty are often in danger.
For those with mental health diagnoses and/or substance use history, these situations are often chronic. The alternative is emergency shelter. Connecticut offers emergency shelter for those in active addiction. What many may not consider is that those in recovery and those actively using drugs are mingling and developing friendships. In a stressful and unstructured environment like a wet shelter, this creates endless opportunity for failure.
The goal of many (if not all) agencies within the homeless system is to practice effective harm reduction. In my experience, this is often done poorly or not at all. The problem with harm reduction strategy is that it needs to be practiced consistently and without deviation from its designed procedure. Half-assed attempts or alterative practices create the opposite effect. This is a regular occurrence within wet shelters.
As a provider and volunteer in the community, I speak directly with those utilizing recovery resources in New London County and I am well versed in the goings-on of shelter. Temporary residents of shelter often complain about the lack of support, the ‘free-for-all’ use of drugs, theft, violence and complacency of guests setting a tone for their own journey. The phrase ‘doing nothing’ comes up again and again.
Services are not properly tailored to the individual either. The state and federal governments pour millions of dollars into helping the unhoused. Programs are created to support these individuals but when the staff isn’t properly trained or vetted, or if the clients are only given 20% of what they need, problems occur. This is a huge issue and it is commonplace. 
In my experience, shelter guests are often treated like herded cattle. They are hustled into housing when they have little to no support to maintain it. It’s also often done on a whim which is chaotic and awful for the guests. In some instances, people are offered poor or inappropriate housing because it is known this person cannot maintain housing independently. I’ve seen this happen repeatedly. They cycle in and out of shelter over and over and over.
The system creates unrealistic standards as well. A person should be enrolled in and exited from shelter in a very brief amount of time. For example, 45 days or 60 days. This is partly because funding is linked to ‘length of stay.’
Picture this, you’ve been laid off from your job where you were barely making ends meet. As someone with poor computer skills, you struggle to apply for work as most employers use electronic applications. You reach out to your local employment office and schedule an appointment for help – it’s six weeks out. When you arrive at that appointment, you are told you need a resume, which you can’t make on your own (those computer skills again). They help you build one, but this takes more than one appointment. You have been applying for work on your own but don’t get many responses – likely because of your applications. This process becomes tedious and diminishes your self-esteem.
Folks living paycheck to paycheck likely have little or no savings to back them up in an emergency either, right? So now you are past due on rent and getting a notice to quit. Eventually you end up in shelter and are told you need to get a job when you’ve been trying to gain employment for months already. Are you frustrated yet? A little defeated?
Now, picture you are applying for work while staying in shelter and after three weeks, you get a job offer. It’s only part time, but it’s better than nothing, right? You are told you can’t be housed with that income. It’s another two weeks before you receive a check and it’s only for a few hours. Eventually, you ‘time out’ of shelter because the job you got isn’t enough and you aren’t eligible for a housing voucher so out to the street you go. Even if you aren’t struggling with mental health or addiction, being unhoused can feel like navigating a landmine field.
While working as a program manager in this system, I have witnessed many heartbreaking situations where those who want to succeed are sidetracked by the fishbowl dynamic that occurs within shelter. Dozens of these people, gainfully employed and contributing to society at the time, are sabotaged by the system that is tasked to help them – all while taking no responsibility. It is clear to staff, clients and many previously housed (or never housed) individuals that in many instances, those in charge are more concerned with legal liability and their own personal reputation than the outcomes they create. Some leaders aren’t even present at their own facilities. This shouldn’t be allowed. The disconnect between government agencies, agency leaders and issues is alarming and sad. All they have to do is listen.
I say WE ARE THE PROBLEM because the public has a limited understanding of homelessness or poverty in general. We judge, we criticize, we don’t want to pay for them, and we don’t want them in our back yard, regardless of if they have been our neighbor all along. 
The fact is, they are and have been. WE ARE THE PROBLEM because our government doesn’t support its most vulnerable people the way they need to be supported. Rental caps, funding for holistic mental health and longer-term support so no one is left behind would be a great start. 
WE ARE THE PROBLEM because we put people in positions of authority and leave them unchecked. Third party reviews should be required for all non-profit agencies, not just for CARF Certification or clout. Reviewers should be onsite for regular unannounced auditing of daily procedures as well as a review of leadership practices. This should include a standard of overall well-being and physical safety for clients and frontline staff.
All Connecticut residents can benefit from the success of the chronically unhoused. When supported, they contribute to the community in ways that others cannot, but it would also decrease public risks that aren’t always considered. Public health, property and violent crime, and environmental damage are just the tip of the iceberg. 
We have a golden opportunity to help our neighbors and finally experience all the value they can bring to the table.

Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whose sweeping New Deal reforms transformed post-depression America, spoke these words in a rousing nomination speech that he delivered at the Democratic National Convention on June 27, 1936. FDR also set a new governance ideal for the Democratic Party: to use a “spirit of charity” in order to create, support, and sustain government institutions, recognizing that they are not businesses or commodities, but a public good.
Democrats in Connecticut hold all of the levers of power, including a veto-proof supermajority in the state house and senate. But despite the state’s $480.3 million General Fund surplus and overflowing reserves, Connecticut Democrats have subordinated the public good to an even “higher” ideal: the fiscal guardrails.
Years of contrived austerity have demonstrated to voters that no public good (indeed, nothing at all!) is more important than aggressively paying off Connecticut’s pension debts and filling up the state’s Budget Reserve Fund, which will top $6 billion this year.
Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat and the most influential champion of the guardrails, closed this year’s legislative session with the claim of “no new taxes.” Perhaps this is true on your W-2, and the withholding of state taxes from your salary (already among the highest in the nation) will not change. But our municipal taxes are at record highs, because the fiscal guardrails merely shift the burden of supporting underfunded services away from the state onto local governments.
Despite Connecticut having one of the highest effective state tax rates in the country, the system of guardrails and caps has meant dramatically less support of our state institutions. This only hurts the people who need their services most, who already are under strain from regressive state taxes.
Steep cuts to our public colleges and universities make as much sense as putting regular gas in a Corvette. It may save a few bucks in the short term, but it will result in degraded performance and damage that are far more costly in the long term. Students and their families pay the repair bill with increased tuition on top of their sky-high taxes. State support for UConn, for example, is 30% lower today than it was in 2008; it should come as no surprise that tuition is now 20% higher, and rising.
We should start calling the fiscal guardrails what they are: a regressive tax. “Fiscal guardrails” is too kind a euphemism for a generational wealth transfer that makes today’s taxpayers pay for the sins of previous administrations.
Governor Lamont has made stringent enforcement of the guardrails his signature policy. But he has failed to justify to Connecticut taxpayers how the benefits of making aggressive debt repayments outweigh the costs of harm to our state institutions in the here-and-now.
Keeping our state institutions in a state of perpetual financial crisis means that more time gets spent on budget triage than helping people who need their services. This is hardly a fiscally responsible use of the few tax dollars that the state is actually able to appropriate for the budget.
What was enacted by legislation can be changed by legislation, and the supermajority possessed by Connecticut Democrats removes any impediments to putting constitutional amendments on the table. Our lawmakers cannot continue to pretend as though there is no legal process to make even small adjustments to the caps or to draw funds from the Budget Reserve Fund.
Investing our hard earned tax dollars into debt repayments and amassing huge cash reserves while willfully cutting critical social services is the very definition of what FDR warned us about: a “government frozen in the ice of its own indifference.”

Dan Sullivan gives an annual address to the Alaska State Legislature on Mar 20, 2025 (Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, took questions from Alaska reporters on Tuesday, in an hourlong phone news conference. He expressed praise and support for the Trump administration’s agenda with the federal budget megabill, saying, “No state fared better from the bill” than Alaska. 
The following transcript of the news conference has been lightly edited to improve readability:
Sen. Dan Sullivan: Thanks everybody back home. You should have gotten a very big, detailed press release that we just sent out. It’s a big bill, a lot there, and what I want to do is kind of cover the highlights, and then be glad to take your questions. But, look, I think this was a huge opportunity for our state. There’s no perfect bill, but a lot that’s in this bill are things that we’ve been working on, not just for months, but for years. And it was a great opportunity with like- minded members of the Senate to really, really advance Alaska’s interests across a whole host of areas. And I think it’s safe to say that no state fared better from this bill than our state, and I’m going to give you a couple of reasons why that’s the case. 
No. 1 and first and foremost, across a whole host of areas, to me, this is a jobs bill. This is a bill about growing our economy, and taking advantage of opportunities. You know, in 2017 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted ANWR (Arctic National Wildlife Refuge). It was considered historic when we did that in that bill. This bill puts into law lease sales, not just for ANWR again, but for NPR-A (National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska). It goes back to the Trump era, integrated activity plan of 2020, for Cook Inlet and for opportunities for timber sales in the Chugach, in the Tongass. Very importantly, these mandated lease sales are in the law which protects us from, to be frank, administrations, like Joe Biden that we experienced for four years, when they came in with executive orders to try to shut us down. And something, again, we’ve been trying to get done for a long time: Every single one of these big federal areas, ANWR, Cook Inlet, NPR-A, is now at a 70-30 revenue share between the state and the feds. The state getting 70 (percent), and the feds getting 30 (percent). Now these start later in the 2034 period, but for those of you who know our history on resource development, we’ve been trying to get that kind of share more towards the state for decades. So we were able to achieve that across the board. So this is going to be very big for jobs, really important for additional revenues for our state Legislature and state government because of this. And then a whole bunch of other energy provisions, one of which is the new Energy Dominance Council, funded up to a billion dollars. And that’s something that, already, our AKLNG (Alaska liquefied natural gas pipeline) project and the secretary of energy are focused on to help advance that project even more. So big wins on economic growth, resource development. If we get this into law, with President Trump’s executive orders on Alaska, this is going to be a really, really exciting time for our economy. 
So next, a real focus here on tax relief for hard-working families and small businesses. As many of you know, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act included across-the-board tax cuts for small businesses, middle-class families, doubling of the child tax credit to support working families — all of that expires at the end of this year. So without this tax reform, this budget reconciliation bill, there would be about a $4.5 trillion tax increase. Alaska’s small businesses would be crushed, middle-class families would be crushed. So by extending the 2017 tax cuts, we avoid a massive tax increase. There’s a whole host of new provisions. These are bills that I co-sponsored to focus on making child care more affordable for families with young children. The list, I won’t go through it, it’s in the press release. It’s a really big part of this bill. Alaskans have been reaching out to our office saying child care, child tax credits, employer-provided child care provisions are really important. When I gave my speech at the Legislature last year, there was a lot of talk about that. We hit historic levels of that (funding) for middle-class families. 
I want to get to a couple other areas that I think are important. This is an area that is really important to Alaska, that really hasn’t made hardly any news. I’m the chairman of the commerce committee subcommittee in charge of the Coast Guard. This bill has the biggest investment in the Coast Guard in American history, nearly $25 billion. Think about this, the Coast Guard’s annual budget is about $11.5 billion. So this is a massive investment, and it’s all in Coast Guard assets: 16 new icebreakers – we think icebreakers are really important; 22 new cutters, a $300 million port infrastructure in Juneau to homeport the ice breaker, the Storis. We’re going to have a ribbon cutting in Juneau in August. I’ve been working on these icebreakers, homeporting in our state for 10 years. Forty new helicopters – a lot of these Coast Guard assets are going to be coming to our state. There’s almost $5 billion in additional shore-side infrastructure that will be spread across the country. Again, a lot of that will be coming to communities like Sitka, Seward, Kodiak. These are really, really important elements of the Coast Guard. But as you guys know, when you’re builing out infrastructure, $300 million, for example, in Juneau for the new port facilities, that’s a lot of jobs. So it’s very exciting. 
Related to the Coast Guard are the provisions to secure the border and fight fentanyl. As you guys know, we’ve had the highest overdose rates in fentanyl for the last two years. There’s a real big commitment – $46 billion to build the southern wall, $8 billion for Border Patrol facilities. And a lot more for the kind of nuts and bolts of a more efficient immigration system, the immigration court system, federal courts, detention facilities. So the president has already shut down the border, almost 99% decrease in illegal aliens. But we have a huge challenge still with fentanyl, with drug cartels, and this is going to shut that down.
Building up our military – $150 billion for our military. Again, a lot of this goes to taking care of our troops. It builds on the historic pay raise — 14.5% — we had for enlisted personnel last year. That’s the highest pay raise ever. Twenty-five billion dollars for the president’s Golden Dome. That’s missile defense. Some of you may have seen, I introduced my Golden Dome Act about two weeks ago. A lot of that — a significant amount of that is going to be coming to Alaska, because we remain the cornerstone of missile defense. So that’s very exciting for our state. Again, national security, but jobs. One thing that’s in there, it’s kind of a small item, but we think really important. Again, a lot of us have been working on this for years:, $115 million to support the exploration and development of existing Arctic infrastructure, like reopening the Naval Air Station at Adak. So a really, really important component of our military. Nationally, of course, there’s a lot focused on ship building, a lot focused on the Indo-Pacific, but a lot of that is going to help our state. 
Another area that’s really important for the country, but also our state: upgrading Alaska and our nation’s aviation system – we have about $12.5 billion for nationwide air traffic control reforms and upgrades, and a significant amount, about $120 million, will be coming to our state building on the $25 million annually that the president and (U.S. Transportation) Secretary Duffy announced for the Alaska FAA Safety Initiative. So we’re building on that. 
Then finally, I wanted to mention the area where we’re going to be strengthening Alaska’s health care. You know, you may have seen, there’s a lot of ads back home, I think false ads, talking about me and this bill. Here’s the facts on the bill: It doesn’t touch Medicare, doesn’t touch Social Security, despite some of these false ads saying to the contrary. And the major reform in this bill is the Medicaid reform that centers around limitations and reductions in states’ use of what are called provider taxes and directed payments. States use that to enhance their federal Medicaid payments. That’s where the reforms in Medicaid are. We are the only state that doesn’t use provider taxes or state-directed payments, so the Medicaid programs and federal funds that the state receives are not impacted by the provided tax reforms in this bill, because we don’t do that. We’re the only state that doesn’t do that. 
So what we have been able to do, and what we’re working on, even as late as last night is to have a very significant, I got a plus up last night to $50 billion in the legislation for rural hospitals, and rural health care that will go to states. There’s a flat rate that — how much that will go — it’s about $100 million a year. And in discussions with senior administration officials, I am very confident that the state of Alaska, contrary to some of the ads on TV that we’re focused on cutting Medicaid, will be getting at least about $200 million a year for the next five years, in addition to what we’ve already gotten in Medicaid. That is a very significant plus-up that will go to the state, it will be able to be used for Medicaid-backlog challenges. And we think that that’s going to be a really, really important innovation, and that was something that I played a lead role in, in the last several weeks. 
There are common sense work reforms that are both in the SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) and the Medicaid provisions. Some of you might be familiar with the Clinton-era welfare reforms, that was a bipartisan work requirement during the Clinton administration. That was 30 hours a week, this is about a third less. It’s 20 hours a week, for able-bodied individuals who have no dependents, who are not disabled, who do not have mental health challenges, or are not seniors. And there’s a way in which that’s going to work for Medicaid, for SNAP. But we were able to get provisions that take Alaska’s unique challenges with regard to the work requirements. For example, all Alaska Natives are exempt from both work requirements on SNAP and Medicaid. That was something that I worked for hard in this bill. And then there are other provisions that, if you’re showing good-faith efforts to make these work requirements, you get extended periods. So those are important as well. 
And then finally, as I mentioned, there’s a whole host of areas where we’re making sure we’re taking care of seniors, elders. There’s a provision it’s about $12,000 per couple for tax deductions to reduce Social Security taxes. This builds on my Social Security Fairness Act that passed at the end of last year, for more take-home money for seniors. And some of the other areas: 100% federal Medicaid match for all Alaska Natives. As I mentioned, complete work requirement exemptions for our Alaska Native communities, many of whom live in rural areas, and that’s very hard to undertake these work requirements. And a final thing that I just wanted to mention. You know, the implementation of this bill, as I mentioned — long night last night, but we’ve been working on some of these things for years. 
There’s been some articles, and I want to just clarify it, because it’s important for people to know the way this works in the budget reconciliation process is that you have to make sure the provisions of the bill are compliant with what’s called the Byrd rule. The Byrd rule is a parliamentary statutory procedure dealing with budgetary and tax issues. The provisions of the bill typically have to meet that Byrd rule, but that’s not self-executing. The way in which provisions are challenged is that a Democratic leader, a Republican leader, will go to the parliamentarian and say, ‘Hey, I want this provision stripped out of the bill because it violates the Byrd rule.’ So the leadership on either side of the political aisle here has to proactively go after provisions that they want to strip out of the bill. What I saw, and it was pretty remarkable, pretty shocking, to be perfectly honest. The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, on literally every provision that I’ve talked about that benefited Alaska. And it is a long list, the ANWR leases, NPR-A, Cook Inlet, a fund for rural hospitals in Alaska and Hawaii, an FMAP (Federal Medical Assistance Percentage) increase – that I’ve been working on for years to get a federal match requirement for Medicaid to be increased in Alaska and Hawaii – ice breakers, homeporting in Juneau, border security, heck, even charitable deductions for Alaska Native whaling communities, every single one of these things — flexible SNAP requirements — Chuck Schumer and the Democrats came after us to try to strip out of this bill. So it’s a little ironic to me, particularly when I’m seeing far-left groups align with Schumer running millions of dollars of ads back home, saying wrongly, ‘Dan Sullivan wants to, you know, cut Medicaid,’ when the only guy cutting Medicaid in Alaska was Chuck Schumer yesterday when he went after our FMAP provision for Alaska and Hawaii, and unfortunately, he was successful. So the bill had a really good federal match increase provisions for Alaska and Hawaii for Medicaid, and Schumer got it removed. That’s hundreds of millions of dollars for Alaskans getting Medicaid money that the minority leader, Democrat leader of the U.S. Senate took out of the bill yesterday. But we kept fighting back, and this bill, like I said, is still a very strong bill, we think, for our state. And appreciate all the interest, and would love to take your questions.
Brian Venua, KMXT: So one of the things I was curious about, (Alaska U.S. Sen. Lisa) Murkowski said in her statement, in an email that the bill, while there’s good provisions, it’s not good enough for the rest of our nation and hopes that this isn’t a final draft. I was curious, what are your thoughts about that sentiment? And you know, what are some parts of it that you’re worried about or would change if you had, like, a magic wand?
Sen. Sullivan: Brian, you know, as you can imagine, I’ve been working with Sen. Murkowski on these provisions for years. And last night, you know, we were all working together and our staffs, that’s kind of a daily thing. I didn’t see her statement, but my understanding from what you said, I know for a fact that she thinks, like I do, that this is a strong bill for Alaska, and I think it is. And so, to be honest, that’s been my focus. Heck, even in Washington, D.C., there’s been some news commentary, even some politicians on both sides of the aisle saying, you know, this bill was a home run for Alaska. Some were critical that it was so good for Alaska. I take it as a badge of honor that this bill has a lot of really good things for Alaska, so that was my focus. I will say that, you know, for me, if I had a magic wand – I had been working on this FMAP provision, that’s the federal match for Alaska and Hawaii, because we both have statutory costs of living levels that are higher than any other place in the country. In the FMAP, it’s kind of complicated, but the formula for your FMAP is based solely on per-capita income, and ever since I became a senator, I’m like, that’s unfair. It should be based on the cost of living and the cost of health care. So I was able to get this FMAP provision to increase our federal match to 65%, and would increase Hawaii’s to 15%. I talked to the Hawaiian senators like, hey, let’s do this together. It’s bipartisan, you guys agree with this provision. And for whatever reason, Chuck Schumer tried to strike it. We fought it really hard. It took us two days. We were fighting in front of the parliamentarian saying, this complies with the Byrd rule. We ended up losing. And you know, that was a real loss, not just for Alaskans, but Hawaiians. But we readjusted and had a more robust provision in the rural health care fund that I talked about, that I still think is going to be a couple hundred million a year for Alaska on health care.
Delcenia Cosman, Homer News: How does the new Medicaid work requirement, outlined in this bill, how would that affect seasonal workers such as the Homer fishing fleet and tourism employees that are not necessarily employed year round?
Sen. Sullivan:  So the work requirement is 20 hours. As I mentioned, 30 hours was the standard under the Clinton administration, but it doesn’t include, as I mentioned, people with dependents, the elderly, and disabled. So there’s a broad exemption in terms of work requirements. And remember, the work requirement is, it’s not just work – you can volunteer for 20 hours. You can go to training for 20 hours. So there’s a whole host of ways in which you can meet that. And then we had provisions that completely exempted all Alaska Native communities in that but we did make adjustments exactly to your question, for seasonal workers, and we also made adjustments — and these are things that Sen. Murkowski and I got in — for areas of the state that have traditionally high unemployment. So to your question, we did make adjustments in that regard, and we can send you the details of that. I don’t have the provision right now in front of me.
Liz Ruskin, Alaska Public Media: Hi there, Senator, the bill extends tax cuts, it creates tax cuts. And as you noted, it spends a lot of money on Coast Guard and defense and other items. It was projected to add more than $3 trillion to the national debt. I’m not sure what the new score is, but are you comfortable with that addition to the national debt?
Sen. Sullivan: Well, look, Liz, when we look at this, there’s this big kind of debate on the baseline, the use of the way in which CBO (Congressional Budget Office) does the score, and the way in which we’re looking at this, this actually has historic savings of about roughly $1.6 trillion, right? And you know, the big debate is that we believe, and you probably saw this debate in Washington, D.C., that the debt and deficit should be marked from the current baseline right and current policy baseline. What that means is — and even the Obama administration had done this during their budget reconciliation — that it assumes that these taxes were not going to continue. So that was the different challenge here and when we’re pretty sure that the tax cuts were going to continue, and so we think the $3 trillion if you look at it from a current policy baseline, is actually quite inaccurate. So as you know, there’s a big debate on this topic, but we think that that $3 trillion assumes that the tax cuts were going to expire, but under current policy, which is the way we viewed this, that’s $3 trillion that we didn’t think was the accurate score under the CBO score.
Ruskin: So do you think this bill lifts us out of debt, that we have no problem with national debt?
Sen. Sullivan: No, I think we have a huge problem in national debt. I mean, to be honest. You know, last year, we had $37 trillion in debt, and we paid out $950 billion in interest, which is more than we paid for the Pentagon. So what we need to be doing, from my perspective, is reforming programs, which you’re seeing with Medicaid, but also growing the economy, and that’s why keeping the tax cuts extended is going to be really important. So this, we believe, is going to reduce the deficit by about $508 billion. And I think the key, as you know, it’s not just $35 trillion, which is a huge number, it’s the percent of GDP that your debt is. And this is going to start, we believe, with the strong economic growth that will come with this, start to reduce the debt. If you remember, CBO doesn’t always get these scores right. When we did the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, they underestimated the growth by about one and a half (percentage) points, and they underestimated the revenues that would come in by about $1.4 trillion. So the key is, you got to have savings, which this bill does, but you can’t grow your way out of a … $35 trillion debt, you got to — I’m sorry, you can’t cut your way out. You got to grow your way out. So the key here is strong economic growth.
Iris Samuels, Anchorage Daily News: So my question is about Medicaid in Alaska, we’ve heard from a lot of concern that the new eligibility requirements would cause thousands of eligible Alaskans to lose access to Medicaid. So my question for you, Senator, is do you think that the number of uninsured Alaskans is going to increase after the passage of this bill?
Sen. Sullivan: So do you mean uninsured in terms of people not receiving Medicaid, or just uninsured as it relates to another issue?
Samuels: The number of Alaskans who don’t have health insurance. So if you also want to address the potential expiration of enhanced premium tax credits, that would also be helpful.
Sen. Sullivan:  Yeah, look, I think the expiration of the enhanced premium tax credits is an important issue, and it wasn’t addressed in this bill. And as you know, that expires at the end of the year, and I think it’s something that I’m hopeful that there’s going to be a bipartisan consensus to address that, but it wasn’t. And to be honest, I think that some of the issues related to that, you know, in a bill like this, you can’t fit everything under the constraints of the Byrd rule. There’s a lot of things here, like I said, my FMAP provision that got taken out of this bill when Schumer challenged it. So that’s one that I don’t think would fit under here, but I think it’s an important issue that we have to look at. It’s kind of a cliff, I don’t think we should have a cliff in terms of those people who are relying on that for their health care. In terms of the backlog for Medicaid. I actually think this bill is going to help that. Again, we are not like other parts of the state, going to see any kind of dramatic reduction, any kind of reduction in our Medicaid federal dollars, because we don’t use provider taxes, and we don’t use state-directed payments, which is where all the reforms are for this bill. So the estimates of about $200 million a year from this rural health provider fund that’s in the bill. It’s a $50 billion fund. I was able to get that doubled in the last couple days, because I think it’s very important for rural communities. I think that that is actually an opportunity for our state to undertake reforms to get at the (application processing) backlog with a lot of that money. We’ve been talking to the governor and his team, and I think that they see that it’s an opportunity.
You know, there have been some stories that with the work requirement, some people might choose not to either work or volunteer, or go to school, or go to training for 20 hours a week. And if they choose not to do that, and they are eligible for the work requirement, you could see Medicaid for those individuals slipping. But we don’t think that that’s going to be a high number. And those are really the only areas in which I could see a Medicaid slippage in the state, because we’re not losing funding. To the contrary, with the estimated $200 million plus, I think it’s being more than $200 million a year from this fund. The state’s going to have a lot of opportunities to make reforms to the program. It’ll make it more efficient and serviceable for the people.
James Brooks, Alaska Beacon: Senator, I talked to Sen.Murkowski, and she said she agonized over her decision whether to vote for or against this. Was there ever a point where you questioned whether you would vote for it, and if so, what was it over?
Sen. Sullivan: Yeah, James, I did. Look, so I know I kind of sound like a broken record, but I’ve been really, really, really focused on this FMAP provision for Alaska. And again, I don’t want to sound too technical, but it’s the federal match requirement for Medicaid. We have one of the lowest matches in the country. We used to be 50%: 50% state and 50% federal. That’s the lowest in America. We’re about 51% right now, which is still really low. And it would always really bug me, because that formula is just pure per-capita income. That’s how they do it, which is why we have a low formula. It doesn’t take into account your cost of living, and it doesn’t take into account the high cost of health care delivery, which we have in those two categories, the highest in the country. So I’ve always said, ‘Hey, we need a much higher FMAP.’ And I’ve been working on this for years, because I just think it’s unfair to Alaska. There’s states that have 80-20 (percent) if you can believe that. Certain states have statutory FMAP – DC has a 70% statutory FMAP. The American territories, Marianas, Virgin Islands, have like an 80% FMAP, and we’re at 50 (percent). So I literally went all the way to very senior folks in the administration and all my Republican colleagues, saying, ‘I need this provision.’ And I explained why, and I got support from the White House, and I got support from all my Republican colleagues, and my provision was actually us and Hawaii, because they had similar challenges. And I will tell you when it got stripped out by Sen. Schumer, it was a giant, enormous frustration of mine, because I’ve been working on this and I care really deeply about this issue. I’ve been working on this issue almost since I got to the Senate. So I had a little bit of a dark night of the soul when that happened. And then we tried to fix it several times, different kind of tweaks and the parliamentarian and the Democrats kept challenging it and we kept losing. So I’m not sure it was a moment where I was going to say, ‘I’m not going to do this,’ but it was a moment of enormous disappointment when you’re trying it and you’re very close. Because remember, this was in the bill, my FMAP provision was in the budget reconciliation bill that we voted to get on four days ago. And when you work hard on something that you know is right for the people you represent, and then it kind of goes down the drai: It was frustrating, very, very frustrating to me. And we’ll re-attack it. The way I did it was, it was my initiative to get permission from my colleagues to plus-up this rural fund. It’s a very big rural fund now, $50 billion and to get essentially the equivalent for Alaska of what my FMAP provision would have been. My FMAP provision would have been about an additional $180 million a year for Alaska for Medicaid. And this rural fund actually gets more for us, about $200 million probably it might even go up to almost $300 million, so that was the moment. That’s a long answer, but I’ve been working on this issue for a really, really long time. I feel very passionate about it. And I was close, and it slipped away from me, because Schumer actually was the one who took it out, right? And it’s very ironic. You watch all these ads, you guys are seeing them ‘Dan Sullivan supposedly cutting Medicaid.’ That’s the false attack by Schumer’s affiliated groups. And you know, he’s the only guy cutting Medicaid in Alaska. I mean, he did it the other night, and it was really disheartening for me.
Jack Barnwell, Fairbanks Daily News Miner: Senator, this bill calls for the eventual sunsetting of the clean energy tax credit. Do you have any concerns about how that will affect projects in rural Alaska that might rely on these projects, and don’t have any direct benefit from natural gas or the high diesel and fuel rates costs?
Sen. Sullivan: Yeah, Jack, it’s a really good question. And I will tell you, it was a big component of the debate that was going on. We were able to get a much more generous kind of runway than what was in the House bill that came over. The House bill had this provision that was much more stringent on when the subsidies for those kinds of renewable projects would go away, and we were able to extend that. And then you may have seen there was also this provision in the House bill that they called an excise tax that was kind of a penalty. We got that actually removed in the Senate bill yesterday. And you know, one of the things that we were making the argument on, particularly for Alaska, is that our construction season and start for the timeline of these production and investment tax credits is so short up here. And that we needed an extended and better, phased-out timeline. We did get that to some degree, certainly an improvement from the House bill, but it’s still, I think, a concern to some. Now, as you know, some of these subsidies have been going on for many, many years, and it’s important for some of these industries to not have to rely on it. But I think the timeline extension was what we were trying to achieve and we got that some degree. And getting rid of this excise tax, which is essentially a penalty, we did achieve that in the bill. So good question. A lot of debate on this over the last several weeks, and that’s where we ended up.
Katie Stavick, Mat-Su Frontiersman: I just wanted to know, because of all the changes to the Senate version of the bill and now it goes back to the House. Are you worried at all about the bill not passing the House as it is now?
Sen. Sullivan: Yeah, Katie, it’s obviously the million dollar question. So as you probably have seen, on budget reconciliation, there’s a lot of back and forth, right? Before you go to the reconciliation part of the bill, you have to do what’s called a budget resolution. And we were doing that in the spring. We passed that in the Senate. We sent it back to the House. They sent it back to us. Those are the precursors to getting on the bill itself, the budget reconciliation bill. And the reason all this is important, it’s under the 1974 Budget Control Act, and Democrats and Republicans both use that act, the reason it’s important that you have to comply with the procedures and comply with the Byrd Rule — which is why it’s so important — is that in the Senate, you only have to get 51 senators to pass these kind of provisions. You know, I get along with my good Democratic friends in the Senate, but none of them would ever support the provisions that we got on ANWR, that we got on NPR-A, that we got on Cook Inlet, they just wouldn’t, right? So we needed this budget reconciliation bill to just be able to have Republican senators and House members vote and pass legislation that fits within the Byrd rule, so there’s a 51 Senate threshold. So that’s why all this is really important, that rules are quite arcane, but there’s already been a lot of back and forth between the House and Senate on the resolutions. Now this is the real, you know, the real live bill. You might remember the budget reconciliation bill started in the House. It came over to us (the Senate). 
It’s kind of interesting, the speaker of the House came over to one of our lunches a couple weeks ago and said, ‘Hey, Senators, we really want you to not change this at all.’ Well, we tried to not change it much, but we changed it some, and now it’s going to go back over there. I think, you know, one goal would be for them to just pass it as is, but that’s going to be up to the speaker and the members of the House. But I think he’s moving forward. I know (Alaska U.S. Rep.) Nick Begich is back in D.C. If they can’t get to passing our legislation, as is, they could pass another version, and then we would go into what’s called a conference. Where leaders in the Senate, leaders in the House would meet, would try to hash out our differences. That’s a possibility, but I think certainly our preference in the Senate at this juncture is for the House to take our provision and pass it, or take our bill and pass it. I think the House Rules Committee already met today, and I think the speaker is really wasting no time on moving forward on our bill, and I hope that they can pass it.
Trill Gates, ABC & FOX Alaska: Hi there, Senator, I had a question about Planned Parenthood. It’s my understanding two of the last Planned Parenthood locations, one in Anchorage, one in Fairbanks in our state, are now being threatened of being closed with this bill. Where will Alaskans in need of their services go?
Sen. Sullivan: I mean, there’s a lot of, I think there are other options with regard to services — community health centers throughout the state, which are all over the state. And I think the discussion, Trill, I think it used to be very bipartisan on what was called the Hyde Amendment, which was that federal funds should not be used to provide abortions. And that’s still the law of the land, but I think in terms of other services, for other health care type services — hospitals, community health centers, I think are areas in which those kinds of services can be provided.
Jeff Landfield, Alaska Landmine: I have more of a philosophical question. You know, we have the highest SNAP error rate, it was 60% I think, it might be down a little bit, but it’s much higher than the national average. And, you know, a third of the state is on Medicaid, and FMAP and the Indian Health Service, it’s a 100% match. Do you think the state needs to take steps to try to fix these problems and have people not so reliant on the federal government for health care and food stamps?
Sen. Sullivan: Well, Jeff, I think it’s a really important question. And our error rate on the SNAP provision the last couple years has been the highest in the country by far. It was 60% last year, which there’s not another state that’s even close to that. One of the things that we wanted to do on the SNAP provision we did get this in there, was to give states like ours with high error rates more time to fix the challenge. And I know the governor and the state Legislature are working on that. We were talking to the secretary of agriculture — Sen. Murkowski and I — with a provision we got in there that will grant her, essentially, the authority to let us go out to 2030 on fixing our error rate before any of the cost share provisions in the bill kicked in. And that was an important reform that we got in the bill. It was, you know, kind of trying to take care of our state in terms of getting control over this error rate, getting systems in place. You know, our error rate wasn’t always that high pre-COVID it was about 7% so I think COVID really undermined what happened in Alaska. 
So that’s one issue, and that’s a big part of the bill, and some of the somewhat Alaska-specific provisions that we got in the bill. The other one, though, I think, is a really important one, which is why I started my press conference with talking about private sector-led growth, giant great opportunities that are in this bill, historic opportunities that are in this bill. And I think you’re asking a really important question, because one thing that’s important is to make sure, and I did this in my speech to the Alaska Legislature earlier this year, is to say, ‘Hey, one of our goals should be to lift people off these programs.’ Remember Medicaid, if you’re disabled, pregnant, disabled, that’s who it was originally focused on. But, you know, you have the expansion population, which is 138% above the poverty level, able bodied. And you know, one of the goals I think we should talk about more is people in that category. Hey, there’s an opportunity with a really good job with the laborers or a great union that’s doing work on the (North) Slope. You get that job, you get great health care from the union, you get great private health care. You get off Medicaid, you have a stronger income coming in. So it’s an important issue that I think we need to remember that having more and more people on Medicaid and SNAP shouldn’t be the goal.  Those are safety nets that are very important, and I think they’re for Alaska, they are reinforced in this bill. But overall, I think we want to encourage people to be able to have jobs that move forward and get them, get them off those kinds of programs. 
And I also think that the work requirements are reforms that help in that way. Remember the Clinton administration did this with welfare reform, with 30 hours a week. It was considered controversial. I think a lot of people saw that it worked. This is about a third less in terms of requirement: 20 hours a week. And there’s a lot of ways in which individuals can meet that requirement. They can do volunteering, they can do training, they can go to school, they can get a job. So I think these kinds of reforms help in that direction that you’re asking and it’s important.
Ashlyn O’Hara, KDLL: Hi, Senator, I’d like to know more about the energy dominance financing program. I work for KDLL on the Kenai Peninsula, and there’s, of course, tremendous interest here about the Alaska LNG project. And are you able to be specific about how exactly the program would accelerate momentum on the project, and I guess as a kind of second part of that, or is it your intention to seek federal capital beyond the existing federal loan guarantees?
Sen. Sullivan: Ashlyn, great question, and the answer to your question is yes. One of the things that we are doing right now with Glenfarne (Group) and the Department of Defense is trying to see if there’s a way in which the Department of Defense can be a buyer of gas that would come down through the pipeline. That could dramatically lower the cost of capital, with regard to having a very big purchaser. Alaska LNG (pipeline) is going right past a lot of our military bases, so this is an issue I’ve raised with (U.S. Defense) Secretary Hegseth recently. I raised it in a breakfast I had with the deputy secretary of defense, just three weeks ago, and I raised it in a hearing with the assistant secretary for installations in charge of the Department of Defense. So the senior leaders of the Pentagon are very aware of this opportunity, and that Glenfarne is quite interested in that. 
And then, with regard to the Energy Dominance Council, what we did is we took, I think it’s called the Section 1706 provision that was in the IRA Act (Inflation Reduction Act), and we kind of reformed that to look at much bigger projects that relates to kind of big infrastructure, so nuclear, LNG and pipeline facilities, that can help increase capacity and base-load energy. That’s kind of the new way in which this 1706 energy dominance fund was reformed in the bill, and we got it capitalized with about a billion dollars. Which was important, because I was on a conference call with (U.S. Energy) Secretary Wright, and that’s the capitalization in the program. He is very interested in looking at the AKLNG project as one of the projects by which they would use this new energy dominance financing mechanism.
So they’re quite aware of it. We got a decent amount of money in it. I had a conference call with the secretary and the governor just two weeks ago. We are still trying to get the Department of Energy to set up the loan guarantees that Sen. Murkowski and I got in the bipartisan infrastructure bill several years ago. The Biden Administration never set that program up. It was four years of asking Secretary Granholm, hey, it’s in the law. We got it passed. You guys need to set it up. And they just kind of gave us the Heisman for four years. So we’re trying to get Secretary Wright and his team to set it up. So to answer your questions, you can kind of tell there are several different government financing angles that we are looking at. And if this law passes, this Energy Dominance Council will be a new one, and I think the secretary would like to target AKLNG as one of his projects.
Eric Stone, Alaska Public Media: Thanks, Senator. So I wanted to follow up on the idea that we’ll grow our way out of debt with the tax cuts. So like debt grew by $2.7 trillion between, shortly after the passage of the 2017 tax cuts, I’m going, you know, Jan. 1, 2018, to Jan. 1, 2020, this is before COVID. The debt grew by $2.7 trillion in that time. Why do you believe that extending these tax cuts further will, you know, help us grow our way out of debt, rather than adding to the national debt?
Sen. Sullivan: Because I don’t think you can cut your way out of a $36 trillion national debt, but I think the combination of savings – which this bill has very historic savings, about $1.6 trillion over 10 years – and growth, is really the key. And I think we’ve seen that throughout our country’s history. We’ve had different periods where we’ve had a very, very high debt-to-GDP ratio. That’s really the key indicator. Sometimes the numbers look daunting, but it’s really a measure of what your GDP is. And the White House Council of Economic Advisers thinks that this will help the GDP — debt-to-GDP go under 97%, with this bill because of the growth. It’ll be generated by it. And without it, they think it would be, you know, much higher, going about over 110%. 
So we’ve done this before, we grew out of a huge debt-to-GDP after World War II. I think on the growth side, after the 2017 tax cuts, you know, we were hitting 3% GDP growth. We were bringing in huge revenues. I think pre-tax cuts, it was about, I was looking at the numbers the other day, was about $3.5 trillion. It went up to almost $5 trillion, and then COVID hit and, you know, kind of all hell broke loose. So we had a very good, long meeting with the secretary of the treasury twice last week, and went through a lot of these numbers, and the Treasury Department thinks that we can hit them. But look, you never know. I mean, you’re asking a very fair question. There’s no doubt about it. But I think if you look at our history, the way you get out of these kinds of big holes, and we’re in a huge hole, is growth, is really, really the key.
Margaret Bauman, Cordova Times: Senator Sullivan, I want to go back to something you said at the beginning of the news conference, that “no state has fared better in this bill.” And you know, regarding issues like Medicaid and other economic issues, you’re very well traveled, and I just wonder how fair you think this is. Because the cost of living is high in Alaska, but there are absolutely pockets of extreme poverty all over this country. They’re in logging communities in the Rockies, they’re in Appalachia, they’re in little towns and big cities all over the country, because of the economic impact on individual families. There are families out there that are homeless, that don’t know where their next meal is coming from, and, you know, your obligation is to Alaska. But should Alaska be getting a hell of a better deal on all this than other states? Thank you.
Sen. Sullivan: Well, you’re right. I am focused on Alaska, and it’s hard to focus on other places. You’re right about there are other pockets of the country that have extreme poverty. We have extreme poverty, which is why, you know, we work really hard to get exemptions in so many parts of the legislation that relates to our state. And the other thing that we — I was really, really focused on, I’ve done it for a long time, as I mentioned this FMAP issue, but really, really pushed and got a big plus-up to the provider fund for rural hospitals and rural health care. That is a big deal to me. And in that fund, $50 billion is going to help states across America. As a matter of fact, the way in which we structure that fund, and my team and I were the ones who wrote the formula. We’re proud of this. We did not do it per capita. We’ve been down that road before. 
This fund has a minimum for every state across America, and that’s a $100 million minimum. Every state gets that. So to your question, that was something that my team and I devised, pushed hard on, funded significantly, and that helps every state. That’s not just an Alaska thing, but that’s going to help us huge. Because when you’re not per-capita income, sometimes we get the raw end of the deal on that. 
So, look, I’m not going to apologize for working hard for our state. That’s just my opinion. But back in D.C., there was a lot of chatter on the internet and stuff on how Alaska did really well in this bill: the energy part, the Coast Guard part, the military part, the tax part, the rural hospital fund. But I also think and I think you guys would all agree, we’ve been overlooked by the federal government, particularly in terms of infrastructure and health care, for years. Which is why I’m so obsessed with this FMAP provision, and when I couldn’t get it, when Schumer stripped it from the bill, we pivoted to this rural fund as a way to get those kinds of funds that we think our state needs. So it’s a good question, but as you can imagine, as a senator, I’m very, very, very focused on the people I represent. But I will say some of the initiatives that our team led on, like this big rural fund, are going to help everybody.

,DC,2025-07-03 02:45:18+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Abrego Garcia was beaten and tortured in Salvadoran prison, new court filings reveal",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/abrego-garcia-was-beaten-and-tortured-salvadoran-prison-new-court-filings-reveal,,"WASHINGTON — Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported in March to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador, endured “severe beatings, severe sleep deprivation, inadequate nutrition, and psychological torture” while there, his attorneys wrote in a late Wednesday filing.The filing, an amended complaint to the District Court of Maryland, provides the first disturbing details of what Abrego Garcia experienced at Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT.His wrongful deportation has become the most high-profile example of the conflict between the Trump administration's aggressive mass deportations campaign and the judiciary’s call for the due process rights of immigrants.The allegations of torture also raise questions about the U.S. State Department’s payment to El Salvador of up to $15 million to detain about 300 immigrant men at CECOT, a possible violation of the human rights law known as the Leahy Law.The law bars State’s financial support of “units of foreign security forces” — such as military and law enforcement staff in prisons —  facing credible allegations of gross human rights violations.Hit with batons, forced to kneel for hoursWhen Abrego Garcia first arrived to CECOT, he was told by a prison official, “Welcome to CECOT. Whoever enters here doesn’t leave,” according to the filing from lawyers with Quinn Emmanuel, the firm representing Abrego Garcia in his immigration case.Abrego Garcia was later kicked, hit with wooden batons and beaten by Salvadoran guards on his first day at CECOT on March 15, according to the new filing.“By the following day, Plaintiff Abrego Garcia had visible bruises and lumps all over his body,” according to the complaint.While in a cell, Abrego Garcia and 20 other incarcerated Salvadorans were forced to kneel from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. and guards would strike “anyone who fell from exhaustion,” according to the filing. During that time, Abrego Garcia was denied access to a bathroom and soiled himself.“The detainees were confined to metal bunks with no mattresses in an overcrowded cell with no windows, bright lights that remained on 24 hours a day, and minimal access to sanitation,” according to the complaint.At CECOT, the guards would threaten to put Abrego Garcia in cells with gang members “who, they assured him, would ‘tear’  him apart,” according to the filing. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers have denied he is a gang member.During his first two weeks at CECOT, Abrego Garcia’s health deteriorated, and he lost 31 pounds, his attorneys said.Transfers to two more facilitiesOn April 9, Abrego Garcia and four others were transferred to a differentsector in CECOT, “where they were photographed with mattresses and better food—photos that appeared to be staged to document improved conditions,” according to his attorneys.Around April 10, he was later transferred alone to a separate prison facility in Santa Ana, El Salvador. On April 10, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration must “facilitate” the return of Abrego Garcia — who had deportation protections from his home country of El Salvador since 2019.But for months, the Trump administration has argued that Abrego Garcia is in the custody of El Salvador, and the United States could not force El Salvador to return him.At the new location, Abrego Garcia “was frequently hidden from visitors, being told to remain in a separate room whenever outside visitors came to the facility,” according to the filing.“During his entire time in detention in El Salvador, Plaintiff Abrego Garcia was denied any communication with his family and access to counsel until Senator (Chris) Van Hollen visited him on April 17, 2025,” according to the brief.The Maryland Democrat traveled to El Salvador in an effort to bring back Abrego Garcia, who is a longtime Maryland resident.Criminal chargesWhile Abrego Garica was returned to the U.S. last month, it was to face federal criminal charges lodged in Tennessee while he was detained in El Salvador. His attorneys have denied the charges of human smuggling and say they are nothing more than the Trump administration trying to save face.Abrego Garcia’s criminal case is being handled out of a Tennessee court and he’s being kept in jail due to fears Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers will deport him.Department of Justice attorneys stated in the District Court of Maryland last week that the Trump administration plans to remove Abrego Garcia to a third country, but said the move was not immediate.Attorneys for Abrego Garcia are trying to move forward with discovery to determine if the Trump administration flouted the district court’s order and the Supreme Court’s order in refusing to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. after the Trump administration admitted his deportation was a mistake.“Defendants’ disdain for the law and legal process, and their cruelty, shocks the conscience and demands immediate, sustained, judicial relief and oversight,” according to the complaint. “It also marks a profound constitutional crisis in which executive agencies have repeatedly and deliberately flouted the authority of multiple federal courts—including the Supreme Court itself.”“This defiance undermines the foundational principles of our constitutional system by eroding the checks and balances and rule of law that protect individual liberty from government overreach,” the attorneys continued.",,,,2025-07-02 23:01:38.885073

Thompson Federal Courthouse in Nashville on June 13, 2025. (John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE — Kilmar Abrego Garcia will remain temporarily in jail at the request of his own attorneys, who cited conflicting positions taken by the government over whether he is at risk for immediate deportation.
An order issued Monday by U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes keeps Abrego in the custody of the U.S. Marshals until a July 16 hearing in Nashville.
The order also directs the U.S. Marshals to hold him “separately from persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody pending appeal” and to ensure he is able to privately confer with his attorneys.
Abrego, an apprentice sheet metal worker living in Maryland, was deported to a Salvadoran prison in March after a traffic stop as the Trump administration began ramping up immigration enforcement efforts.
Kilmar Abrego Garcia to appear in court for possible release, a move federal prosecutors oppose

A government lawyer later admitted Abrego, who entered the country illegally about a decade ago, had been deported in error. A 2019 order from an immigration judge prevents him from being deported to his native El Salvador due to fears of gang violence. The Supreme Court ordered the government to facilitate his return.
A grand jury indictment unsealed June 6 alleged Abrego served for years as a paid driver to transport immigrants who had crossed the U.S. border illegally to points around the country.
Abrego, 29, has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Attorneys for Abrego, who initially sought his pretrial release over the objection of federal prosecutors, last week asked for a delay due to “contradictory statements” made by government officials over his potential deportation.
Abrego Garcia lawyers want Trump administration fined for defying court orders

Both federal prosecutors and Abrego’s attorneys have conceded he will most likely be taken into the immediate custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials should he be granted pretrial release.
But government attorneys in Abrego’s separate immigration case told a Maryland judge last week that they expected ICE to begin the process of sending Abrego to a “third country.” The attorneys did not provide a timeline.
A White House spokesperson later denied Abrego would face imminent deportation.
In arguing their client be temporarily kept in jail, Abrego’s attorneys acknowledged the “irony” of their request.
“In a just world, he would not seek to prolong his detention further. And yet the government — a government that has, at all levels, told the American people that it is bringing Mr. Abrego back home to the United States to face ‘American justice’ — apparently has little interest in actually bringing this case to trial.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Department of Corrections announced that 35 men arrested and detained by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from out of state and held at the Anchorage Correctional Complex were transferred out of state on Monday.
ICE transferred 42 men to Alaska from out of state on June 8, as part of an ongoing agreement between the Department of Corrections and the U.S. Department of Justice, amid a nationwide deportation crackdown. The move sparked daily protests, a fact-finding hearing by the Alaska House Judiciary Committee, and concerns from attorneys and the American Civil Liberties Union of Alaska around the punitive conditions of detention, violations of due process and criminal confinement.
A spokesperson for the Department of Corrections said department Commissioner Jen Winkelman was not available for an interview on Tuesday to discuss the transfer, concerns around conditions of detention, and ongoing plans to house ICE detainees in Alaska.
“The ICE detainees who were transferred due to severe overcrowding in the Washington facility are no longer in the custody of the Alaska Department of Corrections,” said DOC spokesperson Betsy Holley in an email, in which she included the italics and underlining. She added that all questions on the details of the transfer should be directed to DHS/ICE.
Cindy Woods, a senior immigration law and policy fellow with the ACLU of Alaska, said the transfer was not unexpected, since DOC had said they agreed to hold detainees for 30 days. She also said she and several other attorneys were not notified of the transfers.
“Yesterday evening, I flagged the attorneys that I know represent folks who had been transferred, to let them know that they were being transferred again, and but none of them had been told by ICE prior to that,” she said.
Woods said all the detainees were going through civil immigration proceedings, and faced no criminal charges.
“These individuals were all in civil detention, so they were not being detained as part of an ongoing criminal proceeding. They were all in administrative immigration proceedings,” she said, and a number of the men have applied for or received asylum protections.
“And then there were also a handful of folks who were waiting for their immigration proceedings to commence,” she said. “And so (they) were waiting for the opportunity to speak with a judge about either a potential asylum claim or some other request for immigration relief.”
The ICE transfer of detainees to Alaska DOC custody raised serious concerns around standards of detention from legislators and advocates. Attorneys testified before the June 20 hearing of the Alaska House Judiciary Committee that despite no criminal charges, their clients reported that they were subject to lengthy lockdowns, overuse of handcuffs and overcrowding — sleeping three to a cell. In addition, they were denied or had limited access to calls with family and attorneys, regularly strip-searched after visits with attorneys, and subjected to use of force by DOC staff members, who pepper-sprayed a unit to stop a “verbal demonstration” on June 12, the attorneys said.
The ACLU of Alaska sent a letter on Saturday to Alaska state officials and ICE demanding detainees be removed from Anchorage Correctional Complex custody, and a stop to any additional transfers “unless and until constitutionally adequate conditions of confinement and attorney access can be guaranteed.”
The letter provided further detail on the pepper-spray incident: “This ‘verbal demonstration’ consisted of detainees requesting access to their belongings, including an individual who was trying to access his property to get the phone number for his consulate. Following the incident, many individuals experienced respiratory distress, including coughing, burning sensations in their mouth, nose, and eyes, and nosebleeds, and did not receive medical attention. They were also unable to change their clothes for an extended period of time.”
Holley said in the Department of Corrections’ emailed response to an interview request that the state did not make the call to transfer the detainees.
“The decision to transfer these detainees out of Alaska rested solely with the federal government. The decision was not influenced by the recent House Judiciary Committee hearing or the letter issued by the ACLU this past weekend,” Holley said.
“It is important to note the Alaska DOC routinely houses both civil detainees and federal prisoners. While we do not currently know whether ICE will request additional placements in the future, the Alaska DOC remains fully prepared to support DHS/ICE in coordinated efforts that prioritize public safety and the efficient use of government resources.”
The ACLU filed a class action lawsuit against the Department of Corrections in May challenging what they say is “inadequate, dangerous and inhumane” health care provided for incarcerated Alaskans.
Woods said the DOC protocols and detention conditions are unnecessary, and violated the men’s right to due process. “The conditions that they were all held in were punitive, whether or not that was the intention of the government, and such punitive nature are clearly outside the scope of the law, and especially when it comes to the standards and the requirements for civil detainees, who are not being held under criminal charges,” she said.
ICE did not respond to requests for comment about why the detainees were transferred to and from Alaska. Woods said she was able to search in the ICE inmate locator and confirm the men were transferred back to the ICE detention facility in Tacoma, Washington, with reportedly better conditions.
Woods said detainees reported the experience in DOC custody as humiliating.
“They were being held in really substandard conditions, being subjected to pepper spray and strip searches, and handcuffs, and all of those things. And so it was really hard for a lot of people to deal with that shift,” she said, referring to being transferred from Washington state to Alaska custody. “And especially because they were also largely cut off from those outside relationships that sustained them, particularly those who, you know, regularly spoke with their children and their parents and their loved ones who were not located in the United States — having that kind of completely shut off really impacted the individuals who experienced that.”
On Friday, seven U.S. congressional representatives from Washington and Oregon sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security questioning why detainees were transferred to Alaska,  as well as the cost and criteria for who is transferred. The letter also raised concerns that “ICE is wasting taxpayer dollars, flying dozens of people between detention centers thousands of miles apart, in efforts that do nothing to help protect Americans.”

(Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)A coalition of concerned Utah health, food aid and housing advocates rallied together on a virtual call Wednesday to raise alarms about “devastating” fallout if the massive tax and spending bill that’s been dubbed President Donald Trump’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act” gets approved.
Estimates for how many people in Utah would be affected have been a moving target as the bill has made its way through Congress, but advocates warn tens of thousands could lose Medicaid coverage and thousands more in Utah who rely on the nation’s largest federal food assistance program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), could be at risk of losing food benefits. 
They also warned “lives are at stake” because the proposed cuts could especially threaten Utah’s rural hospitals and clinics, which could lead to reduced access to healthcare. Further, they said the cuts would have far-reaching effects that would lead to job losses, increased hunger, and declining health for people across the nation, including Utah. 
Analysis: Upwards of 80K Utahns could lose health insurance under ‘big, beautiful’ bill’

“Over 60,000 Utahns could lose Medicaid coverage because of these cuts, which we know will hit rural Utah particularly hard,” said Nate Crippes with the Disability Law Center, which is also a member of the Protect Medicaid Utah Coalition. “On top of the coverage loss many Utahns — including children, those who are low income, who have disabilities, who are aging — will also now face greater insecurity.” 
Crippes said “thousands of jobs” across Utah could be at risk due to economic fallout from the cuts. 
“While the impacts on some communities will be abrupt,” he said, “the aftershock will be felt by all Utahns.” 
After the U.S. Senate passed its version of the bill Tuesday, it now awaits another vote in the U.S. House. Wednesday, the bill hit a roadblock as far-right members of the House GOP objected to the Senate’s version. Members of the House Freedom Caucus balked at several provisions in the sprawling bill, including that it would increase the federal deficit by $3.4 trillion. 
But a vote in the House still looms. And though advocates acknowledged their complaints may be falling on deaf ears from Utah’s all-Republican congressional delegation, they said they’re not going to stop fighting or give up hope — even if the cuts to Medicaid and SNAP get approved. 
They urged Utahns to do the same — not give up. 
“Whether there’s hope or not, the correct thing for anybody individually to do is still to contact your Congress person and make the effort,” said Neil Rickard, a child nutrition advocate with the advocacy group Utahns Against Hunger. “At the very worst, you’ve emphasized that these are very real issues. Whatever happens with the outcome of this bill, the core issues that we’re talking about right now are still going to exist.” 
But if the bill does pass? Rickard said the fight to restore Medicaid and SNAP benefits is just beginning. 
“We have a huge problem on our hands and we need to start addressing it,” he said. “It’s very bad … but the work does not stop.”
‘Absolutely the wrong time’ to shift SNAP costs to states
Among the advocates who warned against the cuts Wednesday was Glenn Bailey, executive director of Crossroads Urban Center, which he described as the “agency of last resort” that provides food pantry assistance to low-income Utahns.

He said SNAP and Medicaid help people from “falling through the cracks” and ending up in food pantries to begin with. Today, Bailey said Crossroads Urban Center serves up to 13,000 people every month between its two food pantries, “and the need is continuing to go up” amid Utah’s increasing housing costs. 
“This is absolutely the wrong time to make cuts in the safety net, particularly in food resources that help single parents,” Bailey said. He added that adding “red tape” like work requirements or other barriers would be a “big mistake,” especially “for the most vulnerable people in our communities.” 
If the bill passes, Bailey said the federal government will be “spending a whole lot more money and exploding the national deficit in order to do less for the people who need it the most.”
“It’s a big mistake,” he said. 
How would Utah deal with the cuts? Former legislator weighs in
Marsha Judkins, a moderate Republican from Provo who is a former Utah legislator who served on the Social Services Appropriations Subcommittee for six years, said the cuts will likely affect Utahns who need the services rather than weed out fraud because, she said, fraud in Utah’s programs is rare.
Judkins, who did not seek reelection last year, said she’s seen first-hand how legislators are “very careful about the money received from the federal government.” 
“The Medicaid and SNAP programs in Utah have very little fraud, misuse or waste,” she said. “The application process is very rigorous, and the clients on these programs are often reviewed to make sure that they still qualify.”
The proposed cuts could lead to several possible scenarios, she said, but “all of them have some fairly severe consequences to every-day Utahns.” 
“Legislators could decide to make the cuts permanent, and then they would either cut people from the programs or cut the benefits they are receiving,” she said. “Who would be cut and the services that would be cut? New moms, possibly receiving postpartum care. Addiction recovery. Services for those who have serious mental illness. Children who have complex health needs. Patients battling cancer.”

While proponents argue the cuts are meant to go after people committing fraud, Judkins said, “in Utah we simply don’t have that problem, and it’s going to be real people who are going to be cut. And they’re going to be cut from programs that they truly need.” 
She also warned that “unintended consequences” could be increased hospital costs, increased hospital visits, longer wait times for care, and increases in health insurance premiums, “and that’s just to name a few.” 
Rural hospitals at risk
Matthew McCollough, rural hospital improvement director for the Utah Hospital Association, warned rural hospitals are especially at risk from the cuts. 
Roughly 1,300 “critical access” hospitals, or hospitals that are located in rural and underserved areas, currently exist across the U.S., with an average operating margin of only 2.5%, “so they’re barely getting by,” he said. He added that 46% of rural hospitals are operating with a budget deficit, while in states that have not expanded Medicaid, 53% of those hospitals are operating in the red. 
He added that 188 rural hospitals nationwide have already closed or converted to a rural emergency hospital status “because they were unable to keep the doors open.” And about 432 rural hospitals are already vulnerable to closure. 
“And that’s today,” he said, adding that the federal cuts would only further jeopardize “an already very vulnerable, fragile rural healthcare system.” 
He stressed that it’s important to realize “these are real people that need care.”

(Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)In a 4-3 decision, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the state’s 1849 law banning abortion had been “impliedly repealed” by the Legislature when it passed laws over the past half century “regulating in detail the ‘who, what, where, when, and how’” of abortion.
The Court’s majority opinion, authored by Justice Rebecca Dallet and joined by Justices Ann Walsh Bradley, Jill Karofsky and Janet Protasiewicz, finds that the Legislature could not have passed laws regulating abortion access if the 1849 statute was believed to remain in effect.
“This case is about giving effect to 50 years’ worth of laws passed by the Legislature about virtually every aspect of abortion including where, when, and how health-care providers may lawfully perform abortions,” Dallet wrote. “The Legislature, as the peoples’ representatives, remains free to change the laws with respect to abortion in the future. But the only way to give effect to what the Legislature has actually done over the last 50 years is to conclude that it impliedly repealed the 19th century near-total ban on abortion, and that [the statute] therefore does not prohibit abortion in the State of Wisconsin.”
Dallet wrote that when the Legislature passed laws restricting abortion under narrower circumstances, guiding “where, when and how” health care providers could perform an abortion and outlining how public money could fund abortion providers, it was repealing the 1849 law.
The ruling comes three years after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark Court ruling that found there was a constitutional right to abortion access and marks the conclusion of a legal dispute that helped Protasiewicz win election to the Court in 2023 and Susan Crawford win election this April.
In response, the Court’s three conservative justices filed dissents, accusing the majority of “propaganda,” “smoke-and-mirrors legalese” and “pure policymaking.”
“The majority’s smoke-and-mirrors legalese is nothing more than ‘painting a mule to resemble a zebra, and then going zebra hunting. But paint does not change the mule into a zebra,’” Justice Annette Ziegler wrote. “Those in the majority know better, but they do so anyway because they like the result and promised to deliver it.”
In his dissent, Justice Brian Hagedorn wrote that the majority failed to show when the law was presumably repealed by the Legislature, saying that the opinion doesn’t properly address the Legislature’s actions in 2011 and 2015 amending the 1849 law.
“The majority does not say when over those 40 years the Legislature once and for all repealed [the statute],” he wrote. “Was it when the Legislature passed a postviability ban? A partial-birth abortion ban? A twenty-week ban? A waiting period? A physician licensing requirement? The majority fails to say.”
23AP2362 Mandate
Following the ruling’s release, the state’s Democratic elected officials and abortion access activists celebrated the decision as a “win” for reproductive health care in the state.
“Thanks to our lawsuit, today’s decision affirms that access to reproductive healthcare will continue to be available, helping ensure Wisconsin women today are not forced to face firsthand what it’s like to live in a state that bans nearly all abortions, even in cases of rape and incest,” Gov. Tony Evers said in a statement. “Today is a win for women and families, a win for healthcare professionals who want to provide medically accurate care to their patients, and a win for basic freedoms in Wisconsin, but our work is not over. I will continue to fight any effort that takes away Wisconsinites’ reproductive freedom or makes reproductive healthcare, whether birth control, abortion, IVF, or fertility treatments, any less accessible in Wisconsin than it is today. That is a promise.”
Attorney General Josh Kaul, who brought the lawsuit against the law, said at a Wednesday morning news conference that the decision was an important step toward ensuring all Wisconsinites have the freedom to access abortion care, but that the Legislature should step up and further clarify the law.
“I thought we were right on the law. The arguments we made have now been vindicated,” Kaul said. “But at a time when the rights of Wisconsinites and Americans are under threat, this case is a stark reminder of how important it is that we fight for our rights, that we advocate for what is in the best interest of the people of our state, and that we stand on the side of freedom. Here today, we were able to achieve a significant victory for the freedom of Wisconsinites.”
Wisconsin’s state and federal Democratic lawmakers responded to the ruling by saying it wasn’t enough, promising to continue working to codify abortion access in law.
U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said she will continue to work to enact her proposal to ensure women across the country have access to abortion care.
“Today’s ruling tells women across Wisconsin that we will not go back,” Baldwin said. “Today’s ruling tells women that our government trusts you to make decisions about your own body and your future. Today’s ruling tells women in our state that they are not second-class citizens. But, this fight is not over. Every woman, in every zip code, in every state deserves the same rights and freedoms. I will not stop fighting until we make that a reality and pass my bill to restore the right to abortion nationwide and allow women to make their own health care decisions without interference from judges or politicians.”
State Sen. Lisa Subeck (D-Madison) said the Legislature must now pass a bill guaranteeing the right to an abortion.
“Now that the courts have made it clear that Wisconsin does not have a total abortion ban, we must go further,” Subeck said. “It’s time to protect reproductive rights not just in practice, but in law. We must pass the Abortion Rights Restoration Act to guarantee the right to abortion and eliminate the medically unjustified, politically motivated restrictions that still exist in our state statutes. The people of Wisconsin deserve nothing less than full access to safe and legal reproductive health care without unnecessary barriers and free from judgement.”
In a concurring opinion, Karofsky wrote that interpreting the 1849 law as banning abortion gives the state the authority to “exert total control” over women and “strips women and pregnant people of the dignity and authority to make intimate and personal choices by exposing medical professionals who perform abortions to 15-year prison terms.”
In her opinion, Karofsky details the history of abortion access in the U.S. and highlights four women who died because of restrictive abortion bans, including the recent deaths of two Black women in Georgia and a Honduran immigrant in Texas as well as the death of her own great-grandmother in Boston in 1929.
“I tell the stories of Amber, Candi, Josseli, and my great-grandmother Julia to remind us that severe abortion restrictions operate like death warrants,” Karofsky wrote. “Under such restrictions women, children, and pregnant people are denied life-saving medical care while medical professionals are forced to sit idly at their bedsides, unable to do their jobs. Extreme abortion restrictions revive a time in our history driven by misogyny and racism, divorced from medical science; it is a world that must be left behind.”
In her dissent, Justice Rebecca Bradley accused Karofsky of rewriting history to achieve a desired outcome in the case.
“Not content with effacing the law, Chief Justice Jill Karofsky rewrites history, erases and insults women by referring to mothers as ‘pregnant people,’ slanders proponents of the pro-life perspective, and broadcasts dangerously false narratives about laws restricting abortion,” Bradley wrote. “Laden with emotion, steeped in myth, and light on the law, the concurrence reads as a parody of progressive politics rather than the opinion of a jurist.”

Meanwhile, the voting-rights group that filed the lawsuit is urging a federal court not to dismiss the case. 
The post Trump’s DOJ sides with Gray in voter registration lawsuit appeared first on WyoFile .","As a federal court prepares to make a key ruling on a lawsuit challenging Wyoming’s new voter registration law, the U.S. Department of Justice weighed in Tuesday, filing a statement of interest in the case. 
“This court should maintain the long-held position that preventing voter fraud and safeguarding voter confidence are legitimate state interests,” the department’s Civil Rights Division argued in its filing. 
In its own pair of motions, Equality State Policy Center, which filed the lawsuit in May, urged the court Monday not to dismiss the case, arguing the new law “threatens voting rights.”
The law, which took effect Tuesday, makes proof of state residency and U.S. citizenship part of the voter registration process in Wyoming. The law also requires someone registering to vote to attest that they’ve lived in the state for at least 30 days. 
Such regulations are unconstitutionally vague and impose an undue burden on the right to vote, the lawsuit alleges. It names Secretary of State Chuck Gray in his official capacity as a defendant in the case, along with all 23 county clerks. 
The complaint’s profile has risen considerably since it was initially filed, first attracting high-profile attorneys to both sides of the case, then the attention of the Republican National Committee and a coalition of 25 states and Guam. Now, the Trump administration wants to have a say. 
“Requiring documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote is a valid method for a State to achieve its interests in preventing fraud and safeguarding voter confidence in elections,” according to the DOJ’s filings. 
In a poll prior to November’s election, almost 90% of Wyoming adults said they expected their county’s tally of ballots for president in 2024 to be very or somewhat reliable, according to a University of Wyoming survey.
Gray, in a press release, welcomed the federal government’s involvement. 
“I am extremely grateful for President Trump’s and the DOJ’s leadership and prioritization of these important election integrity measures,” he said.
The harms described in the federal lawsuit are speculative, Gray’s attorneys have argued, and lack the kind of specificity required to have standing in a federal court. They’ve alleged that the nonprofit can’t point to specific examples of voters who will be disenfranchised by the new law.
In Monday’s filings, attorneys for ESPC pushed back on Gray’s suggestion, arguing that they’ve “submitted concrete evidence” and pointing to “three separate declarants attesting that they serve individuals who lack the identifying documents [the law] requires.”
“Secretary Gray is also incorrect that no voters facing a disproportionate impact are before the court,” the filing states. “For example, Plaintiff highlights the experience of domestic abuse survivors, thousands of whom live in Wyoming. These survivors are before the court as constituents of the Wyoming Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, one of the Plaintiff’s member organizations. And Plaintiff can adjudicate that harm on their behalf.” (Emphasis from the filing.)
Both parties have pointed to a legal doctrine known as Anderson-Budrick balancing, which “requires courts to weigh burdens that a state imposes on electoral participation against the state’s asserted benefits,” according to SCOTUSblog. 
But Gray’s attorneys have misconstrued the doctrine in his filings, according to ESPC’s motion, and “the Secretary offers no legally meaningful defense of the law. Thus, under binding precedent, and on this record, the Court should find Plaintiff is likely to succeed.” 
ESPC also filed a motion Monday opposing a proposed amicus brief from Guam and 25 states, including those that have passed similar voter registration laws to Wyoming. 
“For all states may posture during legislative sessions (or in amicus briefs) about the specter of non-citizen voting, the fact remains that there is no evidence that it is an actual problem — in Wyoming or anywhere else — and the amici tellingly point to none,” the filing states. 
The court made two decisions on Wednesday. 
For one, it set a deadline for ESPC to object to a separate proposed amicus brief from the Immigration Reform Law Institute — a legal nonprofit affiliated with the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which was founded by white nationalist and anti-immigration activist John Tanton. Plaintiffs have until Tuesday to do so. 
The court also granted a motion designating the county clerks as nominal parties, meaning they will technically remain a part of the case but will not have any responsibilities. 
In the meantime, the court must still rule on the plaintiff’s request to halt enforcement of the new law pending the lawsuit’s outcome.

Labor and environmental advocates are attacking the Congressional Republicans' tax cut megabill for rolling back clean energy programs enacted in the Biden administration. (Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)The tax cut megabill in Congress with a historic rollback on Medicaid also includes provisions reversing U.S. clean energy policies, advocates warned Wednesday, harming not only the environment but the economy.
“This legislation will kill economic growth and jobs, raise energy prices, and cede clean energy technology manufacturing to other countries,” said Carly Ebben Eaton, Wisconsin Policy Manager for the Blue Green Alliance, a coalition of labor unions and environmental groups.
Eaton took part in two online news conferences Wednesday to draw attention to the federal budget reconciliation bill and its repeal of key portions of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.
The budget bill has been the top priority of the Republican majority in Congress as well as the administration of President Donald Trump. It was drawn up to extend tax cuts enacted in 2017 during Trump’s first term that will expire at the end of 2025.
The package returned to the U.S. House for final action after a tied vote in the U.S. Senate that required Vice President JD Vance to pass the measure on Tuesday.
Steep cuts to Medicaid and federal nutrition programs have drawn the most attention during debate on the bill, along with the Congressional Budget Office finding that the wealthiest taxpayers will benefit most from its tax cuts.
The bill also includes measures that would undo several provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), one of the signature pieces of legislation enacted during President Joe Biden’s four years in office. After its passage the act was lauded by environmental advocates for provisions to address climate change by encouraging clean energy through tax credits as well as federal investments.
The House version of the GOP bill “already dealt a serious blow to clean energy tax credits and investments,” Eaton said Wednesday, “but the Senate took it even further, doubling down on cuts that will cost jobs, stall progress and raise energy costs.”
Consumer, business renewable energy incentives
The IRA’s tax breaks were designed to encourage consumers to move to energy-efficient and clean energy appliances and vehicles and encourage utilities and other businesses to increase their use of renewable resources such as solar energy and wind power.
Eaton said Wednesday that clean energy tax credits are supporting more than $8.6 billion in private investments in Wisconsin.
Garrik Harwick, assistant business manager of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers union Local 890 in Janesville, said that over the past three years more than 300 members have worked on solar projects in Southern Wisconsin. He spoke at a news conference with Eaton and several other union leaders.
The IRA tax breaks have encouraged those developments, Harwick said, and the investments have included increased apprenticeship slots, bringing in new trainees.
“These investments don’t just deliver clean energy,” Harwick added. “They create good paying union jobs that strengthen our local communities.”
He warned that repealing the tax credit will likely reduce the use of clean energy technologies and increase energy costs by 6% for homeowners and more than 9% for business customers.
The IRA’s provisions that encouraged apprenticeships helped “open doors that many didn’t even know existed,” said Andy Buck, government affairs director for the Wisconsin and Upper Michigan district of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades.
He said the union has added a number of jobs, including apprentices, installing energy-efficient glass in buildings on projects that were facilitated by the Inflation Reduction Act.
“When someone enters a registered apprenticeship program, they aren’t just learning a trade,” Buck said. “They’re building a career, gaining self-respect, and finding a path to a better life.”
Another provision of the 2022 law opened up tax credits for renewable energy to nonprofit organizations and government agencies, allowing them to receive direct payments to the federal government comparable to the value they’d receive from the tax credit if they paid taxes.
A new middle school being built in Menasha will include solar panels and energy storage, said Matt VanderPuy, a business agent for the Sheet Metal workers union in Sheboygan. The direct pay program will reimburse the district $3 million, he said, while the energy savings is projected at $190,000 per year.
“This is money that they can reinvest into the students, the teachers and the school district,” while saving on property taxes, VanderPuy said.
‘Very ugly impacts,’ says advocate
At another news conference, former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes observed that more than 90% of the jobs that IRA incentives helped create are in Republican congressional districts — although no Republicans in the state delegation voted for the bill. Barnes leads Forward Wisconsin, a nonprofit established during Biden’s term in the White House to inform people about the Biden administration’s infrastructure and climate investments and to defend them.
But business uncertainty this year, which Barnes blamed on GOP positions including Trump’s tariff executive orders, has led nationally to the cancellation of projects worth $15.5 billion, he said.
“The so-called big beautiful bill is going to have some very ugly impacts in Wisconsin, ripping away tax incentives for wind and solar farms, for rooftop solar, for farm sustainability programs, for clean cars and school buses,” said Amy Barrilleaux, communications director for Clean Wisconsin, at the event with Barnes. “And giving more tax breaks to big oil and gas companies does absolutely nothing to create jobs here or any opportunities here — it’s a gift to big oil at the expense of Wisconsin families and at the expense of our environment.”
Heather Allen, policy director for Elevate, an energy efficiency nonprofit, said as many as 11,000 clean energy and manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin could be at risk.
Plans for a $2.5 billion network of electric vehicle charging stations in the state have stalled, Allen said, and Wisconsin manufacturers that would have supplied components “are going to lose that opportunity now.”
“This legislation is going to strangle our solar businesses with red tape,” Allen said. “What you have here is an attack on small businesses that are delivering clean energy solutions to help families save money on their energy bills. And that includes solar installers, but it also includes other home energy contractors, other construction jobs.”
In four recent polls, a majority of those surveyed disapproved of the Republicans’  megabill — making it “more unpopular than any piece of major legislation that’s been passed since at least 1990,” Barnes said.
At the labor news conference, Emily Pritzkow, the Wisconsin Building Trades Council executive director, said advocates are urging people to contact their members of Congress.
“The polling on this is abysmal, and as long as people continue to call and deliver that message , that is what we need to do right now,” Pritzkow said. “Now is the time to weigh in, not once it’s coming to your front door, impacting you, your community, and people you care about.”

(Izzy Wagener/Minnesota Reformer)Even as U.S. House struggled to wrangle the votes to pass President Donald Trump’s major domestic policy initiative Wednesday, Minnesota progressives, food shelves and health care advocates sounded the alarm over the “big, beautiful bill” that would deliver steep cuts to Medicaid and food aid for low-income families.
“There are seniors who will not have care because of this bill. There are Minnesota low-income college students who will not be able to go to college because of this bill. There are people who will not be able to get health care, and people who get health care who are paying thousands of dollars more because of this bill,” said Rep. Emma Greenman, DFL-Minneapolis, at a Wednesday rally in Minnehaha Park.
The U.S. Senate on Tuesday passed Trump’s plan that would extend 2017 tax cuts and slashes spending on the Medicaid program for low-income people and people with disabilities. The legislation also shifts significant costs of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to states for the first time.
The U.S. House passed its own version of the bill in May and now House Republicans are facing pressure to pass the Senate’s version before Trump’s self-imposed Friday deadline. The Senate’s version includes steeper cuts to Medicaid compared to the House, though the House’s most far-right members want even more cuts and have threatened to withhold their votes if they don’t get their way.
Because of the tax cuts and increases in spending on defense and immigration enforcement, the plan would add about $3.3 trillion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
The richest 5% of American taxpayers would receive 44% of the net tax cuts next year, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.
The bill would hit state Medicaid programs across the country. All told, changes to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act in the Senate bill would cause 12 million additional people to be without health coverage in the next decade.
Over 1.2 million Minnesotans receive health care through Medicaid, known as Medical Assistance in Minnesota, and the congressional cuts would impact people’s health care coverage or their ability to access care. Many of Minnesota’s rural hospitals see a high rate of Medicaid patients, and they could see increased costs through uncompensated care.
Fair Share America rolled a dollar-green bus into Minnehaha Park Tuesday, where advocates and legislators gathered to protest the bill. It was part of the “Stop the Billionaire Giveaway,” a cross-country bus tour with a focus on the bill’s tax cuts for the wealthy.
Several Minnesota legislators and advocates gave speeches to a group of roughly 40 people, who staved off the summer heat with fans shaped like dollar bills.
Jerry Guritz, 72, and John Heidelberger, 72, attended the rally together. Sitting in the front row, they had signs reading “Tax the Rich” and “No Kings.” It was the first action Heidelberger had attended since the early 80s when he protested with the Teamsters.
“We’ve got to quit giving the richest people a free pass. They’ve got to pay their share. That’s where the revenue is going to come from, to aid all of the rest of us. I mean, the billionaires made their money off of the workers. Whichever industry it’s in, they’ve had workers,” Heidelberger said.
Zach Rodvold, public affairs director for Second Harvest Heartland, said that food shelves across Minnesota have seen a vast increase in demand, which will be exacerbated if the bill passes.
“This could affect benefits for as many as 150,000 Minnesotans in the near term through cuts to benefits, or outright stripping people of their benefits altogether,” Rodvold said in a virtual press conference Wednesday. “Over time, it will affect every Minnesota SNAP participant because it makes it harder for benefits to keep up with costs over the next 10 years.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSC_0035-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-07-02 20:05:39.873305

Kelly Armstrong hold a press conference to show their support for the reconciliation bill passed by the Senate earlier this week. (Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)Amid national controversy over Congress’ “big, beautiful bill,” U.S. Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., promised the legislation will bring tax relief to North Dakota residents.
The nearly 1,000-page bill was approved in the Senate on Tuesday. The House now must reconcile the Senate’s version of the legislation with the package it passed in May.
Hoeven and other Republican members of Congress have cheered the bill for its tax cuts, protections for farmers and investment into immigration enforcement and deportations.
Hoeven highlighted that the Senate version of the bill will reduce taxes by more than $4 trillion over the next 10 years. Higher-income Americans and corporations would see the largest tax cuts, though both chambers’ packages also propose tax reductions on tips. 
US House GOP struggles to advance megabill against Freedom Caucus resistance

“These are the fundamentals that make our state stronger,” he said at a Wednesday press conference with Gov. Kelly Armstrong in Bismarck. “Now we’re getting these things implemented at the federal level.”
Critics of the “big, beautiful bill” argue it would push millions of Americans off of Medicaid, undermine other social safety net programs like food stamps and grow the national debt.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in an analysis published Tuesday said the bill would add $3.4 trillion in deficits over the next decade.
Armstrong, a former member of Congress, said he is generally skeptical of the office’s numbers and that its analysis of the bill low-balls the positive effects it would have on the economy.
“I think they drastically, drastically underestimate the impact for North Dakota,” he said.
A Legislative Council analysis of the bill published last week also estimated that it would reduce Medicaid enrollment in North Dakota by roughly 18% within the next 10 years, in part due to proposed changes to eligibility requirements that would force all able-bodied Medicaid recipients to work.
Hoeven said the only people who would lose access to Medicaid under the bill are people who can work but choose not to.
“For all the traditional Medicaid population, nobody loses their Medicaid,” he said.
The reconciliation bill has also caught criticism for proposing changes to SNAP, the nutrition program formerly known as food stamps. The House bill would require states to pay a percentage of food benefit costs for the first time. The Senate proposes only implementing this change for states that can’t get their error payment rates below a certain percentage. Error payment rates measure how accurately states determine who qualifies for SNAP and how much assistance to give them.
Federal funding cuts to North Dakota agencies total $100M so far, analysis shows

Hoeven also said that both chambers’ bills increase the child tax credit, which currently is $2,000 per child. The House proposed increasing the credit to $2,500, while the Senate proposed increasing it to $2,200.
North Dakota’s two other Congressional delegates, Sen. Kevin Cramer and Rep. Julie Fedorchak, also voted in favor of the package.
The North Dakota Democratic-NPL Party in a statement earlier this week criticized the package as potentially devastating for people who rely on federal social programs.
“North Dakota taxpayers will be left holding the bag when our elected officials rubber stamp this disastrous bill,” Rep. Zac Ista, House minority leader for the North Dakota Legislature, said in the announcement.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)Pennsylvania education leaders are scrambling after the Trump Administration said it would withhold more than $230 million in congressionally approved funding for after-school programs, teacher training, literacy, and education for migrant and non-English speaking students.
A spokesperson for the state Department of Education said the U.S. Department of Education informed officials Monday evening of a delay in the release of funding that was due to be available starting Tuesday. 
The action is separate from the budget reconciliation bill pending final approval in the U.S. House.
Education advocates told the Capital-Star on Wednesday the failure to release the funds was reckless and unlawful and would affect the commonwealth’s most vulnerable students.
“These federal funds support key programs that expand learning for our most underserved students,” Maura McInerney, legal director of the Education Law Center of Pennsylvania, said in a statement.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
State House Education Committee Chairperson Peter Schweyer (D-Lehigh) said the announcement caught state and local school officials off guard, which came days after the deadline for school districts to approve their budgets.
The uncertainty also arrived as the General Assembly continues negotiations over the state budget.
According to an analysis by Education Week, the $230 million due Pennsylvania is the sixth largest amount among the states after California, Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois. 
Schweyer said he learned of the funding freeze from a school superintendent in his legislative district who had received a “terse” email from the state. He learned further details about the Trump administration’s decision from a New York Times article.
“To say we had no idea this is coming is absolutely accurate,” Schweyer said.
The federal Education Department referred questions to the White House Office of Management and Budget, which did not respond.
He said the funding freeze comes as many school districts and partner organizations are working to finalize agreements and hire staff for after school and summer programs. Rural communities where independent nonprofit organizations such as the YMCA and Jewish community centers are less common are likely to be hit harder, he said.
“The Trump administration is beyond reckless. This Congress is beyond impotent. They’re hurting the families we all collectively serve,” Schweyer said.
Funding for seven federal programs totaling nearly $7 billion nationwide is affected. Five of the programs support K-12 schools, while the other two help schools, community colleges and other organizations provide adult literacy and civics education.

McInerney said the programs benefit children affected by poverty through summer school and after-school tutoring and enrichment programs; immigrant students and English learners, children of migrant workers; youth in the foster care system and juvenile justice system; and adults seeking basic education as a pathway to post-secondary education and employment. 
The state Education Department  provided estimates of the impact on commonwealth schools and other organizations that receive the funds:

Title I-C, Migrant Education, $11 million
Title II-A, Supporting Effective Instruction, $70 million
Title III-A, English Language Acquisition, $20 million
Title IV-B, 21st Century Community Learning Centers, $54 million
Adult Education Basic Grants to States, $20 million

“We are assessing the impact of this delay and will keep school leaders and local programs informed. We are also determining any next steps,” department spokesperson Erin James said. “PDE will continue to share updates as they become available and is committed to supporting Pennsylvania schools, educators, and learners throughout this process.”
McInerney said withholding the funds is a violation of the Impoundment Control Act, which regulates how the president can delay or rescind spending that has already been approved by Congress.
“The unilateral withholding of these congressionally appropriated funding streams without any justification or warning to Congress is outrageous and unlawful.  The administration cannot unilaterally delay or cancel appropriations already enacted into law. Only Congress holds this constitutional power,” McInerney said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/shauneen-doe-building-exterior_0-1024x7681742509292-1.jpg,,,2025-07-02 20:05:39.873305

Ian Masters, R-Berkeley, was not responsible for making an antisemitic comment on Instagram last month.","Del. Pat McGeehan, R-Hancock, addresses the House of Delegates during a floor session on Friday, Feb. 2, 2024, in Charleston, W.Va. (Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)House Majority Leader Pat McGeehan shared more details Wednesday regarding the proof he says he’s collected showing Del. Ian Masters, R-Berkeley, was not responsible for making an antisemitic comment on Instagram last month.
McGeehan — in an interview for WRNR TV — said he personally investigated the accusation against Masters and found the person who he says left the comment from an Instagram account that was using Masters’ full name and that linked to the Citizens Defense League, where Masters once served as president.
The comment in question was left on June 21 by an account with the handle @NoQuarterMasters in response to another comment on a post from April 12 about Dave Portnoy, founder of Barstool Sports. 
In a June 25th interview with West Virginia Watch, Masters denied leaving the comment and said he didn’t have “any active Instagram account.” The next day, House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, R-Clay, told MetroNews Talkline that Masters told him the @NoQuarterMasters account used to be his, but he no longer used it. 
According to McGeehan’s radio interview, Masters knew the person who allegedly left the comment through his late brother. When Masters was visiting his hometown in Hancock County “sometime last year,” McGeehan said he ran into the “younger guy” and wanted to help him.
“… [Masters] gave resources to him — gave money, he gave him his old iPhone which didn’t have any cellular service, but you could work it with WiFi or whatever,” McGeehan said.
McGeehan said Masters’ social media accounts, including Instagram, were still logged in on the phone. The person opened them, McGeehan said, and used Masters’ account to leave the antisemitic comment.
“I don’t even think he knew he was on [Masters’] account,” McGeehan said.
McGeehan would not name the individual who he claims made the comment, saying he was “very sick,” “basically homeless” and living with substance use disorder after a recent extended hospital stay where he woke up from an almost two-month-long coma.
“Look, this is a guy that is probably going to eventually die in the near future, either from the disease he has or from overdosing on the narcotics he’s been prescribed to deal with it,” McGeehan said. “… so I’m not getting [him] involved.”
West Virginia Watch left a voicemail for McGeehan on Tuesday afternoon. He responded via text: “Do not contact me.”
When asked by WRNR host Bill Stubblefield if law enforcement should be getting involved as the person who left the comment “hacked” an elected official and impersonated him online, McGeehan laughed.
“Ha. No. This is over as far as I’m concerned,” McGeehan said. “… There’s a lot of things that would go into [an official investigation] and I’m not going to have some sort of witch hunt. I’ve done due diligence.”
Shortly after Masters’ interview with West Virginia Watch last week, the name on the account was changed from “Ian T. Masters” to “I. Masters.” Masters told Hanshaw, according to MetroNews, that he couldn’t access the account and needed tech support from Instagram to change the password. 
The profile picture on the @NoQuarterMasters account shows a letter addressed to “Ian” in Chester, West Virginia — where Masters grew up, McGeehan said Wednesday. 
The letter is partially covered up by runes burnt into wooden pendants hanging from strings. 
McGeehan said the letter in the profile picture was from Masters’ late brother, who died by suicide in 2014. The runes, McGeehan said, were “symbols from Scandinavian Norse mythology” and were meant to be an “homage” to Masters’ brother as the two grew up reading Norse literature.
The runes include several symbols listed by the Anti-Defamation League, an advocacy organization dedicated to stopping anti-semitism across the world, as antisemitic symbols used by groups and individuals espousing white supremacist, neo-Nazi and antisemitic ideals.
Masters has not commented publicly on this situation, however he is scheduled to give an interview to WRNR on Thursday morning. He could not be reached by phone on Wednesday.
The state Democratic Party has called on Speaker Hanshaw to perform a “full forensic investigation” of Masters’ devices, social media accounts and email; seek an explanation of the account’s profile picture and the symbols within it as well as how the name and bio on the account were changed after his interview with West Virginia Watch if he did not have access to the account.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Pat-McGeehan-20240202.jpg,,,2025-07-02 19:08:06.281567

The council, a nonprofit which distributes funds to 52 family planning centers in Missouri and three in Oklahoma, has been operating without key federal funding for three months. It received notice last week that funds were being restored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and Wednesday, a letter arrived awarding the organization another year of Title X funding.
The decades-old Title X program funds access to family-planning options, like contraception, cancer screenings and testing and treatment for sexually-transmitted diseases. In fiscal year 2024, MFHC received $8.5 million from the program, covering 56,000 patient visits at clinics.
“While we had raised emergency funds to support health centers in providing services, those funds were dwindling,” the nonprofit’s executive director Michelle Trupiano told The Independent. “We and our health centers were about to make some really tough decisions about how to keep doors open and keep services.”
At the end of March, the Trump Administration froze Title X funding to 16 nonprofits in an effort to crack down on diversity, equity and inclusion efforts barred by the President’s executive order. Nearly one in five grantees were impacted. Missouri was one of seven states that, as a result of the suspension, no longer had Title X funds, according to a KFF Health News report.
Trupiano said that the federal government requested information on MFHC and the clinics it helps fund, looking into discrimination policies. MFHC submitted the requested documents and didn’t hear back until the letter of restoration came last week.
“We hadn’t done anything wrong to begin with,” Trupiano said. “Therefore, it’s unclear what we did to correct it because they did not ask us any follow-up questions.”
The Missouri Family Health Council is one of four nonprofits to get funding restored. Others continue to operate without Title X funding or are forced to close doors.
At the end of May, a Planned Parenthood clinic in Ohio stopped operations, citing the loss of Title X funds.
There is an active lawsuit filed by the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association and the American Civil Liberties Union challenging the federal government’s withholding of the funds. Missouri Family Health Council is mentioned in the complaint.
Despite the restoration of funds, Trupiano is anxious about the future of Title X, especially given that President Donald Trump’s 2026 budget request includes cutting all Title X family-planning grants.
“We are concerned about what the future holds,” she said. “That is why we are so relieved that this funding was released so that the health centers can provide as much care to as many people as they can for as long as they can.”

“We’ve already had 600 fires start in Washington” this year, Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove said during a press conference Wednesday. Four hundred of those fires were on state-owned land, he added.
“Don’t be an idiot, don’t set our state on fire this weekend, and have a fun, safe Fourth of July,” Upthegrove said. 
Citing data that shows fireworks were responsible for 156 injuries and 271 fires in Washington last year, with the highest concentration of incidents occurring on the Fourth of July, the state fire marshal is encouraging residents to view fireworks at a public display rather than igniting their own. 
For those who do choose to set off their own fireworks, the fire marshal advises them to only use legal, consumer-grade fireworks that don’t show signs of tampering or damage. Officials also warn against pointing fireworks at others or consuming alcohol when handling fireworks. And they advise keeping sparklers and fireworks away from anyone’s body, and having a water source like a bucket or a hose nearby. 
It’s legal to buy or sell fireworks in Washington until 9 p.m. on July 5. 
Under state law, fireworks can only be discharged between noon and 11 p.m. from June 28 through July 5.  
Some counties and cities across Washington have their own fireworks restrictions that supersede state guidelines. 
With much of the state abnormally dry or in drought, counties in eastern and western Washington have also already been imposing burn bans this summer.
As of Wednesday, InciWeb, the federal website that displays wildfire information, showed a roughly 1,900-acre, lightning-sparked fire burning in north-central Washington, mostly in the Glacier Peak Wilderness. It had not led to evacuations and was not threatening any structures.
Fireworks are prohibited year-round on all public lands in Washington, including state parks, beaches and land managed by federal and state agencies. 
After volunteers removed over 129,000 pounds of trash from Washington beaches last Fourth of July weekend, Washington State Parks is asking beach visitors to clean up after themselves and pack out their trash this year. 
To help reduce litter, volunteers with Grassroots Garbage Gang will hand out garbage bags to visitors at the Seaview, Sid Snyder, Bolstad, Cranberry, Klipsan, Ocean Park and Oysterville beach approaches from 4 to 8 p.m. on July 4. 
Washington State Parks and a handful of nonprofits, including Washington CoastSavers, Grassroots Garbage Gang, Surfrider Olympia and Grays Harbor Surfrider, will also host volunteer beach cleanup events along the coast from 9 a.m. to noon on July 5. 
In addition to the year-round fireworks ban, the Department of Fish and Wildlife is restricting several fire-related activities on land it manages in eastern Washington until further notice due to increased wildfire risk.  
Restricted activities include campfires, target shooting, smoking, welding, operating chainsaws, and operating a motor vehicle away from developed roads. 
“This year’s forecast shows an increased risk of wildfires statewide,” Department of Fish and Wildlife Lands Division Manager Kevin Connally said in a statement. “These restrictions help protect local communities, as well as critical wildlife habitat, and we all have a responsibility to our shared outdoor spaces.” 
July 2 marks National Wildland Firefighter Day. Upthegrove and several fire officials took time Wednesday to honor three Idaho firefighters who were shot Sunday in an ambush in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, while responding to a brush fire, as well as Washington firefighters who died in the line of duty last year. 
“One of the best ways we can honor those that are putting their lives on the line is to do our part to reduce the risk of wildfire, to prevent folks from having to go out and respond in the first place,” Upthegrove said during the press conference, held in Ellensburg. 
Fire season preparation in Washington was made more difficult this year by state budget cuts and federal layoffs, “but we’re ready, at the Department of Natural Resources, thanks to strong partnerships with other agencies,” Upthegrove said. 
“We’re heading into a very, very busy time,” said Kittias Valley Fire and Rescue Chief SJ Goldsmith, citing drought conditions and winds.
“It’s going to take just one spark to create a disaster for our community,” Goldsmith said. “Please make sure that we are taken care of and we don’t have to come put out a fire and risk our lives for your negligence.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fireworks-1024x600.jpg,,,2025-07-02 19:08:06.281567

The community college announced this week its Senior Companion Program, an Americorps-funded initiative, has paused operation as its funding is being held and reviewed by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, Hawkeye Community College Provost Lynn LaGrone said.
Americorps provides funds for programs working with volunteers ages 55 and older to help older adults with special needs live independently and comfortably through the Senior Companion Program. At Hawkeye Community College, LaGrone said the program operates with a $500,000 budget, $400,000 of which comes from Americorps.
College officials, program participants and clients are waiting and hoping the program is deemed valuable enough to the community to get the funding that was already approved by Congress.
“We are such an incredible part of this community that it hurts deeply to not be able to continue to offer a service that benefits some of our most vulnerable constituents,” LaGrone said.

Hawkeye Community College has offered the program since 1976, LaGrone said. Before the halt of operations, 52 senior companions helped 78 clients with what they needed most, whether it be transportation, cleaning or just camaraderie. With other federal grant uncertainty in higher education, she said the college was aware this could happen.
To ensure clients are aware of what’s going on and understand why their companions are no longer stopping by as usual, Executive Director of Public Relations and Marketing Mary Pat Moore said the program head is calling each client personally to “let them know that we’re not abandoning them” and provide advice and resources to try to fill the gap.
Vicky Buss, a second-generation companion who followed in her mother’s footsteps, said she gets paid $4 an hour to meet with three clients multiple times each week. What she does depends on the client’s wishes and needs, she said, but they are always overjoyed to see her stop by and sad to see her go.
“It’s not the money, per se, but it’s just that I feel like these people are people, human beings, and they need the companionship, they need the hugs, they need the caring, you know, and they don’t get that other (than) from us,” Buss said.

This is a program unlike most, LaGrone said, and addresses a growing concern of loneliness becoming a public health crisis. With many of the clients homebound and volunteers all being older adults, the program helps alleviate isolation alongside more practical problems.
“This, to me, adds to part of the crisis, because these were baby steps in the big pool of things, but they were so essential and important to the people who depended on this service,” LaGrone said.
The college has started exploring other funding options in case its federal dollars are permanently lost, but LaGrone said she is remaining “cautiously optimistic” that the funds will be released and the program can continue on like normal. As one of the college’s oldest programs, the community doesn’t want to let it slip away.
Some of the companions are still going out to visit their clients, on their own time and dime, LaGrone said, because of the deep connections and caring the program has facilitated. Buss said she plans to keep seeing at least one of her clients, who has cerebral palsy and always cries when she has to leave.
“I just don’t understand why the government ain’t working with us and helping us out to help them, because in the long run, we’re helping them out, keeping people in their homes,” Buss said.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Back in February, South Dakota lawmakers recognized emergency medical services as an “essential service.”
Sort of.
“Essential service” typically means the government has to guarantee access to said service by providing or funding it.
The majority of states don’t affix that designation to ambulance services.
South Dakota lawmakers voted unanimously in favor of a non-binding resolution that says the Legislature “supports efforts to prioritize emergency medical service as an essential public service.”
Grant funds bolster rural ambulances with training, equipment

There were other efforts in Pierre that didn’t get quite so warm a reception.
Two days after the passage of that resolution, lawmakers shot down a bill that would’ve required counties and municipalities to provide ambulance services. Eight days after that, they shot down a similar bill that would’ve created a state fund to divert some money from criminal fines to help pay for services.
Instead of backing those bills, they chartered a committee to study the issue and stocked it with five senators and six representatives. 
On Monday, that group of lawmakers convened in Pierre to talk about long-term survival for the ambulance services now provided by a mix of paid and volunteer response teams across the state. 
The Emergency Medical Services Interim Committee heard testimony on low passage rates for emergency medical technician exams, a decline in volunteerism and the difficulty of setting up an ambulance district, a legal entity.
But one issue loomed over all others.
“The biggest thing I want to get across is that somebody has got to be responsible for funding us,” said Maynard Konechne, director of the South Dakota Emergency Medical Services Association and a presenter during the Monday meeting.
The study group, which reconvenes on July 23, is tasked with producing a report for lawmakers on the sustainability of ambulance services in South Dakota, with a focus on three areas:

Staff recruitment, training and retention.
Access to care in rural areas far from trauma care centers.
Efficiencies in operations.

Citizens expect an ambulance to show up regardless of how far they live from the nearest hospital, said Sen. Tim Reed, R-Brookings, one of the committee’s two leaders. That means the group — and the Legislature as a whole — has to be ready to change the way it thinks about emergency medical services (EMS).
“We have to be willing to have a conversation about how we recognize, support and potentially restructure EMS as an essential part of our public safety system, just like law enforcement or fire services,” said Sen. Tim Reed, R-Brookings, co-chair of the committee.
Rural areas, declining volunteers, low reimbursement rates
The average emergency medical technician in South Dakota is 51 years old, according to survey data collected by the state Department of Health. 
The department regulates and offers technical support to the state’s 121 licensed ambulance services. It also offers training, collects data, and, for the past three years, has been in the process of disbursing $20 million in COVID-era funding to modernize and bolster ambulance services across the state. 
New report recommends state efforts to sustain rural ambulance services

Marty Link, the director of the department’s Emergency Medical Services and Trauma Program, told the committee that South Dakota has 28 active emergency medical technicians (EMTs) between 70 and 75 years old — and two in their 80s.
“They’re doing great work, and I love them dearly,” said Link, himself a longtime service provider, but aging providers are part of the reason the state urged ambulance services to apply for grants to buy “power cots.” The cots lift and push patients into place without the aid of paramedic muscle, which allows older providers to stay on duty a few more years. 
The trouble is that fewer people are signing on to be volunteer technicians, Link said, and more stringent testing requirements have become a hurdle in recent years. 
Just 56% of the South Dakotans who took their paramedic test with the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians passed on the first try this year. EMTs aren’t as highly trained as paramedics, but also must pass a test, often after completing a 190-hour certification course. The passage rate for South Dakota EMT hopefuls in 2025 thus far is 72%.
Paramedic and state Rep. Eric Emery, D-Rosebud, told the committee his first emergency medical course lasted eight hours. Increasing professionalization has meant a more skilled response team, he said, but it’s also put some people off.
Twenty-eight ambulance services in South Dakota are all volunteer. Another 24 have a mix of paid staff and volunteers, and still more are paid per-call.
Training can be ‘“four, five, six months of their life for something that they may not even be compensated for,” Emery said.
Jerome Harvey of Pennington County, a volunteer firefighter, told the committee he doesn’t see the volunteer model as workable long-term.
“The number one issue is steady state funding and realizing the fact that it is a profession,” he said. “We have to recognize that we’re on the other side of the mountain, on the other side of the pyramid, on the downhill slide in terms of volunteerism.”
Recruitment and retention were the number one needs identified in health department surveys of ambulance agencies, part of a 2023 sustainability assessment.
On Monday, Link and Health Secretary Melissa Magstadt trumpeted the department’s “Telemedicine in Motion” program, which has equipped 84% of South Dakota ambulance agencies with tablets that connect to doctors who can advise EMTs on how to best deal with traumatic issues.
Reimbursement troubles
Lemmon, in far northwestern South Dakota, is among the more rural of the state’s rural enclaves. Its nearest hospital is 26 miles away in Hettinger, North Dakota. 
State spends $11.6 million to update equipment for South Dakota ambulance services

Some of Lemmon’s ambulance services are delivered on a pay-per-call basis, but the call cost often outpaces the pay. Medicare covers about $650, Lemmon EMT Association Treasurer Carrie Derschan said, and Medicaid reimbursements pay around $400.
“That’s about 56%,” of the cost to run a patient from the Lemmon nursing home to the nearer hospital.
“We have to write the rest of that off,” she said.
A “Big, Beautiful Bill” packed with President Trump’s policy prescriptions is currently up for debate in Congress. The bill’s provisions have been revised multiple times so far, but Konechne, the EMS Association leader, said he worries that its proposed cuts to Medicaid will exacerbate the issues facing the mobile medical teams.
“We’re struggling the way it is,” said Konechne. “And now we’re going to take another hit. They’re not doing that for police and firefighters.”
Next steps
An increase to the base rate paid by Medicare and Medicaid in South Dakota for ambulance rides is among the funding options listed by the health department in its Monday presentation. Also suggested was funding help for training courses from the state, more investment from local communities for operational needs, and additional fees for “super speeders” or drunken drivers, earmarked to fund medical services.
Community buy-in is already part of the funding puzzle for rural ambulance services. 
Spearfish pitches in $50,000 a year, that city’s EMS director said. In Buffalo, a northwestern city near the Montana border, financial support for the Harding County service’s 2,500-square-mile coverage area comes from local businesses.
“They realize that we are health care,” said Annette Slaba, Harding County’s EMS director.

Emery sponsored one of the bills to require counties and cities to fund ambulance services that failed to earn support back in February. 
His included a plan to siphon some of the money the state collects in criminal fines into an EMS fund, from which localities could pull grants for their operations. It would have started with $1 million from the state general fund, but Emery said during debate on the measure that the fund would probably need $50 million a year to meet the state’s needs.
Committee member Sen. Tamara Grove, R-Lower Brule, said Monday that she feels like citizens wouldn’t balk at paying additional taxes for emergency medical services, as long as they understood where their money was going.
“We want quality people in those ambulances,” Grove said. “We want people who know what they’re doing and are willing to show up at our worst moments.”
Sen. Reed suggested that lawmakers could simplify the process of starting an ambulance district, around 20 of which exist today as multi-county, or multi-community partnerships. If state law makes it too difficult to set up those districts, Reed said, it might make sense to simplify the process to let communities take the lead.
“I don’t think we want the state starting to draw lines,” Reed said. “It’s best for communities to work together and figure this out. A taxing district would be a way of doing that.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/original_978949a6-1724-4a75-b829-cadf69a4b1da_PXL_20221118_164635230-scaled-e1668887227535-1024x778.jpg,,,2025-07-02 19:08:06.281567

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Motorized cots and chairs, emergency medical technician training and life support dummies are among the purchases made by local ambulance services through two rounds of grant awards from the South Dakota Department of Health.
Some of those items came up during the first meeting of the Legislature’s Emergency Medical Services Interim Committee this week in Pierre. That body is studying ways to maintain the viability of the state’s ambulance services, which operate without state funding through a hodgepodge of paid, paid-per-call and volunteer frameworks.
The $7.5 million in grants for local agencies originated with federal COVID relief funding. Former Gov. Kristi Noem asked lawmakers to set aside $20 million of that money in 2022 to bolster local ambulance services.


The money came in three phases. The first $1.7 million was used to fund Telemedicine in Motion, which uses electronic tablets in ambulance vehicles to connect paramedics and other mobile medical providers to doctors who can help guide their responses. 
In the second phase, the state purchased and distributed LIFEPAK 15 patient monitors and defibrillators, along with training for their use, at a cost of $11.6 million.
The third step involved $7.5 million in grants to individual ambulance providers. Those were made available after the completion of a statewide assessment of sustainability for emergency medical services, paid for during the second funding phase. To apply, applicants were required to read the assessment and ask for items that could fill the gaps identified by the report. 
“We said, ‘If you want to apply for a grant, you have to be able to read the study, to read what was done statewide,” Marty Link, the Health Department’s director of emergency medical services, told the committee on Monday. “We didn’t want that just sitting on the shelf.”
Equipment, training purchased through grant awards
Among other things, the sustainability report cited recruitment and retention, an aging volunteer base and funding for equipment as major needs. 
To that end, dozens of local agencies applied for grants to purchase motorized “power cots” and stair chairs, which allow medics to transfer patients without the physical strain.
Fifteen of the 44 grants in round one, awarded in July 2024, included one or more power cots and chairs, distributed across 14 communities. Some of those grants also included money for instructor training, training classes, medical simulation mannequins and software.
Lawmakers look for ways to deliver on support for ‘essential’ ambulance service

Another 18 of the round two grants awarded last November involved the purchase of mobile people-movers.
“With an aging workforce and patients who are getting larger and larger, it helps us get people safely in and out of the house,” said Alan Perry, who heads up the ambulance service in Lennox and is the president of the South Dakota Emergency Medical Services Association.
Perry’s agency bought one power cot and one stair chair with a $45,000 grant, awarded last July. The agency got another $25,200 in the second round to produce a strategic planning report for Lennox, and to buy bright, wearable lights for use by those who respond to incidents on highways at night.
Training was also a focus area. In Spink County, the ambulance service was able to hire two emergency medical technicians and put on a training course for other technician hopefuls. Twelve of the 17 people who qualified to take the national exam passed and were certified, according to the Department of Health’s presentation to lawmakers on Monday.
Grant money for patient transfer database
The largest single grant went to the South Dakota Association of Health Care Organizations for a project that aims to boost efficiencies statewide. 
The group is using its $500,000 grant to set up an interfacility transfer system that it hopes will create “a single portal where neighboring ambulance services can view and select available transfers” by November 2026.
Link pointed to that project during the study committee’s first meeting. 
Ambulances that move patients without emergency needs from one facility to another – like a patient who needs to ride from a nursing home in Chamberlain to an orthopedic hospital in Sioux Falls – can create hazards for their own communities by doing so, he said.
“There’s a lot of concern with ‘How do we maintain that ambulance presence within our local community when we have an ambulance going over the road?” Link said.

As a result, local ambulance services may decline to give the ride or ask that the patient wait for a ride, according to Tim Rave, director of the association. On any given day, Rave told South Dakota Searchlight, there are up to 80 people in the state who are in a hospital that ought to be somewhere else.
That’s the kind of information the association’s collected with its grant funding, Rave said, as it looks to find out how prevalent the issue is. The database the association aims to build would make it easier to alert ambulance services in any given area to patients in need of a ride, Rave said.
In the future, he said, such a database could help ambulances do things like pick up patients from the hospital to which they’ve just delivered a different patient and bring them home.
That would allow a service to “get paid both ways.”
“That’s the sweet spot we’d love to get to, but that feels a little bit like a stretch goal at this point,” Rave said.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/PXL_20221118_164408441-scaled-e1668887078839-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-02 19:08:06.281567

Keith Kautz left the high court last year due to the state’s mandatory retirement age. He takes over as Wyoming’s top legal official as state attorneys defend a string of anti-abortion laws in court.
The post Gordon names former Wyoming Supreme Court justice who spoke out against abortion as new attorney general appeared first on WyoFile .","Keith Kautz, a retired Wyoming Supreme Court justice known to carry deep religious convictions against abortions, will become the state’s next attorney general, Gov. Mark Gordon announced Tuesday.
Kautz stepped down from the bench last March, when he turned 70 years old — the legally mandated retirement age for justices in Wyoming’s high court. He is, in essence, swapping positions with Bridget Hill, who served as Wyoming AG until Gordon appointed her in April to fill the supreme court seat left open by the retirement of former Chief Justice Kate Fox earlier this year. 
Fox and Kautz were admirers of each other’s passion for the rule of law, though they often disagreed on judicial decisions, WyoFile reported in a November 2023 piece on Kautz’s retirement. 
Kautz grew up around Huntley, Wyoming, and Lyman, Nebraska, and has a University of Wyoming law degree. Gov. Mike Sullivan first appointed him to the bench in 1993, and Gov. Matt Mead appointed him to the high court in 2015. 
Kautz will become the state’s top law enforcement officer, and its chief litigator, at a time when women’s right to seek an abortion is one of the most pressing issues facing the Wyoming judiciary. Wyomingites have been waiting on the state supreme court to rule on the constitutionality of two bans on abortions passed by the Legislature in 2023. If the justices strike down the total ban, a number of court cases on other abortion restrictions — such as an ultrasound requirement, prohibitions on off-label abortion prescriptions and strict regulations on the state’s lone abortion clinic — will all likely have to be litigated. Kautz would presumably helm the state’s defense of the Legislature’s policies in those cases.
As the state’s top law enforcement officer, Kautz could also play a role in determining how zealously Wyoming enforces whichever restrictions on abortion do survive legal muster.
The former justice made his personal opinions on the matter clear in April, days before his old colleagues held a hearing on the abortion ban. Alongside conservative religious leaders and leaders of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, Kautz participated in a “pray in” ahead of that hearing, leading prayers that the justices would uphold the ban.
“To our great shame, Father, we have decided that an unborn child made in your image isn’t a child at all, but merely an unidentified tissue of potential life that may be destroyed and killed even though we know it is alive,” Kautz said during his prayer remarks. “We are becoming enslaved to unthinkable corruption and immorality and we deserve the consequences of our actions.”
His participation in that event raised eyebrows among some pro-choice advocates. When questioned about it by Wyoming Public Media, Kautz said he had asked Fox not to assign him any cases in his retirement — retired judges in Wyoming will sometimes be called upon to hear a case due to judicial workload or judges having conflicts of interest.
“Because of my interest in this particular issue, abortion, and the right to life and the sanctity of life, I thought it would be better for me and the judiciary for me not to be assigned any cases,” Kautz told WPR.

It’s unlikely a Wyoming attorney general would recuse themselves from defending or enforcing a state law because they personally believed in it, legal observers said. While state officials are governed by conflict-of-interest rules, those apply to financial conflicts or matters involving family members. Michael Pearlman, a spokesperson for Gordon, said he wasn’t able to comment on the question. WyoFile was unable to reach Kautz on Wednesday, when his appointment was announced. 
In a news release announcing his appointment, Gordon praised Kautz’s long tenure in the Wyoming judiciary. When the two men met to discuss the appointment, Kautz quoted George Washington, who said that “due administration of justice is the firmest pillar of good Government,” according to the news release. 
In his 2023 interview with WyoFile, Kautz lamented the divisive rhetoric and polarization in today’s politics.
“It’s unfortunate,” he said. “I don’t think that’s productive. But I’m not willing, in a democracy, to say ‘You can’t have the rhetoric.’”
Gordon’s appointment may be well received by his critics on the right. It comes at a time when some legislators have called for changing Wyoming law to make the attorney general an elected position, as opposed to an appointed one. Last year, the House Judiciary Committee passed a bill to make that change with a 6-3 vote. Chamber leadership chose not to consider the measure on the floor, however, killing the bill.

This week marks the 25th anniversary of civil unions, which were the most sweeping grant of rights to gay couples in the nation when they became law on July 1, 2000.
Civil unions grew out of a lawsuit filed by three gay and lesbian couples who had been denied marriage licenses in Vermont. The lawsuit was known as Baker v. Vermont. In December 1999, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled unanimously that gay and lesbian couples were entitled to the same benefits of marriage as heterosexual couples. The court ordered the Vermont legislature to craft a law that would satisfy the ruling, either by legalizing same-sex marriage or by creating an equivalent partnership structure. 
Vermont Supreme Court Chief Justice Jeffrey Amestoy wrote that the decision, “is simply a recognition of our common humanity.” 
It would take until 2009 for Vermont to legalize same-sex marriage. 
To mark the milestone, I spoke with four of the key participants behind civil unions. Stacy Jolles and Nina Beck were two of the six plaintiffs in Baker v. Vermont. Chief Justice Amestoy wrote the decision. Gov. Howard Dean signed civil unions into law. (Rep. Bill Lippert recounted how the Vermont legislature passed the historic law on The Vermont Conversation in an interview in April.)

The following transcript has been edited for length and clarity. The unabridged audio version of this interview can be heard by clicking the audio bar above.
THE PLAINTIFFS
I first met Stacy Jolles and Nina Beck in their South Burlington home in 2000 when I covered the civil unions debate for Mother Jones. In my article, I described them cooing over their newborn son. Seth Jolles has since graduated from college and graduate school. Nina and Stacy had a civil union and were married as each of those opportunities became legal.
Stacy, now 67, a psychologist, and Nina, 69, a physical therapist, are now “semi-retired.” They have been familiar faces as the owners of the popular Burlington tea house, Dobra Tea, which they owned for 11 years and sold in 2021. 
Stacy and Nina joined me on the Vermont Conversation in 2015 to talk about the US Supreme Court decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationally, known as the Obergefell decision. 
This week, I asked them how it felt to be marking the 25th anniversary of civil unions.
Stacy Jolles   
I can’t believe it’s been 25 years. That seemed like such a time of great hope and such a different time than it feels right now. So it is nice to go back and remember that times were better but it’s a little scary to realize that we made it 25 years. We may not make it 26.
Nina Beck
It’s an odd juxtaposition to be celebrating something that happened what feels like a very long time ago but really is only the lifetime of our son, and yet wondering what the future holds or if we’re going to lose those rights that we gained.
David Goodman 
You were one of the three couples that were part of this landmark lawsuit. Tell us a little of your personal story as a couple and then what brought you to sue the state of Vermont?
Stacy Jolles   
Stacy prior to our son Seth, who’s 25 now, we had a son, Noah. We were living in North Carolina and we knew at the time that in order to protect me as the non-biological parent, we needed to do a lot of legal paperwork. And so we did that. When Nina was giving birth, we tried to have a home birth but we ended up going to the hospital. And there was another pregnant couple, actually, that went in, and they didn’t ask the gentleman of the couple anything about paperwork, and they literally stopped me at the door and asked for my paperwork and what allowed me to be there. Who was I? Nina was struggling to give birth and Noah was in trouble in utero and I had to come up with the paperwork that allowed me to be there. So for me, that was a very pivotal moment in our lives and it laid the groundwork that marriage is really a legal contract primarily to protect the children. I don’t need the state to sanction my relationship. I don’t need any public validation other than I need legal protection for my kids. So when the opportunity came along, that was what was in my mind.
Nina Beck   
Stacy and I were living in California before we moved to North Carolina and Vermont. In 1992, we had our big Jewish wedding, which was for our friends and family. That was of course not legally meaningful at all. At the time, we’d heard about a lawsuit brought by three couples in Hawaii and they tried to get marriage. They were the first state, and they failed. But that totally put the idea in my mind that this was a fight. This was this was maybe possible. 
We decided together that if we live somewhere where it was possible to be involved in the work for legal civil marriage, that we wanted to do it. That was 1992, and we showed up in Vermont in 1996 in April and found the Vermont Freedom to Marry movement. We said, how can we be involved? We want to do this. 
David Goodman   
Talk about the Vermont Freedom to Marry Task Force and the marriage equality movement in Vermont that you were part of.
Stacy Jolles   
Well, the movement was really Beth and Susan. 
David Goodman   
This was Beth Robinson, now a federal judge, and Susan Murray, your attorneys at the time.
Stacy Jolles   
Exactly. A lot can be done with just two people who are dedicated. And they were absolutely phenomenal. 
Nina Beck   
It was a very grassroots movement in terms of trying to lift people’s awareness of what is civil marriage (and) why would we want it? Many people traveled all over the state to speak at events to try and gain public support for this. 
David Goodman   
What kind of responses did you get when you were out there tabling and at county fairs?
Stacy Jolles   
Surprisingly we got mostly positive feedback. Both Nina and I were activists our whole lives and we had nothing to lose. It was our obligation since we were both lucky: our families weren’t going to disown us. We weren’t going to lose our jobs. We had so many privileges in so many ways that so many gay and lesbian people didn’t have then and still don’t have. It felt like an obligation to be the person that came forward when so many others couldn’t.
We experienced very little backlash. We got only one letter that was from someone who said they were going to pray for us. And I’m always happy to have somebody pray for me (laughs). 
David Goodman   
I remember being in the Vermont State House when civil unions was being debated in the winter in early 2000. It was intense. There were busloads of people, many from out of state and many with very noticeable southern accents who were from evangelical churches in the South. It felt very volatile. How did it feel to you?
Stacy Jolles   
Well, we’re both martial artists. Not that we were going to get into any kind of physical altercation. 
It was a different time. If I was in that situation now, I would feel very differently. Political violence has become much more normalized. It was moving times, emotional times, but I didn’t feel in danger.
Nina Beck   
I feel like there was a difference between the way Vermont people who lived here reacted to us, even when they didn’t agree with us, as opposed to the people who came up from the south and came from other states. Those people were much more threatening. And also the Vermont folks, even those who were not on our side, didn’t want help. They told those people basically go away. We’re going to keep it local. 
Later when we’d drive through the countryside and see the barns printed with Take Back Vermont, it wasn’t warm and welcoming, but I honestly didn’t feel in danger. 
David Goodman   
The Baker decision was a win for advancing LGBTQ rights, but Stacy, you’ve told me that you felt it was a loss. Explain how it could be both.
Stacy Jolles   
When the decision came down and the (Vermont) Supreme Court basically punted (same-sex partnership) to the legislature, I felt like we lost. The Supreme Court did not rule for marriage. Intellectually, I recognize that you take two steps forward, one step back. I get that it was progress, but I felt like we lost. I felt like the Supreme Court said, No, we’re not going to give you marriage. (Civil unions) wasn’t going to protect my kids in the way I needed them protected. At the time I was working full time and staying home with Seth, and it wasn’t going to protect his rights with the over 2000 federal advantages from marriage. 
Nina Beck  
We live on Lake Champlain, and if we traveled across that lake to New York State, our civil union wouldn’t necessarily be recognized there. What if we went across the lake for the day and got in trouble and needed medical care? There were many, many important protections that marriage has, that civil unions left out. It was separate but unequal.
David Goodman   
It took another decade for Vermont to pass same-sex marriage in 2009 over the veto of Governor Jim Douglas. How did that feel?
Stacy Jolles   
That was awesome. That felt like a step in the right direction towards federal marriage being legal in all states. That was uplifting. 
David Goodman   
Did you get a civil union and then get married? 
Nina Beck   
Yes, we had a civil union ceremony, which included our local representative coming to our house, acting as Justice of the Peace, sitting in our living room and signing a piece of paper. We were not very excited about it, but we wanted it legally in place. When we won marriage, we had a great party in the boathouse at the Burlington waterfront. We recreated our big Jewish wedding, and Beth (Robinson) officiated. That was a great party. 
David Goodman   
Twenty-five years after civil unions in Vermont, there is intense blowback against LGBTQ rights. The U.S. Supreme Court recently ruled against LGBTQ rights in several cases, allowing parents to opt-out their children from school classes that include LGBTQ-themed books, and banning gender-affirming health care for transgender youth. How fearful are you that the rights that you won could be undone?
Stacy Jolles   
I think they will be undone. 
I am the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, as is Nina. So we were raised to view governments like the one we’re experiencing now in a very different way than most Americans might view it. I think it’s going to get very bad and I’m just going to be active until the very last minute. I can be active trying to protect young LGBTQ people’s rights, particularly young transgender people. And I think we’re going to have to fight harder than we have before. 
Nina Beck   
Not to make too many parallels, but the Jews of Europe became extremely assimilated, particularly Austria and Germany, and kind of forgot that antisemitism was real. And there’s a way in which I think young people today who have grown up in the last 25 years without knowledge of homophobia in the way that we who grew up in the 60s and 70s felt it. So it’s a shock to them. It’s not surprising to me, but it is scary in a way that we haven’t seen in a long time.
Every day some more rights are lost. I don’t want to go back to living that way, but I know how to and we’ll just keep fighting. We’ll just have to keep fighting and not be shocked and horrified that these things are going away but rather activated by it.
David Goodman   
You both lived through a time when it seemed impossible that same-sex marriage could win. In 1996, President Clinton passed the Defense of Marriage Act. The tide was not in your favor in the late 1990s. What is your advice to the next generation of activists about what’s needed to prevail even at a time like this?
Stacy Jolles   
We have to be vigilant and brave and as out there as we possibly can. It’s going to get really bad, it’s going to get really scary, and we still are going to have to stand up and fight.
Nina Beck
Don’t back down. 
We have to be as strong as humanly possible. We can look to AIDS activists for tactics. We can look to the civil rights workers for tactics. There’s so many organizations that have gone before us. We just have to adopt the tactics of our predecessors and do it again.
David Goodman   
Any last thoughts? 
Nina Beck   
We continue to feel very privileged to live in the great state of Vermont where we do have rights and privileges as gay and lesbian people. Vermont is the only state that has no laws pending or on the books against trans people. That’s remarkable. We are very lucky to be here.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE
Jeffrey Amestoy served as attorney general of Vermont from 1985 to 1997, winning seven elections, five of them as the nominee of both the Republican and Democratic parties. In 1997, Governor Howard Dean appointed Amestoy to be Chief Justice of the Vermont Supreme Court. Two years later, he wrote the Baker decision. Amestoy retired as chief justice in 2004 and later was a fellow at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government.
Amestoy, 78, spoke with me at his home in Waterbury Center with a stunning view of Mount Mansfield. I asked him what led him to write the most famous line from the Baker decision, that legalizing same-sex partnerships was “simply a recognition of our common humanity.”
Jeffrey Amestoy   
I was cognizant of the extent to which a pure legal analysis that dictated a result to the people of Vermont on an issue that divided them was something to be concerned about. I thought if we could frame the issue in terms that folks would respond to, they would begin to see what it meant in terms of the rights involved. So the phrase “common humanity” was one that I had hoped would resonate. I think it helped structure the public debate, because it became not a question of whether a special class should get special treatment, but I think it helped promote a dialog in which people spoke of their own personal experiences and related it to common humanity. 
The structure of the legal analysis was based on the common benefits clause. So it became a mechanism to try to encourage a public dialog that spoke to the heart of the matter, which was really human relationships. 
David Goodman   
How aware were you that your decision would have national implications and thrust Vermont into the middle of a national culture war?
Jeffrey Amestoy   
I was aware of the significance of the issue to a substantial portion of the country. Folks had fought long and hard, like Beth Robinson and Susan Murray and other advocates for same-sex recognition. You couldn’t be ignorant of the extent to which it had been turned into a real divisive political issue. The Defense of Marriage Act was signed into law by President Clinton in 1996 — that’s three years before our opinion. The (U.S.) Senate passed (DOMA), 85 to 14. Senator Leahy and Senator Jeffords both voted for it. That law said that marriage was between a man and a woman, and beyond that, no state was required to recognize another state’s same-sex marriage. That framed the political culture. It was a reminder to me that any decision that Vermont came up with was going to precipitate a national debate.
David Goodman   
You also knew that other state courts had waded into this terrain. The Hawaii Supreme Court in 1993 and Anchorage (Alaska) Superior Court in 1998 had both legalized same-sex marriage, only to have voters in those states pass constitutional amendments that reversed the decision. How did that affect you as you approached the Baker decision, knowing that you could spark a backlash that could result in this being a very short lived decision?
Jeffrey Amestoy   
It was fundamental to my perception of how we ought to weigh the consequences of the decision if our rationale was trying to advance equal rights for same-sex couples. To me, one of the paramount determinations to be made was how likely was a decision of the court going to advance that? Would a same-sex marriage decision directed from the court advance that? Based on the experiences of Alaska and Hawaii, (legalizing same-sex marriage) would have certainly precipitated a constitutional amendment in Vermont that would have found a lot of public support that would have defined marriage as between a man and a woman. That would have cut off the ability for a court to deal with the matter if the Vermont State Constitution was amended. 
In terms of the climate of the time, between the decision of our court in December 1999 and the civil unions passage in April 2000, voters in California, a liberal state, passed (Proposition 22), a referendum that defined marriage as only between a man and a woman. That passed 61 to 39 percent. That was an indicator of the extent to which there wasn’t going to be a straight line from a Supreme Court decision, even from Vermont, that was going to then lead directly to the recognition of same-sex marriage legally in this country. So all those were part of my framing of the issue.
David Goodman   
You’re describing a very hostile national climate regarding same-sex marriage. What persuaded you to go a different way?
Jeffrey Amestoy   
We tried to look at the issue of the claim for same-sex marriage rights in the context of the Vermont constitution. You had a culture and a history of Vermont in terms of the creation of the common benefits clause. What persuaded me was a legal analysis that we could draw from Vermont’s constitutional culture and one I think that was consistent with Vermont values. So from that standpoint, beyond whatever our personal consideration about the issue was, the claim for same-sex marriage benefits in Vermont resonated with our constitutional framework. Our decision attempted to advance that in a way that would lead to what it did lead to, which was eventually an embrace of same-sex marriage by Vermonters.
David Goodman   
The Baker decision legalized either marriage or an equivalent partnership structure. It took another 10 years before marriage passed over the veto of Governor Jim Douglas. Why didn’t you just legalize same-sex marriage in 1999?
Jeffrey Amestoy   
I thought it would precipitate a constitutional amendment in Vermont, as was being done in 36 other states and was being done in California, that would compel states through their own state constitutions that would foreclose courts from deciding the issue. The constitutional amendments in each state would have provisions that defined marriage as between a man and a woman. 
The response even to the civil union decision indicated how difficult it would have been in that climate in that time to have even Vermonters abide by that decision in the Supreme Court. If you look at the surveys at the time, Vermonters were not embracing the idea of same-sex marriage, and they were not embracing the idea of civil unions either. So it became a much more difficult task for the legislature. Not that what we’d done was an easy thing to do, but the difficult and hard work (that) we honor 25 years later was the work of the Vermont legislature and, of course, Vermonters themselves.
David Goodman   
What does this 25 year milestone mean to you?
Jeffrey Amestoy   
It makes me proud of Vermont. I’m from Vermont. It was a testament to my own faith in the judgment of Vermonters. What Vermonters should be proud of is that it advanced the extraordinary significance of same-sex marriage in this country in a way that I think would have taken longer and perhaps had a more difficult route. Vermonters, as I’d hoped they would, rose to the occasion, as they’ve done historically in a number of other areas too. 
David Goodman   
What did you feel when the U.S. Supreme Court passed the Obergefell decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in 2015?
Jeffrey Amestoy   
It came much sooner than I thought. At the time of Baker, if someone had asked me would the U.S. Supreme Court reach a decision legalizing same-sex marriage in my lifetime, I would have said no. I go again to the point of how a constructive, realistic approach to moving public discourse that recognizes common humanity probably moved that to a much quicker decision by the United States Supreme Court than I would have thought possible. That was a testament to what we had done in Vermont.
THE GOVERNOR
Howard Dean, 76, became governor in 1991 on the death in office of Governor Richard Snelling. Dean was subsequently elected to five two-year terms, becoming the longest serving governor in Vermont history. 
David Goodman   
How did you feel about same-sex marriage in the mid to late 1990s? Democrats nationally were not particularly supportive.
Gov. Howard Dean   
President Clinton wasn’t supportive because he was a great politician and could read the polls. I was not a great champion at the time. I remember exactly where I was when the (Baker) court decision came down. I was in Burlington at a meeting on education, and somebody threw a microphone in front of my face and said, What do you think of this? And my response was a great dismay to people who later became very close friends (like Rep.) Bill Lippert. 
I said, “Well, it makes me uncomfortable, same as everybody else.” And I was uncomfortable.  
I grew up in the 60s and when I was in high school, it was unthinkable to say who you were if you were gay. There was plenty of homophobia. I grew up in a different era. I came to change my mind as governor, because it was actually quite simple. The same-sex marriage people basically outlined about 1700 rights that you could have if you were a married heterosexual person that you could not have if you were in a gay partnership. And as soon as that happened, I realized this was a civil rights bill. It wasn’t just about marriage, (it was) about equality under the law. There was a whole population of Americans that was discriminated against and so something had to be done about it. But I was somebody who had to be brought along because of my upbringing and because of the generation I come from.
David Goodman   
It’s helpful for people to understand where things were in the 1990s. Even for a Democratic governor like yourself, this was not a simple issue. 
Gov. Howard Dean   
Yeah, it was complicated. But once it got distilled to the civil rights issue, that was easy. And then (Reps.) Tom Little and Bill Lippert, who were respectively the chairman and vice chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the House, came to me and said, Look, we can’t get marriage out of our committee, so we’re going to call it civil unions. And essentially, they said a civil union is going to be marriage by another name. And so I said, Look, you guys are the ones on the firing line. You have to do it. And of course, Bill (Lippert), because he was gay, if he was advising this course, then that was sort of the gold standard. And then it went to the Senate. It passed. And that was brutal. In the House, absolutely brutal. 
The (House speech) I remember the most was (Rep.) John Edwards, who was this former state trooper from a very conservative part of the state, which is Franklin County. And he gave up his seat. There was (Rep.) Marion Milne. She gave up her seat. She got up and said she was from Barre and didn’t like this. And she said basically, this is the right thing to do. She didn’t flinch. 
David Goodman   
Unlike anyone else involved in this issue, you had to run statewide after passing civil unions in 2000. This was the heyday of the Take Back Vermont movement, which really sprung up in response to civil unions being passed. You won re-election in 2000 with 50.5% of the vote, barely enough to keep it out of the legislature…
Gov. Howard Dean   
…Which was a Republican legislature after all was said and done because of civil unions. 
David Goodman   
Many legislators who supported civil unions were defeated in November 2000. So there was a political price to pay. What impact did you think civil unions would have on your political future? 
Gov. Howard Dean   
I hate to say this, and nobody’s going to believe it, but I didn’t care. 
This is where the problem with most politicians is. If an issue like this comes along and you conclude that it’s a matter of civil rights, and you duck it for the convenience of your election, you’re wasting your time in politics. Which, of course, is what the problem in Congress is today. I’d say 100% of the Republicans and a good portion of the Democrats are wasting their time because they shouldn’t be in politics. If you’re not willing to stand up for something, why are you in the business? And so for me, it was easy. 
David Goodman   
You signed civil unions into law in 2000 and it took nine years, and over the veto of your successor, Governor Douglas, for same-sex marriage to be legalized in Vermont. Do you have any second thoughts that perhaps just legalizing gay marriage in 2000 would have been the better move?
Gov. Howard Dean   
We couldn’t possibly get it through the legislature. If Bill Lippert comes to me and says, I can’t get this through the legislature, and Tom Little – (a Republican) who in all states other than this one would be a Democrat — if those two people come to me and say they can’t get the bill through…
In politics, sometimes you have to take half and come back and get the other half later. What we did was the first marriage equivalent bill in the entire United States of America. And I think if we hadn’t done what we did, that would have set the cause back for years. We were the model. Even though it wasn’t full marriage — but it basically was as the two described it in the privacy of my office, this is marriage in everything but name — and that’s what it was.
David Goodman   
What do you think was the national significance of Vermont’s civil unions bill?
Gov. Howard Dean   
I think people saw it as gay marriage. It was sort of the lead issue. It happened. I think the next state that did it was Massachusetts, and they did it by court order.
David Goodman   
Today we see a backlash against LGBTQ issues, with the US Supreme Court and Congress limiting rights. Do you think this is a backlash that began right after you signed that law?
Gov. Howard Dean   
This is an organized conservative attempt to overthrow rights which the vast majority of American people support. This (U.S. Supreme) Court essentially is bought and paid for. The court system in this country is a disaster and thank God it wasn’t like that when all this stuff was going on. 
David Goodman   
In the long arc of your political career, where do you rank civil unions among the things that you’ve accomplished? 
Gov. Howard Dean   
I think the only thing that was more important was getting the waiver from the Clinton administration to insure all kids under 300% of poverty. Virtually every child in the state has health insurance, and that’s been going on since 1992. So that one I’d have to put first, but I’d put civil unions second. 
In terms of personal challenges, civil unions was by far the first, because I didn’t really for sure understand what it was to be a public servant until you have to make a decision like that, where you know the public is going to be really upset. I didn’t know I had it in me to do what was right instead of what was politically expedient. 
I never regretted. I had to wear a bulletproof vest all summer during my campaign because the threats were so awful, not just in state, mostly out of state, and all the parades I had to go to, and the meetings that I went to, and tremendous amount of money spent by the Vermont taxpayers on making sure that nobody could take a shot at me. But it never crossed my mind.
Why are you in politics if you don’t stand up for anything that needs to be stood up for?

""When Aiden Became a Brother"" can be seen in the front. Pierce County LibraryA Pierce County librarian is out of a job because of what she calls political pressure over a book about a transgender child that was part of a display in the library.
Former Pierce County Library Manager Lavonnia Moore doesn’t have a degree in library science but worked her way to the top over 15 years, starting as a part-time clerk.
That came to an end on June 18 when she says she was called into the office to speak with Three Rivers Library System Director Jeremy Snell, who told her she was being let go over a book that was part of a summer reading display. Moore said the book, titled “When Aidan Became a Brother” by Kyle Lukoff, was selected for the display by a child at the library.
Moore said she did not have a history of disciplinary problems or bad performance reviews.
Snell did not respond to a voicemail or emailed requests for comment. Snell told the Blackshear Times that the display of the book was the reason for the decision.
Moore said she has hired an attorney.
“It was a shock. I was shocked. I said ‘OK.’ And I broke down. In my mind, I was thinking to myself, ‘I was not going to tell a child no,’” she said.
Moore said the beginning of the end came near the start of June when she allowed parents and kids to create a display to match the theme of the Georgia Public Library Service’s summer reading program, “color our world.”
“There were books, DVDs, games, and each and every one of them had at least a hint of a rainbow on it,” she said. “Because all the kids went to find rainbows. I was just happy that the kids knew where the books were. They even took the time to go into the card catalog to find books. I’m like, ‘Oh! They used the library properly! They know how to use the library!”
“One kid put a box of crayons on the display,” she added. “I’m like ‘Dude, that’s awesome,’ and he’s like ‘I know, right?”
Moore said one of the children brought the book “When Aidan Became a Brother.” Moore said she didn’t know it at the time, but the book is about a young transgender boy whose family is expecting a new baby.

The book is written for young children and discusses Aidan’s gender identity not matching his sex at birth. It doesn’t contain anything graphic or explicit. The cover shows Aidan with his family wearing a shirt with a rainbow on it.
“All I saw was Aidan becoming a big brother,” Moore said. “I saw a family with a kid wearing a rainbow sweater and the mom pregnant. It was a mixed family. I was like, ‘OK, sure, put it on the table.’”
But the book’s placement didn’t sit well with a group called Alliance for Faith and Freedom, which made posts on social media calling on followers to write in to library staff and Pierce County commissioners.
“Please PRAY and take just a few minutes right now to email the (Three Rivers Regional Library) staff and Pierce Commissioners to encourage them to put a stop to this and show them the community supports them in taking a stand against promoting transgenderism at our local library,” the group wrote in posts on Facebook and Instagram.
The group’s Instagram post had no visible likes, comments or shares, while the Facebook post had 26 reactions, ten comments and 82 shares.
Alliance for Faith and Freedom did not respond to a request for comment.
Moore said she had no intention to promote any ideology but kept books relevant to all kinds of people in the community, including LGBTQ people, immigrants from different countries and people who speak various languages.
“The library is for everybody,” she said. “You should be able to go into any library and feel welcome or at least find something that you will enjoy reading, doing, or any resources. I know this day in time is tough, believe me, it is real tough, but the library should be one place that should not be a hurdle.”
Moore said the group has targeted her before over similar issues.
According to the Blackshear Times, the Pierce County Library left the Okefenokee Regional Library System last year, joining the Three Rivers System last July “over controversies surrounding certain sexual displays and bathroom policies.”
‘The fundamental mission of every library’
Organizations like Alliance for Faith and Freedom target libraries across the country, said Todd Cates, a library media specialist in Georgia and the recent winner of the Georgia Library Media Association’s Intellectual Freedom Award.
“They seem to be interested in removing books only that discuss LGBTQ issues or issues of people of color,” he said. “They latch onto a book based on the cover, based on the title, based on the topic. They generally don’t have any real reason to attack the book other than it talks about people of color or LGBTQ topics. They raise a stink, and politicians respond to stink.”
Cates said libraries have procedures for patrons to challenge books and he was disappointed to hear that Moore was fired.
He said “When Aidan Became a Brother” was appropriate for the library’s shelves and the display.
“That’s the fundamental mission of every library. We represent all members of our community, no matter their race, their creed, their religion, their gender, their sexual identity, their sexuality, where they’re from. My library here at my school, I have books in Spanish, I have books in Korean. I represent everybody. I have several copies of the Bible on my shelf. There’s several copies of books that would probably be considered controversial by other groups of people, but that’s immaterial because it represents the people that I serve.”
Georgia mom Lena Kotler said she’s happy when her 10-year-old transgender child Aleix can see herself reflected in the books she reads or the shows she watches.
“I want my child to see people like her, but see them living joyfully and with an in-depth life,” the Decatur mom said. “I’m a millennial. The rare times we saw anything mentioned about someone being trans or in some way gender nonconforming, it was a punchline, it was a plot twist, it was this negative thing, and I want my children to see people like them growing up to be adults who are happy and joyful and have the full life experience, the spectrum of life experience.”
But while inclusion is important, the writing still has to be good, Aleix says, and sometimes transgender characters are written as one-dimensional with their whole plot revolving around being trans.
Aleix’ recommendations for kids’ media that get LGBTQ representation right include the 2022 Disney film “Strange World” and “DeadEndia,” a webcomic and graphic novel with an animated adaptation.

(Courtesy of Lake County School District)Colorado school districts are scrambling after the Trump administration put on hold $6.8 billion in federal funds for K-12 schools across the country, including an estimated $70 million earmarked for the state. 
The U.S. Department of Education is withholding certain grants for after-school programs, teacher training, migrant education and English-language learning, among other initiatives. States were notified Monday, a day before they would typically receive the money. 
This pause has left districts across Colorado uncertain about programs they were already committed to offering. Colorado Education Commissioner Susana Córdova sent a letter to schools about the withheld grants, saying she is “deeply concerned about the potential impact of the delay and ongoing uncertainty surrounding these critical funds.”
The federal Department of Education has not provided a timeline on the funds, which it said are under review in a notice to states. The funds were already approved by Congress.
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the notice said.
Gov. Jared Polis called the move a “direct attack on children, families and Colorado educators” in a statement Wednesday.
“This funding for our schools is already obligated, and it’s absurd that the federal government withheld it,” Polis said. “Investing in education and ensuring that Colorado children have the best possible future has been a top priority, and it’s disappointing to see the federal government hurt students and teachers.”
Programs in limbo
The paused grants make up two-thirds of the after-school program budget for the Lake County School District, which is nestled in the mountains of central Colorado at a 10,000-foot elevation. 
Half of the students enrolled in the small district qualify for subsidized school lunches, and most of their parents drive hours to get to their jobs in high-end resort towns. These parental commutes are why the district’s after-school programs — which provide kids with tutoring, healthy snacks and even occasional bagpipe lessons — are “essential child care,” Superintendent Kate Bartlett said. 
Without the federal grants totaling about $400,000 the district expected to receive, Bartlett said most or all of the after-school programming would shut down, forcing some parents to cut hours at work.
“It’s not just losing out on Lego robotics,” Bartlett said. “The downstream impact is actually much deeper. So that is what makes me sad and worried, not just about outcomes for kids, but really outcomes for families and outcomes for our regional economy.”
The Trump administration’s decision has hit other districts across the state hard as well. Denver Public Schools stands to lose at least $10 million if the grants aren’t disbursed, according to district spokesperson Scott Pribble. That could push the district, which is the largest in the state, to make cuts to staffing, programs and services, he said.
Alex Marrero, superintendent of Denver Public Schools, and Carrie Olson, president of the district’s Board of Education, issued a statement on Wednesday afternoon to “demand the immediate release of these funds.”
“This action is not just a logistical crisis — it is a moral and constitutional breach,” the statement said. “The decision to delay the distribution of congressionally-appropriated education funds is a dangerous overreach of executive authority and a direct affront to public education, especially for communities that rely most heavily on these supports.”
Colorado Education Association President Kevin Vick said in a Wednesday interview that the teachers union is seeking “every available avenue” to get the funding restored.
“Most of this funding is earmarked for our most vulnerable students in our most vulnerable districts, and so as these districts are making plans for the upcoming school year, they were relying on these funds to be able to put needed programs in place,” Vick said. “These funds need to be delivered to Colorado as promised.”
School-based mental health care
In a decision earlier this year, the Trump administration canceled about $1 billion in Department of Education grants that focus on addressing student mental health. Those grants come from a different pot of money than the funding paused this week.
On Tuesday, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser announced that he was joining 15 other state attorneys general in a lawsuit to restore the mental health grants, calling their cancellation illegal and vague. Nearly $10 million is at stake for Colorado institutions, including the University of Colorado, University of Northern Colorado, University of Denver and Colorado Department of Education. 
The funding was meant to “address a shortage of school-based mental health care professionals through recruitment, retraining and re-specializing clinical workers for school-based roles,” according to a statement from Weiser.

(Official White House Photo by Daniel Torok)Hundreds of immigrants awaiting deportation will arrive Wednesday night at the detention center the state built in the Everglades, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced on X.
A spokesperson for the governor’s office told reporters Wednesday morning that the timing for arrival of detainees depended on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The operations at the Everglades Center that Uthmeier and Gov. Ron DeSantis have referred to as a “one-stop shop” for deportations are starting a day after President Donald Trump visited and urged other states to build similar sites.
Uthmeier didn’t offer specifics of the number of people set to arrive at the site at the Miami-Dade Collier Training and Transition Airport or where they are coming from. DHS and Uthmeier’s office didn’t immediately respond to questions from Florida Phoenix.
“Alligator Alcatraz will be checking in hundreds of criminal illegal aliens tonight,” Uthmeier wrote, using Florida officials’ name for the site. “Next stop: back to where they came from.”
Trump says he wants other states to build migrant detention centers after Everglades tour

During his Tuesday visit, Trump said the center would house “some of the most vicious people on the planet.” Around 71% of immigrants detained have had no criminal record, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.
But while immigrants in the country without authorization start to arrive at the Everglades tent and trailer center, which has a capacity of 3,000 people, the DeSantis administration is already moving to open another 2,000-person detention center in Camp Blanding, the primary training center for the Florida National Guard.
Ahead of the start of operations, water seeped into a tent and created large puddles following a storm, where state and federal officials had posed for pictures and Gov. Ron DeSantis answered questions from the press on Tuesday. Stephanie Hartman, a spokesperson from the Florida Division of Emergency Management, and DeSantis’ communications director, Bryan Griffin, said the seams that allowed the water to come in had been fixed overnight.
Griffin also told reporters Wednesday morning that FDEM would be in charge of the facility with oversight from DHS.
Meanwhile, Democrats in the state Legislature and Congress sent letters to Uthmeier and DeSantis condemning the operation and demanding answers about the governor’s speedy takeover of the land owned by Miami-Dade County using authority under a state of emergency on illegal immigration he first declared in 2023.
Florida’s Democratic Congressional delegation expressed its concerns about environmental damage and the treatment of immigrants, who will sleep in bunk beds inside tents with A/C during the rising summer temperatures.
“We urge you to immediately reverse course, halt construction activity, and fully withdraw the proposal to establish any detention facility at the Dade-Collier site,” the Democrats wrote. “We further request that you commit to transparent and science-based environmental review process for any future development plans affecting the Everglades region.”
Environmental groups are waiting for a response from a federal judge out of the Southern District of Florida on their request to temporarily halt the Everglades detention center. Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity filed suit Friday, arguing that the hasty, eight-day construction at the site violates the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), requiring public input and analysis of potential harms before construction.

Andre Bauer has launched a bid to unseat four-term U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham in 2026, saying he’s the “real MAGA” alternative for fed-up GOP voters.
Bauer, who left elected office in 2011 after losing a bid for governor, announced his candidacy Wednesday, The Associated Press first reported.
The 56-year-old former legislator and two-term lieutenant governor says he’s the true conservative who will fight to rein in federal spending and oppose sending troops and taxpayers’ money to fight wars overseas.
Calling South Carolina’s senior senator a “war monger and globalist,” Bauer told the SC Daily Gazette it doesn’t matter that Graham already has President Donald Trump’s endorsement for a fifth term.
“I am the real Trump guy. I’ve stuck with him the whole time,” Bauer said, noting Graham’s sometimes rocky relationship with the president over the last decade.

“He’s not MAGA,” Bauer said, referring to Trump’s Make America Great Again slogan and dubbing Graham as “liberal Lindsey.”
In response, Graham’s campaign stressed that Trump gave his “complete and total endorsement” to the incumbent senator. And just this week, the Senate Budget Committee chairman helped push Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” through the Senate to deliver the president’s “America First” agenda, said Graham campaign spokesperson Abby Zilch.
As for who’s MAGA, she recrafted the slogan for Bauer’s campaign: “This is all about Making Andre Great Again.”
Also this week, Chris LaCivita, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, signed on to Graham’s campaign staff, telling reporters “President Trump has made it clear that he wants Sen. Graham by his side to keep delivering results, and I’m proud to do my part to ensure that happens.”
LaCivita also has prior ties to Bauer, having run his unsuccessful 2010 campaign for governor.
Graham’s team
Graham, who launched his re-election bid in February, has a history of attracting — and besting — challengers from his right flank.
In 2014, he fended off six Republican opponents without needing a runoff. In 2020, he easily defeated three GOP challengers to his right before taking on Democrat Jaime Harrison, who lost by double digits in what was then the most expensive U.S. Senate race ever.
Beyond getting Trump’s endorsement for 2026, Graham’s re-election co-chairs are Gov. Henry McMaster and U.S. Sen. Tim Scott. And a long list of GOP heavyweights helping him raise money include David Wilkins, former U.S. ambassador to Canada and House speaker; former state GOP Chair Karen Floyd; and Ed McMullen, Trump’s former ambassador to Switzerland.
Still, Graham could face a tougher contest in a smaller GOP primary field.
Trump’s backing doesn’t guarantee the party faithful will support him, as seen at a Trump campaign event in Pickens on Independence Day two years ago, when the crowd booed Graham off the stage on his home turf. The Upstate event wasn’t far from his hometown of Seneca.
“You can bet Bauer heard that boo,” former SC GOP Chairman Katon Dawson told the SC Daily Gazette.
Dawson, whose tenure spanned campaigns by both Graham and Bauer, called both men “talented politicians” but said he expects Graham to be able to shake off many of the criticisms thrown his way.
“He can piss off one wing of the party, but that won’t be all of them,” Dawson said.
Time in office
Greenville businessman Mark Lynch, owner of Jeff Lynch Appliance Center, launched his campaign to oust Graham in February. After putting $5 million of his own money into the campaign, he’s already running TV ads to boost his profile.

Bauer, who lives in Travelers Rest, has name recognition from his time in office, starting with his election to the state House in 1996 at age 27 representing a Lexington County district. Three years later, he won a special election for a state Senate seat spanning four counties before being elected lieutenant governor in 2002 at age 33. At the time, he was the youngest lieutenant governor in the country.
Still, it has been 13 years since Bauer has run for office and 19 years since he’s won.
Voters who have moved into the fast-growing state since then won’t know him.
Dawson said he saw it firsthand at a Nikki Haley campaign event during her failed presidential bid last year. Inside a crowded room in Beaufort, he said she asked the crowd how many knew her during her time as governor. Only about a quarter of the room raised their hands.
“There are lots of new voters up for grabs,” said Dawson, chairman from 2002 to 2009. “I’ve seen them; they’re out there. And they’re all along the coast.”
Bauer’s last campaign was in 2012 for the state’s then-new 7th Congressional District, when he a lost a runoff to eventual U.S. Rep. Tom Rice. In 2010, he placed last in a four-way GOP primary ultimately won in a runoff by Haley, who went on to win the Governor’s Mansion that November.
In the interim, Bauer’s gotten married and become a father to four children ages 5 to 17. Having children changed his entire perspective, he said: “There’s a lot of growth from 40 to 56.”

“I think it’s a good break,” Dawson said of Bauer’s time away from office. “He’s still young.”
Still, the former GOP chairman was surprised to see Bauer taking on an entrenched U.S. senator with what Bauer estimates to be $70 million-plus in fundraising capacity. Graham currently has nearly $16 million on hand, according to the latest campaign filings.
Bauer said he recognizes the money disadvantage.
“This is fighting an Army with a toothpick,” he said. “When you’re part of the system, you’re going to raise a lot of money.”
But the former marathoner, who’s known to walk hundreds of miles over a campaign, plans to out-work Graham to convince voters “what true MAGA is.”
“I wouldn’t want to run against Andre Bauer,” Dawson said. “I think Andre’s asset is Andre. He’ll hang off bridges with signs if he has to.”
Graham’s advantages
But Dawson pointed to South Carolina’s history of re-electing long-time, incumbent senators of both parties.
Graham was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 2002 to replace retiring GOP Sen. Strom Thurmond, who left office after turning 100 and died six months later. U.S. Sen. Fritz Hollings, who remained a Democrat over his four-decade tenure as he fought for balanced budgets, retired in 2004. He died in 2019 at age 97.
Dawson noted neither was voted out. And he said he’d be surprised if Graham doesn’t hold on to his seat. He considers Graham’s hawkish stances on foreign policy, to include his continued staunch support of Israel and approval of Trump’s strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, to be a strength in this military friendly state.
“He’s got a lot of friends and he’s done a lot of favors,” Dawson said. “If anything, South Carolina likes a career politician who knows how to bring the bacon home. And Sen. Graham certainly does that.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9754-e1751497833645-1024x619.jpg,,,2025-07-02 20:05:39.873305

The Courts, Corrections and Justice Committee on Monday and Tuesday heard from the elected district attorneys from Santa Fe and Las Cruces, both of whom are critical of the New Mexico Supreme Court’s “case management order,” which sets deadlines for prosecutors to disclose evidence and schedule pretrial witness interviews.
The special rule, which first went into effect in Albuquerque-area courts in February 2015, is meant to resolve criminal cases without unneeded delays and reduce case backlogs by establishing deadlines for steps leading to trial.
At present, the rule applies only in the Second Judicial District in New Mexico’s most populous county of Bernalillo; the Third Judicial District, in the second most populous county of Doña Ana; and the Eighth Judicial District, which covers Union, Colfax and Taos counties.
First Judicial District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies, whose district covers Santa Fe, Rio Arriba and Los Alamos counties in Northern New Mexico, told the committee on Monday afternoon she expects the case management order will come to her area in January 2026.
She has been in talks with First Judicial District Court Chief Judge Bryan Biedscheid about the process of adopting the special rule since the fall of 2023, according to a letter her office shared with Source NM. In that letter, she wrote that Biedscheid hasn’t given her, police or public defenders the opportunity to plan and prepare for the rule.
Under the rules in Bernalillo, Doña Ana and the Eighth Judicial District, the simplest cases must go to trial within about seven months and the most complex ones, including murder cases, must go to trial within approximately 15 months.
The rules require more complex cases to go to trial within a year if the person is held in jail, unless the defendant agrees to a longer period or uncontrollable circumstances occur. The rule also shortens deadlines for prosecutors to make evidence available to defense attorneys.
The same deadlines can be found in the proposed rule for the First Judicial District, which the Supreme Court has not yet ordered. It was not clear on Wednesday when the justices would actually make the rule final.
Carmack-Altwies told the committee in preparation for the order, she asked lawmakers in the most recent session for funding to pay for 13 new positions, but only received money for one.
As a result, Carmack-Altwies told the committee, if the order is implemented in her district, she predicts “thousands of cases are going to be dismissed.”
In addition to personnel and budget concerns, Carmack-Altwies’ office subsequently provided Source with a statement also citing insufficient input from DAs and law enforcement to the rule; lack of computer systems that communicate with law enforcement; and crime labs that are “months or years behind.” 
“People are going to get away with crime and then I believe 10-plus years down the road, you’re going to see an astonishing increase in — an escalation in crime,” she told lawmakers.
Source requested comment on Wednesday from the Administrative Office of the Courts and will update this story if received.
The order has its supporters, though.
Chief Public Defender Bennet Baur told the committee he believes in case management orders because in an overworked system, all parties tend to focus on the crisis in front of them, and not on the new cases coming in.
“You have to hold people’s feet to the fire to get the work done on cases, especially when people are sitting in custody,” Baur said.
Before case management orders came around, a lot of people were languishing in jail and victims were waiting for justice, he said.
“Without a case management order, what pressure is there on a crime lab to actually get the results in?” Baur asked. “There needs to be some flexibility. They are imperfect, but I think they’re really important to make sure that the system moves.”
When the conversation about case management orders continued on Tuesday, New Mexico Supreme Court Chief Justice David Thomson told the committee that when courts release someone and attach a GPS monitor to their ankle, and then their case takes a year to reach a trial, “those two things are not acceptable.”
“It’s important to bring them to trial on a timely basis on those charges, and then a jury can decide whether that individual is guilty or not,” Thomson said.
Ultimately, however, lawmakers have no sway over the rules.
Sen. Antonio “Moe” Maestas (D-Albuquerque) noted there were reasons for the case management order at the time, but he encouraged district attorneys and others to “put some friendly pressure on the Supreme Court to change that.”
“We can’t do it legislatively, but those hard-and-fast deadlines are unreasonable under the circumstances, and they need to be looked at,” Maestas said.

(Photo by Katrin Ray Shumakov/Getty images)Much like the sound level from across the bay on the Fourth of July, the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) isn’t making noise about the opportunity for viewing fireworks from Beavertail State Park in Jamestown.
DEM spokesperson Kimberly Keough confirmed to Rhode Island Current that the state park will remain open Friday night for viewing of the city of Newport’s annual pyrotechnics show in the distance without having to deal with loud noise. The display is slated to kick off at 9:15 p.m. 
The Department has promoted the viewing since 2019 as a way for people who are sensitive to loud noises to enjoy the holiday fireworks.
But the state is no longer referring to the event as “Quiet Fireworks” — or promoting it at all. That’s because last year proved a little too popular.
“Last year, emergency responders had difficulty gaining access because of the number of cars in the park,” Keough said in an email Wednesday. “We don’t have an exact number. Last year there were more cars than spots available (150), with cars parking along roadways in both directions.
“Due to this public safety concern and staffing constraints, the event is not being promoted; however, people are still welcome to park and enjoy the fireworks,” she continued.
To avoid the kind of traffic congestion that occurred last year, Keough said the DEM will have two law enforcement officers at the park while Jamestown police will monitor the entrance.
Parking will be available on a first-come, first-served basis, and the park will close once the lots are filled.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, spurred by Trump, will trim seven months off its environmental and safety review of Bill Gates-backed project.
The post Feds speed up review for Natrium nuclear power plant in Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming may see its first commercial nuclear power plant a few months sooner than anticipated, but still sometime in 2030, according to the developer, TerraPower.
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission notified the Belleview, Washington-based company Tuesday that it’s trimming seven months from an ongoing environmental review and safety evaluation of the proposed advanced, liquid-sodium-cooled “Natrium” nuclear reactor plant outside Kemmerer. That means it will complete its final environmental impact statement for a construction permit by Dec. 31, the agency said.
The move follows “frequent and productive engagements” with the operator, according to the commission, and brings the review process into compliance with an executive order President Donald Trump issued in May. The order was intended to reform the “NRC’s culture” and directed the agency to speed up permitting.
“This acknowledgement by the NRC that our application can be completed more quickly than originally anticipated is a testament to the incredible work by our Natrium team and the support for advanced reactors at the federal level,” TerraPower President and CEO Chris Levesque said in a prepared statement.

Levesque also praised Trump for “founding” the NRC’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program during his first term. TerraPower was the first ever to submit a construction permit application for a “commercial advanced reactor” in March 2024.
“Streamlining reviews is a commonsense solution that will accelerate permitting schedules; and proves that we can bring safe, well-vetted American technologies to market faster and compete on the global stage,” Levesque said. 
The expedited review is cause for concern, Wyoming Outdoor Council Energy and Climate Policy Director John Burrows told WyoFile. Residents deserve “robust and thorough” review to ensure safety, especially for an “experimental” technology such as TerraPower’s Natrium design, he said.
“Expediting the review process is not something that inspires confidence when the stakes are very high for this first-of-its-kind project,” Burrows said via email. “Similarly, the perception that the NRC is prioritizing speed over safety does not bode well for the future of nuclear technology in Wyoming — especially given the legacy of this industry and concerns that Wyomingites have raised in the past.”
The $4 billion project, backed by $2 billion from the Department of Energy, was already under a streamlined review process through the NRC’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program. The plant will be operational in 2030, according to TerraPower. It will be the first utility-scale advanced nuclear power plant in the nation, the company said.
The Natrium project
After reviewing several potential sites in Wyoming, TerraPower announced in 2021 it would tap into existing infrastructure near the Naughton natural gas- and coal-fired power plant just outside the adjacent towns of Kemmerer and Diamondville in western Wyoming.
The company’s Natrium nuclear reactor is a scaled-down version of currently operating nuclear reactors. It will generate a consistent 345 megawatts of electricity — enough energy to power about 250,000 homes — and will have the ability to boost the system’s output to 500 megawatts for short periods, according to the company.

TerraPower, backed by Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates, promotes Natrium as an “advanced” reactor design because it will use liquid sodium for cooling, which requires less water and provides more energy efficiency, it says. The plant will also use a different type of radioactive fuel referred to as high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU), which is more potent than traditional nuclear fuels.
If the pilot project is successful, the company plans to deploy dozens of Natrium plants across the globe, and possibly several more in Wyoming.
Clearing permit hurdles
TerraPower commenced construction on some non-nuclear facilities associated with the project last year. The Wyoming Industrial Siting Council granted a construction permit in January, greenlighting all non-nuclear portions of the Kemmerer Power Station Unit 1 plant.
The federal commission issued a draft environmental impact statement for the nuclear side of the project in June, one month ahead of schedule, it said. 
Though the federal agency is working under an expedited timeline, it warned there may be “unresolved items” related to any “substantive” public comments to address after the December deadline. “The accelerated timeline depends on a continued commitment from [the developer] to resolve these issues and provide necessary information in a timely manner,” the agency wrote in a letter to TerraPower.

About one in four New Mexicans gets SNAP and about two in five New Mexicans are on Medicaid.,"Charles Sallee, right, speaks to a legislative committee in 2023 in Santa Fe. Sallee, the Legislative Finance Committee director, presented some lawmakers Wednesday with a sense of the tough choices they'll have to make if the ""Big, Beautiful Bill"" becomes law in a state with the highest per-capita reliance on SNAP and Medicaid.  (Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)A top budget adviser to New Mexico lawmakers Wednesday laid out the most detailed look he could muster on what the Senate budget reconciliation bill could mean for New Mexico, particularly when it comes to federal spending on health care and food aid here.
Legislative Finance Committee Director Charles Sallee’s presentation was to a special state legislative committee grappling with expected federal cuts. It comes a day after the United States Senate narrowly passed the “Big, Beautiful Bill,” which contains steep cuts to Medicaid and food stamps payments over the next decade. The bill now heads back to the House.
Sallee said the Legislature’s approach in recent years of parking record oil and gas revenues in interest-earning reserve funds has insulated taxpayers from a devastating blow to the state budget. Despite that, the state cannot afford to “backfill” all the expected losses, and his team of analysts is only beginning to try to calculate the many indirect economic implications of the cuts, including to farms, hospitals and the state’s overall financial health. 
“I think fiscally, we’re in the best shape to be able to handle this,” Sallee said. But nonetheless: “There’s a lot of uncertainty.”
New Mexico Health Care Authority Secretary Kari Armijo told the same committee Tuesday that as many as 88,530 New Mexicans will lose their Medicaid coverage due to provisions in the bill. The bill will also likely cause 58,180 New Mexicans to lose their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, she said. 
Those are significant cuts in the state that has the highest per-capita percentage of SNAP recipients and Medicaid recipients in the country. About one in four New Mexicans gets SNAP and about two in five New Mexicans are on Medicaid. 
New Mexico hospitals and patients face closure from ‘domino effect’ of potential Medicaid cuts

The Medicaid cuts would mean more than 10% of 878,000 New Mexicans who currently rely on Medicaid would lose their coverage. The SNAP cuts would mean about 13% of 463,000 SNAP recipients would lose their food benefits. 
In addition to those who lose their coverage or benefits outright, hundreds of thousands more will see benefits reduced or increased paperwork or other burdens, including work requirements, Armijo said.
Sallee tailored his presentation Wednesday to how the bill in its current form could affect state coffers and also detailed the federal budget deficit that Republican members of Congress say they’re trying to address with the cuts. Even with the lawmakers’ efforts to rein in spending, a Congressional Budget Office estimate concludes the bill will add $3.5 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. 
Sallee stressed that lawmakers need to look closely at when certain provisions of the bill go into effect and consider the long view of the cuts, which are phased in over years in some cases over the course of a decade, as they consider the state’s response. 
Lawmakers will have to figure out how the state will respond to caps on provider taxes and Medicaid reimbursement that will hit rural hospitals especially hard, Sallee said. 
At least 15 rural New Mexico hospitals are vulnerable to closure due to provisions in the reconciliation, Democratic senators said in a letter in June to President Donald Trump. Six to eight of them could close here within 18 months, advocates and hospital executives said last month. 
The House and Senate will have to reconcile their different methods of reducing Medicaid reimbursement rates and provider taxes states use to increase the federal share of Medicaid payments, Sallee said Wednesday. 
Report outlines how New Mexico could counter federal food benefits cuts

The Senate version reduced the tax limit by half a percent beginning next year, whereas the House version prohibits new provider taxes. The Senate version similarly phases in reductions in reimbursement rates versus the House’s approach, according to Sallee’s presentation. 
As for SNAP, uncertainty looms about whether New Mexico’s “error rate” will help or hurt it in the end, Sallee said. 
The reconciliation bill seeks to impose a share of administrative costs, as well as the cost of the benefits themselves, on states, with a higher percentage of that cost-share imposed on states that have a high degree of overpaying or underpaying SNAP benefits. New Mexico’s rate is about 14.6%, according to recent federal Agriculture Department estimates. 
The House version of the bill would make states pay between 5% and 25% of the benefit costs, plus 75% of administrative costs for SNAP, based on the error rate. A Senate version from mid-June reduces the benefit costs borne by states to between 5% and 15%. 
On Wednesday, Sallee said the Senate version of the bill passed overnight might actually “reward” states with high error rates, like New Mexico, by giving them until 2029 to fix their error rates before imposing the increased cost-share. 
“The language is not entirely clear exactly how this is going to work, who’s going to be really in or out,” he said. “But at the very least it looks like that’s an example of where you’re going to hear a lot of people saying there’s going to be big cuts for food security in New Mexico.

Aug. 10, 2024. (AnnMarie Hilton/Maine Morning Star)Kelli Austin is already juggling being in school, taking care of her children, and running a business. Now, the Waterville resident is worried she will have to choose between food and medicine. Or skip medical appointments so her kids can go to the doctor. 
“It’s not just me and my kids that are affected by this. There are so many kids right now with parents that are struggling, working two jobs already and juggling multiple hats just to just to barely get by,” she said.
Austin, like thousands of Mainers, relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, and Medicaid, which she is scared she will lose because of work requirements in Republicans’ budget reconciliation bill that passed the U.S. Senate on Tuesday. 
“If this goes through, it’s not just numbers on a page,” she said. “It’s gonna be missed appointments, closed clinics and deferred dreams.”
Advocates are warning of the disastrous consequences if the budget reconciliation bill becomes law, including jeopardizing access to food and cutting health care from thousands of low income people and families. 
Interviews with representatives from half a dozen different groups underscored the concern that the effects of the bill will also be felt by middle class families, small businesses and rural hospitals for years to come.
The bill, which Maine’s entire congressional delegation voted against, is slated for a final vote in the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday, though stalled due to some Republican resistance. The Senate version, which Republican Sen. Susan Collins voted against after initially casting a vote to advance the bill, added provisions that made the bill worse, many experts said.  
“It is one of the largest transfers of wealth and greatest cuts to health care and food assistance in this country’s history,” said Alex Carter, a policy advocate for Maine Equal Justice, a civil legal aid and economic justice organization. “I don’t think it’s dramatic or hyperbolic to say that people are going to go hungry. People are going to not be able to meet their basic needs, and people are going to die if this bill passes.”
The bill restricts access to Medicaid, institutes work requirements for food and health care assistance, makes certain reproductive health providers ineligible for federal funding and requires states to cover some SNAP costs, the federal government currently funds. It will also increase premiums for marketplace health insurance. All those cuts are meant to pay for extending tax cuts passed during President Donald Trump’s first term that mostly benefit the wealthy, as well as fund a significant increase in immigration enforcement.
Many of the advocates who spoke with Maine Morning Star emphasized these provisions will be particularly challenging for a rural, aging state like Maine, where food insecurity, child hunger and health care infrastructure are already stressed and the state does not have extra funding to make up for federal cuts.










I don't think it's dramatic or hyperbolic to say that people are going to go hungry. People are going to not be able to meet their basic needs, and people are going to die if this bill passes.


– Alex Carter, Maine Equal Justice


“When you look at this bill and what it means for Maine and for Maine people, it effectively means that we’re going to lose services,” said Garrett Martin, president and CEO of the Maine Center for Economic Policy.
While much of the bill’s opposition has focused on the threats to Medicaid — which an estimated 30,000 Mainers could lose as a result  — there are other compounding impacts that target the same groups of people whose health care is at risk, Martin and others explained.
The impacts may not be felt immediately because different provisions in the bill take effect on different timelines (including some as late as 2028), but “it’s going to take two to three years before people really start to understand how significant this legislation is going to impact them and their communities,” Martin said.
Nutrition assistance impact 
The bill will, for the first time, make states like Maine bear some of the cost of SNAP. According to the bill, states with a higher rate of errors, meaning benefits incorrectly issued, will have to bear up to 15% of the costs of the program, which could cost the state up to $60 million in benefits —  an unsustainable burden that could effectively dismantle the entire program, according to Anna Korsen, policy and program director at Full Plates, Full Potential, which advocates for state and federal support for child nutrition. 
The bill also introduces stringent work reporting requirements that would make nutrition benefits harder to obtain and maintain, particularly for families with children and older adults. 
Although the vast majority of the 176,000 Mainers who use SNAP meet the work requirements, Korsen said the administrative challenge of filling out SNAP benefit forms is already daunting for families. Adding the additional work requirement will push people out of the program, she said.
“The problem isn’t that people aren’t working. The challenge that they’re creating is that people are going to get caught up in all of this red tape and paperwork,” she said. ​“So what they’re trying to do is just make SNAP harder to get and harder to keep.”
When she was finishing school, Austin was part of Maine’s Parents as Scholars financial aid program, which made her eligible for federal assistance. But under the budget bill, she will have to meet work requirements to be eligible for SNAP and Medicaid, which she said is a challenge as a single mom. 
“I struggle just to get by as it is, let alone taking me out of the house for that many hours and making me juggle that much more,” she said. “It’s not that we’re unwilling to work, it’s that we’re underserved.”
“I’m not asking for a handout by any right, but I’m asking for a fair shot for myself and my kids,” Austin added.
Calling Medicaid a ‘lifeline’ for Mainers, health advocates urge Collins to oppose GOP budget bill

The changes would not only impact food security but also harm local economies, with SNAP benefits generating nearly $548 million in annual economic activity in Maine. Small grocery stores could lose up to 20% of their revenue, and local farms could also suffer significant setbacks by losing the revenue that comes from SNAP. 
Korsen argued that the bill’s provisions create an all-or-nothing scenario for states, forcing them to either pay massive new costs or opt out of the SNAP program entirely.
Indirectly, the legislation also threatens other forms of food assistance, such as free school meals, summer nutrition programs, and WIC benefits, because if a family qualifies for Medicaid or SNAP benefits, they are automatically eligible for free meals. This direct certification allows school districts to be accurately reimbursed by the federal government for providing those meals.
“Schools are scared, families are scared,” Korsen said. “It’s just unbelievable that our government would think that this is okay.”
The proposal also ends the work requirement exemption for homeless people and veterans on SNAP, which means thousands of vulnerable people could go hungry, according to Terence Miller, advocacy director at the Portland-based homeless services organization Preble Street. 
That would put even more strain on privately run food banks, which already faced setbacks when the U.S. Department of Agriculture cut programs that allow them to buy from local farms.
“I mean, a veteran who fought for our country and finds themselves unhoused and needing food is no longer eligible to receive SNAP benefits,” he said. “It’s just unfathomable to me to think that those people will not be able to buy their own food.”
Impact on marketplace health insurance 
In addition to sweeping Medicaid cuts, thousands of Maine residents who rely on marketplace health insurance could see their premiums dramatically increase. 
According to an analysis by the Maine Center for Economic Policy, approximately 63,000 Mainers with marketplace coverage will be significantly impacted by the expiration of premium tax credits, Martin said.
For example, a family of four earning around $78,000 annually could see its monthly premiums double from $263 to $476. Even more stark are the potential increases for older residents: a 62-year-old couple earning $85,000 might face a premium jump from $608 to $2,346 per month.
Those premium tax credits have been crucial in making health insurance affordable, Martin explained. About 85% of marketplace participants currently receive these subsidies, which help cap health insurance costs for individuals and families.
The potential elimination of these credits represents more than just a financial burden, Martin added, it could force many Maine residents to choose between maintaining health coverage or cutting other essential expenses. 
“At the same time that health coverage is being taken away from low income households and individuals and people with disabilities, we’re also seeing a scenario in which arguably middle class families are likely to see a significant increase in costs for themselves as a consequence of this,” Martin said.

(Provided by the S.C. Department of Corrections)A death row inmate could be the seventh scheduled for execution in the past 10 months after a Lexington County judge decided this week he did not have an intellectual disability.
Gary Terry was convicted in 1997 of raping and killing a neighbor in her West Columbia home. Terry, now 57, has claimed that he and 47-year-old Urai Jackson were having a consensual relationship but that he struck her over the head during an argument, accidentally killing her.
  Gary Terry. (Provided/SC Department of Corrections)
After running out of normal appeals, Terry received a temporary reprieve after claiming that he had an intellectual disability, which would mean he couldn’t be executed. Brain scans showed that Terry had damage in the part of his brain responsible for controlling focus and behavior, likely caused by a small stroke, his attorneys argued in court filings.
But Terry’s attorneys failed to prove in court that Terry had enough damage to his brain to warrant pausing his execution, meaning his death sentence “must be carried out,” Circuit Court Judge Robert Hood wrote in a decision filed Tuesday.
Terry’s attorney did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.
It’s unclear whether there will be additional appeals and when an execution might be scheduled.
The state Supreme Court typically sends out death warrants on Fridays, but because this Friday is a holiday, the soonest Terry might receive a warrant would be July 11.
By state law, executions must take place at 6 p.m. on the fourth Friday after a death warrant is issued.
In order for inmates to avoid the death chamber, they must prove they have “significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning” that causes “adaptive behavior” before the age of 18, Hood wrote.
Scans of Terry’s brain showed dead tissue and decreased blood flow to part of his brain. He suffered multiple head injuries before the crime for which he was convicted, including while working for a tree company in Florida, in a motorcycle accident and during a fight in which someone hit him over the head with a board, his mother testified during his 1997 trial.
Terry also started lashing out and showing problems with impulsivity after sniffing glue and losing consciousness when he was 13, his mother testified. He was later diagnosed with intermittent explosive disorder, a mental health condition that causes short bouts of rage, as well as antisocial personality disorder and alcohol dependance, according to court filings.
Still, Terry’s intellectual functioning remained in the “low-average” range, which is not enough to constitute an intellectual disability. An expert who testified during Terry’s 1997 trial agreed with that conclusion, and the experts who testified on behalf of Terry during a 2024 hearing in Lexington County failed to prove any different, Hood wrote.
“The record also shows a history not of intellectual disability but of learning disabilities and drug use, which began as a teenager, and later in life, head injuries,” Hood wrote.
Terry is one of 25 inmates on South Carolina’s death row. One inmate is held in California for crimes committed in that state.
Six other inmates have been put to death since the state resumed executions in September. That followed a 13-year unintended hiatus, during which the state’s supply of lethal injection drugs expired and couldn’t be restocked.
Under an updated law keeping nearly all information about executions secret, officials were able to obtain pentobarbital, a sedative that is lethal in large doses. Last July, the state Supreme Court officially allowed the process to resume by ruling that electrocution and firing squad — a method legislators added to state law in 2021 — were constitutional.
Two inmates have since elected to die by firing squad. The rest have chosen lethal injection.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0541-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-07-02 18:09:26.887986

Andy Kim and Cory Booker said Wednesday. (Spencer Platt | Getty Images)Several of New Jersey’s Democratic leaders are blasting President Donald Trump’s nomination of Alina Habba as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey as a partisan power grab aimed at reshaping the state to serve his political agenda. 
Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee who previously worked in the U.S. Attorney’s Office, said Habba is unqualified for the job. Habba, 41, had no prosecutorial experience when Trump appointed her in an interim capacity in March. 
“Habba has explicitly stated her goal to politicize the office where I served as a prosecutor, and as acting U.S. Attorney, she has already weaponized it against her perceived political opponents,” Sherrill said in a statement Wednesday. 
The White House announced Tuesday that Trump nominated Habba to a full four-year term. When he previously named her as the interim attorney, Trump said Habba would “fight tirelessly to secure a legal system that is both fair and just for the wonderful people of New Jersey.”
Within days of assuming her role, Habba said she would investigate Gov. Phil Murphy and state Attorney General Matt Platkin over the state’s immigration directive limiting law enforcement’s cooperation in civil immigration investigations. She also said on a conservative podcast that she hopes to “turn New Jersey red.” 
In less than four months as acting U.S. Attorney, Habba has drawn ire from judges for ignoring the historically nonpartisan stance of the office. 
She’s targeted Democratic officials who have opposed Trump’s mass detention and deportation plans, including Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was arrested May 9 outside an immigrant detention facility in the city. Habba later charged Rep. LaMonica McIver, a Democrat, with assault in connection with a scuffle that broke out when Baraka was detained. McIver pleaded not guilty to the charges and faces a trial in November. 
When Baraka’s charges were dropped 10 days after his arrest, a judge scolded prosecutors from Habba’s office, warning them that it should not be used to “satisfy public clamor, nor to advance political agendas.” 
Baraka sued Habba over his arrest, claiming he was maliciously prosecuted out of political retribution. Habba responded by saying the mayor should join her in “prioritizing violent crime and public safety.” 
In a joint statement Wednesday, Sens. Andy Kim and Cory Booker, both Democrats, also accused Habba of degrading her office. 
“The people of New Jersey deserve a U.S. Attorney that has deep experience with law enforcement, a reputation and an approach that puts partisanship to the side and who will work to keep our communities safe and impartially pursue justice,” they said. “In her short tenure as an interim U.S. Attorney, she has degraded the office and pursued frivolous and politically motivated prosecutions.”
Habba hasn’t responded to the criticism but did repost a defense on social media Wednesday by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who called her “a fearless, fair, and effective public servant.”
Habba must be confirmed by the Senate by the end of July, but a confirmation hearing has not yet been scheduled. Her 120-day interim appointment expires in three weeks, but judges in New Jersey’s U.S. District Court could allow her to stay pending confirmation.

I think cruelty is the point,” Feist, 61, of Washington, D.C., and originally from North Dakota, told States Newsroom. “It's also extremely alarming that there's such cowardice in the GOP.”The massive budget reconciliation package, passed by Senate Republicans Tuesday with a tie-breaking vote by Vice President JD Vance, extends and expands 2017 tax cuts at a cost of roughly $4.5 trillion over the next decade. It also yanks funding from federal food and health safety net programs.

The bill aggressively rolls back clean energy tax credits, as well as raising the nation’s borrowing limit to $5 trillion.Latest figures from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office show the package would add $3.4 trillion to the nation’s deficit over the next decade, when the country is mired in record-breaking debt. That office’s earlier analysis of the House-passed bill found the package would reduce resources for low-income families while padding higher earners.Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, who chaired an hours-long final committee hearing about the bill overnight, said Wednesday the package is an “embodiment of the America First agenda and we would all do well to remember that.”Medicaid cutsTop of mind for Feist is the bill’s cuts to Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for low-income individuals and some with disabilities. The Senate version of the package, passed Tuesday, included a  $1 trillion cut to Medicaid over 10 years, according to the CBO.“I have parents in North Dakota who are 85 and 86. They already have difficulty seeing their doctor. For every doctor that leaves, he takes on 14 times more burden. Rural health care is already extremely difficult. I would expect there will not be a hospital near where my parents live if this bill is signed into law,” said Feist, whose parents live near Minot.Rural hospitals rely on Medicaid payments. In a last-minute move before Tuesday’s vote, Senate Republicans doubled a fund to $50 billion to subsidize hospitals that will lose funding. Critics say that amount is not enough to fill the gap.GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina voted no after voicing concerns over Medicaid cuts.SNAP and ICEMark Starr sang a protest song he wrote about the “big beautiful bill” as he played guitar and harmonica outside the Longworth House Office Building Wednesday.The 39-year-old Albuquerque, New Mexico, native told States Newsroom he drove to the capital in late April to begin protesting the bill. He said he’s particularly focused on additional funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement contained in the package as well as cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which provides food benefits to low-income households.

(Video by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom) “New Mexico is pretty poor, and so if these cuts to SNAP go, kids can go hungry in New Mexico,” Starr said. “It's just, like, really gonna mess us up, and we're just one of the many states that will be affected that way.”New Mexico has one of the highest poverty rates in the nation.A provision in the bill will shift food assistance costs to state governments for the first time in the federal program’s history. Critics worry that states could tighten eligibility requirements or drop the program because of the financial burden.The left-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities estimates 55,000 teens age 14 and up, and adults up to age 64 could lose food assistance in New Mexico because of the bill’s cuts to state work requirement waivers. Children would remain eligible but households would overall see significantly decreased SNAP dollars.The CBO found in late May that the House-passed bill would result in over 3 million people nationwide losing food assistance.Starr said he’s also against additional funding provided for immigration enforcement.“I think they have enough,” he said, pointing to Trump’s visit to a new detention facility in Florida that the White House is touting as “Alligator Alcatraz.”The Senate-approved version includes an additional $45 billion for ICE detention facilities and $29.9 billion for ICE enforcement and deportation, among billions more directed toward the Southern border.Clean energy to take a hitTiernan Sittenfeld, of the League of Conservation Voters, huddled just outside the House with a group wearing t-shirts that read “Hands off our air, land and clean energy.”Sittenfeld, the organization’s senior vice president of government affairs, argues the rollbacks of clean energy tax credits in the Senate version will “kill clean energy jobs.”“It is bad for our economy. It's bad for jobs. It's going to raise people's energy bills. And of course, it's bad for the planet,” she said.Senate Republicans accelerated the phase-out of some residential, manufacturing and production credits at a faster rate than the House bill. A last-minute change loosened the timeline on some tech-neutral energy credits though, and removed a previously added tax on wind and solar projects.

Industry groups and energy companies small and large have warned early termination of the credits will have a major impact on growth.The tax credits for solar, wind, batteries for energy storage, and electric vehicles, among others, were enacted under Democrats’ own 2022 budget reconciliation bill known as the “Inflation Reduction Act.”The majority of investment in new clean energy manufacturing and production has been concentrated in rural states and states that elected Trump to his second term, according to data collected since 2022 by the Clean Investment Monitor, a joint project by the Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research.“Any Republican who votes for this legislation is voting against the interest of their constituents, voting to kill jobs in their district, voting to kill clean energy projects, voting to make their constituents’ energy bills go up,” Sittenfeld said.Far-right House members who as of Wednesday afternoon were withholding their votes maintain the rollbacks on the clean energy tax cuts, which",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-07-02 18:09:26.887986

The U.S. Department of Education announced Tuesday it has frozen six federal programs that collectively distribute $6.8 billion across the country. The federal agency said it would not send out the money by July 1, the start of the 2026 fiscal year for states and schools, because it is still reviewing the funding.
“The department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the president’s priorities and the department’s statutory responsibilities,” the agency wrote in a message to states.
Withheld funds include nearly $31.37 million that Oklahoma districts use for teacher professional development, $15.68 million that support before- and after-school programs, $6.43 million dedicated for the 13% of Oklahoma students learning English as their non-native language and $240,000 for the children of migrant workers. Another $7.3 million for adult education in Oklahoma also is affected.
The Trump administration also said it froze funds from Title IV Part A, which provide $16.35 million for academic enrichment in Oklahoma schools. However, the Oklahoma State Department of Education said it started receiving money from this program for the 2026 fiscal year.
Federal dollars from the other affected funds have not yet arrived, the state department reported last week.

State Superintendent Ryan Walters advised schools to budget only for federal funds that already have been awarded.
“We appreciate the fact that the Trump administration is working diligently to ensure our taxpayer dollars are being stewarded with care,” Walters said in a statement. “(The state Department of Education) is working in lockstep with the Trump administration to assist with our mutually-aligned education priorities.”
Walters also took to social media to mock California being frozen out of the same programs that Oklahoma and all other states are currently unable to access.
In response to California state Superintendent Tony Thurmond saying the Trump administration’s withholding of funds “will harm students” and “cannot stand,” Walters wrote in a Tuesday post, “Don’t break the law by pushing racist CRT and DEI tactics, by push LGBTQ ideology on kids, and even allow boys to compete in women’s sports.”
The U.S. Department of Education has proposed eliminating the affected programs in future years. Instead, it aims to give out larger, more flexible grants that state leaders can decide how to spend.
In Oklahoma City Public Schools, 47% of students are learning English as their second language. The district expected $1.1 million in federal revenue from Title III, which supports English learners, according to its annual budget, which the Oklahoma City Board of Education approved Monday.
Oklahoma City schools also projected $7.6 million in Title II funds for teacher professional development, up from $3.3 million last year.

“We urge federal leaders to reconsider this action, as these dollars directly support essential staff and programs that make a difference for our students every day,” district spokesperson Crystal Raymond said in a statement. “These funds are critical to our ability to support educators and deliver on our commitment to student success. As always, we will continue to put students first, and we look forward to welcoming our 33,000 students back to classrooms on Aug. 13.”
Now-frozen federal dollars also enable before- and after-school programs across the state, mostly in rural areas. Money for the initiative comes from Title IV Part B, also known as 21st Century Community Learning Centers.
Eufaula Public Schools in eastern Oklahoma receives $300,000 from this program to fund its after-school care and summer learning, Superintendent Monty Guthrie said.
The district also receives about $50,000 for teacher recruitment and professional development from Title II, also known as “supporting effective instruction.” Teacher development needs have become more expensive, Guthrie said, as emergency certified educators and uncertified adjunct teachers become more common in Oklahoma.
Federal money for after-care programs allows Eufaula schools to provide these services for free to low-income families who otherwise wouldn’t be able to pay, Guthrie said. About 180 students participate throughout the school year.
These programs are a “huge, huge plus,” he said, especially in rural towns that have few other childcare options.
Eufaula schools would need to receive federal funds by November for the program to be financially viable this school year, Guthrie said. Otherwise, the district would have to discontinue the services, “which would be very difficult for our families.”
“You just have to plan to continue on, and if things change we’ll have to adjust,” Guthrie said. “We certainly feel that it is a great service to our students and our parents, and we’re going to try to provide that.”

El 30 de mayo, el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional de EE. UU. (DHS) publicó una lista de más de 500 ciudades, condados y estados que designó como jurisdicciones “santuario”. El propio estado de Connecticut, además de seis de sus municipios, figuraban en la lista, ahora eliminada.
Algunos representantes locales se sorprendieron al ver a sus municipios en la lista. Otros no.
El término “ciudad santuario” es controvertido porque no tiene una definición legal oficial, pero generalmente se refiere a las jurisdicciones que limitan su cooperación con las autoridades federales de inmigración.
Esto es lo que necesita saber sobre las ciudades santuario y la reacción de los funcionarios de Connecticut ante la designación del DHS.
¿Qué son las ciudades santuario?
Según Global Refuge, una organización sin fines de lucro que ayuda a las personas a establecerse en EE. UU., las ciudades santuario tienen políticas que establecen límites sobre la información o el apoyo que los gobiernos locales o estatales brindan a las autoridades federales de inmigración. 
El Departamento de Seguridad Nacional, por su parte, clasifica una jurisdicción santuario como “ciudades, condados y estados que obstruyen deliberadamente la aplicación de las leyes federales de inmigración y ponen en peligro a los ciudadanos estadounidenses”.
Según la organización nacional Vera Institute of Justice, las ciudades santuario suelen ubicarse en zonas con grandes poblaciones de inmigrantes.
Según el Consejo Americano de Inmigración, algunas de las llamadas “políticas santuario” pueden incluir medidas como: limitar la capacidad de la policía local o estatal para “arrestar o detener a personas por violaciones civiles federales de inmigración”; prohibir acuerdos de cooperación como el 287(g), que permite al ICE (Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas) designar a agentes locales; impedir que el personal local pregunte sobre el estatus migratorio o restringir la información que se puede compartir con agencias federales.
¿Qué ciudades de Connecticut estaban en la lista?
Las ciudades de East Haven, New Haven, Windham, New London, Hartford y Hamden fueron incluidas en la lista del DHS. El propio estado de Connecticut también fue designado como “jurisdicción santuario”. El Departamento de Seguridad Nacional no explicó por qué se citó específicamente a estas ciudades de Connecticut ni cuáles fueron los criterios para su inclusión en la lista. Tampoco explicó por qué se eliminó la lista.
De los municipios incluidos en la lista, solo Hartford y Windham han promulgado resoluciones que se autodenominan ciudades santuario, mientras que New Haven y Hamden se han designado como “Ciudades Acogedoras”.
En un comunicado, la ciudad de East Haven afirmó que su inclusión en la lista fue incorrecta. “Seamos claros: ninguna agencia federal informó a la ciudad de East Haven sobre esta designación, ni estamos de acuerdo con ella”, afirmaba el comunicado.
“La clasificación emitida por el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional no solo fue absurda, sino también infundada”, declaró el alcalde de East Haven, Joseph A. Carfora. “Antes de que se eliminara la página, mi administración contactó al DHS para exigir una aclaración y comprender cómo se hizo una declaración tan infundada sin consultar ni comunicarse con nuestra oficina. No permitiremos que East Haven sea malinterpretada sin rendir cuentas.”
Sin embargo, los funcionarios de New Haven y Windham también afirmaron que nunca recibieron notificación de su inclusión en la lista. “Windham tiene una gran población latina y es bien sabido que la actual administración [federal] se centra en las comunidades pobres, ya que contamos con recursos limitados”, declaró el alcalde Thomas DeVivo.
El alcalde de New London, Michael Passero, afirmó desconocer la definición de ciudad santuario. “Solo puedo decirles que New London nunca se ha declarado ciudad santuario”, afirmó.
¿Cuáles son las políticas de la ciudad en materia de inmigración?
No todas las ciudades se consideran ciudades santuario, pero todas tienen políticas que abordan la inmigración de alguna manera. 
En New Haven, el alcalde Justin Elicker firmó una orden ejecutiva de “Ciudad Acogedora” en 2020, afirmando “el compromiso de la ciudad de garantizar que los residentes se sientan seguros al acceder a los servicios públicos”.
La directiva prohíbe a los empleados municipales preguntar o revelar el estatus migratorio de una persona, a menos que lo exija la ley estatal o federal. Elicker declaró en una conferencia de prensa el mes pasado que New Haven no obstruye la justicia. Añadió que las políticas de bienvenida de la ciudad hacen que la comunidad sea más segura al animar a las personas a denunciar delitos, buscar atención médica y enviar a sus hijos a la escuela sin temor.
“Esto era algo que esperábamos y estamos orgullosos de ello”, declaró en una conferencia de prensa, refiriéndose a la inclusión de New Haven en la lista de ciudades santuario. “New Haven se enorgullece de ser una ciudad acogedora… Nuestra comunidad inmigrante es parte de nuestra familia New Haven”.
La política de East Haven es que, dado que la aplicación de las leyes migratorias es responsabilidad del gobierno federal, el Departamento de Policía de East Haven generalmente no participa en operaciones de ICE, excepto “cuando se le solicite formalmente como parte de una investigación criminal en curso, o para notificar a los funcionarios federales en situaciones graves donde se perciba una amenaza a la seguridad pública o nacional”.
El Código de Ordenanzas de Hartford declara oficialmente a Hartford como una “ciudad santuario”. Las leyes locales establecen que todos los residentes de Hartford, independientemente de su estatus migratorio, tienen igual acceso a los servicios municipales y a las derivaciones a agencias médicas o sociales. Esta política no impide que los empleados municipales cooperen con las autoridades federales de inmigración cuando sea legalmente requerido.
Las políticas de Hamden limitan la participación de la policía local en la aplicación de las leyes migratorias federales. Los agentes no pueden preguntar sobre el estatus migratorio a menos que esté relacionado con una investigación criminal, ni interrogar a víctimas o testigos sobre su estatus. Tampoco pueden arrestar ni detener a personas basándose únicamente en órdenes de detención civiles u órdenes administrativas, excepto según lo exija la ley estatal. Los recursos municipales, incluyendo la policía y el personal escolar, no pueden utilizarse para ayudar a ICE a menos que así lo exija una ley estatal o una orden de un juez federal.
New London ha compartido en su sitio web municipal el Plan de Preparación Familiar: Preparando a la Familia para la Aplicación de la Ley de Inmigración. Este es un documento estatal que contiene información para familias preocupadas por la aplicación de la ley de inmigración, no específico de New London.
El Departamento de Policía de New London prohíbe a los oficiales preguntar sobre el estatus migratorio a menos que esté directamente relacionado con una investigación criminal, según una orden ejecutiva local. Los oficiales tampoco pueden detener o interrogar a personas únicamente por sospechas de violaciones migratorias, pero la política establece que la policía local puede ayudar a las autoridades federales si se les solicita.
Windham se convirtió en una ciudad santuario tras una resolución de 2017 aprobada por unanimidad. La resolución reafirmó su compromiso de proteger a todos los residentes, incluyendo a los inmigrantes indocumentados que contribuyen a la comunidad. También establece que ningún funcionario o personal municipal arrestará, detendrá ni denunciará a una persona basándose únicamente en su estatus migratorio o de ciudadanía, excepto debido a una orden judicial penal válida o para cumplir con una orden de detención migratoria civil.

On Tuesday, as the federal government continued its unprecedented attack on clean energy and climate funding, Vermont’s Climate Council published its 2025 Climate Action Plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote resiliency in the state.
The plan is a requirement set by the 2020 Global Warming Solutions Act to publish a new framework every four years for tackling the climate crisis. The 2025 plan could guide legislative action on helping Vermonters, especially those with low or moderate incomes, adopt more efficient and less polluting sources of home heat and transportation, the two highest-emitting sectors in the state. 
Other priorities included mitigating future climate hazards, building a climate-ready workforce, weatherizing an additional 79,000 homes, reducing or sequestering emissions on farmland and finding funding to implement all these ideas.
While Vermont files its second Climate Action Plan to try and meet legally-binding emissions reductions, federal funding programs that made possible climate initiatives in small states like this one are on the chopping block. Now, as the state looks for other sources of revenue and support to achieve its climate goals, the new plan lays out what Vermonters might see prioritized in the coming years. But with reduced political will in the last legislative session to proactively deal with climate change, it remains to be seen whether those plans are fiscally realistic under a governor who prioritizes short-term affordability over long-term resiliency.

“Before focusing too much on a new, shiny thing, we should really be thinking about how we maintain the current pace and level of effort,” said Julie Moore, Agency of Natural Resources secretary and a member of the Climate Council who voted for the plan. “Maintaining our current pace is far from certain in this moment.” 
The state’s initial Climate Action Plan preceded devastating floods that wrecked homes and businesses along Vermont’s river valleys in 2023 and 2024. As the atmosphere warms, holding more moisture, precipitation in Vermont has become heavier and more frequent, causing deluges that can lead to deadly floods. 
Climate change, largely driven by the burning of fossil fuels, has also brought increased high heat days that most homes in Vermont are ill-equipped to handle. Wildland fires have become more common and air quality has diminished in the warmer months as enormous wildfires burn elsewhere, according to the plan.
But even with the tangible effects of climate change in Vermont, state lawmakers’ attempts to significantly reduce emissions along outlines from the 2021 Climate Action Plan have failed to meet state emissions targets. Big proposals like the clean heat standard were shelved during the spring legislative session, and the state likely missed its 2025 emissions-reduction target required by the Global Warming Solutions Act. A court case currently playing out in Montpelier could help determine whether the state missed that target.
Now, as the state looks for more guidance on how to lower its emissions, the federal government could squeeze Vermont further as the Trump administration eviscerates clean energy funding and advances in climate science prioritized under President Biden. The 2025 Climate Action Plan recognized the impact of federal cuts, noting that the work to combat climate change was not about to get easier.

What’s in the plan?
The Global Warming Solutions Act binds the state to lower greenhouse gas emissions by milestones set in state statute: 26% below 2005 emissions levels by 2025, 40% below 1990 levels by 2030, and 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. 
The Climate Action Plan outlines pathways to reach those goals every four years, through Climate Council planning meetings, technical analysis with consultants, and community input. More than 1,000 Vermonters and Vermont-based organizations participated in creating the plan, including 850 who joined virtual and in-person meetings and 250 who submitted public comments, according to the plan.
But even with four years of planning, Vermont is still behind its legally-binding goals. While the state initially claimed that it reached that first milestone on Jan. 1, 2025, a report by the Energy Action Network, a Vermont-based collective of energy nonprofits, instead found Vermont to have fallen up to 39% short of the emissions reduction required by law. 
Moore’s agency reviewed the report and has agreed that the state was unlikely to achieve the 2025 goal, but final datasets to assess emissions won’t be available until 2027.
Previous ambitious reductions programs like the clean heat standard were shelved after a campaign by out-of-state fuel lobbyists along with Gov. Phil Scott’s rejection of the plan as unaffordable. State regulators found costs associated with the program were too high, but some members of the Climate Council disagree with those fiscal priorities. 
“When we have a conversation on benefits and costs, we can’t lose sight of the cost of the status quo, which is already too high,” said Jared Duval, one of the 23 state-appointed members of the Climate Council. He quoted numbers from the state tax department that found about $2 billion a year was spent on fossil fuels for transportation and heating in 2024. An economic analysis done for the Climate Action Plan identified a potential $6 billion in costs that could be avoided by 2050 if the state pursued emissions reductions recommendations, Duval said. 
With the lapse in federal funding, Duval said that in order to reduce emissions, the state would need to return to the polluter-pays principle, where fossil fuel corporations are responsible for paying for climate damages and resiliency efforts. This principle doesn’t only apply to the state’s legal battle with fossil fuel corporations in the climate superfund law, Duval said. It also stands as the rationale behind ambitious programs like the clean heat standard and the cap-and-invest model, which the climate action plan asked the state to research this year. 
“The cost of those policies has always been designed to apply to importers of fossil fuels to Vermont,” Duval said. While fuel companies have said those costs will be passed onto customers, Duval said a key difference between the clean heat standard, pursued through the 2021 climate action plan, and the cap-and-invest model, again pushed forward by the 2025 plan, is that cap-and-invest can provide direct payments to Vermonters through rebates, based on their income. 
Duval, along with 15 others, voted for the 2025 plan. Two councillors were not present to vote, and five voted against it, including Sarah Clark, the Agency of Administration secretary; Anson Tebbetts, the Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets secretary; Michele Boomhower on behalf of Joe Flynn, the Agency of Transportation secretary; Lindsay Kurrle, Agency of Commerce and Community Development secretary; and Matt Cota, owner of Meadow Hill Consulting and representing the fuel sector. All except for Cota are in Gov. Scott’s administration and report to the governor, who has worked to overturn the legal requirements in the Global Warming Solutions Act. 
Others were reluctant with their yes votes. While Moore, secretary of the Agency of Natural Resources,, voted for the plan, she said that decision was mainly a reflection of her appreciation of the work of state government staff. Moore said she continues to have “some real concerns.”
“Specifically, I’m concerned about what it will take to operationalize the plan’s vision,” Moore said. “It’s sort of left up to interpretation.”
The Conservation Law Foundation, which sued the state last year claiming the Agency of Natural Resources failed to properly prepare to meet the 2025 emissions goal, called the 2025 Climate Action Plan “toothless” in a statement on Tuesday. 
“The Council has worked hard to come to a consensus and deliver recommendations that include financial incentives to drive down emissions,” said Elena Mihaly, the foundation’s vice president for Vermont. “But it has failed to put in place real, enforceable policies that demand major polluters do their part too.”

The return of cap-and-invest
Much of the council’s attention this last year has been on a cap-and-invest program to reduce climate pollution. Cap-and-invest programs place a declining cap on greenhouse gas emissions, according to the state, while reinvesting the proceeds to climate-friendly projects like energy efficiency and weatherization. In March, Mike Pieciak, Vermont state treasurer, spoke to the council during a special session on cap-and-invest, reminding members that of the billions the state spends on fossil fuels, “over 75% of those dollars flow out of the state.”
But a cap-and-invest model could keep more money in the state and create up to 810 jobs, according to Pieciak, especially if the state were to partner with cap-and-invest initiatives already underway such as the Western Climate Initiative, which includes California, Quebec and Washington, and the cap-and-invest program in New York state. A modified clean heat standard could complement this program, according to the 2025 Climate Action Plan, focusing on the electrification of air and water heating in low- and moderate-income households. 
Such a partnership could avoid problems that Vermont encountered while pursuing a clean heat standard, the council’s previous plan to reduce thermal emissions. In a January report, the Public Utility Commission, which studied the clean heat program, told lawmakers that it would likely be too expensive for the state to take on a first-of-its-kind credit market on its own. 
But this isn’t the first time cap-and-invest has been studied. Over the last four years, the Legislature asked the agency, under guidance from the 2021 Climate Action Plan, to dig into both the clean heat standard and the cap-and-invest program. 
“We’re a little bit taken aback by the price tag associated with each one, along with the administrative complexity,” Moore said. “I’m hopeful that there will be an opportunity for conversation about both what we can do with existing resources.”
Moore said the cap-and-invest program could only work if Vermont joins a multi-state program, and the only one that currently exists – the Western Climate Initiative – has indicated they’re not accepting new members, she said. New York’s plan for cap-and-invest, which could be a better fit as a neighboring state, is not yet operational. Instead, Moore said, the state should focus on more actionable items like continuing to weatherize homes as federal funding disappears. 
“It’s absolutely important to acknowledge long term savings associated with these practices, but you can’t gloss over the fact that there are real and significant upfront costs,” Moore said. “Figuring out how to pay for this work to generate long-term savings is fundamental, and the climate plan, I feel, doesn’t give enough treatment to that issue.” 
Richard Cowart, the former chair of the Public Utility Commission and a member of the Climate Council, said the 2025 plan did a good job marrying provisions that can help communities become more resilient against the impacts of climate change alongside measures to reduce carbon emissions, while also saving the state money.
“The notion that addressing climate change has to be viewed simply as a burden is incorrect,” Cowart said, noting that instead the state’s economy could benefit from doing its part to slow the warming world. “How can we afford to continue to spend $2 billion a year to import fossil fuels that we know that we shouldn’t actually be burning?”
He pointed to Efficiency Vermont as an example of how the state has invested in efficiency, saved money, and provided environmental and health benefits. The 2025 plan builds on that experience, he said, and shows that the state doesn’t require federal money to build important programs like the first-of-its-kind utility launched a quarter century ago. 
“We did not need money to launch Efficiency Vermont, instead we made our own decision to reduce bills for Vermonters,” Cowart said. “We can and need to do the same thing with respect to our ongoing fossil fuel bills.”
Federal funding cuts
But how the state will pay for myriad programs and strategies the 2025 plan puts forward appears to be the crux of the climate debate in Vermont, as the arguments over affordability continue. 
On the federal level, the attack on climate action has never been more brutal. For months, the Trump administration has worked to gut billions of dollars in renewable energy incentives and subsidies for proven initiatives like buying electric vehicles and scaling up charging infrastructure, increasing financial access to heat pumps and solar panels, and supporting big-budget projects like green hydrogen and wind energy.
“The cost of electricity to the people you represent and the folks I represent in Vermont is going up,” said U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., directing the remark toward President Trump.
On Friday, Senate Republicans announced a new axe to clean energy: In the Trump administration’s budget overhaul called the One Big Beautiful Bill, the Senate suggested not only cutting federal funding for renewables but taxing those projects. 
The proposal would have penalized solar and wind projects if they sourced materials from countries the Trump administration has a strained relationship with , including China, which dominates the world in clean energy production and materials. The North America’s Building Trades Unions called it “the biggest job-killing bill in the history of this country” and equated it to “terminating more than 1,000 Keystone XL pipeline projects.”
On Tuesday afternoon, the Senate passed the budget reconciliation bill, all but ensuring that Trump’s agenda will go into effect later this summer. But the tax was removed before Vice President J.D. Vance casted the tie-breaking vote as three GOP Senators – Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Sen. Tim Tillis of North Carolina and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine – broke with their party and voted against the bill.
The bill now moves for a vote in the House.  
“In Vermont and across the country, this bill will kill jobs, raise energy prices and move us in exactly the wrong direction in the fight against climate change,” U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., told VTDigger in an email on Monday before the vote. “It will keep our country hooked on dirty and expensive fossil fuels by creating enormous new handouts for the very industry that is destroying the planet in pursuit of massive profits.”
Increasing frequency and severity of disasters have also taken the toll in Vermont: Since 1953, out of the 62 federally declared disasters in the state, half have occurred since 2011. 
The analysis of these disasters was included in the 2025 plan, but the Federal Emergency Management Agency tool that outlined those disasters was taken down by FEMA on June 30, the day before the report was published. Days earlier, the federal climate website, climate.gov, disappeared. 
The web address now redirects users to the climate webpage of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the federal government’s premier climate science agency currently facing severe staffing and funding cuts. The country’s sixth National Climate Assessment, which provides essential data for state and regional reports like this one, was shelved this spring when scientists were told to stop their work. 
With or without federal support, Vermont will begin its third Climate Action Plan in 2028, with a new publication planned for July 1, 2029. 
It recently became more difficult to understand what  the regional Northeast climate will be like at that time: The fifth National Climate Assessment, which was published in 2023, is no longer available on the federal website.

Greg Gianforte and U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Shultz on Monday formalized a shared forest management agreement the governor said was the first of its kind between the state and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
Calling it a “a model for collaborative landscape scale partnerships,” Schultz said the agreement establishes a new framework to “dramatically increase the pace and scale” of forest restoration, wildlife risk reduction and sustainable timber production across Montana’s national forests and adjacent land.
“Our forests are truly key to our Montana way of life, but this key part of our way of life is at risk. Over 60% of forested acres in our state are classified as being at high or very high risk of wildfire and insect infestations or both,” Gianforte said in remarks with Schultz near Helena that were posted online. “These risks threaten the health of our forests. They threaten our rural communities and our water supplies. It’s important that we work collaboratively to address these risks and make our forests healthy again.”
The new 20-year agreement with the Forest Service is the first of its kind in the nation, Gianforte said, and will implement a shared forest management vision across more than 200,000 acres of forested land in northwest Montana. 
According to the governor’s office, the new Shared Stewardship Agreement will leverage the EXPLORE Act and Good Neighbor Authority to streamline projects and reduce regulatory delays. Both the state and Forest Service said they’ll jointly select large-scale management projects. 
The EXPLORE Act is a bipartisan outdoor recreation package of legislation that passed Congress late last year and included specific provisions championed by Montana Sen. Steve Daines and Rep. Ryan Zinke.
For more than a decade, the Good Neighbor Authority, authorized under the 2014 Farm Bill, has allowed the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation to partner with federal agencies to manage and restore federal lands using state procedures, personnel and contracts. Given that 70% of Montana’s forested land is federally owned, the program has given Montana, and similar states in the West, more leeway in management decisions. 
Amanda Kaster, director of the DNRC, said that since the good neighbor agreement launched, the state has sold more than 100 million board feet of timber while helping safeguard Montana’s communities from wildfire threats. 
“Importantly, the revenue that is generated is reinvested into forest restoration, further reducing wildfire risk near our homes and our municipal watersheds,” Kaster said. “Over the next five years, we’re going to work on identifying and launching five to 10 site specific projects, to not only expand our good neighbor authority work into recreation infrastructure, but also strengthen wildfire resilience and community preparedness.”

Kaster said the first project is slated to begin this year, and the DNRC will be launching a public online dashboard that will track acres treated, board feet harvested and community safety improvements made through the new partnership. 
In a statement, Secretary of Agriculture Brook Rollins said the agreement is “exactly the kind of forward-leaning, state-driven leadership that President Trump and USDA have championed since day one. By cutting burdensome, unnecessary red tape and empowering Montana to lead, we’re proving that through real partnership, conservation and economic growth can go hand-in-hand.”
The shared stewardship agreement states that Montana’s forests are increasingly threatened by more frequent and severe wildfires, widespread insect and disease outbreaks and a “historic lack of active management” requiring a “new, integrated approach.”
By working together, the agencies aim to increase the pace and scale of restoration through coordinated planning and implementation; meet President Donald Trump’s goal of expanding domestic timber production through aggressive annual harvest targets; implement new and expanded categorical exclusions to streamline projects; continue to leverage state-federal partnerships through the Good Neighbor Authority; and increase the pace and scale of thinning and fuels reduction projects. 
The first project, expected to begin this year, is projected to cover a 200,000-acre swath of national forest land with a focus on marketable timber, according to the agreement. The agencies will sign a Good Neighbor Authority agreement for this first project by the end of the year. 
Following the start of that first project, the agencies will select two to four additional landscape-scale projects for feasibility assessments.  
In addition to the large-scale project, the agencies will also work on from five to 10 site-specific projects using streamlined permitting processes provided by the EXPLORE Act, with the first one initiated by the end of 2024. 
The agreement also outlines a commitment to an “annual sustainable volume” of timber harvest as much as 100 million board feet. 
“While our state has a tradition of partnership with the Forest Service, the state of Montana’s forest demands stronger action and closer cooperation,” Gianforte said. “… Together, we can actively manage our forests, reduce fire risk, support local jobs, improve habitat and expand recreational opportunities. And yes, we can make forests healthy again.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-07-02 18:09:26.887986
,Mississippi Today,2025-07-02 21:02:39+00:00,Mississippi Today,Federal agency restores family-planning money to a Mississippi group,Sophia Paffenroth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/02/family-planning-money-restored/,"A federal agency has restored family-planning money to a nonprofit group in Mississippi, three months after suspending the money during a probe into diversity, equity and inclusion practices.","The nonprofit group that administers federal family planning money in Mississippi had its funding restored Wednesday, one month after it was forced to lay off half its staff and three months after its funding was withheld by the federal government.
Title X, a federal program that has been providing money for family planning services to states for over 50 years, flows through Converge to 91 clinics around the state. On March 31, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services told Converge it was withholding $4.5 million intended for Mississippi’s Title X program indefinitely during an investigation into the organization’s diversity, equity and inclusion practices. 
“We are relieved to have received our Notice of Award for Title X funding today, which enables us to return to the essential work of supporting our clinical network, maintaining operations, and meeting the needs of our communities across Mississippi and Tennessee,” Jamie Bardwell, co-executive director of Converge, said in a statement. 
The nonprofit will be rehiring some of the 10 staff it laid off, but is not currently able to rehire all due to “continued instability of federal funds,” Audrey Sandusky, vice president of communications and marketing at Converge, told Mississippi Today. 
The team received a letter from HHS on June 25 that the investigation found Converge to be compliant with the law and that funding would be restored. 
“OASH (Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health) reminds you of your ongoing obligation to comply with all terms of the award, including by not engaging in any unlawful diversity, equity or inclusion-related discrimination in violation of such laws,” the letter read. 
That same day, Sen. Bradford Blackmon, D-Canton, wrote a letter urging Republican Gov. Tate Reeves to push HHS to restore Converge’s funding. Blackmon wrote that the money supported services delivered through federally qualified health centers, which he called “lifelines in both rural and urban areas of our state.”

“The stakes for our communities could not be higher,” Blackmon wrote. “In 2024 alone, over 16,800 Mississippians, the majority of whom are uninsured and living at or below the federal poverty level, relied on Title X-supported services provided by Converge’s network.”
A spokesperson for Reeves did not immediately respond to Mississippi Today’s questions Wednesday about whether the governor advocated for the return of federal funding to Converge.
Blackmon has been a supporter of reproductive health care. Last session, he introduced a protest bill called the “Contraception Begins at Erection Act,” which would have made it unlawful for men to discharge genetic material without the intent to fertilize an embryo. 
Converge leaders still do not know what prompted the HHS investigation, though the initial allegation referenced a 2020 statement the nonprofit made committing to diversity in health care during the wake of the George Floyd protests. 
The team is proceeding with caution, but eager to resume a range of services related to helping people get pregnant, preventing pregnancy through birth control like long-acting contraception, cancer screening, pregnancy testing and STI testing and treatment. 
“This marks a critical step forward for communities that have gone without essential family planning funding for three months and have worked tirelessly to provide care with limited resources,” Bardwell said. “We look forward to resuming services, reconnecting patients with trusted providers, and continuing the vital work of ensuring access to high-quality, compassionate care across the South.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/06163254/3X0A6460-scaled.jpg,,,2025-07-02 17:08:06.719942

The state has enacted seven anti-ESG measures, not including resolutions, since 2021. Connor Gibson, one of the report’s authors, said the ESG label is nebulous, but often takes aim at climate goals, social justice initiatives and culture war targets. 
Much of the legislation that has moved through statehouses in the U.S. is based on model bills propagated by right-leaning think tanks like the Heritage Foundation, he said. The bills often prohibit state entities from giving contracts to or investing in businesses proponents believe discriminate against firearm manufacturers or fossil fuel companies, for example.
 Pleiades head Frances Sawyer said in an interview that anti-ESG legislation prevents companies and fund managers from considering risk factors associated with a changing climate if they want to do business with state governments. 
“Climate economic shocks are here. Right-wing extremists, backed by the fossil fuel sector, have been working nonstop to undermine responsible investment practices in several states across the country under the framework of ‘anti-ESG’ legislation,” Sawyer said in a press release. 
“These policies are costly for investors, pension holders, municipalities, and taxpayers, and it’s critically important that other states, investors, and companies hold the line amid rising climate costs and risks — and protect the right to respond to the climate crisis rationally.”
The climate advisory group’s 2025 Statehouse Report highlighted the anti-ESG trends in legislatures across the country. Arkansas was one of the most effective states in passing such laws, said Gibson. While some states, like Missouri and Arizona, have proposed dozens of anti-ESG bills only to pass one or none, most of the legislation that’s gone before Arkansas lawmakers ended up becoming law.
In 2025, “most of the 106 anti-ESG bills introduced in statehouses failed to advance, and only 9 have been signed by governors,” the report said. Two of those nine bills were passed in Arkansas. Two more bills are awaiting a governor’s signature in other states.
The 2025 numbers are down from 2023, which saw 165 bills introduced nationwide with 22 ultimately passing. Pleiades Strategy first began tracking anti-ESG bills in 2023.  
The targets of these bills are often the large capital funds managed by state governments, such as pension funds, and state contracting, Sawyer and Gibson said. The language often prevents state agencies or pension funds from contracting or investing with any company that boycotts fossil fuel companies, firearms companies or other industries. In the bills Arkansas has passed, there are exceptions for certain situations.
Sawyer said such bills can increase costs for governments by limiting the pool of businesses it can do business with.
Act 411 of 2023 was one such anti-ESG bill that made it into law in Arkansas, sponsored by Rep. Jeff Wardlaw, R-Hermitage, who said in a House State Agencies and Governmental Affairs Committee meeting in February 2023 that it was designed “to make sure that we’re following our beliefs in the state and making sure that nobody’s discriminating against the industries that are important to Arkansas.” 
The law requires state investment funds to divest from firms that “discriminate” against certain industries, such as energy companies and firearm businesses, which are placed on a blacklist. Firms currently on the Arkansas blacklist are Goldman Sachs, TD Bank, Credit Suisse and others.
However, Arkansas became one of the only states to roll back a small part of its anti-ESG legislation in 2025 when it passed Act 252 of 2025. The new law broadened a clause in Act 411 to allow any public entity subject to the law to avoid divesting from blacklisted firms if the divestment would result in a negative financial impact.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/money-1024x678.jpeg,,,2025-07-02 17:08:06.719942

John Hickenlooper, a Colorado Democrat, speaks at a press conference on protecting public lands alongside   U.S. House Assistant Minority Leader Joe Neguse, a Lafayette Democrat, May 28, 2025, at the Lake Estes Marina. (Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Democrats railed against the Republican-led spending cut and tax break package on Wednesday morning as the U.S. House of Representatives inches toward a vote on its final passage.
The bill, which has a Friday deadline imposed by President Donald Trump, would make permanent 2017 tax cuts and slash over $1 trillion in federal funding over a decade for safety net programs like Medicaid and nutrition assistance programs. It would fulfill a bulk of Trump’s domestic policy agenda, including boosting spending for defense and border security.
But Democrats say it is a transfer of wealth from struggling Americans to the wealthy.
“It really is a travesty of any kind of common sense. We’re the wealthiest country on Earth, and we spent the last several days arguing with Republicans over whether 17 million Americans deserve to have health care. I thought we’d gotten past that,” Sen. John Hickenlooper told reporters during a Wednesday morning press conference.
Colorado’s four Democratic representatives voted against the bill when it initially went through the House in May, and the state’s four GOP House members voted in favor of it. On Tuesday, Colorado’s Democratic U.S. senators voted against it.
The House is expected to consider the Senate’s version of the bill sometime on Wednesday.
“This will clearly exacerbate and turbo charge a poverty crisis in our country by virtue of the cruel cuts that have been included in the bill that Republicans are attempting to shove through here over the course of the next several hours,” said Rep. Joe Neguse, a Boulder Democrat. “We’re going to use every procedural tool that we can to try to stop and block this bill from proceeding.”
The Medicaid provisions in the bill, which include new work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks, could put health coverage at risk for nearly 200,000 Coloradans, Hickenlooper said. That estimate ranges from about 150,000 to 250,000. A recent analysis from the state’s Office of State Planning and Budget predicts a loss of $1 billion in health care funding due to the bill, and state budget writers warn that Colorado could not absorb the loss.

Hickenlooper and others said they specifically want to see an exemption in the bill for rural health care centers, clinics and hospitals. He noted a handful of Colorado hospitals that are already labeled as high risk for closure.
“It’s going to take a trillion dollars out of the health care system,” said Rep. Jason Crow, a Democrat who represents Colorado’s 6th Congressional District. “Even if folks are saying ‘I’m not on Medicaid. Why does this impact me? I have the Cadillac program through my employer. What difference will this make?’ You can’t take a trillion dollars out of the American health care system and not have hospital closures, clinic closures, doctors and nurses leaving the system.”
There is some money set aside in the bill to partially compensate rural hospitals.
Mitzi Moran, the CEO of Sunrise Community Health in Greeley, said that the bill could put 11,000, or about one-quarter, of their patients at risk of losing coverage.
Joe Theine, the CEO of Southwest Health System in Cortez, said that about 25% of their total cash comes from Medicaid, including $9 million through provider taxes that enable Colorado to claim more federal money. Southwest Health System is one of the only critical-access hospitals in the region and delivers primary care to nearly 9,000 people in those counties.
Democratic leaders also denounced the bill’s cuts to nutrition programs and reduction in clean energy infrastructure investments.
“This was a major step toward addressing climate change, and now it’s like running into a brick wall,” Hickenlooper said.
On Tuesday, Democratic leaders in the state Legislature wrote to Colorado’s four Republican members of Congress urging them to vote against the bill. In addition to highlighting the risk to Medicaid and nutrition spending, they warned of the potential need to reduce funding for the state’s Department of Corrections, increase higher education tuition, limit the senior and veteran homestead exemption for property taxes, and cut state tax credits for families.
“While we understand that you do not need to balance the federal budget — as demonstrated by your votes for this bill that will increase the deficit by trillions of dollars — we do balance our budgets in Colorado,” House Speaker Julie McCluskie, Majority Leader Monica Duran, Rep. Emily Sirota and Rep. Shannon Bird wrote.
“We have had to make hard choices in the last year to protect core services for hardworking families, and we will have to make many more in the year ahead. However, the choices this bill will force us to make are far worse and will be devastating for our state. Vote no.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird announced Wednesday she will not run for governor in 2026 — an unexpected decision for some Iowans who thought she would be a top Republican contender in the race to fill Gov. Kim Reynolds’ seat.
Shortly after Reynolds announced she would not seek reelection following her current term, Bird released a statement saying she and her husband would “pray and consider what this decision means for our future.”
Bird was considered a high-profile potential pick for the GOP gubernatorial nominee, having strong ties to President Donald Trump from his time in the state during the Iowa caucuses. Trump told Iowans in January 2024 that Bird will “be your governor someday, I predict.” She posted a video on X in May, featuring this comment, alongside other clips of Trump praising the Iowa AG, with the caption “Someday…”
But on Wednesday, Bird officially ruled out a bid for governor in the 2026 election, instead saying she plans to run for reelection as attorney general.
“I am absolutely determined to do justice and hold this office to prevent it from being occupied by a radical, progressive Democrat who would undo all we’ve accomplished,” Bird said in a statement. “… Between now and next November, I will run a fierce reelection campaign, and I will will.”
During her time since taking office after the 2022 election when she defeated longtime former Attorney General Tom Miller, a Democrat, Bird said her office has accomplished “big victories” on issues like supporting crime victims and law enforcement and defending constitutional rights.
As she plans to run again as AG, she thanked people who encouraged her to run for governor, and said she plans to work to elect Republicans in 2026.
“I will also enthusiastically support our Republican nominee for Governor and the entire Republican ticket here in Iowa — our party will be unified,” Bird said. “I remain grateful for the opportunity to serve Iowans as their Attorney General, and I look forward to earning their support again.”
Bird is not the only Republican potential gubernatorial candidate who has tapped out of the race. Iowa House Speaker Pat Grassley announced in late June he will run again for the Iowa House after earlier indicating he was not ruling out a gubernatorial bid. Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig also said in May he will not run for governor but instead run again as agriculture secretary.
There are still several Republicans who are moving forward with gubernatorial runs. Iowa Rep. Eddie Andrews, R-Johnston, and former state Rep. Brad Sherman have launched campaigns for governor, while U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra and state Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, have launched “exploratory” committees for a gubernatorial run.
Bousselot released a statement Wednesday applauding Bird’s work in the AG’s office and saying he supported her decision to run again for the position. He also said Iowa Republicans need a full ticket in 2026 that will “fight aggressively for an Iowa First Agenda that complements President Trump’s America First Agenda.”
“I have been proud to fight for that agenda in the Legislature – lower taxes, bringing manufacturing jobs back to Iowa, and standing firm against extremists who want to raise our taxes so the government can spend more, allow men in girls sports, and who don’t support border policies that keep our communities safe,” Bousselot said. “I have been sharing my perspective with voters around the state, listening to feedback from Iowans, and am laying the groundwork for a potential campaign for Governor next year.”
Democrats including Iowa Auditor Rob Sand and former political operative Julie Stauch have also launched 2026 campaigns for governor.
There is also a Democrat who has announced plans to run for attorney general in 2026. Nate Willems, a lawyer and former state representative, launched his campaign for attorney general in May. Willems released a statement Wednesday saying Iowans are ready to remove Bird from the AG’s office in the upcoming election.
“Iowans are tired of watching Brenna Bird dismantle the integrity of this office and turn it into a mouthpiece for an extreme political agenda,” Willems said in a statement. “Instead of protecting Iowans she has come after our most vulnerable neighbors, including children with disabilities, senior citizens, and sexual assault survivors, all to build her own national profile. It’s time to turn the page and get the attorney general’s office focused on helping the people of Iowa.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/birdabortion1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-02 17:08:06.719942

On Tuesday, the Natural Resources Defense Council, who secured a settlement with the city and the state in 2017 to replace all of Flint’s lead lines, acknowledged that more than eight years later, the state had replaced nearly 11,000 pipes and restored more than 28,000 properties. 
In 2014, the city switched its water supply from water piped in from Detroit to the Flint River, a decision made by emergency managers appointed by then-Gov. Rick Snyder as a cost-saving move. Due to inadequate treatment of the water, corroding pipes leached lead into thousands of homes as residents raised concerns about discolored, foul-smelling and tasting water.
Bonsitu Kitaba, the interim legal director of the ACLU of Michigan, who worked with the city council to secure the settlement, credited the citizens of Flint for Tuesday’s milestone, emphasizing the efforts residents made to ensure the city and the state fulfilled their obligations.
“Residents of Flint deserve – and have always deserved – access to clean, safe drinking water and property repairs, full stop. While we know that this is not a resolution for all the harms caused to the people of Flint from the water crisis, we celebrate this long-awaited win alongside you. We are committed to our partnership and the work ahead,” Kitaba said. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
While the initial deadline for the settlement was set for 2020, Flint residents repeatedly found themselves back in court, with federal judge David M. Lawson in 2024 declaring Flint in contempt of a previous court order requiring the city to hit certain milestones in replacing lead pipes. 
However, the state’s final progress report does not mark the end of the city’s obligations, as several hundreds of pipes remain in vacant homes and some residents have declined to have their pipes tested or replaced. 
During a celebration in May marking the completion of the program, Kitaba noted that the city is still required to replace all lead lines in the coming years. Flint has also committed to replacing any remaining lead lines this year, with Kitaba encouraging residents with lead lines to call 810-410-1133, or email GetTheLeadOut@cityofflint.com.
The council stressed there is no safe level of lead exposure. 
Pastor Allen Overton of Concerned Pastors for Social Action cheered his fellow community members, crediting their work to hold elected leaders accountable as the reason behind Tuesday’s milestone.
“Thanks to the persistence of the people of Flint and our partners, we are finally at the end of the lead pipe replacement project. While this milestone is not all the justice our community deserves, it is a huge achievement,” Overton said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/lead-pipes-enviromental-justice.jpeg,,,2025-07-02 17:08:06.719942

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr picked South Dakota as the place to unveil what he called a “Build America Agenda,” aimed at cutting regulations and revitalizing the telecommunications industry.
Carr delivered a speech Wednesday at the wireless infrastructure construction company VIKOR, surrounded by construction workers, American flags and Toby Keith country music playing from loudspeakers.
Before the event, Carr climbed a 200-foot KELO-TV tower. At the event, he wore and handed out red hats emblazoned with the slogan “Make Towers Great Again,” similar to hats at President Donald Trump’s political rallies that say “Make America Great Again.” 
Inflation drives up cost of broadband internet projects

South Dakota, Carr said, symbolizes what’s possible when “we get our regulatory policies right.”
“I imagine that the ‘other S.F.’ — San Francisco — might seem like a more natural pick to most when outlining a tech or telecom agenda,” Carr said. “But I can’t think of a more appropriate place for me to announce the agenda that will guide much of the FCC’s upcoming work than right here in the real S.F.”
Carr was originally nominated to the FCC by Trump in 2017, and then renominated by President Joe Biden in 2023 and confirmed by the U.S. Senate both times. This year, Trump picked Carr to serve as FCC chairman.
 Prior to Trump’s election win last year, Carr authored a chapter about the FCC in the controversial Project 2025 report, a policy roadmap for a second Trump term published by The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.
On Wednesday, Carr praised Trump’s second-term priorities and Republican leadership in South Dakota, including Republican U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune. Carr previously joined Thune to visit a broadband internet construction site in Colton in June 2023, spotlighting the value of federal investments in internet infrastructure.



Speech highlights
FCC Chairman Brendan Carr announced several goals of his Build America Agenda, including:

Accelerating the shift from aging copper lines to high-speed internet.
Encouraging greater collaboration and more concrete timelines to fix “slow, cumbersome” delays when telecom crews are stringing new fiber-optic lines across utility poles.
Using legal powers to override local siting delays and permit faster infrastructure deployment.
Revisiting how the FCC complies with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), in light of recent Supreme Court rulings relaxing requirements for environmental review.
Selling off unused airwaves that companies can use to build new wireless networks. 
Eliminating rules slowing the space satellite industry, to “inject rocket fuel into our licensing process by standardizing our reviews through more objective metrics.”
Eliminating decades-old rules governing outdated technologies like telegraphs and phone booths.
Implementing workforce reforms aimed at “making it harder for foreign, fly-by-night crews to sweep in and undercut the safety and security of our networks.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The Rhode Island Airport Corporation (RIAC) is asking a state court to block an attempt by a fired firefighter who leads the union representing workers at T.F. Green International Airport to get his job back — a move that appeared to catch him by surprise.
Airport officials filed a lawsuit against Steven Parent on Wednesday in Providence County Superior Court, citing allegations he trespassed into the T.F. Green fire station on Nov. 1, 2024, four days after being fired.
Parent, who worked at T.F. Green for more than a decade, has been president of Local 2873 of RI Council 94 for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) since 2019. The union represents airport police officers, firefighters, airfield maintenance, building maintenance, operations and clerical staff.
An arbitration hearing on an unfair labor practice Parent filed against RIAC is scheduled for some time in August after being delayed twice. He is seeking reinstatement as a fire lieutenant after being fired on Oct. 28 after airport officials claimed he discouraged people from applying for jobs at the Warwick airport while benefiting from overtime pay caused by ongoing vacancies. Upon his termination, airport officials immediately revoked Parent’s security credentials and informed him he was no longer permitted in secure areas of the airport.
The legal action was news to Parent when reached for comment by phone Wednesday morning. He said he had yet to be served any papers.
“They’re suing me?” he said. “I was not aware of any of this — I was just there Monday.”
RIAC claims Parent never returned his deactivated badge as required under the federal government’s Airport Security Program.
Four days after his firing, Parent entered the airport’s fire station — which RIAC claims is a secured area — without an escort. 
“Mr. Parent’s unauthorized access caused alarm among airport employees,” the lawsuit claims.
The fire station is located opposite the airfield, and has a gated entrance along Cedar Swamp Road in Warwick near Winslow Park.
According to airport officials, Parent used an intercom to ask the on-duty firefighter — one of his former subordinates to open the gate remotely for him, the lawsuit states. Parent was reportedly confronted by the airport’s deputy fire chief and told to leave, but Parent allegedly flipped him off.
Parent denied his interaction was uncivil and said he had called the station ahead of his arrival.
“I had no issue with the deputy chief — I wasn’t being disciplined for anything at the fire station,” Parent said.
Deputy Fire Chief Justin Vail deferred comment to RIAC.

Airport officials said Parent took work material without authorization following his firing. Parent said he retrieved a copy of the union’s contract. At the time union officials and RIAC were in the midst of negotiating a new contract for airport workers, which was eventually ratified in March 2025.
“RIAC’s filing speaks for itself,” Duc Nguyen, the airport’s senior vice president of operations,  said in a statement. “This action is to confirm RIAC’s authority to determine eligibility for security credentials consistent with federal requirements and its duty to ensure the safety and security of the airport and traveling public.”
Council 94 President Michael McDonald said he too was caught by surprise by the filing, but that legal action was not totally unexpected. He called the lawsuit a last resort by airport officials to avoid arbitration with Parent over an unfair labor practice, which is scheduled to happen some time in August.
“They’re trying to avoid answering for what they’ve done,” McDonald said in an interview. 
Parent said arbitration was first scheduled for February, but was delayed to June and is now pushed to August.










They’re suing me? I was not aware of any of this — I was just there Monday.


– Steven Parent, fired airport fire lieutenant and president of Local 2873 of RI Council 94 for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees


But a statement issued by RIAC Wednesday claims the arbitration process is limited to addressing whether Parent was wrongfully terminated, not to resolve any legal nuances. The lawsuit argues that even if Parent were reinstated, his alleged security breach would prevent him from regaining clearance, making him ineligible to serve at the fire station.
If the court blocks Parent’s reinstatement, RIAC argues that airport officials can move forward with filling his vacant lieutenant position. The position is not posted on RIAC’s job portal. But Parent said two candidates have already applied and recently took written tests for the role — tests he observed.
“I pretty much encouraged everyone there to apply,” he said.
RIAC is asking the court to uphold officials’ decision to revoke Parent’s credentials.
McDonald said the union will continue to fight for Parent as the legal process plays out.
“We’ll stop at nothing to defend Steve, he’s our local president — as we would for any member of Rhode Island Council 94 who’s been treated in this manner,” McDonald said. “We are confident that once this all settles, we will prevail.”

(Photo by Illustration Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)New Mexico health officials confirmed an additional eight cases of measles in the Luna County Detention Center Wednesday, bringing the total to 13 — 12 people in the jail and one staff member.
Last week, five detainees tested positive for measles, but an additional eight people displayed symptoms, New Mexico Department of Health Chief Epidemiologist Dr. Chad Smelser told Source NM. Two more cases are pending.
The latest case was reported in Luna County on June 26, 2025, and Smelser said lags may occur between determining cases and publicly confirming them.
“We focus on disease control first, trying to prevent the spread of the infection, so we might be a little slower in our communication,” he said.
NMDOH offered vaccinations for 400 detainees and nearly 100 staff, and provided “more than 100 vaccines” in the last week, Smelser said, noting jail officials’ “incredible cooperation” in working to prevent further spread.
Measles, one of the most contagious airborne viruses, spreads through contact with droplets from an infected person’ coughs and sneezes. The virus can survive in the air for hours, and can spread days before and after symptoms appear. Additionally, patients can take one to three weeks to develop symptoms such as headache, fever, cough, red eyes and the spotty red rash.
All 12 people exposed to measles were placed in a designated pod and quarantined until several days after symptoms faded, according to Pablo Montoya, the director of public safety at the detention center. Currently, two people remain quarantined.
Staff were given masks, gloves and gowns to prevent spread, Montoya said. The facility does not staff to be vaccinated, he said.
In total, New Mexico has recorded 94 cases of measles in eight counties since the mid-February outbreak in Gaines County, Texas, first crossed the state line, with cases in Lea, San Juan, Curry, Eddy, Doña Ana, Chaves and Sandoval counties.
Health officials say two doses of the measles vaccine prevents spread, or lessens the severity of an infection. The state is offering dozens of clinics across the state, which can be found on the measles webpage.

The case involves Katie Wood, a math teacher in Hillsborough County who is transgender. She sued the state after a 2023 law passed saying that employees of public schools may not identify to their students with pronouns not consistent with their birth sex, “an immutable biological trait.”
A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled against Wood. The majority considered whether her speech or pronoun use while interacting with students inside the classroom is private speech or within the scope of employment.
“Given the statute’s relatively limited sweep and, even more so, the narrowness of Wood’s challenge, this is, we think, a straightforward case,” Judge Kevin Newsom wrote in a 14-page opinion. “When a public-school teacher addresses her students within the four walls of a classroom — whether orally or in writing — she is unquestionably acting ‘pursuant to [her] official duties.'”
Wood argued the law violated her First Amendment rights and that use of he/him pronouns would induce emotional harm, risk physical harm, and disrupt the classroom, while avoiding titles and pronouns would be “impractical, disruptive, and stigmatizing.”
District Judge Mark Walker in Tallahassee, appointed by former President Barack Obama, had ruled at trial that it was “substantially likely” the law violated Wood’s speech rights and issued a preliminary injunction.

The appeal court vacated that injunction. 
The majority found that Wood was acting as teacher, rather than as a private citizen, when writing her pronouns on the whiteboard and syllabi, wearing a pin with her pronouns, and providing her pronouns verbally. 
“We hold that the district court misapplied the law, and thus abused its discretion, in preliminarily enjoining [the law’s] enforcement against Wood. We therefore vacate the district court’s order and remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion,” Newsom wrote. 
The 2023 law was among bills expanding the Parental Rights in Education Act, also known as “Don’t Say Gay,” from the year before. The bills aim to restrict mention of sexual orientation and gender identity in public schools.
“And because Wood can’t show a likelihood of success on her First Amendment claim, we needn’t address any of the remaining preliminary-injunction factors,” Newsom wrote.

Dissent
In a dissenting opinion, Judge Adalberto Jordan wrote that pronouns and personal titles for a teacher are, “like her name, significant markers of individual identity.”
“They exist outside of, and do not depend on, the school or the government for their existence. Stated differently, Ms. Wood would still have her own preferred personal title and pronouns, and would still use them to identify herself to others, even if she was not a public school teacher,” Jordan wrote. 
It’s not clear that the First Amendment claim brought by Woods should fail, Jordan said. 
“We should be wary of holding that everything that happens in a classroom constitutes government speech outside the ambit of the First Amendment,” Jordan wrote. “Those who wield the power of the government today and are on one side of the gender and culture wars will be the ones at risk of being compelled to speak against their beliefs, or silenced, when their opponents are in charge. Today’s opinion will then not look as attractive.”
Jordan doubted, as did the trial court, that high school students “would view her preferred personal title and pronouns as Florida’s endorsement of her being transgender.”
Jordan was appointed by Obama, and Newsom was appointed by President Donald Trump during his first term, as was Judge Andrew Brasher, who sided with Newsom.

The department announced the settlement with Villa Financial Services LLC and Villa Olympia Investment LLC on Wednesday. The facilities in question include Villa’s Ambassador, Father Murray, Imperial, Regency, St. Joseph’s and Westland locations.
Villa has denied the allegations but agreed to the settlement announced Wednesday.
“Chronic neglect of nursing home residents is absolutely unacceptable, yet sadly all too common,” Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a statement.  “American taxpayers contribute billions every year to ensure quality care for our most vulnerable. When that care is not provided, my office will continue to work alongside our federal partners to hold those responsible accountable.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Villa will pay $3.41 million to the U.S. government as part of the settlement and $1.08 million to the state of Michigan, the department said.
The department’s Health Care Fraud Division handled the case, which is a federally certified Medicaid Fraud Control Unit for the state, which received 75% of its funding from a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services grant of $5.7 million in 2025. The investigation also included involvement from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan.
A whistleblower complaint from Villa employees jumpstarted the inquiry, as employees claimed they personally witnessed the mistreatment of residents. It was alleged that the nursing homes failed to sufficiently staff the facilities, prevent and treat infections, prevent falls, and failed to provide toileting needs that resulted in residents sitting in or laying in soiled beds or clothes for long periods of time.
The facilities also failed to prevent pressure ulcers, also known as bed sores.
Villa must also enter into a five-year quality-of-care Corporate Integrity Agreement with the U.S. DHHS and its Office of Inspector General. The agreement requires the companies to retain an independent quality monitor to review their provision of care and their ability to detect and respond to patient care issues.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-1358903157-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-02 17:08:06.719942

ARTICLE SUMMARY:

Illinois closed fiscal year 2025 with record $54 billion in revenue.
While that marked a surplus from the enacted budget, the extra revenue was anticipated when lawmakers approved the current-year budget in May.
It doesn’t give lawmakers any extra breathing room for an expected volatile fiscal year 2026.



Despite uncertainty over the economy and federal funding during the second half of fiscal year 2025, the year closed on June 30 with the state setting a new record for annual revenue.

Numbers compiled by the independent Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability show FY25 concluded with $54 billion in revenue, the most the state has ever received in a fiscal year. The state also brought in $717 million more in revenue than lawmakers originally budgeted for when they passed a $53.3 billion budget in May 2024.

All told, the final revenue numbers track closely with projections made in May by both COGFA and the Governor’s Office of Management and Budget that formed the basis of the FY26 budget. In other words, June revenues produced no surprises, and lawmakers aren’t sitting on any substantial surplus as the new fiscal year begins.

The record revenues also don’t alleviate any uncertainty for the current or future fiscal years as Congress considers drastic reductions to the social safety net and aid to states.

Causes of revenue growth

Strong personal income tax growth drove the revenue increase in FY25, largely thanks to a “true up” conducted by the Department of Revenue that reallocated business related income tax revenue into the personal income tax category. Personal income tax revenue was 10% higher than in FY24, but corporate income taxes declined by 9.5%.

Some other revenue sources also saw minimal growth. Sales tax revenue grew by less than 1%, though COGFA noted it increased by nearly 3% in the second half of FY25 after a weak start last summer as gas prices dropped and people cut back on large purchases amid growing economic uncertainty.

Federal income was also down 4.6% in FY25, even when excluding one-time pandemic relief funds the state received in FY24. But in a bright spot for the state, COGFA found that state revenue sources grew more than anticipated to offset the $178 million decline in federal revenue.

Despite solid revenue growth this year, questions remain about how well it will perform in FY26.

“Whether this record will be surpassed in FY 2026 remains to be seen, though the FY 2026 enacted budget assumes revenues of $55.297 billion – nearly $1.3 billion above the FY 2025 final total,” COGFA Revenue Manger Eric Noggle wrote.

Bills paid and money left over

The state also ended the fiscal year with $1.9 billion of cash in the General Revenue Fund after all bills were paid, according to the Comptroller Susana Mendoza’s office.

“We work hard each year to pay bills on time, build up the state’s emergency reserves and stress fiscal discipline, even in these uncertain times,” Mendoza said in a statement. “My office will strive for continued improvement in state finances and credit ratings in the new budget year.”

Mendoza's office also put $256 million into the “rainy day” fund, growing it to a balance of $2.5 billion. The fund is expected to grow at a slower rate in FY26, however, as lawmakers suspended a monthly transfer that will free up $45 million.

With an extra cash balance to start the new fiscal year, Mendoza said she plans to pre-pay monthly pension payments for FY26. Lawmakers gave the comptroller authority last year to make pension payments earlier in the year rather than on a monthly basis when extra money is available.

“This will enable the systems to plan accordingly and keep additional dollars in their investment portfolios into the new budget year,” Mendoza said.

An uncertain future

With good new concluding FY25, attention now turns to FY26, which began Tuesday, and the vast uncertainty the state faces from budget talks in Congress and the economic fallout of decisions by the Trump administration.

Gov. JB Pritzker signed a $55.1 billion spending plan in mid-June that relies on $55.3 billion in revenue. It’s the largest budget in state history despite minimal discretionary spending growth, and it relies on $1.2 billion of tax increases or one-time revenues.

But state lawmakers have left the door open to the possibility that changes Congress makes to federal funding that requires states to cover greater portions of government programs and ceases funding in certain areas will require lawmakers to change the budget.

“The ability of the state to try to step in and try to mitigate the damage is somewhat limited, although we have the ability to do certain things and may have to in special session or we may have to in veto session,” Pritzker told reporters in Peoria on Tuesday. “It’s a little hard to tell yet. Some of the provisions of this terrible bill in Washington, D.C. don’t go into effect until next year and so we’ll have to evaluate what changes to make in order to deal with it.”

Work requirements for health care and food assistance programs, cuts to Medicaid reimbursements and the elimination of clean energy tax credits could all require the state to take on more costs.

Free.,Trump dealt loss as judge rejects executive order claiming 'invasion' at the border,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-dealt-loss-judge-rejects-executive-order-claiming-invasion-border,,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge Wednesday ruled as unlawful an executive order by President Donald Trump that barred asylum by claiming an “invasion” at the southern border and the need to protect states.It’s the first major blow to the Trump administration in its attempt to end the ability for asylum seekers to make asylum claims.“The President cannot adopt an alternative immigration system, which supplants the statutes that Congress has enacted,” District of Columbia U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss wrote in his opinion.“Here, nothing in the (Immigration and Nationality Act) or the Constitution grants the President or his delegees the sweeping authority asserted in the Proclamation and implementing guidance,” continued Moss, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama.The order from Moss also prevents the U.S. Department of Homeland Security from enforcing the executive order.He also agreed to certify a class for potential asylum-seekers, which comes after last week's Supreme Court ruling that curtailed nationwide injunctions from lower courts. Certifying a class was suggested by the court to give judges an avenue to make an order broader.Moss put his order on hold for 14 days, to give the Trump administration time to appeal his ruling. If the order is upheld by an appeals court and the Supreme Court, it would require the Trump administration to begin processing asylum applicants for migrants.“(The executive order) is unlawful insofar as it purports to suspend or to restrict access to asylum, withholding of removal, or the existing regulatory processes for obtaining (Convention Against Torture) protection,” Moss wrote in his order.Inauguration DayThe asylum order was one of several immigration-related executive orders that Trump signed on the Inauguration Day of his second term. The order proclaimed that the “current situation at the southern border qualifies as an invasion” and barred asylum-seekers from being able to claim asylum.Trump characterized asylum-seekers seeking entry at the U.S.-Mexico border as an “invasion” and said that the states need “protection,” so the White House would suspend physical entry until the president deemed the “invasion” over.Encounters at the southern border have been the lowest in several years.The section Trump cited in his proclamation, section 212(f), is part of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Under that section, the president has the authority to “suspend the entry” of people who are not U.S. citizens under certain circumstances.Complaint filed in FebruaryThe suit from the American Civil Liberties Union and other legal organizations, on behalf of Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, or RAICES, and other immigration legal service providers, argued the executive order unlawfully denies asylum and other humanitarian protections that are ""expressly granted by Congress.""“It is returning asylum seekers—not just single adults, but families too—to countries where they face persecution or torture, without allowing them to invoke the protections Congress has provided,” according to the initial complaint filed in February. “Indeed, the Proclamation does not even exempt unaccompanied children, despite the specific protections such children receive by statute.”RAICES, Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and the Florence Immigrant And Refugee Rights Project, which provide legal services to immigrants, argued that the proclamation harms the legal aid work of the individual plaintiffs.Those individual plaintiffs in the suit include people who allege they fled persecution in Afghanistan, Ecuador, Cuba, Egypt, Brazil, Turkey and Peru. Some plaintiffs have either been removed to their home country, or to a third country such as Panama, according to the filing.",,,,2025-07-02 17:08:06.719942

(Karen Kasmauski/Getty Images)The federal government’s program that gives payments to people sickened by nuclear weapons testing is one step closer to being reauthorized and expanded.
On Tuesday, U.S. Senate Republicans passed their massive tax and spending package, nicknamed the “big, beautiful bill” — among its many provisions is an expansion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, or RECA, which expired more than a year ago.
If the bill clears the final vote needed from the House, downwinders in all of Idaho will now receive compensation for their medical bills, marking a significant change to the program that advocates say was too narrow to begin with.
Here are the RECA highlights, found in the final pages of the Senate’s 887-page bill:

Downwinders in all of Utah, New Mexico and Idaho would now be eligible for payments. Coverage would also be widened in Arizona to include all of Coconino, Yavapai, Navajo, Apache, Gila, and Mohave counties. Residents who lived in certain parts of Missouri, Tennessee, Alaska and Kentucky who were sickened due to the Manhattan Project would also receive coverage.
The program’s new expiration date would be Dec. 31, 2028.
In some cases, people who lived in affected areas for just one year would be eligible for compensation — the program previously required they live there at least two years.
The compensation amount — originally $50,000 to $75,000 — would be increased to $100,000 in most cases.
Uranium miners and workers based in Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Wyoming, South Dakota, Washington, Utah, Idaho, North Dakota, Oregon and Texas would be covered. The timeframe of eligibility would also be extended to 1990.

 U.S. senators put support behind RECA reauthorization

RECA expired in June 2024 after Congress failed to reauthorize it, and in the year since, downwinders who were just recently diagnosed with cancer or who didn’t know about the program were left without compensation.
“RECA is generational legislation for Missouri and will finally deliver justice for survivors in the St. Louis region,” said Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley, who sponsored the provision. “I call on the House to quickly pass this legislation and send it to President Trump’s desk.”
The program had been in place since 1990, but downwinders have long said it should be expanded. Despite studies suggesting the entire West was blanketed by dangerous levels of radiation during nuclear tests, downwinders in just 10 counties in Utah, as well as a handful of counties in Nevada and Arizona, were covered.

U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, said in a press release that he negotiated the inclusion of Idaho victims in the final language of the bill.
“Many Idahoans have died or suffered as a result of cancer related to fallout from 1950s to 1960s Cold War-era above-ground nuclear weapons testing with no recompense,” Crapo said in the release. “Idahoans have been unfairly left out of the RECA program for far too many years. The Senate’s passage of language to include Idaho in the program marks one step closer to ensuring affected Idahoans will finally start to receive the compensation they rightfully deserve. I urge the U.S. House of Representatives to preserve this provision.”
News that RECA was one step closer to revival was met with mixed reactions on Tuesday from Utah downwinder Mary Dickson. A longtime advocate for RECA expansion, Dickson said it was “bittersweet” — if the bill passes the House, she’ll finally be eligible for coverage, after being diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 1985.
But Dickson and other advocates hoped a RECA expansion would be broader, covering all of Nevada, Arizona, Montana, Guam and other places impacted by Cold War weapons testing.
“Obviously I’m happy to see more downwinders covered. I’m very happy to see that. But I’m also heartsick to see that so many others that we’ve been fighting with in this battle for so long are left out,” she said. “It feels a bit like a hollow victory to me.”
Last year, Hawley sponsored a bill that would expand the program to cover much of the West, and parts of the St. Louis area, where creek water was contaminated by radiation during nuclear weapons development. The bill passed the Senate but stalled in the House, mostly over spending concerns.
It’s not yet clear whether RECA has the support needed in the House to withstand the final vote. The New York Times estimates that the current proposed expansion will cost about $7.7 billion.

Despite studies suggesting the entire West was blanketed by dangerous levels of radiation during nuclear tests, downwinders in just 10 counties in Utah, as well as a handful of counties in Nevada and Arizona, were covered.

Last year, New Mexico Democratic U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján teamed up with Hawley to sponsor a bill that would expand the program to cover much of the West. The bill passed the Senate but stalled in the House, mostly over spending concerns.
In mid-June, when Hawley re-introduced the measure into the GOP budget bill, the delegation responded by noting, in part, that the measure has previously garnered bipartisan support.
U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, who represents the state’s 3rd Congressional District, also noted in a statement provided to Source that over the years of fighting for RECA, the state’s delegation and the advocates have “built a broad coalition grounded in justice and science, yet Republican leadership refused to pass our bill and the program lapsed last year. Since then, people have been dying while Republican leadership in the House drags its feet. However, even a broken clock is right twice a day. While the broader Billionaires Budget Bill is deeply harmful in many ways, we are glad some Republicans are finally recognizing the value of RECA. New Mexicans have waited long enough. They deserve the compensation and recognition they’ve earned through pain and sacrifice.”
It’s not yet clear whether RECA has the support needed in the House to withstand the final vote. The New York Times estimates that the current proposed expansion will cost about $7.7 billion.
Correction: A previous version reported uranium workers in South Dakota, North Dakota, Washington, Idaho, Oregon and Texas were not covered under RECA. While these states were not covered in the initial version of the bill, it was expanded in 2000 to included these states.

That’s more than triple the number enrolled last year, when just under half of the initial program’s 5,000 slots went unfilled even before classes started. And […]","The state Department of Education has reached the legal limit to students who can receive $7,500 to put toward private school tuition and other costs of switching schools. (File/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — South Carolina’s latest scholarship program for K-12 private tuition and other expenses reached its cap of 10,000 students for the year, according to the state Department of Education.
That’s more than triple the number enrolled last year, when just under half of the initial program’s 5,000 slots went unfilled even before classes started.
And of those 2,880 students accepted, as many as 1,000 were removed after payments went out for failing to meet eligibility requirements, according to estimates from the Education Oversight Committee.
But under the law signed in May, income eligibility expanded for the coming school year. Families’ qualifying income can reach up to 300% of the federal poverty level this school year, instead of 200%. For a family of four, for example, incomes max out at $96,450, up from $62,400.
That opened the door for a greater number of students to receive the $7,500 annual scholarships, doled out in four quarterly payments that start this month.
“This is an exciting milestone in South Carolina’s education freedom journey,” state Superintendent Ellen Weaver said in a statement. “This program puts hardworking families in the driver’s seat — empowering them to shape an education as unique as their child.”
K-12 education voucher bill headed to SC governor’s desk

The 10,000 students enrolled for 2025-26 include 1,691 students who participated in the program last year.
The department did not provide a breakdown of student demographics, such as age, race and geographic location, or the reasons applications were rejected.
So far, applications for 16,119 students were submitted; 2,819 of them were rejected, and 4,991 applications remain under review, said agency spokesman Jason Raven.
If they’re found eligible, those students will be put on a waitlist to either take over any spots that open up this year or be among the first to get dibs when the application window opens again next year — when eligibility expands again.
Under the law, up to 15,000 students qualify for 2026-27, when parents’ incomes don’t cap out until reaching 500% of the federal poverty line. That’s $161,000 for a family of four under the latest guidelines (which are adjusted annually).
If more than 15,000 students apply, legislators have the option of funding additional scholarships by putting more money in the state budget.
This year’s increase in students accepted has several possible explanations, Raven said.
For one, legislators did away with the deadline to apply, which was the primary reason the department rejected applications last year. Nearly 80% of the 5,027 applications rejected ahead of the 2024-2025 school year were because parents missed the deadline or failed to complete all the necessary paperwork, the department said at the time.
Palmetto Promise Institute, which spent years lobbying for the school choice program, also redoubled its efforts to help parents sign up, offering a webinar explaining the program as well as one-on-one support for parents with questions, said Felicity Ropp, who leads the conservative think tank’s information hub on school choice.
Another likely reason for the increase, Raven said, was a renewed spotlight on the program as the House and Senate debated and ultimately passed a law meant to get private schools back on the list of providers after the state Supreme Court’s ruling last September.
In a split decision, justices said K-12 private tuition payments violated the state constitution’s ban on taxpayer money directly benefiting private education, requiring private schools to be immediately removed from the list of providers eligible for scholarship money. GOP legislators designed the new law to get around that ban.
Another potential explanation for the increase is a new provision allowing families already using open enrollment programs at traditional public schools to participate, said Patrick Kelly with the Palmetto State Teachers Association. Students attending a school other than the one for which they are zoned, including a different public school, can use the money for various expenses including tutoring, textbooks and computers.

How many of the enrolled students can use their scholarship for private tuition in the coming school year remains to be seen.
The state’s high court will ultimately decide whether tuition payments under the new law are constitutional, as another lawsuit is expected ahead of classes starting.
The compromise that Republicans in both chambers agreed to combined parts of the House and Senate versions of the legislation. Following the Senate’s suggestion, legislators used lottery revenue to cover $20 million of the $75 million the program will need this year. Keeping with the House’s proposal, the law requires Weaver to hire a “trustee” to oversee fund distribution, which will begin at the end of the month.
Supporters of the program said the cap being hit showed a high demand for the payments.
“These robust application numbers show how excited South Carolina parents are to have opportunity and choice in their children’s education,” Ropp said.
Critics remain unconvinced.
Sherry East, president of the South Carolina Education Association, called the law a “blatant disregard for our constitution by those who are sworn to uphold it.”
“Funds that could be used for other state agencies are being diverted to private schools that pick and choose who they educate,” East said in a statement. “If they take state money, they should play by the same rules.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/school-1024x680.jpeg,,,2025-07-02 17:08:06.719942

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)With roughly $1 trillion in Medicaid funding at stake, Congress is racing to finalize a sweeping budget package, dubbed the “big, beautiful bill,” ahead of President Donald Trump’s July 4 deadline — but key decisions about cuts to the health care program remain up in the air.
A preliminary review by the Congressional Budget Office has heightened concern, and a bipartisan chorus of lawmakers and hospital associations across several states is warning against adopting the Senate version of the bill, which they say could devastate Medicaid-dependent health systems.
The overall package, which calls for cuts to several federal social aid programs, is meant to extend overall tax cuts from Trump’s first presidential term, while boosting U.S. border and military spending. 
Although the House already passed its version in June, the Senate version only advanced this week after Vice President JD Vance cast a tie-breaking vote, following opposition from three Republican senators who sided with Democrats. 
A central dispute between the two chambers involves how the Senate version would restructure Medicaid funding, particularly in ways that could undercut Virginia’s hospitals and the state’s expanded Medicaid program. 
“Given the available options, the U.S. House reconciliation legislation is the better approach to accomplish the President’s tax-cutting objectives while still preserving our health care delivery system and health safety net,” wrote Julian Walker, vice president of communications for the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association. “For the sake of public health, well-being, and the economy, we urge members of the House to reject the Senate plan and insist on their version of the package.”
He added that the association is “deeply disturbed” by the Senate version. 
Last week, Virginia joined hospital associations in 13 states in signing a joint letter opposing the Senate’s proposal. Walker has previously warned that rural hospitals would be hit hardest, likely forced into closures or deep cuts into service and staffing. 
While the House version avoids the same blow to hospital funding mechanisms, it still has Medicaid changes that Democrats, healthcare advocates and many Virginians have criticized. 
Both versions of the bill include new work and authorization requirements for Medicaid recipients.Though most Medicaid beneficiaries already work, some rely on it when temporarily unable to do so — such as Richmond-area construction worker Andrew Daughtry, who is recovering from an injury, and the daughter of Aida Pachecho, who is unemployed while battling breast cancer. 
U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said during a recent press call that the additional authorization requirements could overwhelm already burdened government employees. Meanwhile, U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia introduced amendments to protect Medicaid before the Senate bill passed, but those efforts fell short. 
Despite concerns, Virginia’s House Republicans continue to back their chamber’s version of the bill, claiming it meets Trump’s goals without gutting Medicaid. Reps. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, and Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, signed onto a joint letter with other lawmakers last week. 
“The House’s approach reflects a more pragmatic and compassionate standard, and we urge that it be retained in the final bill,” they wrote. “Protecting Medicaid is essential for the vulnerable constituents we were elected to represent. Therefore, we cannot support a final bill that threatens access to coverage or jeopardizes the stability of our hospitals and providers.”
Medicaid’s size as a share of the federal budget has made it a prime target for Republicans looking to trim or redirect spending. Wittman and Kiggans argue the reforms will ultimately strengthen coverage for pregnant people, children and disabled Americans.

In a recent newsletter, Kiggans called the bill “historic,” describing it as a tool to “rein in Washington’s waste” and deliver on promises made by Trump and Congressional Republicans.
Wittman, who has spoken about being adopted thanks to Medicaid coverage at birth, emphasized his personal connection to the program.
“I know firsthand what access to care means for families like mine,” he said in a recent statement. 
But Virginia Democrats argue that Wittman and Kiggans have already done damage by supporting even partial cuts. 
Democratic Party of Virginia chair Lamont Bagby said in a recent statement that the two representatives “already broke their promise to Virginians by voting to advance this disastrous budget that makes the largest cuts to Medicaid in history.”
He questioned whether the two Republicans would “once again bend the knee to Trump” or stand with their constituents.

The GR2 Foundation: Grambling Research and Resource Foundation is a nonprofit entity separate from Grambling State that will support the university’s academics through philanthropic fundraising. Many other universities already work with similar foundations for this. 
“GR2 is the engine behind our next chapter,” said Grambling President Martin Lemelle. “As we rise toward R2 status, we are laying the groundwork for a stronger, smarter, and more sustainable Grambling State.” 
The Carnegie Classification of Institutes of Higher Education recognizes three levels of research institutions: “R1” or “R2,” meaning they are doctoral degree-granting institutions with either “very high” or “high” levels of research activity and “Research Colleges and Universities,” which goes to schools who spend at least $2.5 million annually on research, regardless of whether they confer doctoral degrees. 
To obtain R2 status, Grambling will need to spend $5 million annually on research and confer at least 20 doctorate degrees. 
Research spending at Grambling has decreased every year since 2017, when it spent $5.9 million on research. In 2023, the most recent year in which data is available, Grambling spent less than $500,000 on research, and does not presently have a research ranking. 
Grambling has recently secured over $12 million in research funding, according to a university press release, including $7 million from the National Science Foundation. 
Theodore Callier, Grambling’s vice president for research, said launching the foundation will allow the university to scale its success in securing external funding. 
Louisiana’s other R2 institutions include Southern University, one of the 13 HBCUs with the designation, Louisiana Tech, the University of New Orleans and LSU Health Sciences Center New Orleans. 
Louisiana’s R1 universities are LSU, Tulane and the University of Louisiana Lafayette. 

Xavier University of Louisiana, University of Louisiana Monroe, Southeastern Louisiana University and LSU Health Sciences Center Shreveport are designated as “research colleges and universities.”

,DC,2025-07-02 20:02:34+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,US House GOP struggles to advance megabill against  Freedom Caucus resistance,"Jennifer Shutt, Ariana Figueroa",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-struggles-advance-megabill-against-freedom-caucus-resistance,,"WASHINGTON —  U.S. House Republican efforts to pass the “big, beautiful bill” hit a roadblock Wednesday, when leaders left the chamber in a holding pattern for hours before sending members back to their offices.The House was scheduled to vote on a rule that would have set up floor debate and a final passage vote for the tax break and spending cut package. But that plan was delayed indefinitely after GOP leaders had to hold open another vote as they tried to secure the votes needed to move forward amid an especially thin 220-212 majority.Far-right members of the House GOP objected strongly to the Senate version passed Tuesday, which reflected changes made during the past month compared to an earlier version passed in the House. Members of the House Freedom Caucus cited provisions dealing with immigration and the repeal of clean energy tax credits, as well as the measure’s increase in the deficit.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released analysis after the Senate voted, showing the bill would increase deficits by $3.4 trillion during the next decade compared to current law.'We can't make everyone 100% happy'Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said just before walking onto the floor that he felt ​​”very positive about the progress” made during ongoing negotiations, but didn’t commit to having the necessary votes.""The thing about it is, when you have a piece of legislation that is this comprehensive and with so many agenda items involved, you're going to have lots of different priorities and preferences among people because they represent different districts and they have different interests,” Johnson said. “But we can't make everyone 100% happy. It's impossible.”Johnson said he would never ask lawmakers to “compromise core principles, but preferences must be yielded for the greater good.”South Dakota Republican Rep. Dusty Johnson told reporters before the delay that “the rule going down would be a very unfortunate development.”But he expressed confidence in Speaker Johnson’s ability to bring holdouts on board eventually, potentially by making commitments tied to future bills.""Speaker Johnson has not made any promises. He has been really good about talking about legislative vehicles that will exist in the months to come,” Dusty Johnson said. “Reconciliation is not the only tool in the Republican, or I should say in the congressional toolbox. Mike Johnson's done a good job of making people understand there are other ways we can get things done.”Trump presses House GOPSeveral House GOP lawmakers traveled to the White House earlier in the day to meet with President Donald Trump, who was working to assuage concerns through several social media posts.“THE ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL DEAL IS ALL ABOUT GROWTH. IF PASSED, AMERICA WILL HAVE AN ECONOMIC RENAISSANCE LIKE NEVER BEFORE,” Trump wrote. “IT IS ALREADY HAPPENING, JUST IN ANTICIPATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL BILL. DEFICIT CUT IN HALF, RECORD INVESTMENT — CASH, FACTORIES, JOBS POURING INTO THE USA. MAGA!!!”Further complicating matters were a few absences, since the House was set to be out of session this week and lawmakers experienced weather-related travel delays trying to get back to Capitol Hill. Many opted to rent cars and drive instead of trying to rebook canceled flights.But the bigger problem facing Speaker Johnson is that he cannot lose more than a handful of GOP votes and still pass the legislation. House Rules Chairwoman Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., urged support for approving the rule during floor debate, arguing it was essential for GOP lawmakers to deliver on campaign promises.“This legislation is the embodiment of the America First agenda and we would all do well to remember that,” Foxx said. “Failure at this critical juncture is not an option. This clock is ticking, the president and the American people are waiting. ""Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern, ranking member on the panel, railed against the dozens of provisions Senate Republicans bundled together in the 870-page package, including some added just Tuesday.“This process — an abomination, legislative malpractice,” McGovern said. “Final text of this bill came out less than 24 hours ago. We met in committee an hour after it was posted and now we’re here considering a rule that only allows for one hour of debate.“This bill is within the jurisdiction of 12 different committees. One hour is ridiculous. And every minute we’re finding out new things that were snuck into the bill: a tax cut for whalers and now we’re learning about a gambling tax.”Tax cuts favor higher incomesThe bill — which underwent weeks of revisions in the Senate after a prior version barely passed the House in May — will extend and expand the 2017 GOP tax law while overhauling several safety-net programs and slashing spending on Medicaid.Those tax cuts skew toward wealthier income earners. The top 1% would receive a cut three times the size of those with incomes in the bottom 60% of after-tax income, according to analysis from the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. It also makes permanent some tax breaks on business investments and research and development costs.The package makes substantial changes to Medicaid, including requiring some people on the program to work, participate in community service, or attend an educational program for at least 80 hours a month.It will block any Medicaid funding from going to Planned Parenthood for one year, essentially requiring enrollees to find other health care options for routine appointments such as cancer screenings, birth control and sexually transmitted infections treatment and screening. Using federal taxpayer dollars for abortion coverage has been restricted for decades, with limited exceptions.The legislation requires state governments to pay for a portion of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for the first time if they cannot get error payment rates under a certain percentage. SNAP is the primary federal nutrition program that feeds low-income people and roughly 42 million rely on it.It bolsters spending on border security and defense by hundreds of billions of dollars, including line items for the “golden dome” missile defense system and additional barriers along the southern border.The measure would provide a substantial funding increase to federal immigration enforcement for detention and removal of people without permanent legal status, aiding the president in carrying out his campaign promise of mass deportations.The bill would raise the debt limit by $5 trillion, a figure designed to get Congress past next year’s midterm elections before the country would once again bump up against the borrowing limit.Protesters milled about and held signs on street corners outside the U.S. Capitol as Republicans worked to pass the megabill. Several spoke out against cuts to Medicaid and SNAP, as well as rollbacks to clean energy tax credits contained in the budget reconciliation package.Senate turmoilThe House voted 215-214 mostly along party lines to approve the first version of the package in late May.Senate Republicans spent much of the last month reading through that, trying to determine what proposals their members supported and which elements would need to come out to comply with the strict rules that go along with writing a budget reconciliation bill.The parliamentarian, that chamber’s referee, continued to issue rulings on whether various policies in the legislation were in bounds for days before the Senate officially began debating the measure and even after they launched into vote-a-rama Monday morning.That “Byrd bath” process eventually wrapped up, allowing Senate GOP leaders to release updated text of the package shortly before the chamber took its final vote.Even with near-constant negotiations among Senate Republicans, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., was unable to get everyone on board.3 Senate Republicans voted noMaine Sen. Susan Collins, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis opposed the measure, which the Senate approved on Tuesday with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote.Collins wrote in a statement that while she supported “extending the tax relief for families and small businesses,” her opposition to the legislation “stems primarily from the harmful impact it will have on Medicaid, affecting low-income families and rural health care providers like our hospitals and nursing homes.”Collins also cited “additional problems” with how the legislation addressed tax credits for certain forms of energy production, which she wrote “should have been gradually phased out so as not to waste the work that has already been put into these innovative new projects and prevent them from being completed.”Tills spoke about his opposition to the bill’s changes to Medicaid during a floor speech before the Senate’s vote, arguing its cuts to spending to the state-federal health program for low-income people and some people with disabilities weren’t in the best interest of GOP voters.“I’m telling the president that you have been misinformed,” Tillis said. “You supporting the Senate mark will hurt people who are eligible and qualified for Medicaid.”Tillis said he supports a policy change in the bill that would require people on Medicaid to work, participate in community service, or attend an educational program. But he was critical of other changes implemented by his Senate colleagues, and announced he won't seek reelection hours after voting against advancing the package.“I love the work requirement. I love the other reforms in this bill. They are necessary and I appreciate the leadership of the House for putting it in there,” Tillis said. “In fact, I like the work of the House so much that I wouldn’t be having to do this speech if we simply started with the House mark.”Paul said he decided to vote against the legislation because it will increase federal deficits during the next few years. “To me the most pertinent question is, how will the bill affect the deficit in the next year?” Paul said. “Currently our deficit is estimated to be a little under $2 trillion this year. What will happen to the (deficit) in 2026 if this bill passes? Well, using the math most favorable to the supporters of the bill, referred to as the policy baseline, the deficit in 2026 will still be $270 billion more than this year.”Paul added “that’s just not good if you profess to be fiscally conservative.”Ashley Murray contributed to this story.",,,,2025-07-02 16:09:16.025004

Ron DeSantis delivers remarks during a press conference in Jacksonville on Jan. 10, 2025. (Screenshot from Florida Channel)Gov. Ron DeSantis has vetoed a bill that was intended to limit state and local officials from using their official authority or influence to solicit campaign contributions.
The legislation (HB 1445) sponsored by Melbourne Republican Debbie Mayfield also would have prohibited reimbursement for transportation expenses of agency heads who live outside of Tallahassee.
The legislative proposal was introduced after NBC News reported that two top staffers in the governor’s office were calling state lobbyists to raise money for a political committee aligned with the governor at the same time that news surfaced that First Lady Casey DeSantis was considering a run for governor. State officials denied the report.
The bill was passed unanimously in the Senate and 97-1 in the House. Palm Beach Republican Mike Caruso, an ally of the governor, was the only dissenter.
Veto override?
Speaking on Matt Gaetz’s program on the One America News Network on Tuesday night, Miami-Dade House Republican Juan Porras called the veto “irresponsible” and said the Legislature could attempt to override it.
“If there were any bill that the Legislature would override the governor’s veto, it probably would be this one,” he said.
“I think in my opinion [it’s] irresponsible that the governor decided to veto this,” Porras added. “I think it looks bad on his part. But I do think this is something that all of the Legislature could probably get behind and override if the Senate probably were to agree.”
“I might know someone over there,” Gaetz quipped, referring to his father — Don Gaetz — who won re-election to the Senate last year after serving as Senate president in 2012-14 and now chairs the Ethics and Elections Committee.
The veto was no surprise, since the governor blasted the proposal earlier in the session. That’s when the legislation called for all executive branch appointees who live outside the state capital to have to move to Tallahassee.
“They’re saying all the agency heads must live in the swamp,” DeSantis said during a press conference in Pensacola in April. “I want to drain the swamp; I don’t want to refill the swamp. Where are they getting this? It’s an asinine proposal.”
Lawmakers later removed that provision, but kept the language that would prohibit executive directors of executive branch departments, secretaries of executive branch departments, and chief administrative officers of government entities housed under the executive branch from being reimbursed for transportation expenses incurred between their residences and department headquarters. It would also have prohibited per diem and subsistence allowance when remaining overnight in their county of residence.
The bill also required members of the state’s Board of Governors to be U.S. citizens and either a Florida resident or a graduate of a state university. It also required members of a state university board of trustees to be U.S. citizens and either a Florida resident or a graduate of the university overseen by such a board.
In his letter explaining his veto of the legislation on Tuesday, DeSantis focused only on that provision only of the proposal.
“CS/HB 1445 attempts to impose additional eligibility criteria by requiring members of the BOG [Board of Governors] and BOT [Board of Trustees} to be ‘either a resident of this state or a graduate of [a/the] state university.’ However, the Florida Supreme Court has ‘consistently held that statutes imposing additional qualifications for office are unconstitutional where the basic document of the constitution itself has already undertaken to set forth those requirements.’”
Bad blood
The governor’s veto of Mayfield’s bill comes with some history.
She had originally supported DeSantis run for president in 2023 but, along with a handful of GOP state lawmakers, publicly flipped their support to Donald Trump during a Republican presidential summit in Orlando that fall.
Mayfield served the past eight years in the Senate before being term-limited in 2024. She won a House seat last fall but decided to run again for her old seat earlier this year once it became vacant following Randy Fine’s decision to run for Congress.
The Florida Department of State attempted to deny her the ability to run for that seat, saying it would violate the state term limit law. She challenged that decision and won in state court a week later, and ultimately won that Senate seat last month.

Lawmakers of both political parties made their top job in the 2025 session addressing stiff increases in residential property taxes, and after negotiations that took nearly the entire session, they agreed to legislation that aims to help.
Margie MacDonald, who looks out for senior citizens as a lobbyist for Big Sky 55+, said the group she represents came out with “a big win.”
“We felt it was a major substantial cut for the vast majority of older Montanans who were hit the hardest by the 2023 property tax shift,” MacDonald said.
The most recent reappraisal cycle pushed up the median tax bill for residential payers 21%, and the increase was expected to continue. In 2023, reappraisals went up a record 46% on average.
Now, the work done at the Capitol is starting to shape up in the real world, and local and state legislators and lobbyists are counting wins — such a change in the conversation about who’s to blame — and already pointing to losses — such as hefty increases for Montanans who own second homes.
This week, the Department of Revenue announced it is sending out reappraisal notices to property taxpayers and asked them to review them as soon as possible. The DOR said the information will reflect the recent changes signed into law.
“It’s important that Montana property owners review this information,” said Brendan Beatty, director of the Montana Department of Revenue, in a statement. “If property owners wait until property tax bills are sent in November, it will be too late for the department to correct property characteristics and make adjustments that may impact the value of the property for Tax Year 2025.”
House Appropriations Chairman Llew Jones, largely seen as the architect of the property tax redesign in the 2025 session, said he believes the new system evens out a spike that had put a significant burden on residential payers at the expense of other classes.
Jones said the business lobby paid lower taxes, but this session, they weren’t quite as happy.
“They all walked the halls and yelled at me,” said Jones, R-Conrad.
An analysis Jones shared from the Department of Revenue shows the before-and-after estimates of payments based on changes from House Bill 231 and Senate Bill 542 — the two main bills that together addressed property taxes.
The analysis assumes other factors remain the same, such as local levies.
In Cascade County, for example, a home valued at $400,000 would have been billed $3,225 without any change from the legislature.
With the pair of bills that passed, the owner will be billed an estimated $2,217 instead in 2025 and $2,238 in 2026, according to the analysis, again, with other factors being equal. That’s a difference of $987.
“For many Montana homeowners — with homes around $400,000 — the estimated savings top $1,000 or more per year,” Jones said in a statement. “But remember: these are projections. Actual savings will depend on local mill levies set by your county, city and schools.”
County Commissioner Josh Slotnick of Missoula said increases in value coming soon from the Department of Revenue might “usurp the gains” people may have experienced in property tax relief, if not completely, at least partially.
But Slotnick said one important thing that happened in the most recent session goes beyond the work to reduce the hit to residential payers. He said Gov. Greg Gianforte “is forever saying your local officials have a spending problem.”
But Slotnick said legislators, including Jones and Missoula Democratic Reps. Mark Thane and Jonathan Karlen, were able to respond to data instead — which showed the burden had shifted onto residential taxpayers.
“A huge victory is that to a large degree, the discussion stopped being about, ‘How do we stop county commissioners and mayors from spending like drunken sailors?’ To, ‘How do we deal with the burden shift?’” said Slotnick, a Democrat.
He said the outcome is a nod to fairness.
“This solution isn’t a Democratic solution. It isn’t a Republican solution. It’s a solution based in reality,” Slotnick said.

Gianforte, a Republican, signed the pair of bills that account for the property tax redesign.
Together, HB 231 and SB 542 provide for a graduated tax rate with three tiers for homes, support a rebate, and offer relief for homes that are primary residences, including long-term rentals, among other provisions.
The governor vetoed a bill that would have expanded a property tax credit for elderly people.
In his veto letter, Gianforte said the program in House Bill 831 would have cost $7 million, the program already works well in its current form, and seniors benefit from the other property tax relief bills he signed.
Meanwhile, residential property taxpayers also recently received postcards about a smaller short-term patch — a reminder from the Department of Revenue that property tax rebates of up to $400 will be available starting August 15, 2025.
Although some politicians praise the outcome from Helena, Commissioner Mike McGinley, from Beaverhead County, remains skeptical that residents in his district will benefit.
McGinley is a Republican who has been one of the most outspoken local politicians when it comes to recent property tax increases and challenges for local governments.
He has pointed out that local governments have been living under a constraint in state law that allowed them to increase property taxes in general just half the rate of inflation — putting them more behind year after year.
McGinley said he isn’t convinced the new system will work well in Beaverhead County.
For the county itself, he said, an estimated 27% drop for residential payers will probably hit agriculture and commercial classes and “cause a little controversy.”
Also, he said Dillon, the county seat, doesn’t have a diverse tax base, so the only way to make up the difference is by levying more mills — on the same residential payers.
McGinley said maybe on the whole, the legislation will help residential payers in the state, especially by shifting some of the responsibility to people with second homes. But he said he doesn’t believe some taxpayers in his district will see relief.
“People who are expecting these big tax decreases better buckle down. It can’t happen,” McGinley said.
Sen. Mary Ann Dunwell, D-Helena, who spoke throughout the legislative session about hardships on seniors, said tens of thousands of people who qualified for the property tax rebate issued after the last 2023 session still missed out.
Dunwell said she worries that the same people who either didn’t hear about the rebate or had trouble with the application will be in the same boat this time.
This year, the state is paying rebates, and rebate applications automatically enroll a property taxpayer in the homestead rate reduction starting in 2026, according to a recent guest piece in the Missoulian from Thane, Karlen, and other Democratic members of the House Tax Committee.
“The poorest people, the most vulnerable, the most disenfranchised, the ones who generally fall through the cracks, are again going to fall through the cracks,” Dunwell said.
The Department of Revenue did not answer questions sent Friday about the outreach it is doing, in addition to the postcard, to ensure eligible people receive the breaks the legislature intended. In fall 2023, the DOR estimated 43,000 people who were eligible for rebates had not received them.
Although Dunwell raised concerns, she also said the property tax relief package that passed is an improvement, and if something isn’t working — “we’ll come back next session and fix it.”
The redesign aimed to support Montana residents with one home, a “homestead,” including by dropping the rate for the first $400,000 in value from 1.35% to 0.76% — while the rate for second homes goes from 1.35% to 1.9%.
Some Montana residents who aren’t rich but have family cabins have said the outcome means they get a break on their main residence but “crushing increases” on their second home.
“For many families, that may mean being forced to sell long-held properties and likely losing them to out-of-state buyers,” said Vicki Turner of Helena in a letter Dunwell shared. “That’s not only unfair, but it is also unjust and heartbreaking.”
Jones, though, said the goal was to support the majority of Montana residents — “the vast majority of folks are just trying to pay for their one house.” He said Montanans with vacation homes aren’t treated differently than others with vacation homes.
“Most folks don’t have two homes,” Jones said.
Slotnick, with Missoula County, said the difficulty in a place where values keep increasing is that even if commissioners increase taxes 4%, that bump could translate into a 20% increase in someone’s property tax bill.
“How it’s not fair is the increase in your home’s value is not an accurate value of your ability to pay,” Slotnick said.”
The pair of property tax relief bills reduce the tax rate on a graduated scale for residential property, which lowers the taxable value of the property, he said. In doing so, he said, it shifts the tax burden back to other classes of payers.
“The reason this is so difficult is some of those others (taxpayer groups) have really intense lobbyists and attorneys who typically win their arguments,” Slotnick said.
Slotnick said he appreciates the legislation because people with homes that have a lower value will get a larger reduction, and that result pleases him as a progressive Democrat.
But he also said people in Missoula, for example, won’t see as much relief as residents of some other counties because Missoula has a lot more houses in the $750,000 to $800,000 range.
“We have a whole bunch of middle income people who really need help who, through no fault of their own, own a $850,000 home,” he said. “I am one of them.”
(Slotnick, a farmer, said he bought a $250,000 property in 2000, and it’s now worth $850,000.)
But Slotnick also said legislators applied a scale they thought would work for the most people, and the bills are fair.

Glenn Youngkin, flanked by Petersburg Police Chief Travis Christian, speaks to reporters at the Virginia State Police headquarters in Richmond on July 2, 2025. (Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Wednesday doubled down on the controversial use of courthouse arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, brushing off criticism that some of the individuals detained were simply in court to pay fines for traffic infractions and had no criminal record.
“Let’s just be clear, the vast majority of the people that have been arrested at courthouses around the country are committing violent crimes,” Youngkin said at a press conference at the Virginia State Police headquarters in Richmond. “If someone breaks the law and is here illegally, they should be arrested.”
Although not involved in the recent courthouse raids, Youngkin hailed efforts by the Virginia Homeland Security Task Force, a state-federal partnership he launched in February to target gang members, narcotics traffickers and undocumented immigrants with criminal records. 
“This work is critical, and it’s happening all over the commonwealth of Virginia,” he said. “We just passed over 2,500 arrests through our Virginia Homeland Security Task Force. Two-thousand five-hundred violent criminals who are here illegally — MS-13 members, Tren de Aragua, others, international violent gang members.”
Describing the task force as a “national model of success,” Youngkin credited the rapid rollout of Virginia’s 287(g) agreement with ICE — approved just 20 hours after his Executive Order 47 in February — for much of the operation’s momentum. The program allows state and local law enforcement to enforce federal immigration laws.
“It started with a plan, and then stepped to a 287(g) memorandum with the federal government and our State Police and our Department of Corrections, and yes, some of our local law enforcement partners,” Youngkin said Wednesday. “This is a concerted effort to collaborate with the federal government to make sure that violent criminals that are here illegally are arrested.”
When asked by The Mercury about recent arrests in Chesterfield County, where ICE agents detained at least 14 people over several days last week — including a man who had come to court to pay traffic fines — Youngkin didn’t waver.
“First of all, if you break the law in America and you’re here illegally, then you should be detained and deported,” he said. “That’s common sense.”
Youngkin emphasized that ICE is not targeting houses of worship or schools and accused the media of distorting the intent of enforcement efforts.
“They’re not going to schools and they’re not going to churches … the media really wants to try to sow deceit,” he said.
Several news reports, however, confirm ICE has conducted arrests on church grounds and near schools since sensitive-location protections were rolled back. 
In California, migrants were detained outside churches and in parking lots, sparking backlash from local faith leaders. Meanwhile, school districts across the U.S. are preparing for ICE presence amid concerns over student safety and civil rights. 
And in Washington, D.C., immigration officers attempted to detain a school healthcare worker at a local elementary school parking lot — prompting school officials to demand ID and warrants before letting them on campus.
The arrests in Chesterfield drew immediate backlash from community leaders and local officials, who say the enforcement actions are sweeping up residents with no history of violent crime and undermining public trust in the legal system.
One of those detained was Salvador Calderon-Cuellar, whose immigration status remains unclear. 
According to court records, Calderon-Cuellar pleaded guilty in April to two traffic violations — driving without a license and failure to yield — and appeared at the Chesterfield courthouse on June 25 to pay a $130 fine when ICE officers took him into custody through the back entrance.
Jessica Schneider, a member of the Chesterfield Board of Supervisors, was addressing a protest outside the courthouse when she learned of his arrest.
“He had no prior arrests,” she said. “Can you tell me that that is a violent criminal person that should be detained? This is a person that is here, working in our communities, and why are we punishing him?”
Protesters condemned the arrests as politically motivated and harmful to due process. Nicole Martin, president of the Chesterfield County NAACP, called the courthouse a “sacred place in a democracy,” warning that ICE raids would dissuade victims and witnesses from engaging with the legal system.
The courthouse operation is part of a larger statewide trend. 
In addition to Chesterfield, ICE has carried out arrests in Sterling, Albemarle County, and Richmond in recent months. In a joint ICE-FBI operation in Northern Virginia  seven undocumented individuals were detained in what the agency described as a targeted enforcement effort.
Youngkin’s task force is comprised of more than 200 officers from the FBI, ICE, Virginia State Police, and the Department of Corrections. 
ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons said in April the expanded use of 287(g) agreements has been a key driver of arrests in Virginia. FBI Director Kash Patel called the effort “a tremendous success,” while U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi praised the governor’s alignment with the Trump administration’s “Make America Safe Again” agenda.
But research complicates the narrative that undocumented immigrants pose an outsized threat. A 2024 report funded by the National Institute of Justice found that undocumented immigrants in Texas were arrested at significantly lower rates than U.S.-born citizens — including for violent, property, and drug crimes.
Del. Michael Jones, D-Richmond, said in a statement last week that the Chesterfield arrests “desecrate the very temple of justice their oath of office obligates them to uphold.” He has proposed reforms to restrict ICE access to courthouses, labeling the raids a violation of constitutional dignity.
And Amanda Pohl, clerk of the Chesterfield Circuit Court, said she only became aware of the ICE operation after it was already underway. 
“They’ve been in plain clothes, and so I don’t actually have an accounting of how long they were here,” she told The Mercury. While her office doesn’t coordinate with ICE, she said she was reviewing internal policy to ensure “this is a courthouse where people feel safe.”
But for Youngkin, the political calculus is clear. “This is about safety,” he said Wednesday. “And today, Virginia is safer.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy issued a proclamation for a special session on Wednesday, calling Legislators back to Juneau in August to pass legislation on education reform and his executive order creating a new Department of Agriculture.
The special session also means that lawmakers cannot wait until January to vote on overrides to the governor’s budget vetoes and his vetoes on several policy bills. They must vote in the first five days of the special session.
That’s significant, because 45 votes are needed to override a budget veto, and while there were 46 votes in favor of a prior veto override this spring, at least one legislator who voted in favor of that override will be unavailable in August.
The 30-day special session is scheduled to begin 10 a.m. August 2 in Juneau.
Agriculture is currently overseen by a division within the Department of Natural Resources. 
​​“Enacting a few necessary reforms to our public education system can elevate those children struggling in Alaska’s school system,” said Dunleavy in an email statement with the announcement. “As elected officials we must do all we can to put the next generation on the path to a successful and prosperous future, and that starts with a solid public education. Splitting the Division of Agriculture away from DNR into a department will elevate food security and support our hard-working farmers while growing the agricultural sector.”
The announcement comes in the wake of a historic veto override vote, 46-14, by the Legislature rejecting Dunleavy’s veto of an education funding bill, House Bill 57, raising the core of the state’s education formula by  $700 per student. Dunleavy then made a budget veto of part of the funding for schools, pushing it down to $500 per student, and House and Senate leadership have promised to override that veto in the next session. 
Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, said he was surprised by the announcement and learned about it from reporters calling him for comment.
The special session will force lawmakers to vote early on veto overrides for education funding and a variety of other bills, he said. Legislative attorneys have told lawmakers that with the governor’s proclamation, they cannot defer those votes until the regular session begins in January.
That’s a problem for supporters of an education veto override, because 45 of 60 legislators are needed for that vote to succeed. This spring, a policy veto override garnered 46 votes, but Sen. Forrest Dunbar, D-Anchorage, is in Poland on a National Guard deployment and is expected to be unavailable in August.
Other legislators may also be unavailable, Stevens said.
And supporters of an override have questioned whether all of the votes from the previous override vote will hold for a budget override.
In May, lawmakers voted 32-28 to deny an executive order by Dunleavy to create a new Department of Agriculture, citing the proposal’s costs as well as creation through an executive order rather than as legislation, with public input.

That’s less than 1% of the total forestland surveyed.","A foggy morning at Calispell Meadows on the Colville National Forest in northeast Washington. (Photo courtesy of U.S. Forest Service)More than half a million acres of trees spread across Washington were sick, struggling, or dead last year, according to the results of an aerial survey of forests by the state’s Department of Natural Resources.
Surveyors identified about 545,000 acres with some level of tree mortality, defoliation, or disease, the department said this week. That’s less than 1% of the total forestland surveyed.
The amount of forest with problems is up nearly 30,000 acres from 2023 and more than the 10-year average of 519,000 acres, but well below the acres mapped with diseased or dead trees in 2022, according to the Department of Natural Resources.
The Department of Natural Resources and the U.S. Forest Service partnered to conduct an aerial survey of 22 million forested acres in Washington state to observe recently killed and damaged trees. They carried out the survey between June and September last year.
The agencies, as well as the Oregon State Department of Forestry, have been partnering on aerial detection surveys since 1947, according to the Department of Natural Resources.
Washington experienced above average temperatures for the majority of 2024, with some level of drought observed on most lands by fall.
“The main climate takeaway for Washington in 2024 was the continuation of long-term warming trends,” the Department of Natural Resources stated in the report. “For the third time in four years, the annual average temperature in Washington was among the 10 warmest on record.”
The “unusually dry and warm weather” likely contributed to tree stress and insect success, the Department of Natural Resources reported.
Insects were the primary cause of the tree damage mapped last year.
Bark beetles, in particular, were responsible for about 270,000 acres of damage. Notable bark beetles with high activity are the fir engraver, the mountain pine beetle, the western pine beetle and the silver fir beetle.
While the silver fir beetle only damaged 2,900 acres of Washington forests last year, up from just 500 acres in 2023, Department of Natural Resources entomologist Glenn Kohler said that beetle’s damage is among the most visible, given its presence in the North Cascades National Park, Snoqualmie Pass and the Alpine Lakes Wilderness.
“We will certainly be interested to see if the current peak is sustained for a second year,” Kohler said.
Another outbreak noted in the 2024 report is the continued presence of the California fivespined ips beetle, which has been the cause of increasing pine tree deaths since 2022 in urban forest settings around the Puget Sound region. The beetle was first detected in Washington in 2010.
Also of concern is the western spruce budworm, which caused defoliation damage to more than 63,500 acres of forest in 2024 after three years of no recorded activity.
Western spruce budworm outbreaks are uncommon in Washington state, according to the Department of Natural Resources, with the last outbreaks occurring in 2011 and 2012.
The current outbreak is most visible east of Ross Lake in Whatcom, Skagit and Okanogan counties, according to the Department of Natural Resources.
The 10-year average of forest damage in Washington is skewed by a two-year gap during the COVID pandemic, when the full 22 million acres of Washington state’s forest were not surveyed.
A total of 550,000 damaged acres were mapped in 2021, but only 19 million acres were surveyed that year. Similarly, only 10.5 million acres were surveyed in 2020, with 322,000 acres of damage mapped.
Data used for those two surveys was acquired through a combination of ground sampling and remote sensing in place of survey flights.
The standard 22 million acres of Washington’s forests were mapped in 2019, 2022 and 2023. A total of 658,000 damaged acres were mapped in 2019, 672,000 damaged acres were mapped in 2022, and 517,000 damaged acres were mapped in 2023.
“Similar to wildfire season data, it’s better to make observations over a longer period, like a 10 year stretch, to gauge trendlines,” said Will Rubin, a spokesperson for the Department of Natural Resources.
The data is included in an annual Department of Natural Resources report that summarizes insects, diseases, and other disturbances affecting Washington’s forests.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/colville-national-forest.jpg,,,2025-07-02 16:09:16.025004

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Tuesday marked the first day that Montanans can say that abortion — up to the point of viability — is protected specifically through an amendment in the state’s Constitution.
Voters in November overwhelmingly supported the constitutional right, even though the procedure has long been legal, and Constitutional Initiative 128 became the law of the state, despite a last-minute legal challenge.
That challenge was rebuffed on Tuesday by a unanimous decision of the Montana Supreme Court not to hear the case brought by several individuals and the Montana Life Defense Fund, a committee association with the Montana Family Foundation. The lawsuit asked the high court to intervene, halt the amendment from going into effect, and declare it void, due to concerns that voters on Election Day did not have enough information to properly decide the issue.
The Supreme Court dismissed the late challenge, and said that the suit was poorly timed and didn’t even develop a set of facts adequately. Meanwhile, the Montana Family Foundation said while it was disappointed in the decision, it would continue the fight at the district court level.
“We remain confident in the strength of our arguments and will now proceed at the district court level. While today’s decision is a setback in timing, it is not the end of the road. This is justice delayed — not justice denied,” said Derek Oestreicher, chief legal counsel for the Montana Family Foundation.
Two plaintiffs, Joe Addy and Hannah Rhodes, had asked the high court to intervene and invalidate CI-128, which makes abortion legal up to the point of fetal viability. They argued that because the text of the entire amendment was not printed fully on the ballot, and because voters who registered to vote on Election Day did not have the full text or the voter information booklet issued by the state, they were not adequately informed.
However, the Montana Supreme Court rejected all of those arguments and criticized the plaintiffs for bringing the challenge just a few weeks before the abortion amendment was to be enacted.
Moreover, the court said that CI-128 was handled the same way as every other ballot measure since 1978, so that if the court would have accepted the argument, it opened up the possibility that all amendments since were also constitutionally deficient.
“Any urgency of emergency that exists is entirely of the Defense Fund’s own making, because it waited seven months to file this petition,” the court said in the seven-page order, which outlined why it turned down the request. “We have repeatedly warned parties they cannot manufacture an emergency due to lack of diligence.”
While the plaintiffs said they did not know what they were voting for or against by registering to vote on Election Day with the full text of the amendment not printed on the ballot, the court criticized them because copies of the full voters’ guide and the full text are required to be available at every voting precinct.
“The Defense Fund does not tell us how many election-day registrants exist for the 2024 General Election, nor does it assert that the number of election-day registrants was sufficient to change the outcome of this vote,” the court noted.
The Supreme Court also pointed out that state law requires the Montana Secretary of State to print a voter information guide, as well as preparing the ballot information for publication in newspapers or other platforms at the county and state level.
In addition to publishing the text in newspapers around the state and having voting guides sent to all registered voters and available at the polling locations, the Supreme Court said that “the Secretary of State maintains a website, accessible to the public, that includes the (Voter Information Pamphlet) along with other information about Montana’s elections.”
“The Defense Fund has not demonstrated that the electorate was not provided with the full text of CI-128,” the order said. “…And it has not developed the facts necessary to support its legal arguments.”

Tony Evers signed bills into law launching efforts to bring nuclear power to Wisconsin and creating and expanding programs to help children in crisis. Evers talks to reporters in March. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Ahead of floor sessions for the Senate and Assembly to vote on the budget, Gov. Tony Evers signed bills into law launching efforts to bring nuclear power to Wisconsin and creating and expanding programs to help children in crisis.
The bills passed the Senate and Assembly in floor sessions in June where debate centered heavily on the lack of funding attached to them. Evers had earlier told lawmakers to include the funding or he would veto the legislation, Democrats agreed the funding should be included, while Republicans said the funding would come in the budget if Evers signed the bills without any changes. State funding for the bills was included in the budget plan approved by the budget committee Tuesday.
One law, 2025 Wisconsin Act 11, will create a Nuclear Power Summit Board in Wisconsin responsible for putting on a summit in Madison to advance nuclear power and fusion energy technology.
The summit must be held within one month after instruction starts at the new engineering building at UW-Madison. Construction on the building, which is estimated to cost $419 million, started in April and is supposed to be finished in 2028. The funding for the building was approved by the Legislature and Evers in 2024.
Evers also signed 2025 Wisconsin Act 12, which requires the Public Service Commission to conduct a study to determine potential sites for a nuclear power plant. The state budget bill includes $2 million to fund the study.
Evers said the bills would help the state pursue an “innovative, clean energy future and bring more clean jobs to our state.”
Wisconsin currently has one active nuclear power plant. The Point Beach Nuclear Plant located in Two Rivers, which first came online in the 1970s, has two tractors and provides about 16% of the state’s energy, according to the conservative think tank the Badger Institute. A Kewaunee nuclear power plant shut down in 2013. 
“We can’t afford to choose between mitigating climate change and protecting our environment or creating good-paying jobs and building a strong economy, and by working toward clean energy options Wisconsinites can depend on in the future, we’re doing both,” Evers said. “We must continue our efforts to help lower energy costs and improve energy independence by reducing our reliance on out-of-state energy sources, and these bills are an important step in the right direction.”
Evers also signed Senate Bill 106, now 2025 Wisconsin Act 9, that will create psychiatric residential treatment facilities (PRTFs) in the state. The law is the result of a study committee on the emergency detention and civil commitment of minors and aims to reduce the number of  youth in crisis who are sent out of state for care by offering long-term mental health treatment closer to home.
The budget will include $1.79 million for grants to psychiatric residential treatment facilities.
Another law, 2025 Wisconsin Act 10, which is also a result of the study committee, instructs the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) to create a statewide portal to facilitate the sharing of safety plans for minors with designated safety plan partners. The budget includes about $819,000 in state funding for the program and the agency will get one staff position to run the portal. 
Sen. Jesse James (R-Thorp), who served as chair of the study committee, has championed the legislation this session.
At a press conference ahead of the Senate floor session, James said his focus has been on supporting Wisconsin’s children and that the issues are personal for him as a father and a law enforcement officer.
“I believe there are real positive changes within our reach. It’s about recognizing the opportunities in front of us and taking decisive action when that moment comes,” James said. “This budget is packed with great projects. We increase funding for our child advocacy centers. We take care of our child victims in a safe environment. We establish funding for psychiatric residential treatment facilities to keep children with intense mental health treatment needs closer to home.” 
Another law, 2025 Wisconsin Act 13, officially recognizes new child advocacy centers in state statute and expands the number of them that are eligible for the Wisconsin Department of Justice’s child advocacy grant program. The centers work with law enforcement to investigate child abuse and neglect and provide children with resources and support. The budget will include $2 million to support the grants. 
The final piece of legislation is 2025 Wisconsin Act 14, to distribute hearing protection devices to state and local law enforcement and firefighters. The budget will include $2.6 million to fund the program.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The same year Nebraskans voted to cement an abortion ban beyond the first trimester into the state constitution, the number of abortions performed in Nebraska rose about 7.6%. 
According to data from the state Department of Health and Human Services, at least 2,501 abortions were performed in Nebraska in 2024. That’s 176 higher than 2023’s total of 2,325 abortions in one year. 
Since 2020, Nebraska’s abortion rate has remained relatively level between about 2,300 to 2,500 procedures per year. All the while, the state’s abortion policy has fluctuated more wildly. 
In 2022, when Nebraska banned abortions past 20 weeks of pregnancy, state lawmakers were considering a full abortion ban that would be triggered when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. 
The trigger bill did not pass, and the next year lawmakers returned with a proposal to ban most abortions beyond six weeks of pregnancy. That proposal did not pass either, but in the same session lawmakers approved an amended bill to ban most abortions at 12 weeks post-gestation. 
For the 2024 election, abortion-rights advocates launched an initiative to expand abortion access within the Nebraska Constitution, which was swiftly met with an opposing initiative aimed at enshrining the current ban in the constitution. The more restrictive measure passed by roughly 55% of voters.
Breaking down the data
Nebraska’s monthly abortion rate in 2024 fluctuated between a low of 174 recorded in February, up to 250 recorded in October, just before the election. 
By far, the most popular method for undergoing an abortion was via medication, which accounted for 2,024 of the 2,501 abortions recorded in 2024 — just under 81% overall. The second most common method was curettage with suction, which made up 475 abortions that year.

Nebraska voters approve constitutional amendment Initiative 434, banning most abortions past the first trimester

Compared to 2023, Nebraska saw fewer clients traveling from other states for abortions in 2024. In 2023, Nebraska logged clients from 19 outside states, while 2024 logged 14 other states. 
The number of clients traveling from each of those states also dropped in all but one state. For example, neighbor Kansas had 51 patients in 2023 compared to just two in 2024, and Texas had 46 patients in 2023 and 10 in 2024. 
The outlier is Iowa, which already made up the largest amount of out-of-state clients in 2023, with 222 that year. In 2024, that number rose to 358 clients. 
This comes as no surprise to Ruth Richardson, CEO of Planned Parenthood North Central States (PPNCS). Iowa bans most abortions after cardiac activity is detected, which typically happens around six weeks of pregnancy. Advocates have said this essentially amounts to a total ban, as most women don’t realize they’re pregnant at that point. 
In a PPNCS press release, the organization reported that abortions performed in Iowa dropped sharply after its ban took effect in the summer of 2024. In comparison, abortions provided in Nebraska have risen about 68% since Roe was overturned in 2022, Richardson said. 
“More people must travel to get essential health care, when they deserve to be able to get it in their own communities,” Richardson said in the press release. “And yet amidst all this chaos and manufactured confusion, we have innovated and implemented solutions that have increased the number of abortion patients we have served.”    
Sandy Danek, executive director of Nebraska Right to Life, agreed that Iowa’s new abortion ban likely contributed to the rise in Iowan clients traveling to Nebraska for abortions in 2024. She said women who feel like they need an abortion often seek out states with more “liberal” abortion laws when their state is more restrictive. 
DHHS’ data reported that more than half of Nebraska’s abortions performed in 2024 happened between six to eight weeks gestation. Considering that, Danek said she feels the state’s current abortion ban past the first trimester is still too lax. She also acknowledged that further restrictions may risk encouraging Nebraskans to travel to states where abortions are more accessible. 
Danek said there are plenty of alternatives to abortions available to women who may feel they have no other option, but the challenge lies in getting the word out to those women. 
“You want to balance your dollar to both provide those services to women, but then also reach out to make the community know that they exist,” Danek said. “And that’s a juggling act.”
Implications for Nebraska’s future 
Following voters’ approval of the first-trimester abortion ban in November, abortion-rights advocates speculated that officials in the anti-abortion camp would use the victory to push for further restrictions. Officials in that camp, including Gov. Jim Pillen, told a different story, saying that it wasn’t the right time to try for more. 
While there were no bills introduced in Nebraska’s 2025 legislative session that would have directly increased the state’s abortion ban, several bills were introduced that advocates claim were intended to narrow abortion access. Those included a bill to increase requirements for medication abortions from State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue (LB 512), and a bill to require the burial or cremation of abortion remains from Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair (LB 632).

Neither of those bills passed this session, but both will remain on the books when lawmakers reconvene in 2026. 
Though it’s too early for Nebraska Right to Life to identify priorities for the 2026 session, Danek said she supports Holdcroft’s bill. Given that the vast majority of recent Nebraska abortions are performed through medication, and she claims abortion pills are linked to a range of negative side effects, Danek said LB 512 is “a good starting place.” 
Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood officials are grappling with potential new obstacles at the federal level. Congress is considering a version of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” that would prohibit Medicaid funds from going to Planned Parenthood for one year for any health care service provided by the organization. 
The bill passed the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, and is up for a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives as early as this week. 
Through this uncertainty, Richardson said PPNCS is looking for ways to expand their services, particularly for clients in health care deserts who have to travel longer distances for in-person care. She said they are increasing their investments in telehealth and service lines for primary care, for example.

(Photo by Preston Keres/USDA)Not all farmers and ranchers will agree in a discussion about climate change, but it would be difficult to find a Midwest producer who did not value climate-related data addressing drought, precipitation, temperature and frost outlooks. 
These are all pieces of data gathered and distributed by the Ames-based Midwest Climate Hub, which along with the other 10 regional climate hubs under the U.S. Department of Agriculture, is slated to be cut from the federal agriculture budget. 
The U.S. House appropriations bill that sets the 2026 fiscal year budgets for agriculture, rural development, food and drug administration and related agencies includes “no funds for climate hubs or climate corps.” 
The summary of the bill, which closely follows budget requests from President Donald Trump, says it “safeguards American taxpayer dollars and preserves core functions” by eliminating funding for climate hubs, among other changes. 
Eleven regional Climate Hubs were established as interagency departments by USDA in 2014 with the goal of coordinating across USDA agencies, and with U.S. producers, on climate resiliency strategies.

Lowering the information barrier
Laurie Nowatzke was formerly the associate director of the Midwest Climate Hub, before she was terminated in February and then brought back in March briefly before she took the second deferred resignation program offered to federal employees.
Nowatzke said part of her role at the hub was to “bridge” on-the-ground responses and needs of producers to USDA research, and vice versa.
Each climate hub is a little different, depending on the needs of their region, but Nowatzke said climate, in its most basic form relating to weather patterns, was a big focus for the Midwest.
“A huge focus of ours was taking that sort of experienced climate and weather conditions and how that applies or affects agriculture,” Nowatzke said.
This is most seen through the ag-focus climate outlooks the hub put out monthly, and weekly during crop season.
Nowatzke said as of the end of April when she left the office, staff were not allowed to update content on the website and have instead continued to send the outlooks via email to subscribers.
She said the climate outlooks were a “key product” the hub put out that producers and stakeholders said was especially helpful to contextualize the “vast array of climate and weather data” available from outlets like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Rod Pierce, a long-time corn and soybean farmer in central Iowa, said the outlooks help him with both long- and short-term planning in his operation. They help him answer questions such as when is the last frost so he can plant, is it going to be dry, and importantly, what conditions are other Midwestern states facing that he should take into account when marketing his commodities.
“Weather is so important in us making decisions, trying to look at the trend for the year…do I want to grow corn or beans…it just helps put some of that stuff in line,” Pierce said.
He said the hub reports give him a “big picture” of trends in the region, and he feels the information is trustworthy.
“We know the people that are doing it are not just blowing smoke,” Pierce said. “It’s good data, it’s researched data.”
Alli Wenman, the regional climate outreach project manager for the University of Wisconsin–Madison’s  extension, said in interviews with extension office managers and educators throughout the Midwest, she learned access to training and applicable information were the top tools these professionals said they needed to discuss the impacts of climate change with producers in their regions. 
“They need to know the climate science … but they also need to know the social science, like, how do I facilitate that conversation around climate,” Wenman said. “The hub has that information and has the capacity to build those tools, the capacity to build those trainings.” 
Wenman spoke with these professionals as part of a project, funded by USDA, to forge connections between university extension programs and the climate hubs and work toward greater agricultural resilience in the face of climate change. 
She said the partnership with the Midwest Climate Hub was “key” to cut through the “noise” at the research level and give producers the tools and data that matter most to their operations. 
Wenman said the ag-focused climate outlooks have become a trustworthy source of information for a lot of producers. 
“The information is out there, but it’s maybe not framed for ag,” Wenman said. “There’s too much information, so they help us sort through what information is relevant for ag and put it into ag terms.”
The reports pull information from nearly a dozen agencies and compile it into a four-page report full of climate, crop and soil moisture information and graphics. 
A spokesperson for U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, R-Iowa, who served on the subcommittee that passed the bill, said the hubs are a “duplicative” program and the same research can be conducted through competitive agriculture research programs that are already funded by the federal government and supported by the House’s newest bill. 
The bill’s report shows it would terminate the funding for climate hubs and climate corps, which were initiated under former President Joe Biden to train young people for high-demand clean energy jobs. 
“The bill maintains critical funding to ensure we have the safest food, drugs, and devices in the world and puts America’s farmers, ranchers, and rural communities first,” the bill report reads. 
Hinson, in a statement, said “farmers felt like they were screaming into a void” as the the Biden administration “focused on DEI and radical climate policies” while farmers’ “real needs were ignored.” 
“This bill cuts wasteful spending – including for so-called “Climate Hubs” – and champions President Trump’s farmer-first agenda to strengthen longstanding research programs, support rural businesses and infrastructure, and safeguard our food supply,” Hinson said. “I will continue to support farmer-led conservation initiatives to ensure Iowa producers are empowered with conservation tools and have all the resources they need to feed and fuel the world.”
The House appropriations committee also tried to reject funding for the hubs in its FY25 budget bill, though the Senate’s version expanded funding for the program. Because Congress has failed to pass appropriations bills, the government has been operating on continuing spending resolutions based on the fiscal year 2024 budget.
The Senate passed the massive, budget reconciliation package, known as the “one big beautiful bill” Tuesday which sets mandatory spending over a 10-year span. The appropriations bills, like the House-proposed ag bill, are separate budgets that deal with discretionary spending in the agencies. 
Reports form the Hub
While the climate outlook reports are what many Midwest producers might know the hub for, the regional hubs also produced reports on the impacts of climate change, and mitigation strategies, on agriculture, forestry, tribal lands, wetlands and other region-specific areas.
Nowatzke said funding from the Inflation Reduction Act of the Biden administration helped the hub to “really chip away” at climate mitigation concerns and greenhouse gas emissions.
“So (the hub was) starting to move beyond just dealing with climate change or near-term weather events, but also addressing agriculture’s impact on climate change as well,” Nowatzke said. 
The Midwest Climate Hub produced reports like “Climate Change Impacts on Iowa Agriculture” and similar reports for eight Midwestern states. The reports calculated long-term changes in temperature, precipitation, growing season length and the impacts these have had, and are projected to have, on agriculture. 
Nowatzke said these reports also employed feedback from on-the-ground folks at extension offices, crop physiologists and farmers to determine the strategies that would be helpful for a farm trying to deal with a changing climate.  
The hub also explored, and produced reports on topics like: the relationship between climate change and specialty crops in the Midwest and a guide on managing the risks of field and equipment fires which are exacerbated by drought conditions. 
The hub, in collaboration with on Midwest Regional Climate Center, also reported and developed interactive tools for farmers on soil temperature and frost dates. 
Nowatzke said while the Climate Hub sits on a congressional chopping block, and has already dealt with cuts to staff and programs, most of the hub’s collaborating agencies have also been hit by federal cuts. 
She said without the hubs, this climate research at other agencies could persist, but she expects USDA would struggle in “delivering the science that they do, to the people that they’re developing the science for.” 
“Researchers serve a really important role in developing that work and publishing it, but also we need professionals who are trained and capable and have capacity to actually disseminate that in ways that people can use it,” Nowatzke said. 
Wenman said this is what she hears from other extension officers and producers who, while they might not use the term climate change, are seeking tools to help adapt to more extreme weather, drought patterns and other associated effects of a changing climate. Wenman said the hub information is “actionable” and the “stuff that really matters to people.” 
“Extension is trying to prepare our staff to better help farmers deal with the effects of changing climate conditions,” Wenman said. “Losing the hub would seriously hinder our ability to continue to do our jobs well within that realm.”

(Photo courtesy of Connecticut Harm Reduction Alliance, formerly known as Greater Hartford Harm Reduction Coalition)A study published Wednesday in the medical journal JAMA Network Open found that emergency room clinicians were much less likely to refer Black opioid overdose patients for outpatient treatment compared with white patients.
The researchers looked at the medical records of 1,683 opioid overdose patients from emergency rooms in nine states: California, Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Oregon and Pennsylvania.
About 5.7% of Black patients received referrals for outpatient treatment, compared with 9.6% of white patients, according to the researchers, who received a federal grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse to conduct the analysis.
States, hospital systems try less punitive drug testing of pregnant women and newborns

While the nation saw a decrease in opioid overdose deaths in white people between 2021 and 2022, overdose death rates increased for American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian, Black and Hispanic people. Patients visiting ERs for opioid overdoses are more likely to die from an overdose after the visit, the authors wrote, underscoring the importance of gaining “an improved understanding of disparities in [emergency department] treatment and referral.”
In total, roughly 18% of the patients received a referral for outpatient treatment, 43% received a naloxone kit or prescription, and 8.4% received a prescription for buprenorphine, the first-line medication for treating opioid use disorder.
The researchers used records from 10 hospital sites participating in a national consortium collecting data on overdoses from fentanyl and its related drugs. The patient records were from September 2020 to November 2023.
Another study in JAMA Network Open, released Thursday, found similar disparities: Black and Hispanic patients were significantly less likely than white patients to receive buprenorphine. Black patients had a 17% chance, and Hispanic patients a 16% chance, to be prescribed the therapy, compared with a 20% chance for white patients.
The authors of that study, from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, looked at data from 176,000 records of opioid-related events between 2017 and 2022 across all 50 states.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)The federal government’s program that gives payments to people sickened by nuclear weapons testing or uranium mining and milling — including in South Dakota — is one step closer to being reauthorized and expanded.
On Tuesday, Senate Republicans passed their massive tax and spending package, nicknamed the “big, beautiful bill” — among its many provisions is an expansion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, or RECA, which expired more than a year ago.
If the bill clears the final vote needed from the House, downwinders in all of Utah will now receive compensation for their medical bills, marking a significant change to the program that advocates say was too narrow to begin with.
People exposed to radiation from uranium mining and milling in South Dakota — primarily decades ago in the Edgemont area at the southern end of the Black Hills — were previously eligible for compensation and would remain eligible under the reauthorization. Seventy-nine claims from people residing in South Dakota have been awarded by the program since its inception, totaling $6.76 million.
Here are the RECA highlights, found in the final pages of the Senate’s 887-page bill:

Downwinders in all of Utah, New Mexico and Idaho would now be eligible for payments. Coverage would also be widened in Arizona to include all of Coconino, Yavapai, Navajo, Apache, Gila, and Mohave counties. Residents who lived in certain parts of Missouri, Tennessee, Alaska and Kentucky who were sickened due to the Manhattan Project would also receive coverage.
The program’s new expiration date would be Dec. 31, 2028.
In some cases, people who lived in affected areas for just one year would be eligible for compensation — the program previously required they live there at least two years.
The compensation amount — originally $50,000 to $75,000 — would be increased to $100,000 in most cases.
Uranium miners and workers based in Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Wyoming, South Dakota, Washington, Utah, Idaho, North Dakota, Oregon and Texas would be covered. The timeframe of eligibility would also be extended from 1971 to 1990.

“RECA is generational legislation for Missouri and will finally deliver justice for survivors in the St. Louis region,” said Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley, who sponsored the provision. “I call on the House to quickly pass this legislation and send it to President Trump’s desk.”
RECA expired in June 2024 after Congress failed to reauthorize it, and in the year since, downwinders who were just recently diagnosed with cancer or who didn’t know about the program were left without compensation.
The program had been in place since 1990, but downwinders have long said it should be expanded. Despite studies suggesting the entire West was blanketed by dangerous levels of radiation during nuclear tests, downwinders in just 10 counties in Utah, as well as a handful of counties in Nevada and Arizona, were covered.
News that RECA was one step closer to revival was met with mixed reactions on Tuesday from Utah downwinder Mary Dickson. A longtime advocate for RECA expansion, Dickson said it was “bittersweet” — if the bill passes the House, she’ll finally be eligible for coverage, after being diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 1985.
But Dickson and other advocates hoped a RECA expansion would be broader, covering all of Nevada, Arizona, Montana, Guam and other places impacted by Cold War weapons testing.
“Obviously I’m happy to see more downwinders covered. I’m very happy to see that. But I’m also heartsick to see that so many others that we’ve been fighting with in this battle for so long are left out,” she said. “It feels a bit like a hollow victory to me.”
Last year, Hawley sponsored a bill that would expand the program to cover much of the West, and parts of the St. Louis area, where creek water was contaminated by radiation during nuclear weapons development. The bill passed the Senate but stalled in the House, mostly over spending concerns.
It’s not yet clear whether RECA has the support needed in the House to withstand the final vote. The New York Times estimates that the current proposed expansion will cost about $7.7 billion.

Surtax spending gets ‘complicated’,Sam Drysdale // State House News Service,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/government/state-government/supplementing-or-supplanting-surtax-spending-gets-complicated/,"
The Legislature this week agreed to use nearly $500 million in surtax revenue to deliver a major boost to K-12 school funding, a move that some see as fulfilling the voter-approved mission of the tax on high earners while others warn it strays from the original promise of funding new education and transportation initiatives.
The post Supplementing or suppla[...]","THE LEGISLATURE this week agreed to use nearly $500 million in surtax revenue to deliver a major boost to K-12 school funding, a move that some see as fulfilling the voter-approved mission of the tax on high earners while others warn it strays from the original promise of funding new education and transportation initiatives.
The budget that lawmakers sent to Gov. Maura Healey’s desk Monday includes a $496 million expansion to the state’s Chapter 70 funding that provides education revenue for local school districts. The money is being drawn from revenue generated by the 4 percent surtax on annual income over $1 million, approved by voters in 2022 through a ballot question, also called the Fair Share Amendment.
That single line item (1596-2450) accounts for just more than 20 percent of the $2.4 billion in surtax spending lawmakers agreed to for the fiscal 2026 budget. It represents a shift in how that revenue is being used — and it has drawn mixed reactions even among the groups that campaigned for the surtax in the first place.
“This budget was crafted with concern over what is going on at the federal level,” Massachusetts Teachers Association President Max Page said, referring to anticipated cuts from Congress and President Donald Trump’s administration. Though the union previously warned against using surtax funds to replace routine and recurring education spending, Page said this year’s context made the decision more understandable.
“But, importantly, we certainly would hope that this much to fulfill the SOA wouldn’t be a part of next year’s budget,” he said, referring to the 2019 Student Opportunity Act, which is phasing in more than $1.5 billion in additional funding for districts over seven years. “The way it’s been working, which we really approve of, is the regular budget funds the SOA investments, and we can do new investments like higher minimum aid, universal school meals, capital fund investments, through Fair Share.”
The fiscal 2026 budget increases Chapter 70 funding by $460 million over the previous year, according to the Senate Ways and Means Committee — and funds that increase with surtax dollars. In addition to supporting the fifth year of SOA implementation, the $496 million line item for so-called SOA expansion also includes a sharp increase in minimum per-pupil aid, from $104 to $150.
In past budgets, similar increases to Chapter 70 were paid for through general state revenues. The shift this year raised red flags for those who view the surtax as a way to go above and beyond standard funding obligations.
“Voters overwhelmingly approved the Fair Share Amendment to enable new investments in public education and transportation — not to plug existing budget gaps,” said Bahar Akman Imboden, director of the Hildreth Institute, a research center focused on equity in higher education. She said she was “disappointed” to see nearly $500 million “being used to backfill” K-12 spending.
Imboden warned that reallocating surtax revenue to cover existing commitments could undermine recent progress in spending surtax dollars on higher education, which has included making community colleges free and financial aid expansions. 
Those initiatives are continued in this budget, but she warned, “without corresponding investments in campus capacity, student supports, and infrastructure, the gains we’ve made in encouraging more Massachusetts students to pursue higher education will falter.”
About 11 percent of the surtax revenue in the fiscal 2026 budget is allocated to higher education, according to the Hildreth Institute — a roughly $5 million decrease from the previous year. On average, higher education line items saw a 0.5 percent increase in the fiscal 2026 budget, the Institute noted.
In previous years, surtax funds have been used to launch major new programs like universal free school meals, fare-free Regional Transit Authorities and free community college for all Massachusetts residents. Those are continued in the fiscal 2026 budget. Groups who backed the surtax saw those programs as examples of using the money for “supplementing, not supplanting” existing spending on education and transportation through general revenue.
In the first budget cycle after the surtax passed, the MTA issued an analysis praising the Legislature’s approach.
“Importantly, Senate Ways and Means, the House and the governor use Fair Share Amendment revenue in the FY24 budget only for new programs and expenditures,” the union wrote. “Regular annual increases for state programs, including a $595 million increase for Chapter 70 and more than $62 million for Special Education Circuit Breaker, are funded out of general state revenue – not Fair Share revenue.”
This year’s decision breaks from that precedent. But a policy analyst from a think tank that backed the surtax campaign says the change was likely necessary in the face of economic uncertainty, tighter general revenues, and a difficult fiscal year for most school districts around the state.
“There are more new things you could do if you weren’t using so much of it for Chapter 70, so it’s hard to see in isolation. It’s complicated,” said Colin Jones, deputy policy director at the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center.
“But this year when we hear talk about things like the impact of the trade war, tariffs, the economy and the federal budget, they’re building flexibility with this maneuver to increase Fair Share to cover basically all of the Chapter 70 increase this year,” he said. “That frees up general funds to do other stuff. And flexibility in this environment is pretty good.”
The Raise Up Massachusetts coalition, which led the ballot campaign to pass the surtax, also defended the Legislature’s approach.
“The Constitution doesn’t allow specific appropriations in a ballot measure, so it gives the Legislature the ability to spend the money on the priorities that they choose, and we expect that those priorities may shift and evolve as time goes on,” said Andrew Farnitano, a spokesperson for the coalition.
Farnitano pointed to the strength of surtax revenue collections as a sign the funding stream can be relied upon for major investments. 
“The intention of the amendment was to give the state the resources to make these decisions and have these conversations through the budget process, where we have the resources that are necessary,” he said.
When asked about concerns over the volatility of surtax revenues — which depend on high-income earners  — Farnitano responded, “The evidence so far is showing that Fair Share revenues are very strong and can be counted upon.”
Indeed, the Department of Revenue reported in May that it had collected nearly $2.6 billion from the surtax between July 1, 2024 and April 30, 2025 — exceeding the total for all of fiscal 2024 with two months of fiscal 2025 still to be counted. Secretary of Administration and Finance Matthew Gorzkowicz has said total fiscal 2025 surtax collections could approach $3 billion.
Meanwhile, general tax collections have plateaued.
From the House floor Monday, House Ways and Means Chair Aaron Michlewitz made the case for moving Chapter 70 obligations into the surtax category.
“This shift will further limit any potential exposure with general fund revenue while holding to our commitment to fully fund the fifth year of the Student Opportunity Act,” he said. “This reduction in overall spending will better prepare the commonwealth for potential economic turmoil in the months ahead.”
Senate Ways and Means Chair Michael Rodrigues’ office also cited the unexpectedly high surtax receipts as a factor in the decision to expand its use. 
“In light of higher than initially estimated Fair Share collections, we felt comfortable increasing the conference amount to allow for transformative investments in education and transportation,” said Rodrigues spokesperson Sean Fitzgerald.
Still, critics worry about setting a precedent that allows baseline education costs to be paid for with what was pitched to voters as a tool for innovation.
“While we understand FY2026 presents fiscal challenges, Massachusetts has one of the strongest rainy day funds in the country; reserves that exist precisely to help us sustain progress during hard times,” Imboden said. “Now is the moment to honor the will of the voters and ensure that Fair Share dollars are used to move us forward, not simply to hold the line.”

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — LGBTQ+ supporters are relaunching a bipartisan advocacy group in an effort to provide a more centrist conversation amid increasingly hateful rhetoric. 
The Equality Network which launched last week aims to change the narrative surrounding LGBTQ+ legislation in an environment that has become “a form of tribalism and partisanship that we’ve never seen,” said Troy Stevenson, executive director of the network. 
By providing a more centrist conversation the network hopes to share the stories of LGBTQ+ Oklahomans and reach across the aisle to generate productive and informed conversation between lawmakers.
“So as Democrats and Republicans and independents …, we intend to move forward in that direction and make sure that we’re going out and having conversations and doing more listening than talking and doing more of everything than judging,” Stevenson said.
The Equality Network, which started in 2009, merged with the Cimarron Alliance Foundation to form Freedom Oklahoma in 2015. Stevenson previously led The Equality Network before launching Freedom Oklahoma to tackle a growing number of anti-LGQBT+ bills being filed in the Legislature.
The resurrected network is focused on presenting policy to the Legislature that contains research and data explaining the positive and negative impacts of the proposed legislation to help spur more informed conversation. 
Stevenson said their work in the upcoming session will focus on “making sure they don’t do anything horrible to our kids.”
Its membership is bipartisan, a move the group hopes will reshape the conversion.
Republican Labor Commissioner Leslie Osborn said her involvement in the network stems from her daughter, a member of the LGBTQ+ community, who moved to Canada because she felt unwelcome. 
“I don’t think that’s acceptable in America,” she said. “Who you love should never have been ingrained in a government issue or political issue.”
In recent years, Oklahoma has seen a growing number of anti-LGBTQ+ measures filed, which range from cracking down on the books children can access in school libraries that contain content regarding sexual sexual lifestyles to banning gender-affirming health care for minors and drag shows in public.
Rep. Andy Fugate, D-Oklahoma City, said the core of the network “is about personal freedom, freedom from intolerance, freedom from big government intrusion into someone’s personal life.” 
“Love is love, and people should be free to be their own authentic selves, without big brother government interfering in that life,” he said.
Composed of a two-member staff, The Equality Network, which will be based in Oklahoma City, does not have a finalized budget yet, however, it intends to work with other LGTBQ+ foundations for funding.
Stevenson said they are partnering with Oklahomans for Equality in hopes to host town hall meetings across Oklahoma. 
Oklahomans For Equality did not return messages seeking comment.
Nicole McAfee, executive director of Freedom Oklahoma, said they weren’t familiar with the relaunch of The Equality Network.
“There’s always room for more folks fighting for 2SLGBTQ+ liberation in and beyond the Oklahoma Capitol.” McAfee said. “We’re excited to connect with folks seeking new opportunities to engage in the process.”

(Getty Images)TOPEKA — An examination of Sedgwick County’s bail system found practices that exacerbate inequality within the criminal justice system, leading advocates to request change.
A key finding from a recently released report from the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas revealed that the county’s bail system “penalizes poverty, perpetuates racial disparities, and undermines the presumption of innocence.”
The report found that the money bail system in Sedgwick County, home to Wichita, results in many people who haven’t yet been convicted of a crime spending more time in jail because they can’t afford to pay for their release ahead of a trial.
Lindsay Callender, a policy associate with the ACLU of Kansas, said pretrial jail time should be reserved for ensuring court appearances, preventing harm to the public and avoiding judicial interference.
“But instead, many people spend up to months behind bars awaiting trial for low-level, nonviolent offenses simply because they can’t post bond, regardless of their guilt or innocence,” Callender said in a news release.
Judges in Kansas often apply bail uniformly, the report said, without consideration for individual circumstances.
The report urged judges to set bonds, the conditions of a person’s release on bail, based not on a set schedule but on individual assessments of flight risk, the danger to the public and financial standing.
The average total bond amount for people charged with crimes in Sedgwick County is more than $104,000, while the average income is less than $90,000. The median income is lower at around $66,000.
The median bond amount for people facing nonviolent charges in Sedgwick County is $1,500, which the report said can be burdensome for low-income groups.
The report found that Sedgwick County’s bail system mostly punishes people accused of committing nonviolent crimes, making up about 84% of all charges awaiting trial. More than half of those charges were tied to procedural violations, which the ACLU attributed to issues of poverty or substance use. Around 15% of the nonviolent charges were drug-related.
Men make up the majority of the population in the Sedgwick County jail. Black individuals make up around one-third of the jail population and about 9% of the county’s general population.
The report said the racial and gender inequalities “in Sedgwick County’s bail system are extreme even by standards of the American justice system.”
It continued: “Black individuals are more likely to be charged, held on bail, held longer, and held on higher amounts. Women, who make up just over a quarter of the incarcerated population, face distinct and compounded hardships, from financial strain to exacerbated mental health challenges.”
A majority of Kansas voters that the ACLU polled statewide in 2023 expressed concern about inequalities in the state’s criminal legal system. More than half of those polled said the system carries “different standards of justice for the rich and the poor.”
Micah Kubic, executive director of the ACLU of Kansas, said the issues within Sedgwick County’s bail system didn’t come from nowhere. It is directly tied to “decades of over-policing, surveillance, and disinvestment in vulnerable neighborhoods,” Kubic said.
Bail policy is set by statute in Kansas, leaving change up to legislators. A small handful of states have abolished commercial bail bonds, including Nebraska, and others have implemented reforms, which can include personal recognizance bonds. Those allow someone charged with a crime to be released from jail before a trial, but it is dependent on the person showing up for court.
The report suggested the Sedgwick County District Attorney, whose office did not respond to requests for comment, issue a memo requiring its staff to seek personal recognizance bonds for all defendants charged with crimes that don’t involve other people. Assault, murder and rape would be exempt for this requirement, and the report recommends the office tailor any cash bail amounts to the individual’s circumstances, including ability to pay.
Kubic said elected officials have an opportunity to alleviate cycles of harm within Sedgwick County’s bail system.
“Sedgwick County’s money bail system causes financial destruction, employment disruption, and strain on familial relationships that lead to broader socioeconomic consequences for communities — and it makes all of us less safe,” Kubic said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Scales-of-justice-1024x683-1.jpeg,,,2025-07-02 15:09:11.119681

(Photo by Chloe Bennett-Steele/StateImpact Oklahoma)In Norman, scientists are working to significantly speed up tornado warnings while finding new paths to understanding deadly storms and protecting lives and property. A cooperative institute with more than 220 employees is studying ways to update weather radar facilities, investigate the dynamics of severe storms and more.
But the years-long research projects are at risk of termination under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) most recent budget estimate.
A document published Monday details the deep funding cuts to the nation’s leading weather and climate agency, which would result in the termination of the National Severe Storms Lab (NSSL) and the University of Oklahoma’s Cooperative Institute for Severe and High-Impact Weather Research and Operations (CIWRO).
StateImpact previously reported that the Trump administration sought to eliminate NOAA’s research arm, which includes the NSSL. The new budget is a detailed version of the passback document released in April. A request for comment from U.S. Rep. Tom Cole, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, went unanswered. U.S. Sen. Markwayne Mullin also did not respond.
In a statement, a spokesperson for Sen. James Lankford said he would continue to monitor the budget request during the appropriations process.
“Senator Lankford believes NOAA and the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman do essential work in early detection, forecasting and research,” the spokesperson said in an email.
The latest plan states that a fraction of NSSL research funds would be funneled to the National Weather Service. It’s unclear whether the weather service would use the money for continued research or to cover operational costs.
Two large research projects led by the NSSL would be terminated. The Warn-on-Forecast is creating a system to increase tornado warning lead times, which are usually just a few minutes long. In 2024, the program resulted in a 75-minute lead for residents in Iowa.
The VORTEX USA project is a collaboration between meteorologists and social scientists to determine why tornadoes in the Southeast are more deadly than in other places. The program began in 2015, primarily developed by the NSSL.
“NOAA will evaluate options for supporting these specific activities within the NWS in the future,” the document reads.
Climate research and public information 
The budget request would terminate funding for many organizations focused on climate, weather and oceans. In Norman, the Southern Climate Impacts Planning Program works with communities on hazard mitigation plans. The documents are usually stepping stones to getting federal funds after a natural disaster.
The program, located within the National Weather Center, is funded by NOAA grants and would likely be eliminated under the budget proposal.
Climate change is widely targeted throughout the budget request to recenter the agency’s focus on weather, according to the document. But meteorologists say the cuts will likely also disrupt scientists’ understanding of naturally occurring weather patterns.
“By eliminating climate research, we’re eliminating a lot of research that is separate from climate change and has direct societal benefits, like better understanding the El Niño, La Niña phenomenon, being able to understand how to make longer-range monthly to seasonal outlooks,” said Alan Gerard, meteorologist and former NSSL employee. “All of that benefits agriculture, benefits business.”
The news came the same day the website that hosts The National Climate Assessment shut down. The report includes details on how local communities are impacted by warming temperatures and other effects of human-caused climate change.
Both changes reflect the Trump administration’s efforts to eliminate federally funded work on climate research.
The final budget will be decided by Congress, which has until the end of September to vote on the spending or provide interim funds for an extension.

Kay Ivey’s office said Wednesday it plans to name a member of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles within the next few days, whether or not that’s Chair Leigh Gwathney.
“The governor is in receipt of the list of nominations. She is reviewing and will make a determination by the Monday deadline,” Gina Maiola, a spokesperson for the governor, said in a statement Wednesday.
Gwathney’s fate has become the subject of public contention, with the board’s falling level of parole grants and responsiveness to the Legislature at the center of the discussion.
In a letter released Tuesday, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall and several sheriffs and prosecutors praised Gwathney and urged Gov. Kay Ivey to reappoint her to another term amid concerns from civil rights groups about declining parole rates and attempts to flaunt oversight from the Legislature.
“Reappointing Leigh Gwathney is about more than leadership — it’s about protecting Alabama families from violent criminals and honoring the voices of victims who too often go unheard,” the letter said. “Ms. Gwathney has never lost sight of what’s at stake: the safety of our citizens and the dignity of those who have suffered at the hands of violent offenders.”
Ivey will choose from a list of candidates submitted by the lieutenant governor, the speaker of the Alabama House of Representatives and the Alabama Senate president pro tempore.
Marshall, as well as sheriffs, police chiefs and prosecutors, commended Gwathney’s commitment to public safety.
“More importantly, her willingness to continue to serve in the face of unprecedented and unwarranted criticism by the liberal media shows a level of courage, conviction, and dedication to the cause that is rarely seen in Montgomery,” Marshall said in the letter. “Ms. Gwathney has earned the trust and respect of law enforcement, prosecutors, and crime victims across our state, all of whom now have a stake in seeing her reappointed.”
Gwathney was appointed to the board in 2019 after the Legislature made a series of changes to parole laws following the 2017 release of Jimmy O’Neal Spencer. Spencer, who was misclassified in the system, was convicted and sentenced to death in 2022 of murdering three people during a series of robberies in 2018. The victims included a 7-year-old child. The Legislature enacted a law that set stricter rules and regulations for applicants to be granted parole, especially if they commit violent offenses.
Parole rates have plummeted under Gwathney’s tenure, going from more than 50% in 2017 to 8% in 2023 before increasing to about 26% in 2025.
Criminal justice advocates have criticized the parole board for declining parole rates and not adhering to parole guidelines. The guidelines, though not binding on the board, are meant to serve as a guide for the parole board to follow when making parole determinations.
Along with the declining parole rates, the conformance rate, the frequency with which the parole board follows the guidelines, has also declined to the point that members’ decisions align with the parole guidelines only about a quarter of the time.
At an October meeting of the Joint Prison Oversight Committee, Gwathney struggled to answer direct questions about the parole guidelines and the board’s apparent lack of conformance with them when determining parole.
Over the past year, several lawmakers proposed legislation aimed at reforming the parole board, even going as far as to make funding for the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles contingent on the members adopting updated parole guidelines as required by the law.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Parole_Board_002-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-02 15:09:11.119681

Josh Schriver (R-Oxford) on the House floor on May 1, 2025. | Kyle DavidsonIn Michigan, where voters in 2022 approved enshrining the right to an abortion into the state constitution, legislation that would classify elective abortions as homicide has been introduced.
Last week, Michigan state Rep. Josh Schriver (R-Oxford) introduced House Bills 4670 and 4671 to create the “justice for babies in the womb act”. The bill aims to adjust all definitions in assault, assault and battery, and homicide cases to apply to “an unborn child in the same manner as they would if the victim were an individual who had been born alive”.
The proposed legislation, which was referred to the House Judiciary Committee, seeks to extend legal personhood to fetuses and fertilized embryos and would allow for women who receive abortions to be charged with homicide. 
The bills would be unlikely to pass through Michigan’s Democratic-led Senate which has approved several measures to implement the constitutional right to reproductive health care, including abortions. However, the legislation has been applauded by anti-abortion advocates, including former Planned Parenthood clinic director turned anti-abortion activist Abby Johnson whose story is the premise of the 2019 movie “Unplanned”.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Another equal protection bill has been introduced in Michigan by @JoshuaSchriver and needs your support!,” Johnson posted on “X”. “It’s time to make our voices heard!!! Abortion is murder! I am proud to support Michigan house bills 4670/4671.”
The bills outline that the unintentional death of a fetus or fertilized embryo would not be subject to the outlined criminal penalties if it were the result of “a life‐saving procedure to save the life of the mother if accompanied by reasonable steps to save the life of the unborn child.”
The Foundation to Abolish Abortion applauded the bills’ introduction in a news release this week with the president of the foundation, Bradley Pierce calling the bills’ “righteous legislation”.
“House Bill 4671 is the first legislation in Michigan state history that would establish equal protection of the laws for preborn children,” Pierce said. “This bill would simply make murdering anyone illegal for everyone, in recognition that preborn babies are image-bearers of God and are just as worthy of legal protection as people who have already been born.
Since 57% of Michigan voters approved the constitutional amendment to add the right to reproductive health care including abortions to the state constitution, there have been unconstitutional efforts to subvert that decision, Chief External Affairs Officer at Planned Parenthood Advocates of Michigan Ashlea Phenicie said in a statement Wednesday.
 “In 2022, Michiganders voted in record numbers to permanently enshrine reproductive freedom into our state constitution… Bills like HB4671 are just empty political grandstanding pushed by anti-abortion extremists who are out-of-step with Michiganders’ values,” Phenicie said. “While it’s unlikely to pass into law, it proves yet again how committed they are to defying the will of voters to control our bodies, lives, and futures.”
Several other states, including Georgia, Indiana, North Dakota and Texas have introduced bills in the same vein.
A request for comment was made by Michigan Advance to Schriver, but has yet to be returned. 
The bills are just the latest attempt by Schriver at rolling back constitutional protections. Earlier this year, he proposed a resolution urging the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn its 2015 decision legalizing same-sex marriage, an effort that ended ignominiously when state Sen. Jeremy Moss (D-Southfield), the first openly gay member of the Michigan Senate, crashed Schriver’s press conference and ended up holding an impromptu session with reporters when Schriver stormed out.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1340-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-02 15:09:11.119681

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Provisions in the new tax and spending bill passed by the U.S. Senate early Tuesday would go even further than the House bill in removing health care and other benefits from immigrants with legal status.
The House version of the massive tax and spending bill penalized states providing health care for some immigrants with legal status as well as those that chose to spend state money to enroll immigrants without legal status in Medicaid.
But the Senate bill is even tougher on immigrants here legally and illegally, reducing benefits for most refugees and immigrants on humanitarian parole, including Afghans and Ukrainians who helped the United States in wars overseas and in return were promised safe haven and a safety net in the United States.
The Senate bill also cuts state reimbursement for emergency care in the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That would force those states to pay more for emergency care for immigrants, cut back services or drop out of Medicaid expansion, a potentially catastrophic move for low-income U.S. citizens as well as new immigrants.
The bill passed with three dissenting Republican votes, from U.S. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Vice President JD Vance broke the tie. The bill, officially the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” now returns to the House for final passage before going to President Donald Trump to be signed.
States face hard choices as budgets expected to tighten

Advocates and experts see repercussions as refugees and other legal immigrants lose health insurance and turn to already-stressed hospitals and charities for help. It could be a nail in the coffin for some rural hospitals that are in financial trouble and scaling back services. Hospitals are required to serve anyone who arrives for emergency care, regardless of their ability to pay.
“In our state, it’s going to be absolutely devastating for rural hospitals,” said Kate Woomer-Deters, a senior attorney at the North Carolina Justice Center’s Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Refugees are not going to go home just because they lost their health care coverage. They’re still going to be showing up at the door of hospitals and clinics needing care.”
Some groups, such as Afghans, Ukrainians and Iraqis, were often brought here after helping the U.S. in war efforts, putting their lives in danger and making life in their home country untenable.
“In the case of the Afghans, this is pretty much a knife in the back to those folks who helped the United States when the United States needed help in their country,” said David Meyer, a board member of the Bloomington Refugee Support Network in Indiana, where he personally helps seven refugee families from Afghanistan, Honduras, Iraq, Nicaragua and Syria.
The Senate bill takes Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and even food stamps off the table for most refugees. There are a few narrow exceptions for people with green cards, some Cuban migrants waiting for citizenship, and some Micronesians and Marshall Islands natives with treaty rights, said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
That also applies to immigrants with legal status who don’t have green cards: people with asylum, immigrant victims of domestic violence, immigrant victims of sex trafficking and parolees — such as Afghans — admitted due to urgent humanitarian reasons, as well as to refugees.










It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.


– Shelby Gonzales, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities


“There’s going to be more emergency health care needs because uninsured people will be delaying care,” Gonzales said. “It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.”
The bill also cuts funding for expansion states to pay for emergency care in hospitals. Increased costs could force some states to drop Medicaid expansion altogether, spreading the pain to low-income U.S. citizens as well, Gonzales said.
“It’s one more reason states are looking at their budgets and they’re having to make decisions about their Medicaid expansion program,” Gonzales said.
In Indiana, Meyer said, Afghan women especially often need food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to get by at first. It takes them a long time to learn to read and write since they were not allowed to attend any school under the Taliban.
“They arrived in our community totally illiterate in their native language and starting from scratch learning English, so that’s a huge impediment to being gainfully employed,” Meyer said. Even once they’ve become self-sufficient enough to get off food stamps and Medicaid, many still need the support of the Affordable Care Act to get health care.
Removing all subsidized health care “would have a devastating effect on those families, and not just Afghans but Syrians, people from the Democratic Republic of Congo and others that have been relocated to south-central Indiana,” Meyer said.
‘Big Beautiful Bill’ dings states that offer health care to some immigrants here legally

Indiana hosted more than 10,500 of the nearly 460,000 refugees who arrived in the United States between 2013 and 2023, according to a 2023 report from the nonprofit Immigration Research Initiative. In fiscal 2024, another 1,380 arrived in Indiana, mostly from Congo and Burma, but including 90 people from Afghanistan, according to State Department records.
In North Carolina, there were 276 new Afghan refugees in fiscal 2024 among 2,730 total new refugees. Even professional Afghans such as doctors and lawyers struggle at first in low-wage jobs, said Woomer-Deters, of the North Carolina Justice Center. It takes time for them to get accreditation and language skills to practice their professions here, she said.
“A lot of these folks need their food stamps, Medicaid — they need these programs for an adjustment period when they get here. And these are people we’ve invited to come and have vetted,” she said.
A Congressional Budget Office report June 29 estimated that almost 12 million people, including 1.4 million immigrants covered by state-only programs, would lose health insurance under the Senate plan.
A Republican response to an earlier CBO report emphasized that the bill would save states $13.1 billion in Medicaid spending over 10 years, “freeing up resources they can choose to reinvest to further strengthen care for the most vulnerable Americans.”
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, however, called that conclusion misleading in its own response in turn.
“These savings would largely result from millions of people losing health coverage — hardly an outcome worth celebrating,” the response said.
More states offer health care coverage for certain immigrants, noncitizens

Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, said there was one small positive change in the Senate version compared to the House version.
States will no longer be penalized for using the option to cover some immigrant children and pregnant women.
And the Senate version would not penalize expansion states for offering Medicaid to immigrants on humanitarian parole, but only because that help for parolees was ended in entirely, along with help for refugees and other kind of immigrants with legal status who lack green cards, Cuello said.
“In other words, they are blocking all paths to health care,” Cuello said in an emailed statement. “This is not an attack on the undocumented. It’s an attack on lawfully present immigrants.”

According to the Iowa Board of Behavioral Health Professionals, Giovanni Demezier of Davenport was issued an Iowa mental health counselor’s license in May 2021.
The board alleges Demezier began providing counseling services to a female patient, identified in board records as T.S., in January 2024. The counseling sessions took place in the patient’s home and at some point during the counseling relationship, Demezier allegedly initiated a sexual relationship with the patient.
According to the board, the patient alleges that after the two engaged in sexual relations, Demezier told her he needed to switch her from counseling to coaching services and had her sign a new contract for such services — implying that this made their sexual relationship permissible.

T.S. later became pregnant and believes Demezier is the father. Demezier allegedly provided money to T.S. to terminate the pregnancy, but it was too late for such a procedure once she discovered she was pregnant, according to the board.
The board states that Demezier was interviewed and admitted to having sexual contact with T.S.
Court records indicate Demezier worked for Davenport’s QC Counselor at the time of the alleged relationship. Police records indicate T.S. provided police with screenshots of text conversations with Demezier that included references to sexual activity, a pregnancy, and the change in their relationship from counselor to coach.
The police records also indicate QC Counselor said, in response to a subpoena, that Demezier had left the company on Aug. 21, 2024, and that he had retained all client records upon his departure.
On May 14, 2025, police executed a search warrant at Demezier’s residence and seized a laptop computer from his home office. The laptop was then sent to Johnson County Joint Forensic Analysis Cyber Team in Coralville for forensic examination.
No criminal charges have been filed in the case.
Board: Advances made toward second patient 
The Board of Behavioral Health Professionals also alleges that in 2021, Demezier began counseling services with a previous client, M.R., via telehealth sessions.
Approximately two years into the counseling relationship, Demezier introduced the idea of switching M.R. from counseling to coaching, claiming it would be more affordable, according to the board.
On Aug. 2, 2023, the patient became a client of Demezier’s private practice, after which Demezier allegedly encouraged her to communicate with him more frequently via his personal cellphone. According to the board, Demezier assured M.R. the rules were different given their new coaching relationship.
According to the board, M.R. claims that on Oct. 28, 2024, Demezier initiated a sexual conversation with her via text message. “The patient felt scared, trapped, and intimidated by the situation and the sexual comments” made by Demezier, the board alleges. She terminated the relationship with Demezier via email message on Oct. 31, 2024.
In connection with the allegations involving T.S. and M.R, the board has charged Demezier with improper sexual contact with a patient or making suggestive or lewd remarks or advances to a patient; failure to comply with a national code of ethics, and engaging in sexual activities or sexual contact with a client.
The board recently concluded Demezier had engaged in sexual contact with a client and engaged in improper sexual behavior toward a second client, making him “an immediate danger to the public health, safety and welfare.”
As a result, the board has issued an emergency order immediately suspending his license. Additional action may be taken after a hearing on the charges has been held.

(Photo by Robin Bravender/States Newsroom)Justice Department attorneys told a federal district judge Tuesday that the Trump administration will not impose proposed restrictions on birthright citizenship for a month — but that it reserves the right to “immediately” start planning for that day.
The two-page notice was filed in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt, Maryland, in response to District Judge Deborah Boardman’s demand a day earlier to know “if the government thinks that it can start removing children from the United States who are subject to the terms of the executive order.”
It is the latest twist in a months-long legal battle over an executive order signed by President Donald Trump on Jan. 21, his first day back in office, that sought to deny citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. unless at least one of their parents was a citizen or a permanent legal resident.
Historically, “birthright” citizenship has been granted to anyone born on U.S. soil, regardless of their parent’s status. But Trump claimed in his executive order that that was a misinterpretation of the law, which he claimed was never intended to apply to everyone.

The order was almost immediately challenged in court by groups that said birthright citizenship is a bedrock of U.S democracy, and that denying citizenship to a child born here could make the child stateless altogether. Judges in three different districts, including Boardman, agreed and issued nationwide injunctions to block the order.
The government appeal focused on whether the district court judges had the authority to impose a nationwide ban on the order. In a 6-3 ruling Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed that the judges should not have extended the injunction beyond those people and groups that brought the suits.
But the high court’s ruling noted that a class-action suit could apply nationally. That’s why the plaintiffs in the Maryland case — CASA, the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project at 15 women who are pregnant or new mothers — were back in court Monday, seeking to get their suit certified as a class action suit for all undocumented parents and their babies.
The Supreme Court sent the cases back to the district court, but also set July 27 as the earliest date the administration can apply the executive order, to allow time for the cases to be reheard. On Monday, Boardman ordered Trump’s attorneys to clarify in writing the government’s view of what it can do under the executive order, and when.
Trump’s attorneys agreed in the filing that the earliest date the administration would apply the order is, in fact, July 27. But the the court’s ruling also provided for a 30-day ramp-up period, the notice said.
“The Court’s stay thus allows Defendants to immediately begin to ‘develop[] and issu[e] public guidance about the Executive’s plans to implement the Executive Order,’” the filing reads.
Boardman also gave Trump’s lawyers until July 7 to file a response to the plaintiffs’ motion to turn the case into a class action lawsuit.

The lawsuit says federal agents are stopping people only for being Latino, placing them in ‘deplorable conditions’ and not allowing them to speak with an attorney. 



A lawsuit filed Wednesday by civil and immigration rights groups accuses federal authorities of unleashing an unconstitutional siege by snatching workers and U.S. citizens off Southern California streets and denying them food, water and the right to speak with an attorney. 
The federal class action lawsuit aims to immediately stop immigration agents from conducting military-style raids across L.A. that prioritize “numbers, pure numbers,” according to the complaint. It also seeks to get access to counsel for those arrested who are now being held in overcrowded “dungeon-like” facilities where the conditions are deplorable and unconstitutional, the filing says.  
Federal agents in combat gear, some masked and armed with rifles, have stormed swap meets, car washes, bus stops, and churches since early June, grabbing people off sidewalks and dragging away mothers, workers, day laborers, and U.S. citizens without explanation, the complaint alleges. Civil rights groups, led by the American Civil Liberties Union, say the raids have been part of an illegal mass-arrest campaign driven by the Trump administration’s nationwide deportation quota policy. 
“Such seizures look less like lawful arrests and more like brazen, midday kidnappings,” the lawsuit states.  
In late May, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller issued a directive to Immigration and Customs Enforcement to make 3,000 immigration-related arrests every day, and stated there would be “consequences for not hitting arrest targets,” the lawsuit says, referencing a story in the Wall Street Journal. 
“Since early June, this District has been under siege,” the complaint states. The lawsuit is brought by the ACLU, Public Counsel, and Immigrant Defenders Law Center, among others. It names Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other top officials from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Border Patrol, and the FBI as defendants. 
DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the raids have been “highly targeted.”
“Any claims that individuals have been ‘targeted’ by law enforcement because of their skin color are disgusting and categorically FALSE,” she wrote in an email. “These type (sic) of smears are designed to demonize and villainize our brave ICE law enforcement. This kind of garbage has led to a more than 700 percent increase in the assaults on enforcement officers. Politicians, activists, and “journalists” must turn the temperature down and tone down their rhetoric.”
Federal officials made similar claims about similar raids conducted in Kern County in January. After the ACLU challenged the raids in court, a federal judge later found they likely violated the Constitution’s ban on unreasonable searches, issuing a preliminary injunction banning those raids in the Central Valley. 
The new suit makes the same arguments about the Los Angeles raids. 
‘They don’t care if you have papers’ 
Filed on behalf of five individuals and four advocacy groups, including the United Farm Workers, the filing documents a sprawling crackdown that has targeted dozens of locations across Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura, and Santa Barbara counties, terrorizing mostly Latino neighborhoods in the process. Among those locations are at least 15 Home Depot parking lots, nine car washes, a Santa Ana park, a swap meet in Santa Fe Springs, and several churches. 
The suit argues that agents are detaining people solely based on their race, clothing or occupation, which would be a violation of the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and the Fifth Amendment guarantees of due process. 
“They don’t care if you have papers, as long as you look like what they want you to look like, they’ll take you,” recalled one witness who saw agents take away a dark-skinned man who only spoke Spanish from the Downey Memorial Christian Church on June 11. 
Another witness said she saw federal agents pulling people from the bathrooms during a military-style raid at a popular Los Angeles swap meet with 60 heavily armed agents. Videos taken from the scene of that crackdown show armed agents dressed in camouflage, some of whom wore masks concealing their identities. Border Patrol made a video boasting about its actions there. 
“If you looked Hispanic in any way, they just took you,” the witness said, according to the complaint. 
In Culver City, agents descended on a car wash on June 8 dressed in either camouflage fatigues or plainclothes, driving unmarked cars. One witness saw an agent carrying an assault rifle while running after a customer across a four-lane road. Other terrified customers shouted, “Don’t shoot!” In Westchester, that same day, armed agents in camouflage and helmets tackled a fruit vendor to the ground, according to the suit. 
In Orange County, on June 6, agents surrounded and questioned Latino men painting a house while ignoring white neighbors in nearby yards. 
U.S. citizens taken
Among those detained was Heidi Plummer, a U.S. citizen who got caught up in an immigration raid while taking a walk through a park in Santa Ana on June 14. She was handcuffed, put in a vehicle with others, and taken to a station and held for an hour and a half before she was released, the complaint states. 
Andrea Velez, another U.S. citizen, was being dropped off at work in downtown Los Angeles when she was grabbed without explanation and without anyone asking her for her identification. Her mother, who witnessed the attack, said it looked like “they’re kidnapping her.” 
“The only thing wrong with her … was the color of her skin,” said her mother, according to the lawsuit. 
The plaintiffs in the lawsuit allege federal agents have no prior information about the people they’re detaining, nor any warrants. They allege the agents are arresting people without considering whether or not they pose a flight risk before a warrant can be obtained, in violation of federal law. They also claim the agents are not identifying themselves or telling people why they’re being arrested, also in violation of federal law. 
Detention ‘conditions are deplorable and unconstitutional’ 
ICE detention capacity is buckling under the surge in arrests, causing the agency to hold people in a basement area in Los Angeles known as “B-18.” The basement is meant to be a short-term processing center for ICE, but now people are facing prolonged confinement there without access to attorneys, according to the complaint. The Immigration and Nationality Act says people have the right to call an attorney while in immigration detention. 
There, detainees have reported having little access to food or water. They say the holding areas have been so crowded that there hasn’t been space to sit or lay down. 
“In these dungeon-like facilities, conditions are deplorable and unconstitutional,” the complaint states. Facing the awful conditions at that site and others, some people have been pressured into accepting “voluntary departure,” the complaint says, which helps federal authorities continue to arrest more people. 
McLaughlin, the assistant secretary for Homeland Security, denied the accusations in the lawsuit about conditions inside ICE facilities. 
“Any claim that there are subprime conditions at ICE detention centers are false. In fact, ICE has higher detention standards than most U.S. prisons that hold actual U.S. citizens,” McLaughlin said.
McLaughlin said all detainees are provided proper meals that are certified by dieticians, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with lawyers and family members.   
“This is the best healthcare that many aliens have received in their entire lives,” she added. 
The 65-page complaint asks the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles to block federal immigration agents from continuing the raids, declare their tactics unconstitutional, and allow access to counsel for those who have been swept up and detained. 
“Despite the fear and risks associated with speaking publicly,” the lawsuit says, the plaintiffs are “taking courageous action to enforce the rule of law.” 
The organizations that are part of the lawsuit are: the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, the Los Angeles Worker Center Network, United Farm Workers and the Immigrant Defenders Law Center. The legal team includes attorneys from the ACLU of Southern California, ACLU NorCal, LA-based Public Counsel, and UC Irvine School of Law Immigrant and Racial Justice Solidarity Clinic.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/062025_ICE-Raid_GETTY_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-02 14:15:00.102493

This story was originally published by ProPublica. 
One summer day in 2017, a front-page story in the StarNews of Wilmington, North Carolina, shook up the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. The drinking water system, it said, was polluted with a contaminant commonly known as GenX, part of the family of “forever” PFAS chemicals.
It came from a Chemours plant in Fayetteville, near the winding Cape Fear River. Few knew about the contaminated water until the article described the discoveries of scientists from the Environmental Protection Agency and a state university. Given that certain types of PFAS have been linked to cancer, there was widespread anxiety over its potential danger.
In the onslaught of legal action and activism that followed, the EPA during President Donald Trump’s first term took an assertive stance, vowing to combat the spread of PFAS nationwide.
In its big-picture PFAS action plan from 2019, the agency said it would attack this complex problem on multiple fronts. It would, for example, consider limiting the presence of two of the best-known compounds — PFOA and PFOS — in drinking water. And, it said, it would find out more about the potential harm of GenX, which was virtually unregulated.
By the time Trump was sworn in for his second term, many of the plan’s suggestions had been put in place. After his first administration said PFOA and PFOS in drinking water should be regulated, standards were finalized under President Joe Biden. Four other types of PFAS, including GenX, were also tagged with limits.
But now, the second Trump administration is pulling back. The EPA said in May that it will delay enforcement on the drinking water limits for PFOA and PFOS until 2031, and it will rescind and reconsider the limits on the other four. Among those who challenged the standards in court is Chemours, which has argued that the EPA, under Biden, “used flawed science and didn’t follow proper rulemaking procedures” for GenX.
These EPA decisions under Trump are part of a slew of delays and course changes to PFAS policies that had been supported in his first term. Even though his earlier EPA pursued a measure that would help hold polluters accountable for cleaning up PFAS, the EPA of his second term has not yet committed to it. The agency also slowed down a process for finding out how industries have used the chemicals, a step prompted by a law signed by Trump in 2019.
At the same time, the EPA is hampering its ability to research pollutants — the kind of research that made it possible for its own scientists to investigate GenX. As the Trump administration seeks severe reductions in the EPA’s budget, the agency has terminated grants for PFAS studies and paralyzed its scientists with spending restrictions.
Pointing to earlier announcements on its approach to the chemicals, the EPA told ProPublica that it’s “committed to addressing PFAS in drinking water and ensuring that regulations issued under the Safe Drinking Water Act follow the law, follow the science, and can be implemented by water systems to strengthen public health protections.”
“If anything,” the agency added, “the Trump administration’s historic PFAS plan in 2019 laid the groundwork for the first steps to comprehensively address this contamination across media and we will continue to do so this term.”
In public appearances, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has pushed back on the suggestion that his agency weakened the drinking water limits on GenX and similar compounds. Future regulations imposed by his agency, he said, could be more or less stringent.
“What we want to do is follow the science, period,” he has said.
That sentiment perplexes scientists and environmental advocates, who say there is already persuasive evidence on the dangers of these chemicals that linger in the environment. The EPA reviewed GenX, for example, during both the first Trump and Biden administrations. In both 2018 and 2021, the agency pointed to animal studies linking it to cancer, as well as problems with kidneys, immune systems and, especially, livers. (Chemours has argued that certain animal studies have limited relevance to humans.)
Scientists and advocates also said it’s unclear what it means for the EPA to follow the science while diminishing its own ability to conduct research.
“I don’t understand why we would want to hamstring the agency that is designed to make sure we have clean air and clean water,” said Jamie DeWitt, a toxicologist in Oregon who worked with other scientists on Cape Fear River research. “I don’t understand it.”
Delays, confusion over PFAS
Favored for their nonstick and liquid-resistant qualities, synthetic PFAS chemicals are widely used in products like raincoats, cookware and fast food wrappers. Manufacturers made the chemicals for decades without disclosing how certain types are toxic at extremely low levels, can accumulate in the body and will scarcely break down over time — hence the nickname “forever chemicals.”
Without explanation, EPA restores some grants for PFAS research in Maine

The chemicals persist in soil and water too, making them complicated and costly to clean up, leading to a yearslong push to get such sites covered by the EPA’s Superfund program, which is designed to handle toxic swaths of land. During the first Trump administration, the EPA said it was taking steps toward designating the two legacy compounds, PFOA and PFOS, as “hazardous substances” under the Superfund program. Its liability provisions would help hold polluters responsible for the cost of cleaning up.
Moving forward with this designation process was a priority, according to the PFAS plan from Trump’s first term. Zeldin’s EPA describes that plan as “historic.” And, when he represented a Long Island district with PFAS problems in Congress, Zeldin voted for a bill that would have directed the EPA to take this step.
The designation became official under Biden. But business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and organizations representing the construction, recycling and chemical industries, sued. Project 2025, The Heritage Foundation’s playbook for the new administration, also questioned it.
Zeldin has said repeatedly that he wants to hold polluters accountable for PFAS, but his EPA requested three delays in the court case challenging the Superfund designation that helps make it possible.
The agency said in a recent motion it needed the latest pause because new leadership is still reviewing the issues and evaluating the designation in context of its “comprehensive strategy to address PFOA and PFOS.”
The EPA also delayed a rule requiring manufacturers and importers to report details about their PFAS use between 2011 and 2022. An annual bill that sets defense policy and spending, signed by Trump in his first term, had charged the EPA with developing such a process.
When Biden’s EPA finalized it, the agency said the rule would provide the largest-ever dataset of PFAS manufactured and used in the United States. It would help authorities understand their spread and determine what protections might be warranted.
Businesses were supposed to start reporting this month. But in a May 2 letter, a coalition of chemical companies petitioned the EPA to withdraw the deadline, reconsider the rule and issue a revised one with narrowed scope.
When the EPA delayed the rule less than two weeks later, it said it needed time to prepare for data collection and to consider changes to aspects of the rule.
Citing Maine Morning Star reporting, Pingree presses EPA on PFAS grant terminations

In an email to ProPublica, the agency said it will address PFAS in many ways. Its approach, the agency said, is to give more time for compliance and to work with water systems to reduce PFAS exposure as quickly as feasible, “rather than issue violations and collect fees that don’t benefit public health.”
The court expects an update from the EPA in the Superfund designation case by Wednesday, and in the legal challenges to the drinking water standards by July 21. The EPA could continue defending the rules. It could ask the court for permission to reverse its position or to send the rules back to the agency for reconsideration. Or it could also ask for further pauses.
“It’s just a big unanswered question whether this administration and this EPA is going to be serious about enforcing anything,” said Robert Sussman, a former EPA official from the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. As a lawyer, he now represents environmental groups that filed an amicus brief in PFAS cases.
Back in North Carolina, problems caused by the chemicals continue to play out.
A consent order between the state and Chemours required the manufacturer to drastically reduce the release of GenX and other PFAS into the environment. (The chemicals commonly called GenX refer to HFPO-DA and its ammonium salt, which are involved in the GenX processing aid technology owned by Chemours.)
Chemours told ProPublica that it invested more than $400 million to remediate and reduce PFAS emissions. It also noted that there are hundreds of PFAS users in North Carolina, “as evidenced by PFAS seen upstream and hundreds of miles away” from its Fayetteville plant “that cannot be traced back to the site.”
PFAS-riddled sea foam continues to wash up on the coastal beaches. Chemours and water utilities, meanwhile, are battling in court about who should cover the cost of upgrades to remove the chemicals from drinking water.
Community forums about PFAS draw triple-digit crowds, even when they’re held on a weeknight, said Emily Donovan, co-founder of the volunteer group Clean Cape Fear, which has intervened in federal litigation. In the fast-growing region, new residents are just learning about the chemicals, she said, and they’re angry.
“I feel like we’re walking backwards,” Donovan said. Pulling back from the drinking water standards, in particular, is “disrespectful to this community.”
“It’s one thing to say you’re going to focus on PFAS,” she added. “It’s another thing to never let it cross the finish line and become any meaningful regulation.”
Research under fire
The EPA of Trump’s first term didn’t just call for more regulation of PFAS, it also stressed the importance of better understanding the forever chemicals through research and testing.
In a 2020 update to its PFAS action plan, the EPA highlighted its support for North Carolina’s investigation of GenX in the Cape Fear River. And it described its efforts to develop the science on PFAS issues affecting rural economies with “first-of-its-kind funding for the agriculture sector.”
Zeldin, too, has boasted about advancing PFAS research in an April news release. “This is just a start of the work we will do on PFAS to ensure Americans have the cleanest air, land, and water,” he said.
At about the same time, though, the agency terminated a host of congressionally appropriated grants for PFAS research, including over $15 million for projects focused on food and farmlands in places like Utah, Texas and Illinois.
Scientists at Michigan State University, for example, were investigating how PFAS interacts with water, soil, crops, livestock and biosolids, which are used for fertilizer. They timed their latest study to this year’s growing season, hired staff and partnered with a farm. Then the EPA canceled two grants.
In virtually identical letters, the agency said that each grant “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities. The objectives of the award are no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.”
The contrast between the agency’s words and actions raises questions about the process behind its decisions, said Cheryl Murphy, head of Michigan State’s Center for PFAS Research and co-lead of one of the projects.
“If you halt it right now,” she said, “what we’re doing is we’re undermining our ability to translate the science that we’re developing into some policy and guidance to help people minimize their exposure to PFAS.”
At least some of the researchers are appealing the terminations.
About a month after PFAS grants to research teams in Maine and Virginia were terminated for not being aligned with agency priorities, the agency reinstated them. The EPA told ProPublica that “there will be more updates on research-related grants in the future.”
Even if the Michigan State grants are reinstated, there could be lasting consequences, said Hui Li, the soil scientist who led both projects. “We will miss the season for this year,” he said in an email, “and could lose the livestock on the farm for the research.”
Federal researchers are also in limbo. Uncertainty, lost capacity and spending restrictions have stunted the work at an EPA lab in Duluth, Minnesota, that investigates PFAS and other potential hazards, according to several sources connected to it. As one source who works at the lab put it, “We don’t know how much longer we will be operating as is.”
The EPA told ProPublica that it’s “continuing to invest in research and labs, including Duluth, to advance the mission of protecting human health and the environment.”
Meanwhile, the agency is asking Congress to eliminate more than half of its own budget. That includes massive staffing cuts, and it would slash nearly all the money for two major programs that help states fund water and wastewater infrastructure. One dates back to President Ronald Reagan’s administration. The other was spotlighted in a paper by Trump’s first-term EPA, which said communities could use these funds to protect public health from PFAS. It trumpeted examples from places like Michigan and New Jersey.
The EPA lost 727 employees in voluntary separations between Jan. 1 and late June, according to numbers the agency provided to ProPublica. It said it received more than 2,600 applications for the second round of deferred resignations and voluntary early retirements.
“These are really technical, difficult jobs,” said Melanie Benesh, vice president for government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group. “And the EPA, by encouraging so many employees to leave, is also losing a lot of institutional knowledge and a lot of technical expertise.”
The shake-up also worries DeWitt, who was one of the scientists who helped investigate the Cape Fear River contamination and who has served on an EPA science advisory board. Her voice shook as she reflected on the EPA’s workforce, “some of the finest scientists I know,” and what their loss means for public well-being.
“Taking away this talent from our federal sector,” she said, will have “profound effects on the agency’s ability to protect people in the United States from hazardous chemicals in air, in water, in soil and potentially in food.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-DrinkingWater-PFAS-Getty.jpg,,,2025-07-02 14:15:00.102493

The state experienced unusually high spring temperatures and an average (in some areas, below average) snowpack, which led to a quick runoff season. 
Now, with summer underway, more than 90% of the state is either in moderate or severe drought, with some high elevation areas in central Utah classified as abnormally dry.

“Temperatures have soared, and with that comes a natural increase in outdoor watering,” said Utah Division of Water Resources Director Candice Hasenyager. “We want our lawns and gardens to look nice and there are ways to do this through smart planning and new technologies that save water.”
According to the division, reservoir levels around the state remain at about 8% higher than normal for this time of the year. In northern Utah, Strawberry, Deer Creek, Jordanelle, Rockport, Smith and Morehouse, Echo, East Canyon and Pineview reservoirs are all at about 90% capacity or higher. 
As of Wednesday, the Great Salt Lake was at about 4,192 feet in elevation, slightly below the state’s “ecologically healthy” level of 4,198 feet. Utah Lake was at about 91% capacity. 
Hot and windy weather prompts statewide fire restrictions and a call for prayer

But with the drought worsening and peak summer temperatures still ahead, water levels in the state’s lakes and reservoirs are expected to drop. 
“Right now, we’re generally seeing outflows from reservoirs begin to exceed inflows,” Hasenyager said. “That pattern typically sets in later in the summer, but this year’s heat is accelerating things. Across all sectors, we need to look for ways to be efficient with our finite water supply.”
The drought prompted Utah Gov. Spencer Cox to declare a state of emergency in 17 counties earlier this spring
The executive order allows farmers and ranchers to access low-interest loans from the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food. Agricultural producers in Beaver, Carbon, Emery, Garfield, Grand, Iron, Juab, Kane, Millard, Piute, San Juan, Sanpete, Sevier, Tooele, Uintah, Washington and Wayne counties can apply to receive up to $100,000, with loans available until the end of October. 
The drought is also contributing to the high fire danger in Utah. So far this year, the state has seen more than 52,000 acres burned in 438 fires.

Thom Tillis of North Carolina deviated from party leadership to cast a vote in the negative.,"The U.S. Capitol on Sunday, June 29, 2025. (Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)The U.S. Senate narrowly passed President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” on Tuesday, with Vice President JD Vance casting a tie-breaking vote.
Senators voted 51-50, mostly along party lines. All Democrats voted in opposition, as well as three Republicans.
Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who announced Sunday that he will not seek reelection in 2026, deviated from party leadership to cast a vote in the negative.
The measure, if passed, would make drastic cuts to Medicaid, SNAP benefits, and student loan payment programs, to name a few components.
Here’s a look at how North Carolina’s congressional delegation is responding to the bill moving forward.
Tillis goes against his party
Tillis, a moderate Republican, joined fellow GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky to stray from party lines and vote against the bill.
He specifically voiced concern over the bill’s impact on Medicaid, saying the Senate draft contains “significant” changes that would be “devastating” to North Carolina.
“I did my homework on behalf of North Carolinians, and I cannot support this bill in its current form,” he wrote on social media.
Tillis added that the bill would result in tens of billions of dollars in lost funding for the Tar Heel State, including in hospitals and rural communities.
Facing a primary challenge from a Trump-backed candidate, Tillis revealed just days before the vote that he would retire instead of running for reelection next year.
The move sets off a battle for the open seat in both major parties. Lara Trump and Roy Cooper appear to be frontrunners, but neither have declared their candidacy thus far.
Democrats rally against the measure
Rep. Alma Adams, representing North Carolina’s 12th congressional district, proposed an amendment to the budget bill on Wednesday as it appeared on the House floor.
The amendment “protects against any cuts to Medicaid and SNAP,” Adams said, asking to bring it in front of the chamber.
“The unanimous consent request cannot be entertained,” Republican Rep. Steve Womack of Arkansas said, shutting it down as he presided over the body.
Adams shared on social media about how Republicans “wouldn’t entertain” her amendment.
“We are going to keep fighting this One Big, Ugly Bill,” she wrote.
Rep. Deborah Ross of North Carolina’s second congressional district said she was back in Washington to vote against the bill.
It would “strip food assistance, health care, climate change support all from the American people and give huge tax breaks to billionaires,” she said in a video she posted online.
Ross pointed out that Vance had to vote on the topic.
“Even our Senator Thom Tillis could see through what this is going to do to people’s health care,” she said.
Other Republicans continue to back the measure
Aside from Tillis, North Carolina’s congressional Republicans have voiced their support for the budget bill.
Rep. Richard Hudson of the ninth congressional district has been one of the most vocal members from the state to defend the measure.
Hudson sent off a flurry of posts online outlining claims that Democrats are working against the American people.
He posted a series of messages saying, “if the One Big Beautiful Bill Act doesn’t pass, it will have disastrous effects on…” ending with the economy, border security, national security, and fiscal trajectory.
“Today, House Republicans will vote to prevent the largest tax increase in American history,” Hudson posted Wednesday morning.
Gov. Josh Stein urges opposition
Democratic Gov. Josh Stein issued a letter on Wednesday to the North Carolina congressional delegation asking members to vote against the legislation.
He explicitly highlighted his “deep concern” for changes to Medicaid, SNAP, and tax credits for energy and manufacturing.
Stein said the bill poses both immediate and long-term threats to the health and wellbeing of North Carolinians, as well as the state’s economic stability.
“This bill has moved at a breakneck pace, leaving North Carolinians without ample time to provide feedback on the devastating impacts this would have on our state,” he wrote.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/uscapitoljune292025_0-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-02 14:15:00.102493

The firefighters killed were Battalion Chief John Morrison, 52, of the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department, and Battalion Chief Frank Harwood, 42, of Kootenai County Fire and Rescue. The injured firefighter is Dave Tysdal, who works for the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department.

“Every contribution made through these official channels goes directly toward supporting the families in their time of unimaginable loss and need,” the Professional Firefighters of Idaho said in a news release.
The brush fire officials believe the suspect caused, named the Nettleton Gulch Fire, grew to 38 acres by Tuesday morning, largely because of better mapping, the Idaho Department of Lands reported. The fire is not contained.
The U.S. Forest Service on Tuesday closed roads near Canfield Mountain until July 15, unless the order ends earlier. A temporary flight restriction is still in effect for the area. Flying drones or aircraft in the area without authorization poses “a serious hazard to firefighting and law enforcement activities,” Idaho Department of Lands officials say.
Structures are still not at risk from the fire, and no evacuations have been ordered, Department of Lands officials say. The fire is in steep terrain.
Crews on Tuesday will work to contain the fire by installing hose lays and setting up water access for the fire’s perimeter, officials say. Fire operations on Tuesday also changed from the Idaho Department of Lands’ Mica Fire Protection District to the North Idaho Type 3 Incident Management Team.
The active shooter situation Sunday delayed firefighting efforts. The fire’s cause remains under investigation.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-02 17:51:29+00:00,CT Mirror,CT employee union takes Lamont to arbitration after no raise offer,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/02/ct-employee-union-ned-lamont-arbitration/,"After the unit announced its plans, SEBAC said it ‘would not expect a single one of our units to accept’ Lamont’s wage freeze proposal.","While weighing a third term, Gov. Ned Lamont asked a key part of his political base — unionized state employees — to accept a wage freeze despite his administration projecting the second-largest budget surplus in Connecticut history.
The 1,300-member Judicial Professional Employees Union announced arbitration plans Wednesday afternoon and is one of just 35 state bargaining units working under contracts that expired Tuesday. But other worker groups, which still are negotiating with the Lamont administration, are expected to have received similar no-raise proposals.
“Negotiation teams representing their colleagues have been working tirelessly at each of the 35 bargaining tables to reach agreement on successor contracts that address pay and other issues,” Drew Stoner, spokeswoman of the State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition, or SEBAC, wrote in a statement. “However, after months of bargaining, our first unit has declared impasse.”
Stoner added the judicial professionals’ union, which represents probation officers, information technology analysts, assistant clerks, counselors and other support staff, had asked for a 2.5% cost-of-living increase in the new fiscal year that began Tuesday, as well as a step hike for all but the most senior workers. A step hike typically adds another 2 percentage points to the value of the raise. This would match the increase Lamont negotiated, and legislators approved this past May, for state police troopers.
SEBAC, which includes all major state employee unions excluding the troopers’ unit, added that the administration’s offer for judicial professions “was no wage increase, no step, and no top step payment. We would not expect a single one of our units to accept this offer.”
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said Wednesday, “The administration plans to present an offer to SEBAC regarding wages and work conditions as soon as next week. … Governor Lamont immensely values the contributions of our state employees, as evidenced by consistent wage increases and our offer will reflect that.”
Since Lamont became governor in 2019, his administration largely has negotiated matching pay hikes for all state employee unions.
And since 2021, as Connecticut has enjoyed unprecedented surpluses driven by aggressive and increasingly controversial budget caps, most unionized workers have received effective annual raises of 4.5%. That reflects a 2.5% cost of living adjustment and a yearly step increase.
Since those budget caps last were set in 2017, annual surpluses have averaged $1.8 billion, a huge sum that represents 8% to 9% of the General Fund. And the governor’s budget office projected two weeks ago that Connecticut would close the 2024-25 fiscal year with nearly $2.2 billion or 10% left over.
Though the outgoing fiscal year closed on Monday, the comptroller’s office won’t complete a final audit until September.
Despite those surpluses, and projections for more black ink in the next few years, the governor and his fellow Democrats in the General Assembly’s majority adopted a new, $55.8 billion, biennial budget that assumed most unionized employees would not be getting their raises on time this July 1.
Legislators struggled to find enough room under the constitutional spending cap — which keeps most budget growth in line with household income and inflation — to cover raises and planned new investments in child care, municipal aid and education.
The expectation, though, was that workers still would receive an increase for the 2025-26 fiscal year, but that it would be delivered retroactively in 2026-27, when there would be more projected room to spend under the constitutional cap.
But despite the large surpluses, Lamont and state officials also are wary that Connecticut will lose hundreds of millions of dollars in annual Medicaid payments and other grants from Washington, D.C., as part of ongoing efforts by Congress and President Donald J. Trump to slash federal spending.Critics say budget caps were calibrated arbitrarily and the huge, post-2017 “surpluses” don’t reflect non-essential resources, but rather vital dollars stripped from education, health care, and other core programs to build state reserves and reduce Connecticut’s considerable pension debt.
The state entered this fiscal year with more than $35 billion in unfunded pension liabilities. Those obligations, coupled with bonded debt and funds owed to other retirement benefits programs, collectively approach $79 billion, making Connecticut one of the most indebted states, per capita, in the nation.
But much of that debt was due to poor savings habits over seven decades, between 1939 and 2010. And given that pension debt — even at the current pace Connecticut is paying it down — is projected to place pressure on state finances well into the 2040s, critics say Lamont is placing too much pressure on one generation to solve a problem created by three.
State employee unions have been some of the most vocal critics of those caps, and say they’ve led to dangerous understaffing levels in many agencies and departments.
“Our state workforce is the backbone of public safety, infrastructure, education and health — and the first line of defense when federal resources are held back,” Stoner added. “Yet with no contract in place, Lamont is asking workers to hold the line with one hand tied behind their backs. … Governor Lamont must recognize this reality and empower his representatives to  agree to fair and honorable contracts.”
The governor, a fiscal moderate, is expected to announce later this summer whether he will run in 2026 for a third term in office.
At a June 5 press conference, one day after the General Assembly closed the regular 2024 session, the governor gave his strongest indication to date of an inclination to seek another four-year term with Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz.
“I love the job,” he said. “I think we’ve had extraordinary progress compared to where we were, say, 10 years ago. I think Susan and I are a pretty good team.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC03422-e1541205352185.jpg,,,2025-07-02 14:15:00.102493

(Courtesy of Angel Peña) A U.S. Customs and Border Protection proposal to construct a 1.3-mile barrier along the southern skirt of a Sunland Park mountain threatens the area, local conservation groups say.
Most of Mount Cristo Rey lies in southern Doña Ana County, rising from the banks of the Rio Grande in an expanse of Chihuahuan desert, mottled with olive-green chaparral and ocotillo. The mountain hosts a 29-foot tall limestone statue of Jesus Christ on the cross, and draws thousands of people every year in pilgrimage from the surrounding areas in Las Cruces, El Paso and Juárez. The area is also a popular hiking and mountain biking area.
The proposal would widen roads to construct a 30-foot high steel barrier and an additional one and a half miles of roadway in Doña Ana County. The wall would stretch over the mountain’s southern portion, which stretches to the Anapra neighborhood in Juárez.

In announcing the project at the start of June, the Department of Homeland Security said it would “close critical gaps in the border wall and enhance border security operations” in the border areas in El Paso, Tucson and Yuma.
When reached by phone, CBP spokesperson Landon Hutchison added that Mount Cristo Rey “was a major human smuggling infiltration site for the cartels.”

Also in June, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem waived federal environment and water laws to speed up border wall construction projects, including more than 12 miles between Santa Teresa and Mount Cristo Rey. The waivers exempt projects from requirements of 24 federal laws, including the Endangered Species Act, Clean Water Act and National Environmental Policy Act.
U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-NM) whose district encompasses Sunland Park, declined to say if he supports the project when reached for comment.
“I support responsible efforts to keep our border secure and our communities safe. That includes smart investments in technology and, where needed, physical barriers,” Vasquez said in a written statement. “We can keep our country safe while also respecting the environment, cultural heritage, and the people who call this region home.”










“I think by expanding the border wall, you threaten to turn this place of recreation, this place of worship, into a graveyard”


– Dr. Brian Elmore, El Paso emergecy room doctor


Members of El Paso-Las Cruces coalition No Border Walls on Mount Cristo Rey, however, urged the public to submit public comments on the project  — which they say threatens to worsen migrant deaths, erosion and habitat loss for the area — before a July 3 feedback deadline.
While CBP data shows border crossings declined by nearly 80% in the last year, deaths of people crossing the border in the area around El Paso and New Mexico have risen sharply since 2021, and, in 2024, it became the deadliest place for migrants to cross along the entire U.S.-Mexico border.

“It is pretty disheartening to see,” Antoinette Reyes, the Southern New Mexico coordinator for Sierra Club Rio Grande chapter, told Source NM. “By blocking off that section, which is already steep and difficult terrain as is, it forces people to go into more dangerous portions of the border to cross.”
Injuries from climbing over the walls can result in life-changing injuries, said Dr. Brian Elmore, an emergency room physician in El Paso. He’s treated people who fell from the border walls, which can cause severe ankle breaks, as well as head and back injuries. The summer’s heat, combined with difficult terrain, could pose additional concerns, he said.
“I think by expanding the border wall, you threaten to turn this place of recreation, this place of worship, into a graveyard,” Elmore said. “I would expect to see more people falling from the wall there, suffering heat injuries, in this area.”

Construction of the border wall would also require high water use for pouring concrete to reinforce the roads for heavy machinery, said Erik Meza, a coordinator for the Sierra Club Borderlands program in Tucson.
“They will probably need to widen some of those roads, so that means that they are going to start bulldozing some of the native vegetation of the area, reducing a habitat for species,” he said. “By compacting the soils, we’re probably going to have more water run-off and erosion.”
The area is crucial for species such as javelina and mule deer, but also the birds, reptiles and pollinators that cross the habitat, said Raymundo Aguilar, a member of the Juárez conservation group Colectivo Sierra de Juárez. He noted that scientists documented an endangered Mexican Gray wolf crossing the border in the area in 2017, and the construction of a wall with 4-inch gaps between steel bollards would prevent most species from moving freely.
“Protecting this corridor is not only urgent; it is a commitment to the life we share on both sides of the border,” Aguilar said in Spanish. “We believe that efforts should focus on restoring this connectivity, not fragmenting it.”

Provisions in the new tax and spending bill passed by the U.S. Senate early Tuesday would go even further than the House bill in removing health care and other benefits from immigrants with legal status.
The House version of the massive tax and spending bill penalized states providing health care for some immigrants with legal status as well as those that chose to spend state money to enroll immigrants without legal status in Medicaid.
But the Senate bill is even tougher on immigrants here legally and illegally, reducing benefits for most refugees and immigrants on humanitarian parole, including Afghans and Ukrainians who helped the United States in wars overseas and in return were promised safe haven and a safety net in the United States.

The Senate bill also cuts state reimbursement for emergency care in the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That would force those states to pay more for emergency care for immigrants, cut back services or drop out of Medicaid expansion, a potentially catastrophic move for low-income U.S. citizens as well as new immigrants.
The bill passed with three dissenting Republican votes, from U.S. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Vice President JD Vance broke the tie. The bill, officially the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” now returns to the House for final passage before going to President Donald Trump to be signed.

Advocates and experts see repercussions as refugees and other legal immigrants lose health insurance and turn to already-stressed hospitals and charities for help. It could be a nail in the coffin for some rural hospitals that are in financial trouble and scaling back services. Hospitals are required to serve anyone who arrives for emergency care, regardless of their ability to pay.
“In our state, it’s going to be absolutely devastating for rural hospitals,” said Kate Woomer-Deters, a senior attorney at the North Carolina Justice Center’s Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Refugees are not going to go home just because they lost their health care coverage. They’re still going to be showing up at the door of hospitals and clinics needing care.”
Some groups, such as Afghans, Ukrainians and Iraqis, were often brought here after helping the U.S. in war efforts, putting their lives in danger and making life in their home country untenable.
“In the case of the Afghans, this is pretty much a knife in the back to those folks who helped the United States when the United States needed help in their country,” said David Meyer, a board member of the Bloomington Refugee Support Network in Indiana, where he personally helps seven refugee families from Afghanistan, Honduras, Iraq, Nicaragua and Syria.
The Senate bill takes Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and even food stamps off the table for most refugees. There are a few narrow exceptions for people with green cards, some Cuban migrants waiting for citizenship, and some Micronesians and Marshall Islands natives with treaty rights, said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
That also applies to immigrants with legal status who don’t have green cards: people with asylum, immigrant victims of domestic violence, immigrant victims of sex trafficking and parolees — such as Afghans — admitted due to urgent humanitarian reasons, as well as to refugees.










It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.


– Shelby Gonzales, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities


“There’s going to be more emergency health care needs because uninsured people will be delaying care,” Gonzales said. “It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.”
The bill also cuts funding for expansion states to pay for emergency care in hospitals. Increased costs could force some states to drop Medicaid expansion altogether, spreading the pain to low-income U.S. citizens as well, Gonzales said.
“It’s one more reason states are looking at their budgets and they’re having to make decisions about their Medicaid expansion program,” Gonzales said.
In Indiana, Meyer said, Afghan women especially often need food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to get by at first. It takes them a long time to learn to read and write since they were not allowed to attend any school under the Taliban.
“They arrived in our community totally illiterate in their native language and starting from scratch learning English, so that’s a huge impediment to being gainfully employed,” Meyer said. Even once they’ve become self-sufficient enough to get off food stamps and Medicaid, many still need the support of the Affordable Care Act to get health care.
Removing all subsidized health care “would have a devastating effect on those families, and not just Afghans but Syrians, people from the Democratic Republic of Congo and others that have been relocated to south-central Indiana,” Meyer said.

Indiana hosted more than 10,500 of the nearly 460,000 refugees who arrived in the United States between 2013 and 2023, according to a 2023 report from the nonprofit Immigration Research Initiative. In fiscal 2024, another 1,380 arrived in Indiana, mostly from Congo and Burma, but including 90 people from Afghanistan, according to State Department records.
In North Carolina, there were 276 new Afghan refugees in fiscal 2024 among 2,730 total new refugees. Even professional Afghans such as doctors and lawyers struggle at first in low-wage jobs, said Woomer-Deters, of the North Carolina Justice Center. It takes time for them to get accreditation and language skills to practice their professions here, she said.
“A lot of these folks need their food stamps, Medicaid — they need these programs for an adjustment period when they get here. And these are people we’ve invited to come and have vetted,” she said.
A Congressional Budget Office report June 29 estimated that almost 12 million people, including 1.4 million immigrants covered by state-only programs, would lose health insurance under the Senate plan.
A Republican response to an earlier CBO report emphasized that the bill would save states $13.1 billion in Medicaid spending over 10 years, “freeing up resources they can choose to reinvest to further strengthen care for the most vulnerable Americans.”
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, however, called that conclusion misleading in its own response in turn.
“These savings would largely result from millions of people losing health coverage — hardly an outcome worth celebrating,” the response said.

Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, said there was one small positive change in the Senate version compared to the House version.
States will no longer be penalized for using the option to cover some immigrant children and pregnant women.
And the Senate version would not penalize expansion states for offering Medicaid to immigrants on humanitarian parole, but only because that help for parolees was ended in entirely, along with help for refugees and other kind of immigrants with legal status who lack green cards, Cuello said.
“In other words, they are blocking all paths to health care,” Cuello said in an emailed statement. “This is not an attack on the undocumented. It’s an attack on lawfully present immigrants.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-07-02 17:32:45+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘Everybody loves John’: Jackson mayor Horhn’s big party brings in big bucks,Molly Minta,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/02/everybody-loves-john-jackson-mayor-horhns-big-party-brings-in-big-bucks/,Tuesday's gala was a spectacular party that helped generate half a million dollars in sponsorships for Jackson Mayor John Horhn's inauguration festivities.,"By Tuesday evening, the room where Jackson Mayor John Horhn took the oath of office between gospel performances by the Mississippi Mass Choir earlier in the day had transformed into a glittery gala, replete with a red carpet, lit candles and a classically raunchy gig by blues musician Bobby Rush.
It was a spectacular party that helped generate half a million dollars in sponsorships for Tuesday’s inauguration festivities. More than 140 sponsors across Jackson made monetary and in-kind donations to celebrate Horhn, a longtime state senator from northwest Jackson, finally attaining the office he’d sought for 16 years.
“What better way to kick off and put the cap on such a monumental day, a momentous day, than to come out to the Jackson Convention Center and throw a party,” Horhn said after he took the stage.
All told, Horhn’s inauguration committee raised more than $485,000 in cash sponsorships and $150,000 in write-off donations to organize yesterday’s events, including the bash that was free and open to the public and featured food from more than 20 local businesses and a pricey cash bar. 
While the final tally of what was spent yesterday or how many people attended isn’t complete, Jeff Good, a local restaurateur who oversaw the committee’s finances, said he had budgeted about $320,000 for the day and estimated 2,500 attendees. Horhn will be able to use any leftover funds to put on future events. 
Each sponsor had a different motivation for donating, Good said. Some were local companies who have sought city contracts, while other Jacksonians made financial contributions simply because they are fans of Horhn. 
“There’s so many things that John has done,” Good said at the gala. “Everybody loves John.” 
While past mayors have thrown similar balls upon their inauguration, Horhn’s party was especially well-attended and inclusive, multiple attendees said. 
In the weeks leading up to the gala, the inauguration committee circulated a digital chart inviting people to sponsor the event at different levels from the lowest tier, called “spark” at a minimum of $500, all the way up to the “drum major” at $15,000 or more. 
Sponsors were to make the checks out to a 501(c)4 set up by the inauguration committee, Good said, and send them to a P.O. Box managed by Willie Bozeman, Horhn’s chief of staff and interim campaign manager. 
What did the sponsors get in exchange for their contribution? Good pointed at gigantic screens on either side of the gala’s main stage that listed the sponsor’s names. 
“We read their names on the podium,” he said. “They get the notoriety that they supported the mayor. It’s no different than if you’re doing a charity ball.” 
Sponsors also got dedicated tables, an invitation to a VIP reception, a swag bag and acknowledgement in the event program — a list that reads like a who’s who of Jackson and included developers like the Mattiace Company and Gabriel Prado, prominent law firms such as Butler Snow, nonprofits, lobbyists, engineering firms and well-known city construction contractors. 
“When you read the sponsorship list in our program, it is Jackson businesses, Jackson families, Jackson couples,” Good said. 
Cynics might say these donations will be used to get the mayor’s ear down the road.  
“Some folks are doing it to reap the benefits of contracts,” said David Archie, a former Hinds County commissioner recently hired by former Mayor Chokwe Lumumba after running for mayor himself, as he was looking for a table to sit at. “Some folks are doing it to be on the staff or to have family members on the staff.” 
But many others felt their sponsorship was more akin to a “thank you.” Carla Kirkland, the chief executive officer of an education consulting company that works with Jackson Public Schools, said she didn’t need to donate to get Horhn’s attention — she’s known him since he was a senator. 
Instead, Kirkland said she donated $15,000 to show Horhn that she has his back, much more than she’s given past mayoral administrations. 
“I think it shows the support that we are showing for the new administration and just letting them know that we are behind you,” she said. “We will put our money behind you, and we will put our name behind you.” 
Kirkland went even further, helping to fundraise for the gala, which she said was easy to do. Through her group chat network, she said she sold over 100 “spark” sponsorships. 
“I am in a GroupMe with the AKAs, with the Jack and Jills … with Women for Progress,” she said. “So I just pulled together my network.” 
The gala also proved to be a good networking opportunity: While talking to a reporter, Kirkland spotted Errick Greene, the Jackson Public Schools superintendent.

,Mississippi Today,2025-07-02 17:25:34+00:00,Mississippi Today,Ridgeland nonprofit joins lawsuit over EPA’s funding pause,Alex Rozier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/02/ridgeland-nonprofit-joins-lawsuit-over-epas-funding-pause/,Ridgeland nonprofit has joined a national lawsuit over EPA-terminated grants focused on climate resilience.,"2C Mississippi, a Ridgeland-based nonprofit focused on climate resilience in Mississippi, recently joined a national lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency after the government terminated over $20 million in grant funds for the organization.
In February, the lawsuit says, the EPA followed directives from President Trump to cut federal spending by terminating grants for a variety of environmental justice and climate resilience projects. Lawyers from a number of groups, including the Southern Environmental Law Center and Earthjustice, filed the complaint in federal court in Washington D.C. on June 25. The complaint asks for full funding of the roughly 350 awarded grants impacted by the EPA’s cuts.
The Ridgeland organization, federal data shows, was set to receive about $20.5 million for two projects in Jackson: $20 million for a self-sustainable “resilience hub” and $500,000 to complete a “microparks” project aimed at tackling flooding and blight in the city. 2C Mississippi, one of the over 20 plaintiffs from around the country, received just $300,000 of those funds so far.
In a March memo the EPA sent to 2C Mississippi, the agency wrote, “This EPA Assistance Agreement is terminated in its entirety effective immediately on the grounds that the award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.”
Dominika Parry, who founded the nonprofit in 2017, called it a “nearly impossible task” to obtain the $20 million elsewhere for the resilience hub, a concept she said is growing around the country, such as in New Orleans. The idea, she explained, is to provide shelter both during emergencies but also during general times of need.

“ This is a place where people can come, stay overnight, have access to energy, be in healthy conditions,” Parry said. 
Features would include a tornado shelter, 150 beds, showers and charging stations, as well as job training and community spaces. Parry added the facility would be self-sustainable with an independent well water system as well as solar panels with battery storage. Working with Jackson nonprofit Voice of Calvary Ministries, Parry secured a site for the hub at a former church in west Jackson. 
The microparks project, which she discussed with Mississippi Today last year, seeks to take on both blight and flooding by turning dilapidated properties in flood zones into communal green spaces with public art and gardens. Despite having already selected the locations and cleared the land for the parks to live in, Parry said she’s had to pause the project since the EPA’s termination. She was optimistic that funding could come from elsewhere, but it’s unclear how long that would take. 
Without the grant money, Parry’s unsure if her organization as a whole can survive. Already, she said, she’s had to start working for free as well as reduce her employee’s salaries. 
“Losing that funding is a pretty existential change to our functioning,” she said.
In a separate project, 2C Mississippi secured a $1.5 million federal grant for a recently unveiled green space on Farish Street.
“So far we’ve been incredibly grateful and lucky that we were able to keep delivering and build trust, and now the idea we are going to go and tell people we don’t have the funds, that weighs on me,” Parry said. “People in Jackson have been promised many, many things that never happened.”
Other Mississippi groups whose grants were terminated include the Gulfport-based Steps Coalition and Jackson State University. Steps Coalition, according to federal data, received just $122,000 of a $500,000 grant to engage residents in local land-use and leadership training. JSU received about $60,000 of $100,000 from two EPA grants to train water technicians, support grant writing in underserved communities, and provide water to a garden at Blackburn Middle School in Jackson.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/05115716/Farish-Street-Green-Commons-6.jpg,,,2025-07-02 14:15:00.102493

(Photo byArielle Robinson / Verite News)Tulane University is no longer pursuing disciplinary action against seven students who were originally facing consequences for their participation in an off-campus protest advocating for Columbia student activist Mahmoud Khalil to be released from immigration detention in Louisiana.
The students announced on June 9 that the school had dismissed the charges.
The protest took place on March 11 near Tulane University and proceeded peacefully as participants called for both Tulane and Loyola universities to take action against deportation and recent actions taken by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Rory Macdonald, one of the seven students, said that initially receiving the charges was devastating.
“It was a terrible overreach on Tulane’s part,” Macdonald said.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Macdonald and some other students went through a similar disciplinary process after participating in an encampment at Tulane during the spring of 2024, which resulted in a semester-long suspension.
“We tried to fight [those suspensions] too, and we weren’t successful,” Macdonald said. “But I think that what’s different here is that we had the legal support that really let us show them, this will not stand.”
After the protest, the Office of Student Conduct sent emails to the students informing them of their charges, including “failure to comply,” “disruptive conduct,” and “acting in collusion to violate the Code of Conduct.”
According to a letter written by legal counsel for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), the students were told that their actions were not protected by the university’s freedom of expression policy because of their association with Tulane Students for a Democratic Society, a student group that was suspended from campus after organizing the spring 2024 encampment.
Cameron McLaren, one of the students who was facing charges, told Verite News in an email that she believes the university was operating politically without explicitly saying so.
“The school was trying to police our affiliation with a national organization and hid their motives by retroactively enforcing copyright/branding rules,” McLaren wrote.
FIRE, a nonprofit organization focused on protecting free speech, criticized Tulane for penalizing the students for protesting off-campus.
“Once an organization is no longer affiliated with the university, Tulane has no further interest in prohibiting students from associating with the group off campus, just as it has no interest in barring membership in any other local political organization, sports league, or theater ensemble,” the letter reads.
Zach Greenberg, a lawyer with FIRE, told Verite that the organization is involved with hundreds of cases regarding free speech on college campuses each year.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“We’re glad to see that Tulane dropped the charges and did the right thing,” Greenberg said. “However, the charges should never have been brought to begin with. The universities, before they bring these charges, should understand what free speech protects and refrain from punishing students for exercising their rights.”
According to Macdonald, the process of disciplinary hearings typically involve Tulane’s legal representatives asking students questions in a format similar to that of a legal deposition.
“It’s a very one-sided process and we fought to change the process,” Macdonald said. “We eventually were able to get a meeting between the students who were under attack, faculty who were supporting them and the dean of students.”
Leading up to these meetings, the students asked members of the public to call into the dean of students’ office and express their concerns about penalizing the students. In their second meeting with administrators, the students were informed that the charges were being dismissed.
Tulane has not made a public statement about the reasoning behind the charges being dropped. Macdonald said that the students were not given any additional information regarding the decision when it was made.
Tulane spokesperson Michael Strecker said that the university cannot comment on individual conduct cases. In a written statement provided to Verite, Strecker emphasized that Tulane’s conduct process is “educational in nature.”
“There are multiple paths for resolving cases, ranging from major matter investigations to informal resolution processes,” Strecker wrote. “The path any individual student’s case takes may change along the way based on the information provided and available.”
McLaren was relieved when the charges were dropped because it meant that she could graduate this past May as planned, with a degree in psychology and computer science.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“I knew that the decision wasn’t due to Tulane having a change of heart; rather, we ran a successful political defense campaign,” she wrote, referring to the letter from FIRE and calls from the public.
Macdonald, who will be returning to Tulane in the fall to finish their studies as a history major, says that they are still concerned about the state of free speech on campus.
“We won the right to keep organizing Tulane students off-campus, but a lot of us feel like we need to keep fighting until there is actually some measure of free speech on campus,” they said. “The only way we can make any progress in our universities is to be loud and public about it.”

Phil Murphy in 2025. (Photos by Hal Brown and Amanda Brown)Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee for governor, is entering the general election season with a double-digit lead over her Republican rival, Jack Ciattarelli, according to a new Rutgers-Eagleton poll released Wednesday.
The first major gubernatorial poll since the June primary shows Sherrill with 51% of voters’ support, and Ciattarelli with 31%, if the Nov. 4 election were held today.
Including voters who lean toward a candidate, her lead grows by one point. About 3% say they’d vote neither, and 6% are uncertain.
While Sherrill holds a comfortable edge, the poll also suggests economic issues could take front and center to narrow the race as November approaches. Pollsters also found “an intense national political landscape” will have an impact yet to be seen, and that this gap will likely shrink in the next several months.
“Early polling on the governor’s race should serve as a baseline or a barometer of how voters are feeling in the moment — not as some crystal ball predicting the future four months from now,” said Ashley Koning, an assistant research professor and director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling. “A lot can happen between now and November.”
She said 2021 showed how much a race can shift in just a few months. Ciattarelli, who was also the GOP gubernatorial candidate then, narrowly lost to Gov. Phil Murphy in a closer-than-expected race. Polls had showed Murphy ahead by double digits, but he only won by about three points.
President Donald Trump remains a looming presence in the race, with 52% of voters polled saying Trump plays a “major factor” in their vote, Wednesday’s poll showed. Nearly three-quarters of Sherrill supporters cited Trump as a top concern, compared to 27% of Ciattarelli backers.
Koning noted that while Trump’s endorsement of Ciattarelli may have boosted him in the primaries, these numbers are “an early sign” that the endorsement could play out differently in the general election.
“Trump’s influence appears to be more of a benefit to Sherrill right now,” said Koning.
With four months to go, both campaigns are battling for the bloc of independent voters that could sway the race. Sherrill, whose name recognition and favorability has surged since April, has been seen as the more moderate candidate between the two, according to the poll.
Ciattarelli, a former assemblyman, still commands strong enthusiasm from the Republican base, with about 80% of his supporters saying they are “very” or “somewhat enthusiastic.” But Sherrill outpaces him nearly 2-to-1 on health care, education and infrastructure.
She loses her edge on taxes and affordability, the two biggest issues New Jerseyans face, the poll states. On handling taxes, Sherrill leads 39% to Ciattarelli’s 34%, and on cost of living, 45% say they’d trust Sherrill more while 29% support Ciattarelli.
Voters also are split on who would handle crime and safety better — 39% support Sherrill compared to 37% backing Ciattarelli.
Ciattarelli’s team took to social media to blast the poll. Chris Russell, a political strategist for the candidate, called it “pure fantasy” and compared it to 2021 polls that they said incorrectly predicted the gubernatorial results. He also suggested the data contains inaccurate calculations and “methodological malpractice,” saying Kamala Harris and Murphy supporters were overrepresented.
An Eagleton spokesperson did not immediately respond to Russell’s comments.
Seventy-eight percent of voters said they will “definitely” cast ballots in the November election, and another 15% said “probably.”
Pollsters surveyed 621 adults, including 579 registered voters, in mid-June. The poll has a margin of error of 5.4 percentage points.

The accelerated phaseout of wind and solar energy tax credits could raise rates in Wyoming by an average 29%, according to one consumer group.
The post Big Beautiful Bill could inflate Wyoming electricity rates, some observers say appeared first on WyoFile .","Though bargaining continues, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act could land on President Donald Trump’s desk later this week with major implications for Wyoming’s energy economy and, very likely, residents’ electric bills.
For better or worse? Depends on whether you believe renewable energy is a help or a hindrance to meet the exploding electrical demand. 
Wyoming’s top politicians suggest the bill, in its Senate form, is a panacea for affordable fossil-fuel and nuclear energy. It will “unleash affordable, available, reliable Wyoming energy,” Wyoming Republican Sen. John Barrasso said this week. 
Critics, meantime, warn that renewable energy is left out of the bill’s unleashing. Instead, the sweeping budget and policy bill will deliver a punishing blow to wind and solar projects by stripping key federal tax credits and solidifying Trump administration efforts to suppress permitting and other support for the industries, likely jeopardizing hundreds of projects slated throughout the country, they say.

Estimates of what that means for U.S. ratepayers’ monthly electric bills over the next several years range from a 10% to 20% increase. 
One consumer advocacy group — Clean Energy Buyers Association, whose 400 members include Microsoft, Amazon and Google — warned that if the renewable energy sector loses the 45Y and 48E production and investment tax credits, it would raise the cost of electricity in Wyoming by an average 29% — the steepest increase in the nation.
“There is no question that removing tech-neutral energy credits would cause economic harm and job losses and drive up electricity prices in more than half the country,” the association’s CEO, Rich Powell, said in a prepared statement last month.
Reached Tuesday by WyoFile, the association said it could not provide further details regarding its Big Beautiful Bill analysis for Wyoming. You can read highlights and find links to its full report here. For now, many local utility officials are reserving comments as they review the 900-plus-page bill.

The average Wyoming household pays about $105 per month for electricity compared to the U.S. average of about $135, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Renewables’ growing role in Wyoming
For all of Wyoming’s fossil fuel might, tilting federal policy toward coal, oil and natural gas and away from renewables doesn’t cleanly translate into more affordable electricity, according to industry watchers. The U.S. fleet of coal-fired power plants, for example, is old and increasingly expensive to operate, utilities say. 
Meantime, wind and solar — albeit with the help of federal tax incentives — continually improve their cost efficiency while helping meet an insatiable demand to power artificial intelligence and other computational industries. Wind and solar are the fastest-growing sources of new electrical power in the nation, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Wind power in Wyoming has doubled since 2019, making up more than 21% of electrical generation in the state.
If that momentum goes away, it will be difficult for utilities to maintain rates and meet burgeoning new demand, said Jonathan Naughton, director of the University of Wyoming’s Wind Energy Research Center.
“If you take a look at what could be built and installed today, it’s wind, solar and [energy] storage,” Naughton told WyoFile. 
Adding more nuclear power generation takes a long time, Naughton added, and no utility is proposing to build a new coal plant. Thanks to AI and industrial competition for direct power additions, “if you try and buy a [natural] gas turbine right now, you’re looking at five to six years before you can get one.”
Naughton declined to speculate on the Big Beautiful Bill’s potential implications for Wyoming’s electric ratepayers. However, increasing competition for new power, he said, has developers scrambling to build whatever form of power generation that can be installed the fastest.
“It comes down to, ‘How can government and the administration affect these things?'” Naughton said. “The bottom line is, we need a lot of electricity generation developed over the next 10 years. And what is ready? I think wind and solar and [energy] storage are really ready to do that.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Matthew Mueller) Kentucky Auditor Allison Ball announced that a special examination of the Kentucky Department of Education found “widespread improvements needed across the agency.” 
Ball’s office released the examination, which is more than 550 pages, late Monday evening. The General Assembly passed legislation in 2024 directing the auditor to review the state agency that oversees public K-12 schools in Kentucky. 
“Kentucky’s children deserve to receive the education they need to be competitive in the real world,” Ball, a Republican, said in a statement. “This examination provides a clear path forward for student success, parent accessibility, and teacher support in all of Kentucky’s schools. It can serve as a guiding document for Commissioner (Robbie) Fletcher as he continues his work to improve the state of public education across our Commonwealth.”
The auditor says the Education Department failed to use $250 million that could have gone into bolstering underfunded areas of education during fiscal years 2021-24 — a conclusion the department disputes in its response to the report.
The disagreement between the department and auditor appears to revolve around their conflicting interpretations of state budget language.
The auditor’s report specifically says pupil and vocational transportation were underfunded areas that could have benefitted had the department reallocated excess funding as the state budget allows. Instead, the department returned or “lapsed” the $250 million to the state’s General Fund or Budget Reserve Trust Fund.
The money in question was allocated through the state’s basic education funding SEEK (Support Education Excellence in Kentucky) formula.
Earlier this year, Fletcher wrote that KDE was predicting a $40 million SEEK funding shortfall in the 2024-25 academic year.
The SEEK formula determines the amount of state funding to local school districts. The formula has a base per-pupil funding allocation, along with additional funding for factors like transportation costs or the number of students in a district who qualify for additional resources like special education, free or reduced-price lunch and English language assistance.
Other findings included: 

“Kentucky still has significant work to do related to closing achievement gaps and
ensuring all students are prepared for future success.”
When reviewing diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, auditors “did not observe any program or activity at KDE that indicated non-compliance with current federal guidance” as of May 2025. 
KDE and the state’s other education and labor agencies “have gaps in communication, in alignment around strategic resource planning, and in goal-setting for a unified state-level vision for student success in K12, postsecondary, and career.” 

The auditor’s office conducted the examination with PCG Consulting Group on KDE’s activities between July 2020 and June 2024. The full report includes a June 2025 response to the audit from Fletcher on KDE’s behalf, saying there is “what may be perceived as a conflict of interest” with PCG. Fletcher said the consulting firm held contracts with KDE and was an active bidder on two KDE solicitations during its involvement in the examination. PCG was not awarded either contract. 
Ball said in a follow-up letter dated July 1 that KDE did not inform her office or PCG about the possible conflict of interest but instead “decided to raise this issue for the first time now,” after seeing the report. Ball also asserted that PCG and her office “worked side-by-side to critically analyze KDE, without reservation.” 
PCG also included a reply to KDE’s claim saying it conducts a “conflict check” before responding to any request for proposals or other opportunities, and that it has other state-level clients in Kentucky.

In a statement about the audit as a whole, Fletcher said it “took many, many hours of staff time to speak with the auditors and provide the documents that were required for this deep look at how the agency operates.” 
“In every section, the report highlights the good work agency staff have been doing to support the students and educators of Kentucky,” Fletcher said. “The audit showed that morale at KDE is high, our staff members truly believe in the agency’s work and that superintendents believe they can rely on KDE to provide them with high-quality resources.
“KDE is an organization focused on continuous improvement. We look forward to utilizing the APA’s final report to identify opportunities for future growth and plans for continued improvement in service of Kentucky’s public school students. We welcome the opportunity to work with the Kentucky General Assembly for the legislative changes necessary to accomplish recommendations within the report.” 
Though they acknowledged they are still reviewing the audit’s findings, Republican House Speaker David Osborne and Rep. Scott Lewis, the chair of the House Primary and Secondary Education committee, said in a Tuesday press release that “it is abundantly clear that it provides an invaluable road map for improvements.” 
“The Department of Education holds arguably the most important mission in state government: preparing the next generation of Kentuckians for success. Yet, far too many students fall short of their academic potential because of failed programs, broken systems, and antiquated processes that no longer serve today’s needs,” the statement said. “Education continues to be a priority for the legislature. We’ve provided historic levels of funding — even after adjusting for inflation — and adopted policies to improve curriculum, behavioral issues, and attract talented educators.” 
The Republican lawmakers added that legislators “must consider recommendations and implement the changes necessary to create real, measurable improvement” and they look forward to working with KDE, educators and administrators “to address the concerns identified in this audit and to build a stronger, more accountable educational system for all Kentucky students.”
The Kentucky General Assembly will convene in Frankfort for the 2026 legislative session in January. One of the top legislative priorities will include deciding the next two-year state budget. 
The Republican Party of Kentucky issued a statement criticizing KDE for the “improperly returned” $250 million in SEEK funding, particularly amid the predicted shortfall earlier this year. 
“Until Andy Beshear and the Kentucky Department of Education can properly manage the funding already available for local school districts, they have no business requesting more money or using taxpayer-funded public relations stunts to pressure the General Assembly into launching new education programs — especially when Auditor Ball’s report clearly shows this administration is incapable of managing the ones already in place,” said RPK spokesperson Andy Westberry.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/231107Gubernatorial_Night11_MM-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-02 14:15:00.102493

(Jetta Productions Inc./Getty Images)Indiana scored a $6.25 million boost from the federal government to expand registered apprenticeships across the state – growing a path to high paying, in-demand careers for Hoosiers. 
The Indiana Department of Workforce Development Work-Based Learning and Apprenticeship team secured the federal grant as part of a nearly $84 million national push by the U.S. Department of Labor to expand apprenticeship capacity. 
“These federal dollars ensure Indiana is in a prime position to deliver on President Trump’s Executive Order to modernize American workforce programs,” Gov. Mike Braun said in a press release. “We’re not just equipping employers with vital tools for skills development; we’re cementing Indiana’s leadership in workforce innovation and economic prosperity.”
The award includes: 

$1.28 million in base funding to bolster existing apprenticeship infrastructure.
$4,9 million in competitive expansion grants aimed at launching new apprenticeship models and reducing barriers for employers.

The RAP combines on-the-job learning, classroom instruction and mentorship to train individuals in their field. The program is offered in in several industries including agriculture, building and construction and health and life sciences. DWD Commissioner Josh Richardson said RAP is a pathway to good paying careers. 
“The resources allotted allows us to deepen partnerships with Indiana businesses, community colleges, and training providers – strengthening our talent pipeline and ensuring Hoosiers have the skills employers need today and into the future,” he said in a press release. 
For fiscal year 2025, there were a total of 25,250 active apprentices across the state – putting Indiana near the lead. 
Indiana’s demand for apprenticeship is rising after education officials approved a massive high school diploma redesign last year. The new graduation plan includes more personalized learning pathways and experiences, including taking college courses while in high school and gaining hands-on experience.

The Trump administration announced this week it was withholding $26 million in federal grant funding to Vermont’s public schools, part of a broader freeze of more than $6 billion nationwide for after-school and summer programs and English language instruction.
Funds for these programs were supposed to be distributed on July 1. But the U.S. Department of Education alerted the state Agency of Education they were holding the funds back “on the evening of June 30,” according to a press release by the Agency of Education.
The federal department told state education officials they will conduct a review of the programs, but did not provide a timeline for when that would be completed, according to the agency’s press release.
The abrupt pause in funding will likely disrupt local school districts’ operations. Those federal funds are built into local districts’ budgets for the 2025-26 school year, according to the release.
Vermont Secretary of Education Zoie Saunders said in the release the decision to withhold these funds, “disrupts districts’ ability to staff critical positions and provide a wide range of programming, including efforts to reduce chronic absenteeism and improve literacy outcomes.”
“This decision also contributes to a culture of uncertainty that takes away from the important work our schools need to focus on to support our students,” Saunders said.
Six federal grant programs were affected by the funding pause, according to the Agency of Education, including programs to provide instructional and support services to migrant children and their families.
The funds supported the University of Vermont-run Vermont Migrant Education Program that serves children who have relocated alone or with their families to obtain seasonal or temporary employment in agriculture, the Agency of Education release said.
Another program has supported instructional services and supports within school districts for English language learners. Those grant dollars were used to fund multilingual liaisons to help families integrate into their schools and communities through summer school and after-school English language services.
Other federally funded programs helped finance mentoring programs and professional development for teachers. The state agency said in its release the programs were “essential to improving academic outcomes as well as supporting the retention of effective educators.”
Another program supported programming for mental health services, which the state agency said was critical to reducing chronic absenteeism.
The Agency of Education said it was “actively working with districts to mitigate the impact of this decision by conducting outreach and providing one-on-one intensive support to the field.”
“The Agency is proud of the critical investments that Vermont public schools have made using these federal funds and will continue to support districts in navigating the uncertainty in the federal funding landscape,” the agency said in its release.

(Aristide Economopoulos/NJ Monitor)More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.
“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.
Gun-industry companies and groups give $2 million to help build state-owned shooting range

Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

But people are far more likely to win their cases — and not get deported — with one.
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Renata Daou to discuss her article, “A lack of immigration lawyers in CT means big court backlogs,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Renata’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Renata. You say a shortage of judges and immigration court staff has been an issue during the Biden administration, but it hasn’t been discussed much since President Trump ramped up his mass deportation policy. So what prompted you to do this analysis, and what do the numbers show?
RD: So it wasn’t much of a matter who the president was when I started doing the analysis. It was last year that I went to a self-representation clinic that groups were hosting in Hartford, in a church. So I just went, kind of like, to see what it was about. And when I was there, I was talking to the people who were hosting the clinic and the lawyers that were there, and I was like, ‘Oh, why are you doing this? How many people are usually coming?’ And I was just chatting with them. And, one thing that they told me that caught my attention was that they were doing this because a lot of these people who are coming to the clinics wanted to be represented by lawyers, but they couldn’t find anyone available, or they didn’t have the money to afford a lawyer. But this clinic is free, so that was an option for them.
And one of the lawyers that I was talking to was quite frustrated, because she was like, there are too many people. Like, I cannot handle more cases than I already have. There are way more people than like, and all of us can. Even if we try to take as many people as we can, it’s just impossible. So I was wondering if that is a problem across Connecticut? Is this a Hartford problem? I remembered that last year, the problem seemed to be a bit worse. I remember that Connecticut was like, maybe, like 12, in the ranking of not being represented. So it was actually worse last year than it is this year. So I remember that I looked at that and I was like, wow, that wasn’t like something that I really expected for Connecticut. I didn’t know that there was, like the shortage. So I just started talking to a bunch of different lawyers about their experience. Looked at the data like and that’s how it came to be.
WSHU: It’s interesting that the backlog has actually gone down from 46,000 in 2024 to 42,364. Is that from 2023 to 2024, or is this the 2025 number?
RD: I believe those are like pending cases.
WSHU: Pending cases, yes, it’s going down. The number of pending cases is going down.
RD: Yeah. It kind of spiked in 2023 and 2024, and now it’s decreasing a little bit.
WSHU: Now, why is that happening? Do you have any ideas?
RD: So I talked to a few of the lawyers about why they thought this was happening. But the maximum that I can say is just like anecdotal evidence, there isn’t really a set answer as to why it was going down from 2024 to 2025 when I talked to them. I know that some of them are like, maybe, like student clinics. They’re representing these people, and they’re trying to take on more and more people. It’s just like people rushing; the process is just like trying to get it done faster. But no one really knows.
WSHU: You visited the immigration court in Hartford. What was your experience? What was the process like?
RD: I went to a merits hearing. For most people, it was either the first or second hearing. So basically, what happened was that the judge was asking, like, ‘Oh, have you filed for asylum?’ Most people had already filled out the application. So he would ask, like, ‘Do you have a lawyer?’ Most people didn’t. So he was just setting another court date. But of course, he couldn’t be sitting forever. So like, for most of them, they’re like, Okay, next time they come, we third our lawyer, we’re gonna go through with the process. So it wasn’t when they actually presented all the evidence. It was just like those initial hearings.
WSHU: How difficult is it for someone in immigration court to represent themselves without a lawyer? What difference does having a lawyer make in an immigration case?
RD: Your success rate if you have a lawyer is way higher than if you don’t have a lawyer. I believe it’s just like the knowledge of the law, because, like, a lot of people don’t know, like, what documents they need to fill, what programs they are eligible for, because there’s a lot of different visas that you can apply in the US. There are a lot of different programs that you can qualify for, depending on your situation. And if you have just arrived in a new country, some people speak English. Some people don’t. If you just like, arriving and you don’t really know where to start, what you’re eligible for, it’s kind of like, hard to create a case and to have all this documentation ready and prepared, if you’re doing all this by yourself, and you don’t even know what the process looks like, if you’re like, going completely like blank, I don’t know. You think, like, realistically, like, what are the chances that you’re actually going to be able to, like, defend yourself against, for example, like the government lawyer who knows the house, and those are the programs, and knows everything.
WSHU: You’re not on the same level as them.
RD: Yeah, and having a lawyer who knows all these processes and everything you’re eligible for makes a huge difference.
WSHU: What’s the situation? Is it getting better? Is it getting worse? What’s your takeaway from doing this analysis?
RD: It’s kind of difficult to say if it’s getting better or not. I think the backlog might be coming down.
WSHU: Could that be because there are fewer people who are going through immigration court these days, because a lot of people are self-deporting?
RD: I don’t know how many people are self-deporting. I would say that I think it’s just, like, going down, just because, like I said, a lot of people cannot find lawyers. So, the cases get resolved quickly.
WSHU: You spoke to some lawyers. How do they feel about the future of immigration courts, for people who have to go through immigration court? I have Melissa here who says, “The biggest thing I wish people knew is just how wonderful my clients are, just how wonderful the immigration immigrant communities in our state and throughout the country are.” So they feel that if people got to know the immigrants, they would be less supportive of the harsh way that immigrants are being treated right now.
RD: Yeah, I was going to say that, like when it comes to the lawyers, all of them are very passionate about what they do, because this is a type of law that the like, financial return, for example, if you compare to corporate stuff litigation, you make way less money and the stress. So from what I saw, like the people who are in this type of work, they actually really passionate about getting their clients to get a better life and all of that, so that you can tell that these people are in this type of job, because especially those who are doing a lot of pro bono work.
Yes, I’m not sure how much they’re making, but the people cannot pay for the services. Like an immigration lawyer, if you’re paying out of pocket, it might cost $20,000; most people cannot afford that. So they’re very passionate about it, and they want their clients to succeed. But I also like the laws keep changing really fast, so it’s kind of, okay, how are we going to keep up with this? How many people can we truly represent and not leave them hanging? So there’s this balance.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/npr.brightspotcdn-1-1024x683.webp,,,2025-07-02 12:25:21.707352

Uthmeier says they need to reverse that vote, or face the possibility that Gov. Ron DeSantis will remove commissioners from office. In a letter add[...]","Screenshot of Key West Police Chief Sean Brandenburg speaking to City Commission on June 30, 2025.Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier says the Key West City Commission violated Florida law by voiding its police department’s 287(g) agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) earlier this week.
Uthmeier says they need to reverse that vote, or face the possibility that Gov. Ron DeSantis will remove commissioners from office.
In a letter addressed to the seven members of the Key West City Commission, Uthmeier says that by declaring the Key West Police Department’s existing 287(g) agreement void, “Key West has made itself a sanctuary city.”
Sanctuary cities have been banned in Florida since 2019.
“Prohibiting its police officers from receiving the necessary federal training to adequately enforce U.S. immigration laws not only prevents city police from enforcing current federal immigration law but also effectively prevents the city police department from participating in federal immigration operations,” Uthmeier writes.
“In this instance, however, it’s even worse. The Commission didn’t merely prevent the Police Department from entering a 287(g) agreement; it affirmatively voided an existing 287(g) agreement under which the Police Department was actively operating. Bad policy, and illegal.”
The Key West City Commission voted 6-1 on Monday night to void the agreement, put in place by the city’s chief of police, Sean Brandenburg, on March 4, with City Manager Brian Barroso’s knowledge but not the approval of city commissioners.
Several commissioners said on Monday night that they only learned of the agreement recently, calling the decision by the city manager to give approval “improper.”
Brandenburg told the City Commission on Monday night that he began receiving emails about the 287(g) agreements from the Florida Police Chiefs Association earlier this year. He said he also received phone calls from members of the Florida Sheriffs Association telling him that signing the agreement was mandatory “and that I should start moving forward.”
“Shortly thereafter, I was advised that the governor had laid out exactly how he could now remove a police chief from office if we did not enter into a 287(g) agreement,” he said. “This obviously made the situation more urgent for me. I found the most up-to-date version and brought it to [the] legal [department] for approval.”
The resolution approved by the Key West City Commission requests that Barrosso and Brandenburg “refrain” from entering into any new agreements until the courts have ruled on the obligations imposed on local governments. And it affirms that the Key West Police Department must assist federal immigration activities “when requested.”
As of July 1, ICE has signed 744 memorandums of agreement with local law enforcement agencies for 287(g) programs covering 40 states, including more than 280 with counties or cities in Florida, according to ICE’s website. That includes every sheriff’s office in the state.
This is not the first time that Uthmeier has threatened local elected officials. In March, Uthmeier warned three members of the Fort Myers city council that the governor could remove them from office if they didn’t allow the city police to question people about their immigration status and detain those subject to deportation.
“The City Commission must immediately reverse its June 30, 2025, action and allow the Police Department to resume cooperative engagement with ICE under its 287(g) agreement,” Uthmeier writes. “Failure to take corrective action will result in the enforcement of all applicable civil and criminal penalties, including removal from office by the Governor pursuant to section 908.107, Florida Statutes, and the Florida Constitution.”

“Any seam that had an issue where there was water leakage has already been fixed overnight,” DeSantis’ communications director, Bryan Griffin, told reporters following a press conference Wednesday.
The governor’s spokesperson also said the Florida Division of Emergency Management is in charge of the site at the Miami-Dade Collier Training and Transition Airport with federal oversight from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
FDEM spokesperson Stephanie Hartman wrote in a statement that vendors had tightened any seams at the base of the structures that allowed water to come in during the storm. She described the water intrusion as minimal.

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Provisions in the new tax and spending bill passed by the U.S. Senate early Tuesday would go even further than the House bill in removing health care and other benefits from immigrants with legal status.
The House version of the massive tax and spending bill penalized states providing health care for some immigrants with legal status as well as those that chose to spend state money to enroll immigrants without legal status in Medicaid.
But the Senate bill is even tougher on immigrants here legally and illegally, reducing benefits for most refugees and immigrants on humanitarian parole, including Afghans and Ukrainians who helped the United States in wars overseas and in return were promised safe haven and a safety net in the United States.
The Senate bill also cuts state reimbursement for emergency care in the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That would force those states to pay more for emergency care for immigrants, cut back services or drop out of Medicaid expansion, a potentially catastrophic move for low-income U.S. citizens as well as new immigrants.
The bill passed with three dissenting Republican votes, from U.S. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Vice President JD Vance broke the tie. The bill, officially the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” now returns to the House for final passage before going to President Donald Trump to be signed.
Advocates and experts see repercussions as refugees and other legal immigrants lose health insurance and turn to already-stressed hospitals and charities for help. It could be a nail in the coffin for some rural hospitals that are in financial trouble and scaling back services. Hospitals are required to serve anyone who arrives for emergency care, regardless of their ability to pay.
“In our state, it’s going to be absolutely devastating for rural hospitals,” said Kate Woomer-Deters, a senior attorney at the North Carolina Justice Center’s Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Refugees are not going to go home just because they lost their health care coverage. They’re still going to be showing up at the door of hospitals and clinics needing care.”
Some groups, such as Afghans, Ukrainians and Iraqis, were often brought here after helping the U.S. in war efforts, putting their lives in danger and making life in their home country untenable.
“In the case of the Afghans, this is pretty much a knife in the back to those folks who helped the United States when the United States needed help in their country,” said David Meyer, a board member of the Bloomington Refugee Support Network in Indiana, where he personally helps seven refugee families from Afghanistan, Honduras, Iraq, Nicaragua and Syria.
The Senate bill takes Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and even food stamps off the table for most refugees. There are a few narrow exceptions for people with green cards, some Cuban migrants waiting for citizenship, and some Micronesians and Marshall Islands natives with treaty rights, said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
That also applies to immigrants with legal status who don’t have green cards: people with asylum, immigrant victims of domestic violence, immigrant victims of sex trafficking and parolees — such as Afghans — admitted due to urgent humanitarian reasons, as well as to refugees.










It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.


– Shelby Gonzales, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities


“There’s going to be more emergency health care needs because uninsured people will be delaying care,” Gonzales said. “It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.”
The bill also cuts funding for expansion states to pay for emergency care in hospitals. Increased costs could force some states to drop Medicaid expansion altogether, spreading the pain to low-income U.S. citizens as well, Gonzales said.
“It’s one more reason states are looking at their budgets and they’re having to make decisions about their Medicaid expansion program,” Gonzales said.
In Indiana, Meyer said, Afghan women especially often need food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to get by at first. It takes them a long time to learn to read and write since they were not allowed to attend any school under the Taliban.
“They arrived in our community totally illiterate in their native language and starting from scratch learning English, so that’s a huge impediment to being gainfully employed,” Meyer said. Even once they’ve become self-sufficient enough to get off food stamps and Medicaid, many still need the support of the Affordable Care Act to get health care.
Removing all subsidized health care “would have a devastating effect on those families, and not just Afghans but Syrians, people from the Democratic Republic of Congo and others that have been relocated to south-central Indiana,” Meyer said.
Indiana hosted more than 10,500 of the nearly 460,000 refugees who arrived in the United States between 2013 and 2023, according to a 2023 report from the nonprofit Immigration Research Initiative. In fiscal 2024, another 1,380 arrived in Indiana, mostly from Congo and Burma, but including 90 people from Afghanistan, according to State Department records.

In North Carolina, there were 276 new Afghan refugees in fiscal 2024 among 2,730 total new refugees. Even professional Afghans such as doctors and lawyers struggle at first in low-wage jobs, said Woomer-Deters, of the North Carolina Justice Center. It takes time for them to get accreditation and language skills to practice their professions here, she said.
“A lot of these folks need their food stamps, Medicaid — they need these programs for an adjustment period when they get here. And these are people we’ve invited to come and have vetted,” she said.
A Congressional Budget Office report June 29 estimated that almost 12 million people, including 1.4 million immigrants covered by state-only programs, would lose health insurance under the Senate plan.
A Republican response to an earlier CBO report emphasized that the bill would save states $13.1 billion in Medicaid spending over 10 years, “freeing up resources they can choose to reinvest to further strengthen care for the most vulnerable Americans.”
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, however, called that conclusion misleading in its own response in turn.
“These savings would largely result from millions of people losing health coverage — hardly an outcome worth celebrating,” the response said.
Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, said there was one small positive change in the Senate version compared to the House version.
States will no longer be penalized for using the option to cover some immigrant children and pregnant women.
And the Senate version would not penalize expansion states for offering Medicaid to immigrants on humanitarian parole, but only because that help for parolees was ended in entirely, along with help for refugees and other kind of immigrants with legal status who lack green cards, Cuello said.
“In other words, they are blocking all paths to health care,” Cuello said in an emailed statement. “This is not an attack on the undocumented. It’s an attack on lawfully present immigrants.”

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Performance indicators released Friday show Louisiana’s economy shrank by 1.7% over the first few months of 2025 and is moving in what one expert called a “sideways” direction marked by sluggish growth and contractions at both the state and national levels. However, it’s not yet in recession territory, analysts say. 
New first-quarter data that became available last week showed the U.S. economy slowed further than analysts had initially thought. U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), which measures the total value of the goods and services produced, shrunk for the first time since 2022 and Louisiana posted the worst GDP rate in the Southeast region.
With a shrinkage of -1.7% GDP for the first quarter, Louisiana dropped in the state rankings from 15th to 38th, according to a U.S. Department of Commerce report released Friday. The sectors performing the worst included minerals extraction (mining, quarrying and oil and gas drilling), construction and finance and insurance. 
Louisiana economist Loren Scott said there is broad consensus that President Donald Trump’s tariffs are a big cause of the economic contraction. 
Trump’s tariff threats prompted American businesses to stock up on products, causing a surge of foreign imports into the U.S. that far exceeded the production of American-made goods and services, Scott said. 
Still, Scott is expecting GDP growth to improve for the second quarter at both the national and state levels. Those figures are set to be released at the end of July.  
  Real gross domestic product decreased in 39 states in the first quarter of 2025, with the percent change ranging from 1.7% at an annual rate in South Carolina to –6.1 percent in Iowa and Nebraska, according to statistics released today by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis)
“The second quarter is gonna be totally reversed,” he said, though he hedged his forecast with a caveat. “If the tariffs stay in place, you’re going to see the economy slow down and inflation creep back up.”
David Dismukes, an economist with Acadian Consulting Group in Baton Rouge, was less optimistic, pointing to signs of inflation already increasing and a tight labor market. He expects both indicators to remain problematic for the remainder of the year with Louisiana continuing to mirror the U.S. economy.  
“We’ve been moving pretty much sideways,” Dismukes said. “I don’t think the economy is very strong … though we haven’t quite entered recession territory.” 
A U.S. Department of Commerce report released Thursday indicated that inflation ticked up in May. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Federal Reserve’s inflation reading to track the prices of goods and services, has risen 3.7% from December, bringing the average annual inflation rate to 2.4% nationally and 2% for Louisiana and the southern region. 
The main inflation culprit continued to be food and grocery prices. The cost of food, overall, in Louisiana has increased 2.8% since May of last year. That includes a 3.6% hike on food from restaurants and a 2.2% hike on groceries over the same period, according to the Consumer Price Index.
Core inflation, which excludes food and energy to more accurately measure long-term trends, posted a 0.2% spike in May, increasing the state’s annual core inflation by 2.5% since last year.
Rising prices for goods and services often leads to wage growth. Wages on average began outpacing inflation over a year ago and continue to do so, though they have held steady at 4.3% since February, according to a Fed wage growth tracker. 
There are other signs of uncertainty on the horizon. After several months of gains, the average personal income of Americans fell 0.4% in May. And more significantly, consumer spending fell to unexpected levels, according to a Commerce Department report released Friday.  
The downturn in consumer spending is what pulled down the GDP, signaling there was more uncertainty in the economy than most had thought, Scott said. 
“The business sector doesn’t like uncertainty,” Scott said. “Uncertainty is the bane of economic growth.”
Until now, spending had remained strong throughout the high inflation period that began three years ago. Following steady gains through last December, analysts had estimated slower growth of just 1.8% for the first quarter of 2025, but they missed that mark by more than a percentage point as the latest consumer spending data showed just 0.5% growth. That disparity is what caused the Federal Reserve to revise its first-quarter economic report.   
One bright spot has been the labor market. Louisiana’s jobs market finally recovered from the hemorrhaging that occurred during the coronavirus pandemic five years ago. After lagging behind the rest of the country, the state reached its pre-pandemic mark in February with nearly 2 million non-farm jobs, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That number has been inching upward, though it remains to be seen if the trend will continue or level off.
Scott said he believes Louisiana can continue to post job gains. He cited a string of recent announcements from large companies moving into the state such as Meta’s planned data center and Hyundai’s steel plant. 
Sharing a different take, Dismukes said he doesn’t see much more room for job gains unless Louisiana can grow its population. 
Complicating the labor market is a series of high-profile raids by U.S. immigration officials targeting sectors that generally employ migrant workers. One of those is the construction sector.
Dan Mills, CEO of the Home Builders Association of Greater New Orleans, said Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids have “absolutely” affected his industry. 
“I continue to hear more stories about empty job sites and builders having trouble finding people,” Mills said. 
Even documented legal immigrants are not showing up for work because they’re afraid of getting swept up in the raids and accused of having fake documents, he said. 
“The fear that is created by these officials showing up in unmarked cars and masks, they don’t know if they’re being illegally detained or kidnapped,” Mills said. 
He said the ICE raids are exacerbating what was already a tight labor market with not enough workers in the residential home building sector. 
“We’ve seen labor prices increase 38% over the last four years, and we have 350,000 job vacancies in residential contracting nationwide,” Mills said. “Any exacerbation of that is only gonna push that number up.”

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)As the U.S. House of Representatives debates whether to give final passage to Congressional Republicans’ signature tax break and spending cuts package, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer released an analysis Wednesday that indicates implementation of the proposed Medicaid and food assistance cuts could cost Michigan billions in lost revenue.
 “Republican cuts to Medicaid and SNAP will rip healthcare away from our most vulnerable friends and family and create a ripple effect that cuts jobs and drives up costs for middle class Americans,” Whitmer said in a press release. 
The analysis highlighted three reports, the first from the Washington Center for Economic Growth. Compiled by Professor Robert Manduca of the University of Michigan, the report indicates Medicaid amounts to an average of 11.2% of the economic base of regions nationwide. According to Manduca that means Medicaid contributes roughly as much to metropolitan Detroit as the auto industry. 
Additionally, the report says many recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, would no longer be able to afford their groceries, resulting in grocery stores losing revenue and impacting their ability to pay their employees, as well as buy food from suppliers, ultimately impacting farmers and other food manufacturers.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Another report cited by Whitmer, this one from the Commonwealth Fund, estimates that if the cuts to Medicaid and SNAP proposed in the GOP budget bill are allowed to take effect, Michigan’s gross domestic product would drop by $3.57 billion by 2029. A third report from the Michigan Health and Hospital Association found that the hospital industry in the state could see up to 17,300 jobs in health care cut, with more than 16,000 others indirectly tied to the industry also slashed.
“The cuts to Medicaid included in this bill will result in the loss of healthcare access throughout all of Michigan,” Brian Peters, CEO of Michigan Health & Hospital Association, said in the news release. “Healthcare providers will be forced to reduce services, impacting all Michiganders and harming the health and wellness of our communities.” 
The legislation, dubbed the “big, beautiful bill” by President Donald Trump, would extend the 2017 tax cuts for wealthier Americans passed during his first term, which would be offset by vastly scaling back spending from the federal government.
Whitmer, in the press release, said that Republican cuts to Medicaid, combined with the loss of $2.95 billion in direct federal funding, Michigan faces a total loss of more than $4.5 billion in gross domestic product as well as 41,500 total jobs. The job losses alone, she said, means Michigan would lose out on $319 million in state and local tax revenue. 
“With fewer people able to afford groceries or pay their hospital bill, local communities will lose spending, business, and jobs. Raising costs for working families to pay for a tax cut for the rich is unacceptable,” Whitmer said. “I’ll keep working with anyone to lower costs, create jobs, and protect access to affordable, quality health care.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AMR_1282-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-02 12:25:21.707352

Twenty-two businesses and nonprofits across Delaware have been awarded grants through the Delaware Grocery Initiative, part of the state’s effort to fight food insecurity and expand access to nutritious food in underserved communities.
The initiative, also known as the First State Food System Grants, is run by the Delaware Division of Small Business (DSB) and aims to support food access in areas classified as food deserts or at risk of becoming so.
Grants ranging from $5,000 to $12,500 were awarded, with a total of $25,000 distributed in this round of funding.

The money will help recipients improve supply chains, expand cold storage, and strengthen partnerships among community-based food providers.
“The Delaware Grocery Initiative is about bolstering economic development and uplifting some of our most vulnerable communities,” said State Senator Darius Brown, who sponsored the legislation that created the program. “Access to nutritious food is essential for living a long and healthy life. This program ensures that critical component of personal health is a reality for all Delawareans, regardless of their tax bracket or the neighborhood they live in.”
More than 50 applications were submitted for this round of funding. DSB officials said they prioritized projects that focused on infrastructure improvements such as food aggregation, transportation, and storage—key elements in strengthening Delaware’s local food system.
Among the 22 grant recipients are organizations like Native Roots Farm Foundation, Lutheran Community Services, The HOPP, Jefferson Street Center, and YWCA Delaware.
The list also includes small businesses like Woodenhawk Farms Inc., Forever Freeze Co., and Farmacy Market.
All projects supported by this grant must be completed by December 31, 2025.
Since the program began in 2022, it has awarded more than $1.9 million to fund 39 projects throughout the state.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-02-at-11.48.12-AM.png,,,2025-07-02 12:25:21.707352

(Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)In a 4-3 decision, Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the state’s 1849 law banning abortion had been “impliedly repealed” by the Legislature when it passed laws over the past half century “regulating in detail the ‘who, what, where, when, and how’” of abortion. 
The Court’s majority opinion, authored by Justice Rebecca Dallet and joined by Justices Ann Walsh Bradley, Jill Karofsky and Janet Protasiewicz, finds that the Legislature could not have passed laws regulating abortion access if the 1849 statute was believed to remain in effect. 
“This case is about giving effect to 50 years’ worth of laws passed by the Legislature about virtually every aspect of abortion including where, when, and how health-care providers may lawfully perform abortions,” Dallet wrote. “The Legislature, as the peoples’ representatives, remains free to change the laws with respect to abortion in the future. But the only way to give effect to what the Legislature has actually done over the last 50 years is to conclude that it impliedly repealed the 19th century near-total ban on abortion, and that [the statute] therefore does not prohibit abortion in the State of Wisconsin.” 
Dallet wrote that when the Legislature passed laws restricting abortion under narrower circumstances, guiding “where, when and how” health care providers could perform an abortion and outlining how public money could fund abortion providers, it was repealing the 1849 law. 
The ruling comes three years after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark Court ruling that found there was a constitutional right to abortion access and marks the conclusion of a legal dispute that helped Protasiewicz win election to the Court in 2023 and Susan Crawford win election this April. 
In response, the Court’s three conservative justices filed dissents, accusing the majority of “propaganda,” “smoke-and-mirrors legalese” and “pure policymaking.” 
“The majority’s smoke-and-mirrors legalese is nothing more than ‘painting a mule to resemble a zebra, and then going zebra hunting. But paint does not change the mule into a zebra,’” Justice Annette Ziegler wrote. “Those in the majority know better, but they do so anyway because they like the result and promised to deliver it.” 
In his dissent, Justice Brian Hagedorn wrote that the majority failed to show when the law was presumably repealed by the Legislature, saying that the opinion doesn’t properly address the Legislature’s actions in 2011 and 2015 amending the 1849 law.  
“The majority does not say when over those 40 years the Legislature once and for all repealed [the statute],” he wrote. “Was it when the Legislature passed a postviability ban? A partial-birth abortion ban? A twenty-week ban? A waiting period? A physician licensing requirement? The majority fails to say.”
23AP2362 Mandate
Following the ruling’s release, the state’s Democratic elected officials and abortion access activists celebrated the decision as a “win” for reproductive health care in the state. 
“Thanks to our lawsuit, today’s decision affirms that access to reproductive healthcare will continue to be available, helping ensure Wisconsin women today are not forced to face firsthand what it’s like to live in a state that bans nearly all abortions, even in cases of rape and incest,” Gov. Tony Evers said in a statement. “Today is a win for women and families, a win for healthcare professionals who want to provide medically accurate care to their patients, and a win for basic freedoms in Wisconsin, but our work is not over. I will continue to fight any effort that takes away Wisconsinites’ reproductive freedom or makes reproductive healthcare, whether birth control, abortion, IVF, or fertility treatments, any less accessible in Wisconsin than it is today. That is a promise.”
Wisconsin’s state and federal Democratic lawmakers responded to the ruling by saying it wasn’t enough, promising to continue working to codify abortion access in law. 
U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said she will continue to work to enact her proposal to ensure women across the country have access to abortion care. 
“Today’s ruling tells women across Wisconsin that we will not go back,” Baldwin said. “Today’s ruling tells women that our government trusts you to make decisions about your own body and your future. Today’s ruling tells women in our state that they are not second-class citizens. But, this fight is not over. Every woman, in every zip code, in every state deserves the same rights and freedoms. I will not stop fighting until we make that a reality and pass my bill to restore the right to abortion nationwide and allow women to make their own health care decisions without interference from judges or politicians.”
State Sen. Lisa Subeck (D-Madison) said the Legislature must now pass a bill guaranteeing the right to an abortion. 
“Now that the courts have made it clear that Wisconsin does not have a total abortion ban, we must go further,” Subeck said. “It’s time to protect reproductive rights not just in practice, but in law. We must pass the Abortion Rights Restoration Act to guarantee the right to abortion and eliminate the medically unjustified, politically motivated restrictions that still exist in our state statutes. The people of Wisconsin deserve nothing less than full access to safe and legal reproductive health care without unnecessary barriers and free from judgement.”
In a concurring opinion, Karofsky wrote that interpreting the 1849 law as banning abortion gives the state the authority to “exert total control” over women and “strips women and pregnant people of the dignity and authority to make intimate and personal choices by exposing medical professionals who perform abortions to 15-year prison terms.” 
In her opinion, Karofsky details the history of abortion access in the U.S. and highlights four women who died because of restrictive abortion bans, including the recent deaths of two Black women in Georgia and a Honduran immigrant in Texas as well as the death of her own great-grandmother in Boston in 1929. 
“I tell the stories of Amber, Candi, Josseli, and my great-grandmother Julia to remind us that severe abortion restrictions operate like death warrants,” Karofsky wrote. “Under such restrictions women, children, and pregnant people are denied life-saving medical care while medical professionals are forced to sit idly at their bedsides, unable to do their jobs. Extreme abortion restrictions revive a time in our history driven by misogyny and racism, divorced from medical science; it is a world that must be left behind.” 
In her dissent, Justice Rebecca Bradley accused Karofsky of rewriting history to achieve a desired outcome in the case. 
“Not content with effacing the law, Chief Justice Jill Karofsky rewrites history, erases and insults women by referring to mothers as ‘pregnant people,’ slanders proponents of the pro-life perspective, and broadcasts dangerously false narratives about laws restricting abortion,” Bradley wrote. “Laden with emotion, steeped in myth, and light on the law, the concurrence reads as a parody of progressive politics rather than the opinion of a jurist.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_8328-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-02 12:25:21.707352

Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one.
One summer day in 2017, a front-page story in the StarNews of Wilmington, North Carolina, shook up the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. The drinking water system, it said, was polluted with a contaminant commonly known as GenX, part of the family of “forever” PFAS chemicals.
It came from a Chemours plant in Fayetteville, near the winding Cape Fear River. Few knew about the contaminated water until the article described the discoveries of scientists from the Environmental Protection Agency and a state university. Given that certain types of PFAS have been linked to cancer, there was widespread anxiety over its potential danger.
In the onslaught of legal action and activism that followed, the EPA during President Donald Trump’s first term took an assertive stance, vowing to combat the spread of PFAS nationwide.
In its big-picture PFAS action plan from 2019, the agency said it would attack this complex problem on multiple fronts. It would, for example, consider limiting the presence of two of the best-known compounds — PFOA and PFOS — in drinking water. And, it said, it would find out more about the potential harm of GenX, which was virtually unregulated.
By the time Trump was sworn in for his second term, many of the plan’s suggestions had been put in place. After his first administration said PFOA and PFOS in drinking water should be regulated, standards were finalized under President Joe Biden. Four other types of PFAS, including GenX, were also tagged with limits.
But now, the second Trump administration is pulling back. The EPA said in May that it will delay enforcement on the drinking water limits for PFOA and PFOS until 2031, and it will rescind and reconsider the limits on the other four. Among those who challenged the standards in court is Chemours, which has argued that the EPA, under Biden, “used flawed science and didn’t follow proper rulemaking procedures” for GenX.
These EPA decisions under Trump are part of a slew of delays and course changes to PFAS policies that had been supported in his first term. Even though his earlier EPA pursued a measure that would help hold polluters accountable for cleaning up PFAS, the EPA of his second term has not yet committed to it. The agency also slowed down a process for finding out how industries have used the chemicals, a step prompted by a law signed by Trump in 2019.
At the same time, the EPA is hampering its ability to research pollutants — the kind of research that made it possible for its own scientists to investigate GenX. As the Trump administration seeks severe reductions in the EPA’s budget, the agency has terminated grants for PFAS studies and paralyzed its scientists with spending restrictions.
Pointing to earlier announcements on its approach to the chemicals, the EPA told ProPublica that it’s “committed to addressing PFAS in drinking water and ensuring that regulations issued under the Safe Drinking Water Act follow the law, follow the science, and can be implemented by water systems to strengthen public health protections.”
“If anything,” the agency added, “the Trump administration’s historic PFAS plan in 2019 laid the groundwork for the first steps to comprehensively address this contamination across media and we will continue to do so this term.”
In public appearances, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has pushed back on the suggestion that his agency weakened the drinking water limits on GenX and similar compounds. Future regulations imposed by his agency, he said, could be more or less stringent.



“What we want to do is follow the science, period,” he has said.
That sentiment perplexes scientists and environmental advocates, who say there is already persuasive evidence on the dangers of these chemicals that linger in the environment. The EPA reviewed GenX, for example, during both the first Trump and Biden administrations. In both 2018 and 2021, the agency pointed to animal studies linking it to cancer, as well as problems with kidneys, immune systems and, especially, livers. (Chemours has argued that certain animal studies have limited relevance to humans.)
Scientists and advocates also said it’s unclear what it means for the EPA to follow the science while diminishing its own ability to conduct research.
“I don’t understand why we would want to hamstring the agency that is designed to make sure we have clean air and clean water,” said Jamie DeWitt, a toxicologist in Oregon who worked with other scientists on Cape Fear River research. “I don’t understand it.”
 Delays, confusion over PFAS
Favored for their nonstick and liquid-resistant qualities, synthetic PFAS chemicals are widely used in products like raincoats, cookware and fast food wrappers. Manufacturers made the chemicals for decades without disclosing how certain types are toxic at extremely low levels, can accumulate in the body and will scarcely break down over time — hence the nickname “forever chemicals.”
The chemicals persist in soil and water too, making them complicated and costly to clean up, leading to a yearslong push to get such sites covered by the EPA’s Superfund program, which is designed to handle toxic swaths of land. During the first Trump administration, the EPA said it was taking steps toward designating the two legacy compounds, PFOA and PFOS, as “hazardous substances” under the Superfund program. Its liability provisions would help hold polluters responsible for the cost of cleaning up.
Moving forward with this designation process was a priority, according to the PFAS plan from Trump’s first term. Zeldin’s EPA describes that plan as “historic.” And, when he represented a Long Island district with PFAS problems in Congress, Zeldin voted for a bill that would have directed the EPA to take this step.
The designation became official under Biden. But business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and organizations representing the construction, recycling and chemical industries, sued. Project 2025, The Heritage Foundation’s playbook for the new administration, also questioned it.
Zeldin has said repeatedly that he wants to hold polluters accountable for PFAS, but his EPA requested three delays in the court case challenging the Superfund designation that helps make it possible.
The agency said in a recent motion it needed the latest pause because new leadership is still reviewing the issues and evaluating the designation in context of its “comprehensive strategy to address PFOA and PFOS.”
The EPA also delayed a rule requiring manufacturers and importers to report details about their PFAS use between 2011 and 2022. An annual bill that sets defense policy and spending, signed by Trump in his first term, had charged the EPA with developing such a process.
When Biden’s EPA finalized it, the agency said the rule would provide the largest-ever dataset of PFAS manufactured and used in the United States. It would help authorities understand their spread and determine what protections might be warranted.
Businesses were supposed to start reporting this month. But in a May 2 letter, a coalition of chemical companies petitioned the EPA to withdraw the deadline, reconsider the rule and issue a revised one with narrowed scope.
When the EPA delayed the rule less than two weeks later, it said it needed time to prepare for data collection and to consider changes to aspects of the rule.
In an email to ProPublica, the agency said it will address PFAS in many ways. Its approach, the agency said, is to give more time for compliance and to work with water systems to reduce PFAS exposure as quickly as feasible, “rather than issue violations and collect fees that don’t benefit public health.”
The court expects an update from the EPA in the Superfund designation case by Wednesday, and in the legal challenges to the drinking water standards by July 21. The EPA could continue defending the rules. It could ask the court for permission to reverse its position or to send the rules back to the agency for reconsideration. Or it could also ask for further pauses.
“It’s just a big unanswered question whether this administration and this EPA is going to be serious about enforcing anything,” said Robert Sussman, a former EPA official from the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. As a lawyer, he now represents environmental groups that filed an amicus brief in PFAS cases.
Back in North Carolina, problems caused by the chemicals continue to play out.
A consent order between the state and Chemours required the manufacturer to drastically reduce the release of GenX and other PFAS into the environment. (The chemicals commonly called GenX refer to HFPO-DA and its ammonium salt, which are involved in the GenX processing aid technology owned by Chemours.)
Chemours told ProPublica that it invested more than $400 million to remediate and reduce PFAS emissions. It also noted that there are hundreds of PFAS users in North Carolina, “as evidenced by PFAS seen upstream and hundreds of miles away” from its Fayetteville plant “that cannot be traced back to the site.”
PFAS-riddled sea foam continues to wash up on the coastal beaches. Chemours and water utilities, meanwhile, are battling in court about who should cover the cost of upgrades to remove the chemicals from drinking water.
Community forums about PFAS draw triple-digit crowds, even when they’re held on a weeknight, said Emily Donovan, co-founder of the volunteer group Clean Cape Fear, which has intervened in federal litigation. In the fast-growing region, new residents are just learning about the chemicals, she said, and they’re angry.
“I feel like we’re walking backwards,” Donovan said. Pulling back from the drinking water standards, in particular, is “disrespectful to this community.”
“It’s one thing to say you’re going to focus on PFAS,” she added. “It’s another thing to never let it cross the finish line and become any meaningful regulation.”

 Research under fire
The EPA of Trump’s first term didn’t just call for more regulation of PFAS, it also stressed the importance of better understanding the forever chemicals through research and testing.
In a 2020 update to its PFAS action plan, the EPA highlighted its support for North Carolina’s investigation of GenX in the Cape Fear River. And it described its efforts to develop the science on PFAS issues affecting rural economies with “first-of-its-kind funding for the agriculture sector.”
Zeldin, too, has boasted about advancing PFAS research in an April news release. “This is just a start of the work we will do on PFAS to ensure Americans have the cleanest air, land, and water,” he said.
At about the same time, though, the agency terminated a host of congressionally appropriated grants for PFAS research, including over $15 million for projects focused on food and farmlands in places like Utah, Texas and Illinois.
Scientists at Michigan State University, for example, were investigating how PFAS interacts with water, soil, crops, livestock and biosolids, which are used for fertilizer. They timed their latest study to this year’s growing season, hired staff and partnered with a farm. Then the EPA canceled two grants.
In virtually identical letters, the agency said that each grant “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities. The objectives of the award are no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.”
The contrast between the agency’s words and actions raises questions about the process behind its decisions, said Cheryl Murphy, head of Michigan State’s Center for PFAS Research and co-lead of one of the projects.
“If you halt it right now,” she said, “what we’re doing is we’re undermining our ability to translate the science that we’re developing into some policy and guidance to help people minimize their exposure to PFAS.”
At least some of the researchers are appealing the terminations.
About a month after PFAS grants to research teams in Maine and Virginia were terminated for not being aligned with agency priorities, the agency reinstated them. The EPA told ProPublica that “there will be more updates on research-related grants in the future.”
Even if the Michigan State grants are reinstated, there could be lasting consequences, said Hui Li, the soil scientist who led both projects. “We will miss the season for this year,” he said in an email, “and could lose the livestock on the farm for the research.”
Federal researchers are also in limbo. Uncertainty, lost capacity and spending restrictions have stunted the work at an EPA lab in Duluth, Minnesota, that investigates PFAS and other potential hazards, according to several sources connected to it. As one source who works at the lab put it, “We don’t know how much longer we will be operating as is.”
The EPA told ProPublica that it’s “continuing to invest in research and labs, including Duluth, to advance the mission of protecting human health and the environment.”
Meanwhile, the agency is asking Congress to eliminate more than half of its own budget. That includes massive staffing cuts, and it would slash nearly all the money for two major programs that help states fund water and wastewater infrastructure. One dates back to President Ronald Reagan’s administration. The other was spotlighted in a paper by Trump’s first-term EPA, which said communities could use these funds to protect public health from PFAS. It trumpeted examples from places like Michigan and New Jersey.
The EPA lost 727 employees in voluntary separations between Jan. 1 and late June, according to numbers the agency provided to ProPublica. It said it received more than 2,600 applications for the second round of deferred resignations and voluntary early retirements.
“These are really technical, difficult jobs,” said Melanie Benesh, vice president for government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group. “And the EPA, by encouraging so many employees to leave, is also losing a lot of institutional knowledge and a lot of technical expertise.”
The shake-up also worries DeWitt, who was one of the scientists who helped investigate the Cape Fear River contamination and who has served on an EPA science advisory board. Her voice shook as she reflected on the EPA’s workforce, “some of the finest scientists I know,” and what their loss means for public well-being.
“Taking away this talent from our federal sector,” she said, will have “profound effects on the agency’s ability to protect people in the United States from hazardous chemicals in air, in water, in soil and potentially in food.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3m-nocrop-1024x575.jpg,,,2025-07-02 12:25:21.707352

During the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, President Calvin Coolidge also did.","Editor’s note: This essay is part of Mississippi Today Ideas, a platform for thoughtful Mississippians to share fact-based ideas about our state’s past, present and future. You can read more about the section here.

On the evening of April 5, my phone and our community’s emergency siren both started screaming at once, jarring my husband and me to our feet. I clicked my phone and heard an automated voice begin to speak, warning of a tornado near Oxford. 
My husband, emergency bag in hand, called for the dogs to follow as we hurried down the stairs to our “safe place,” a windowless storage room in the basement. Even there, we could see angry bursts of lightning and hear the siren as it continued to wail. 
My family — as do others across the state — knows how to respond to the severe storms and dangerous tornados that interrupt our lives, often with devastating results. 
In the past, the federal government, through FEMA, has also responded. But now the Federal Emergency Management Agency is threatened by an administration that wants to overhaul it. President Trump has said he wants to “fix a terribly broken system” by shifting emergency disaster response to the backs of the states. 
Together with Congress, we need to insist, as we’ve repeatedly done in the past, that the executive branch work alongside us when disaster strikes our communities. 
*
The Trump administration is not the first to downplay its role in providing emergency relief to Americans during disasters. President Calvin Coolidge took a similar stance during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927. 
That year, months of persistent rain combined with runoff from melting snow pushed levees that had been engineered to constrain the Mississippi River beyond their limits. Beginning in mid-April, levees from Illinois to Louisiana began to crumble, and as they did, waves of turbulent water flooded fields and swept through towns.

While numbers hint at the destruction –hundreds of souls lost, hundreds of thousands of people displaced and thousands of square miles flooded — they don’t reflect the agony or suffering of those whose lives were capsized during the flood.
*
In late April of 1927, President Coolidge created a commission, headed by Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, to respond to the massive flooding that had by then spread across at least seven states. Unwilling to allocate any federal money to the effort, Coolidge instead called on the American public to donate $5 million. 
Hoover, an engineer by training, leveraged the public’s donations with the capacity of the American National Red Cross. Their volunteers provided food, clothing, medical care and temporary housing to those whose homes were destroyed. 
Meanwhile, the president stood steadfast, refusing to use federal tax dollars to provide relief. 
Or rebuild bridges or roads that had been swept away. 
Or invest in future flood-control efforts.
Newspapers up and down the Mississippi River Valley criticized President Coolidge’s insistence that the states absorb the cost of rebuilding their communities while also bracing for seasonal floods that would occur again. 
“It seems obvious,” wrote the Memphis Commercial Appeal, “that neither the head of the nation or any one of his responsible advisors realizes either the nature or the immensity of the problem.” 
The paper went on to question how a nation as wealthy as the United States could impose the “burden of tremendous loss, sacrifices, agonies and destruction,” on individual states. 
In Jackson, the Clarion-Ledger also questioned the government’s response, particularly since President Coolidge had repeatedly refused to witness the flooding in person. “Not a dime has the government appropriated. The truth of the matter is that it has been necessary to school President Coolidge day by day a bit more towards the realization of the immensity of the catastrophe.”
The public and Congress continued to demand that the federal government assume a new responsibility for its citizens, one that included disaster relief, recovery and prevention. 
Eventually, Coolidge struck a deal with Congress and in May 1928, Congress enacted the 1928 Flood Control Act. The law authorized the Corps of Engineers to design and construct projects that would control flooding on the Mississippi River and the Sacramento River in California. 
The new law also ended the philosophy that regional disasters were solely the responsibility of the states. Instead, it acknowledged that the wealth of the country would be used to alleviate the suffering of its citizens. 
In 1950, the Federal Disaster Relief Act created the pathway for states to ask the president for federal help during crises.  This was followed by the establishment of FEMA in 1979.
*
So far this year, more than 60 people have lost their lives due to tornados in the United States, including at least seven people in Mississippi. Though storms have uprooted trees, flooded streets and caused property damage in Oxford, our community has largely been spared the heartache these deadly tornadoes caused elsewhere. 
We don’t know what the future holds for FEMA. In April, President Trump appointed former Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant to a council charged with recommending changes that may overhaul the agency. 
But as tornado season rolls into hurricane season, we know that the destruction caused by these severe storms is more than any of us can bear alone. We must insist that the federal government keep its sleeves rolled up and support our communities during times of disaster.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Progressive groups are rallying around New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin after legislators moved last month to take the state police from his control.
Advocates from eight grassroots groups Wednesday denounced bipartisan legislation that would make the New Jersey State Police — now a division under the state department of law and public safety, which Platkin heads — its own department answerable directly to the governor.
They criticized the bill’s timing, coming as “federal law enforcement and judicial practices have become politically weaponized under an increasingly authoritarian Trump administration.”
“This misguided legislative effort could not come at a worse time, as we can no longer expect the U.S. Department of Justice to serve as a backstop to hold state police accountable for discriminatory conduct,” said Jim Sullivan, interim policy director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey. “New Jerseyans – and all people who enter our state – deserve better.”
Antoinette Miles, who heads the New Jersey Working Families Party, urged legislative leaders and Gov. Phil Murphy to reject the bill.
“At a time when our civil rights are under attack from Donald Trump and extreme Republicans in Washington, we need our elected officials in Trenton to be working with General Platkin more closely than ever to ensure that New Jerseyans’ rights are protected,” Miles said. “This dangerous bill, the apparent product of a political vendetta, threatens to erode the progress we have made.”
Other groups blasting the bill Wednesday included New Jersey Citizen Action, Make the Road NJ, New Jersey Institute for Social Justice, New Jersey Policy Perspective and the Latino Action Network.
Tensions have increasingly grown between the state police — the largest police force statewide with 3,000 members — and Platkin, whose office investigates fatal police encounters, oversees police licensing, and publicly reports on police major discipline and use of force.  The office issued two scathing reports last fall on racism in the agency’s hiring and promotions, which renewed civil rights leaders’ calls for a clean sweep of its top brass.
Such investigations are why Platkin should retain oversight, said the Rev. Charles Boyer, founder of Salvation and Social Justice.
“The New Jersey State Police has a long, well-documented history of racism embedded in their culture,” Boyer said. “To allow them to separate from the oversight of the Attorney General’s office is not just irresponsible — it’s an assault on the Black community. Their record with Black people is abominable, and if the legislature permits this, it will echo the same disregard for justice we see under the Trump administration.”
Spokespeople for the state police and Platkin’s office didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
Lawmakers pushing the bill have cited the attorney general’s lack of law enforcement experience, interference with the ability of police do their jobs and tedious bureaucracy in the attorney general’s office, among other concerns.
The legislation does have some tentative initial support from the NAACP New Jersey State Conference.

Sign up for their newsletter here.
Harmful “forever chemicals” flow from wastewater treatment plants into surface water across the U.S., according to a new report by a clean-water advocacy group.
Weekslong sampling by the Waterkeeper Alliance both upstream and downstream of 22 wastewater treatment facilities in 19 states saw total per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) concentrations increase in 95 percent of tested waterways after receiving discharge from the facilities. Some of the waterways supply drinking water to nearby communities.
The study also found increased PFAS levels downstream of 80 percent of waterway-adjacent fields treated with “biosolids,” solid matter recovered from the sewage treatment process and spread on farmland as fertilizer.
Research on PFAS has linked the chemicals to multiple types of cancer, liver and kidney damage, reduced fertility, lower birth weights and endocrine system interference. Now, scientists suspect the chemicals can also impair immune system function, said toxicologist Linda Birnbaum, former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the National Toxicology Program, who was not involved in the new report.
The study is the second phase of Waterkeeper Alliance’s National PFAS Monitoring Initiative. Phase 1, conducted in 2022, revealed PFAS contamination in 83 percent of tested U.S. rivers, lakes and streams. That number rose to 98 percent of the sites included in the most recent study.
“PFAS pose one of the most urgent environmental and public health threats of our time,” Waterkeeper Alliance CEO Marc Yaggi said at a press briefing after the report’s release last week. PFAS from industrial sources flow through wastewater treatment plants and into waterways of ecological, cultural, recreational and public health significance, he said.
“These wastewater treatment plants are not designed to remove PFAS, and they face significant challenges managing this pollution, while accountability from industrial source polluters remains limited or nonexistent,” said Yaggi.

PFAS are a class of more than 9,000 man-made compounds designed to resist water, grease, heat and oil. Found in a wide range of consumer products, from clothing and nonstick cookware to cosmetics and fire retardant foam, PFAS are also released as industrial waste by the facilities that manufacture these goods.
Once in the environment, they do not break down, instead accumulating in water, soil and air. That’s how they got their unnerving “forever chemicals” name.
“It really doesn’t matter how you’re exposed to PFAS, whether you eat it, drink it, inhale it or even if some of it gets in through your skin,” Birnbaum said. “They’ll build up in us.”
While advanced treatment technology to remove PFAS from wastewater exists, most facilities do not have it. None of the 22 facilities included in the study employed PFAS removal technology, the Waterkeeper Alliance said.
The report’s findings underscore the need for stricter limits on PFAS discharges from industry sources, said Kelly Hunter Foster, the alliance’s senior attorney. Absent federal standards, restrictions on PFAS discharge are left to state or municipal authorities, she said.
The lack of Environmental Protection Agency guidance places an unfair burden on cities that lack both the technology to remove PFAS from treated water and the expertise to determine the acceptable level of any given chemical, said Hunter Foster.
The result is a regulatory free-for-all. All but one of the treatment facilities analyzed in the study process water from industrial users that have no restrictions on the concentration of PFAS in their wastewater.
In 2024, the EPA under the Biden administration set its first nationwide, enforceable limits on six PFAS compounds in drinking water.
Countless more PFAS chemicals may be harmful to humans and wildlife alike. “I don’t know that any of these chemicals are completely non-toxic,” said Birnbaum, the former federal toxicologist. PFAS left out of EPA regulation are less understood, not necessarily less dangerous, she added: “If you don’t look, you don’t know.”
And the new EPA rules are now slated to be pared back. The Trump administration said in May that it plans to delay enforcement of two of the Biden-era PFAS limits while rescinding the other four.
The Waterkeeper Alliance study identified as many as 14 different PFAS types in a single sampling site, and a total of 19 across the locations. Several of the compounds most commonly found at elevated levels downstream of treatment facilities in the study are not among those with EPA drinking water limits.
Currently, the EPA does not have any PFAS effluent limits or pretreatment standards, regulations that would restrain the ability of industry sources to discharge PFAS in the wastewater they send to treatment facilities.
“The lack of federal standards makes it impossible to keep the PFAS out of the system,” said Hunter Foster.
The new report includes policy recommendations calling for nationwide regulation of PFAS that treats the chemicals as a class, rather than individual substances, and the eventual phasing out of PFAS production and use.
A complete reduction in PFAS production is critical, Birnbaum argued. “Turn off the tap,” she said. “We’ve got to stop making these things.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_2667-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-02 12:25:21.707352

The contest — coordinated by the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce & Industry and the Nebraska Manufacturing Alliance — has become an increasingly popular way to draw attention to the state’s manufacturing industry and products made in Nebraska-based facilities. Voter participation in the contest has grown each year.
“Manufacturing is so much more than meets the eye. It’s technology, agriculture, energy, and a driving force behind the Nebraska economy,” said Nebraska Chamber President Todd Bingham.  “We’re thrilled to showcase the cool things made right here in Nebraska every day that benefit the lives of Nebraskans and beyond.”
Voting is open to the public, with all Nebraskans invited to advance their favorite product to the next round. The winner will be announced at the NE Chamber’s 2025 Manufacturing Summit, this year to take place Oct. 6 in La Vista. 
The summit coincides with National Manufacturing Month in October.
“Manufacturing drives innovation and growth across countless industries throughout the state,” said Marc Hock, Pinnacle Bank president, which also is a partner in this year’s competition.
Last year, the “Coolest Thing” top honor went to Valley Irrigation’s center pivot irrigation machine. The year before that, the winner was Rocket Mobility’s all-terrain tracked wheelchair made in Columbus.
In 2022, the inaugural winner was Kawasaki’s subway car built in Lincoln to run on the rail tracks of New York City.

(Photo courtesy of Oregon Department of Transportation/Flickr)The Oregon Department of Transportation plans to lay off up to 700 employees as soon as the week of July 7, with layoffs taking effect by the end of the month, according to emails from agency leadership obtained by the Oregon Capital Chronicle.
The move comes after the Oregon Legislature adjourned for the year Friday without passing a transportation funding bill that the department needs to maintain staff and close a more than $300 million shortfall.
ODOT Director Kristopher Strickler said in a 12:22 a.m. email to staff Saturday — sent just hours after House Republicans voted not to move on a funding bill for the agency — that the Legislature’s inability to pass a transportation package to keep the agency solvent is “shocking, scary and frustrating.” 
Strickler said the email was “the hardest message I’ve ever had to send in my career.” Employees who do jobs that are funded by the state highway fund will be most vulnerable to layoffs, he wrote, but the agency is trying to save as many positions as possible by leaving current vacancies unfilled. Still, they said, between 600 and 700 employees would likely be laid off.
The consequences of the Legislature’s inaction go beyond staffing cuts, according to transportation advocates and local transit agencies, which are preparing for broader challenges to maintain their own aging infrastructure.
House Bill 2025, in its original form, would have raised the state gas and payroll taxes, increased vehicle licensing and registration fees and created new taxes on car sales to generate nearly $14.6 billion for the Oregon Department of Transportation and local governments over the next 10 years. By the last day of the session, lawmakers failed to pass a watered-down version that would’ve raised $2 billion over the next decade only for the state transportation department, by raising the state gas tax 3 cents and increasing licensing and registration fees.
Strickler said the only way out of the agency’s budget problem is for the Legislature to dedicate additional funding or provide more flexibility in how current funds are spent. He said the costs for inaction from the Legislature will be long-term.
“It’s sure to cost the state more in the long run as our assets deteriorate. And that doesn’t even account for the immense cost of losing the valuable, irreplaceable knowledge that resides in the ODOT people who have dedicated years – sometimes decades – of their lives to making our agency and transportation system safe and reliable,” he wrote to staff.
 Local officials, transportation advocates express disappointment

Some advocates and public officials are urging lawmakers to take action in a special session.
The Oregon Transit Association expressed concern that Oregonians would lose access to public transit, pointing to the financial strain and high operation costs transit agencies are already facing. The original transportation proposal would have increased the portion of state payroll taxes that go to public transit from 0.1% to 0.3% over several years. Without an increase, officials at TriMet, Portland’s public transit agency, said they have to cut 27% of their bus service, eliminating 45 of 79 bus lines.
“Vital infrastructure jobs are on the line, and our ability to deliver basic safety services like filling potholes and improving traffic conditions is at risk,” Portland Mayor Keith Wilson told the Capital Chronicle. “I urge the legislature to act quickly and deliver a solution that supports all Oregon communities, including Portland.”
Like Wilson, Bend Mayor Melanie Kebler previously testified in favor of House Bill 2025, which she said would have especially helped fund safety maintenance needed throughout Highway 97 in Central Oregon.
However, Kebler opposed lawmakers’ last attempt at a transportation package, House Bill 3402, which proposed to raise taxes and fees to fund the Oregon Department of Transportation and would not have extended any additional funding to cities and counties.
“Any revenue increase for transportation needs to be shared fairly with cities so that we can keep up with increasing demands on our local systems in the face of rising costs,” Kebler told the Capital Chronicle.
The City of Bend has worked in past years to increase its transportation funding, but it cannot do it alone, Kebler said, adding that she’s hopeful lawmakers will return for a special session.
Without a transportation package, counties will be unable to afford safety upgrades such as reflective striping, rumble strips and guard rails, according to Erin Good, a spokesperson for the Association of Oregon Counties. Investments in bridge replacements and improvements to emergency response routes won’t happen, and counties will face staff reductions, resulting in less resources for pavement repairs, pothole fixes and routine infrastructure maintenance, she said.
Brett Morgan, a lobbyist and transportation policy director at the nonprofit environmental group Climate Solutions said the package could have saved lives.
“These investments could have made a real difference for Oregonians: they would have meant fewer crashes, more lives saved, and stable transit funding that would have enabled people to get to work, school, or the doctor’s office,” Morgan said. “Oregonians deserve a transportation system that is safe, clean, and fair. We will continue to fight to make that vision a reality.”

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Provisions in the new tax and spending bill passed by the U.S. Senate early Tuesday would go even further than the House bill in removing health care and other benefits from immigrants with legal status.
The House version of the massive tax and spending bill penalized states providing health care for some immigrants with legal status as well as those that chose to spend state money to enroll immigrants without legal status in Medicaid.
But the Senate bill is even tougher on immigrants here legally and illegally, reducing benefits for most refugees and immigrants on humanitarian parole, including Afghans and Ukrainians who helped the United States in wars overseas and in return were promised safe haven and a safety net in the United States.
The Senate bill also cuts state reimbursement for emergency care in the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That would force those states to pay more for emergency care for immigrants, cut back services or drop out of Medicaid expansion, a potentially catastrophic move for low-income U.S. citizens as well as new immigrants.
The bill passed with three dissenting Republican votes, from U.S. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Vice President JD Vance broke the tie. The bill, officially the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” now returns to the House for final passage before going to President Donald Trump to be signed.
Advocates and experts see repercussions as refugees and other legal immigrants lose health insurance and turn to already-stressed hospitals and charities for help. It could be a nail in the coffin for some rural hospitals that are in financial trouble and scaling back services. Hospitals are required to serve anyone who arrives for emergency care, regardless of their ability to pay.
“In our state, it’s going to be absolutely devastating for rural hospitals,” said Kate Woomer-Deters, a senior attorney at the North Carolina Justice Center’s Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Refugees are not going to go home just because they lost their health care coverage. They’re still going to be showing up at the door of hospitals and clinics needing care.”
Some groups, such as Afghans, Ukrainians and Iraqis, were often brought here after helping the U.S. in war efforts, putting their lives in danger and making life in their home country untenable.
“In the case of the Afghans, this is pretty much a knife in the back to those folks who helped the United States when the United States needed help in their country,” said David Meyer, a board member of the Bloomington Refugee Support Network in Indiana, where he personally helps seven refugee families from Afghanistan, Honduras, Iraq, Nicaragua and Syria.
The Senate bill takes Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and even food stamps off the table for most refugees. There are a few narrow exceptions for people with green cards, some Cuban migrants waiting for citizenship, and some Micronesians and Marshall Islands natives with treaty rights, said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
That also applies to immigrants with legal status who don’t have green cards: people with asylum, immigrant victims of domestic violence, immigrant victims of sex trafficking and parolees — such as Afghans — admitted due to urgent humanitarian reasons, as well as to refugees.
“There’s going to be more emergency health care needs because uninsured people will be delaying care,” Gonzales said. “It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.”
The bill also cuts funding for expansion states to pay for emergency care in hospitals. Increased costs could force some states to drop Medicaid expansion altogether, spreading the pain to low-income U.S. citizens as well, Gonzales said.
“It’s one more reason states are looking at their budgets and they’re having to make decisions about their Medicaid expansion program,” Gonzales said.
In Indiana, Meyer said, Afghan women especially often need food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to get by at first. It takes them a long time to learn to read and write since they were not allowed to attend any school under the Taliban.
“They arrived in our community totally illiterate in their native language and starting from scratch learning English, so that’s a huge impediment to being gainfully employed,” Meyer said. Even once they’ve become self-sufficient enough to get off food stamps and Medicaid, many still need the support of the Affordable Care Act to get health care.
Removing all subsidized health care “would have a devastating effect on those families, and not just Afghans but Syrians, people from the Democratic Republic of Congo and others that have been relocated to south-central Indiana,” Meyer said.
Indiana hosted more than 10,500 of the nearly 460,000 refugees who arrived in the United States between 2013 and 2023, according to a 2023 report from the nonprofit Immigration Research Initiative. In fiscal 2024, another 1,380 arrived in Indiana, mostly from Congo and Burma, but including 90 people from Afghanistan, according to State Department records.
In North Carolina, there were 276 new Afghan refugees in fiscal 2024 among 2,730 total new refugees. Even professional Afghans such as doctors and lawyers struggle at first in low-wage jobs, said Woomer-Deters, of the North Carolina Justice Center. It takes time for them to get accreditation and language skills to practice their professions here, she said.
“A lot of these folks need their food stamps, Medicaid — they need these programs for an adjustment period when they get here. And these are people we’ve invited to come and have vetted,” she said.
A Congressional Budget Office report June 29 estimated that almost 12 million people, including 1.4 million immigrants covered by state-only programs, would lose health insurance under the Senate plan.
A Republican response to an earlier CBO report emphasized that the bill would save states $13.1 billion in Medicaid spending over 10 years, “freeing up resources they can choose to reinvest to further strengthen care for the most vulnerable Americans.”
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, however, called that conclusion misleading in its own response in turn.
“These savings would largely result from millions of people losing health coverage — hardly an outcome worth celebrating,” the response said.
Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, said there was one small positive change in the Senate version compared to the House version.
States will no longer be penalized for using the option to cover some immigrant children and pregnant women.
And the Senate version would not penalize expansion states for offering Medicaid to immigrants on humanitarian parole, but only because that help for parolees was ended in entirely, along with help for refugees and other kind of immigrants with legal status who lack green cards, Cuello said.
“In other words, they are blocking all paths to health care,” Cuello said in an emailed statement. “This is not an attack on the undocumented. It’s an attack on lawfully present immigrants.”

The costliest scam, however, has remained largely unquestioned: economic development incentives.
Providing tax breaks and subsidies to relocating corporations was agreed to be a dreary but unavoidable burden of being Southern, like sweating through a hot, humid August. But there has recently been a bit of a glasnost–an opening of debate–on this long-closed topic. Many North Carolinians are coming to understand that incentives are an irredeemable racket.
A determination to recruit northern businesses has been part of North Carolina’s political DNA for over 100 years. Long burdened by a history of rural poverty, state leaders believed that North Carolina must lift itself out of provincial deprivation by persuading Yankee enterprises to move south.
“Industrial recruitment” became so deeply lodged in the state’s political DNA that few people questioned even the most extravagant efforts to woo the cigar-smoking panjandrums on Wall Street and State Street. In the 1950s, Luther Hodges played Governor Goof Ball by posing on a magazine cover with his pants pulled down to reveal North Carolina-made underwear. North Carolinians did not consider this an embarrassment.
We’ve always been the eager seekers gazing at corporate prizes–jobs, factories, relief from grinding poverty. But we did not go so far as to directly subsidize industrial prospects until the 1990s. When Alabama won a big Mercedes plant that the German automaker had dangled before several southern states, North Carolina leaders decided that we needed to “get in the game” by providing corporate incentives. Since then, we have distributed countless millions of dollars to out-of-state corporations in return for the promise of jobs.
This policy was never based upon sound economics. Economists have long been nearly unanimous in the conclusion that incentives are not an effective economic development tool. Incentives create some jobs by bringing in new companies but destroy other jobs by causing local firms, which are placed at a disadvantage by the subsidies going to out-of-state rivals, to cut jobs on their own shop floors.
Recruitment “deals” also necessitate tax increases by increasing the demand for roads and schools, which further mitigates the benefit of the new company’s investment. States that offer incentives are like Lewis Carroll’s Red Queen, moving tirelessly but making no progress.
Still, North Carolina has offered incentives for decades. But the wasteful nature of this “game” has become so undeniable that abolishing incentives has become a topic of debate. It reflects well on our state’s political culture that the practice of providing incentives has become controversial. In South Carolina, corporate welfare is civic religion. We, by contrast, seem to be learning a lesson from a growing roster of deals gone bust.
One incentives-funded project after another has been cancelled by its corporate benefactor, with the state struggling to recover losses from subsidies already paid out.
Telecommuting has made it effectively impossible to recruit the best knowledge industry jobs, and the manufacturing plants we’re attempting to woo to our state sometimes aren’t getting built. And as the left-leaning writer Harold Meyerson has observed, non-union manufacturing jobs (which is what they are most likely to be in a state where the anti-labor “right-to-work” policy has been enshrined in the state constitution) are often not even good jobs at all. Median income in knowledge economy Raleigh is $14,000 higher than in Greenville, South Carolina, which with the help of incentives has brought in thousands of non-union jobs in auto manufacturing.
I used to think that at least some economic development incentives could pay off. Specifically, I was persuaded by the work of Berkeley economist Enrico Moretti that huge “Million-Dollar Plants” could create so many ancillary jobs that they could transform an entire regional economy. With thousands of new jobs reshaping an area, even a large fiscal subsidy could be justified.
But North Carolina has attempted to play that game, and the state has offered such lavish subsidies for these plants that it has simply become unreasonable. For example, the state offered one auto manufacturer a $1.5 billion package for a $1.6 billion plant. If the state had landed that deal, taxpayers would have subsidized almost the entire cost of the company’s facility.
This has gotten out of hand. At a time when public finances are already under stress, we are allocating scarce resources to corporations that have serially reneged on their promises to create jobs. We have spent decades playing a dirty game with other southern states that has served largely to enrich corporations that have little genuine commitment to North Carolina. It’s finally time to desist. Perhaps, going forward, public dollars should support the public good.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Money-chalkboard-Getty.jpg,,,2025-07-02 12:25:21.707352

Brian Hardin of Gering, a bill that included a provision from Hardin at Pillen's request to outlaw child sexual abuse material generated with artifical intelligence. May 30, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — As the federal “one big beautiful bill” continues to move through Congress, one provision related to AI that Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen and 16 other Republican governors opposed has been removed, at least for now.
The ever-changing federal legislation, a key priority of President Donald Trump, passed the U.S. House of Representatives on May 22, 215-214, and the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, 51-50. The House version would prohibit states from regulating artificial intelligence for the next decade, raising concern it could entangle state laws against AI-generated child sexual abuse material or the nonconsensual use of someone’s likeness in intimate images. The Senate voted 99-1 to remove the provision related to AI.
However, as the priority legislation of President Donald Trump returns to the House, the AI components could return. U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., has already introduced an amendment to revert the bill to the House version and “delete their dud.”
Nebraska lawmakers passed two laws in May related to AI that Pillen signed into law. They currently are set to go into effect in early September:

Legislative Bill 172, from State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering at Pillen’s request, prohibits AI-generated child pornography. Passed 46-3 as part of LB 383.
LB 371, from State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha, provides civil liability for sharing AI-generated or computer-generated intimate images without the depicted person’s consent. Passed 49-0.

Pillen has joined a push led by Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders against the AI moratorium and said he was proud to defend “smart, commonsense protections.”
“AI holds great promise for innovation across our economy, but it also poses a grave threat to our kids if it is abused,” Pillen said in a Saturday post on X, formerly Twitter. “State leaders know best how to strike this balance, and Congress should respect that.”
Senate votes 99-1 to remove AI moratorium from megabill

Hardin, who joined Pillen for a bill signing of the “commonsense” legislation May 30, said lawmakers could never have envisioned the world of AI decades ago when writing existing laws protecting children. Pillen said he knows “it turns all of our Nebraska stomachs because of the values of what we believe in,” that there are predators taking advantage of young people.
Said Hardin: “Thanks so much to [Attorney General Mike Hilgers] and his staff for helping us wade through these dangerous waters that, frankly, our federal government has been waiting for other leadership to happen.”
The Nebraska Examiner asked Hilgers and his office at that bill signing if the Nebraska laws would be impacted by the federal legislation. They were unsure at the time.
The governors argued that the technology is already “deeply entrenched in American industry and society” and will be used throughout society over the next decade, “for harm and good.”
“That Congress is burying a provision that will strip the right of any state to regulate this technology in any way – without a thoughtful public debate – is the antithesis of what our Founders envisioned,” the governors wrote.

The Republican officials said they support Trump’s bill and his “vision of American AI dominance,” but they said they couldn’t “support a provision that takes away states’ powers to protect our citizens.”
“Let states function as the laboratories of democracy they were intended to be and allow state leaders to protect our people,” the governors wrote.
Also joining the letter: Govs. Kay Ivey of Alabama, Mike Dunleavy of Alaska, Brian Kemp of Georgia, Brad Little of Idaho, Kim Reynolds of Iowa, Jeff Landry of Louisiana, Mike Kehoe of Missouri, Greg Gianforte of Montana, Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota, Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma, Henry McMaster of South Carolina, Larry Rhoden of South Dakota, Bill Lee of Tennessee, Spencer Cox of Utah and Mark Gordon of Wyoming.
U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., who led the amendment to remove the AI moratorium altogether, had briefly struck a deal to at least protect the AI laws related to online safety and protecting children that Nebraska and other states had enacted. 
“I regret that we weren’t able to come to a compromise that would protect our governors, our state legislators, our attorney generals and, of course, House members who have expressed concern over this language,” she said in a floor speech.
Blackburn continued: “But what we know is this: This body has proven that they cannot legislate on emerging technology.”

Josh Kassmier, R-Fort Benton, with his stack of bills at the end of the 69th Montana Legislature. (Keila Szpaller/Daily Montanan)The problem didn’t start this year. In fact, it probably started, like so many things, around the COVID-19 pandemic when lawmakers had to figure out how to hold legislative meetings safely, without the spread of the virus.
But as the Montana Legislature has seen a record number of bill drafts, more interim committees in between legislative sessions, and implementation of a new database because the longtime computer server was nearly dead, the number of compensatory hours, — or additional work hours — Legislative Services Division employees have banked has ballooned to more than 15,000 hours.
The issue, first reported by the Montana Free Press, can be broken down in a number of ways. For perspective, 15,000 hours is roughly the equivalent of two-years’ worth of time. In a state department that numbers around 100, that translates to an additional work-month of time off for the average full-time employee, although the director of Legislative Services, Jerry Howe, notes that the comp time is not necessarily evenly distributed among all of its employees.
However, the burgeoning number of comp-time hours is an issue that continues to grow, and recently Howe and the Legislative Council, the bipartisan committee that manages the operations of the Legislature, met to talk about how to meet the challenge.
Comp time, which is used as a benefit to fairly treat staff members during the long and sometimes grueling legislative session held every two years for 90 days, is a tool to avoid what would be either an oversized staff or exorbitant overtime.
However, Montana law caps comp time at 120 hours per employee, Howe explained, and at the end of the year, any comp in excess of the equivalent of three full-time weeks off is wiped out, essentially shorting employees who have worked the hours but didn’t get compensated. That thought keeps Howe up at night.
“It’s not just that this happens every two years, for a busy session. It’s that we have people who work here their entire careers. Employee morale is my top concern,” he said. “I’ve got to figure out how we get our staff time to decompress, recharge the batteries and enjoy this beautiful state we all love.”
Montana Senate President Matt Regier, R-Kalispell, said that he wants to make sure the state is fair to its employees who have worked such long hours at the behest of the lawmakers.
“They deserve to either have the vacation time or a buy-out,” he said.
One of the other compounding factors in this comp-time puzzle is that the additional time is already on top of normal benefits, like personal time off or vacation time.
  More work, same staff 

The causes for the comp time conundrum are multi-faceted: High numbers of bills introduced, high number of amendments, extra committees during the interim, and new technology, including remote meetings that take considerably more time and expertise to run.
For example, two special committees created after the 2023 session included one established to consider voting regulations and another to look at the state’s judiciary, a top priority for the Republican majority. Then, there was a special committee during the 2025 session that investigated former Senate President Jason Ellsworth for ethical violations. Howe told the Daily Montanan that the committee took huge staff time, amounting to more than 1,000 hours after it was completed.
During session, the Legislative Services Division wrestled with a new database to track and display the committee meetings, all the bills and their respective amendments. It replaced technology that had been in use for nearly two decades, but was on the verge of failing after the original software developer said that it would no longer be supporting it, causing Howe and his information-technology team to begin migrating to a new server and software that would normally be a four-year process. Instead, his team attempted to do it in 14 months.
Also, a lawsuit now before the Montana Supreme Court regarding whether junque files, which are the drafting files kept by Legislative Services for every bill and resolution introduced, are part of Montana’s public records. That lawsuit, which is being litigated in part by a coalition of media, including the Daily Montanan, has also taken considerable time, Howe said — one of many atypical but not necessarily rare occurrences that has contributed to the increase in comp time.
“None of those things can be put off,” Howe said. “One thing that impresses me about the Legislative Services staff is how dedicated they are to the legislators and the legislative process.”
Howe said Montana has experienced busy legislative sessions previously. It has experienced busy interims — the time between the legislative sessions. But, it has never experienced busy times back to back to back, seemingly without an end. That trend, Howe said, is new.
  No one solution, but several possible solutions 

Howe also identified four different options or “levers,” the Legislature has to address the problem, including adding full-time staff; buying out compensatory time; limiting the number of interim studies; or limiting the number of bill drafts or changing rules about bills requiring legislative hearing.
“We have these different levers we can pull, and we have to decide which ones to pull and when, and it will probably be a combination of all of them,” Howe said. “You don’t get into this situation with one really busy interim or one long session. They build up. They accrue.”
Previously, the Legislature has considered “buying back” the comp time, Howe said, but that measure failed this session. In 2023, the Legislature spent $325,000 to buy down comp time. This session, there was a proposal for “buying back” another $300,000, but that failed.
Regier has been both the Senate’s top leader as well as a former Montana Speaker of the House. As a part of the Legislative Council, he said lawmakers from both parties are wrestling with this issue.
He said unexpected things, like the thousand-plus hours of work for the “Ellsworth investigation,” were unforeseen.
“I hope to never have another ethics committee meeting again,” he said.
Instead, Regier said the problem of too much work is something that is being created by the Legislature, therefore the solution probably lies within the Legislature, as well.
He said that legislative leadership needs to better prioritize bills and amendments to bills — which take top priority during the busy legislative session.
“Our legislative staff has delivered. They have an incredible work ethic,” Regier said. “Sometimes, our lawmakers don’t know what they’re asking.”
For example, holding a remote session can take days of advance notice and technological hurdles for the IT department in order to ensure that public participation, mandated by state law, can be available virtually anywhere in the state.
Regier said even some very small changes could make big impacts. For example, as the legislative session winds down, some lawmakers have less to do — no new bills to introduce. Instead, they begin proposing topics for lawmakers to study when the Legislature is not in session. And the number of study bills and topics has ballooned. Regier suggested that simply walking back the deadline for interim study bills could help lighten the workload.
  Not just Montana 

Howe, who has worked for the Utah Legislature and stays in contact with counterparts from other states, especially those in the West, says the problem is one that many western states are experiencing as national issues bleed down into state politics.
Howe said that in a place that prides itself on being a “citizen Legislature,” many Montana lawmakers aren’t experts in law or even how state code works. Sometimes, ideas from constituents come to Legislative Services scrawled on the back of a napkin or scratch paper. But taking those ideas and changing laws through the state’s code can take weeks or months, even for ideas that seem straightforward.
“These ideas seem so easy,” Howe said. “But most people just don’t have the understanding of how laws relate to one another and how they are organized in code. Public policy is not a simple endeavor. If it were, we would not need to meet constantly and continuously.”
Some of the increase in work is also natural, Howe said. Montana, like many other states in the West after COVID, is growing. And that growth can challenge laws or aspects that haven’t been touched for years — if not, decades.
“The policies of the 1940s and ‘50s don’t work anymore, and the policy needs to adapt to that environment,” he said.
Some of the work increase is also related to term limits. Many lawmakers request fewer bill drafts and have a better handle on state law the longer they serve in the Legislature, Howe said. However, with term limits, legislative staff is often re-teaching or explaining the legal and legislative process to new members.
“People kind of hit their stride when they’re nearing the end of their limits,” Howe said.
Howe would love to believe that the long hours and the complex back-to-back-to-back sessions and their interims were an outlier, but he said as the appetite to legislate continues to be brisk, driven in part by national politics, he is also looking ahead. And Montana, like many other states, may be called into special session to patch budget holes created by Congress.
If that happens, there’ll be a sort of double-whammy: More demand for legislative services and less time to spend down comp time.
“We don’t know what is in the ‘big, beautiful bill’ and how will affect us,” Howe said. “But cuts in Congress could mean a special session in Montana as well as other states.”
And that translates to more staff time for Legislative Services.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_4046.jpg,,,2025-07-02 11:02:36.924430

State takeovers have been employed during the recent era of education reform aimed at closing the achievement gap separating lower-income students and students of color from their better-off, white peers. But the evidence supporting the moves has been decidedly underwhelming. 
The post As Holyoke schools exit state oversight, new scrutiny for receivership l[...]","WHEN THE FORMAL announcement came at last week’s state board of education meeting that the Holyoke public schools were being released from receivership after 10 years of state oversight, board member Michael Moriarty said the quiet part out loud. 
“Academic outcomes are not the reason we’re coming out of receivership,” Moriarty said. “We all acknowledge it, we all know that’s the work we’re going to be working very hard at doing.” 
The press release from the state education department announcing the exit from receivership touted Holyoke’s improved graduation rates, greater high school enrollment in advanced coursework, and other outcomes. But it steered clear of any mention of core academic outcomes. 
That may be because driving achievement gains was a central argument for the 2010 law that gave the state authority to take over chronically underperforming districts. The legislation, dubbed The Achievement Gap Act, was seen as a way to charge through the thicket of local in-fighting, poor management, and restrictions imposed by teachers’ contracts in order to get schools and students on track in the most troubled districts. Under the law, a state-appointed receiver is given broad power to make changes in the district, including reconfiguring schools, making curriculum changes, and overriding provisions of union contracts.  
State takeovers have been employed during the recent era of education reform aimed at closing the achievement gap separating lower-income students and students of color from their better-off, white peers. But the evidence supporting the moves has been decidedly underwhelming.  
In Holyoke, on the most recent MCAS, just 8 percent of its students in grades 3-8 met or exceeded expectations in English language arts and only 6 percent did so in math. 
One of the most comprehensive reviews of the state takeover strategy, carried out by Beth Schueler, an associate professor of education at the University of Virginia, and Joshua Bleiberg of the Annenberg Institute for Education Reform at Brown University, looked at 35 districts, spanning 14 states, that were taken over by state authorities between 2011 and 2016. The analysis included two Massachusetts districts, Lawrence and Holyoke, that were under state control at the time. “Overall, we find no evidence that state takeover improves academic achievement,” they wrote in a 2021 paper.   
While state takeovers did not, overall, lead to clear gains in student achievement, some districts did see improvement, while achievement in others was flat, and some saw a dip in performance. That prompted Schueler to explore whether there might be common features of districts that saw positive outcomes under state receivership.  
In a new paper, Schueler suggests that state takeovers that provide some role for decision-making at the local level may produce better results. She looked at the three Massachusetts districts that have been put in state receivership under the 2010 law – Lawrence, Holyoke, and Southbridge – as well as a cohort of Springfield schools operating under a state-district partnership that was formed in 2014 as an alternative to full state takeover.  
Schueler found little evidence of improvement in Holyoke and Southbridge but found gains in the early years of the Lawrence takeover, especially in math, that have largely been sustained and “generally positive to neutral effects on student academic outcomes” in the Springfield Empowerment Zone. In both Lawrence and Springfield, the takeover models allowed for more school-level decision-making as well as some local say in the governing oversight boards directing the turnaround.  
That kind of “multilevel governance,” Schueler said, might be a model that uses state authority to make necessary changes in things like school schedules and curriculum while avoiding the “potentially more negative effects of takeovers” that might come from cutting out any local voice in decision-making.  
Paul Reville, who authored the 2010 reform law as state education secretary under Gov. Deval Patrick, called it a “reasonable hypothesis” that including some local voice in state takeovers could make them more effective.  
Critics, including the state’s two main teachers unions, have called for stripping the state of authority to take control of underperforming districts. But even as he welcomed the return of the school system to local control, Holyoke Mayor Joshua Garcia said the takeover made sense at the time, with the district mired in dysfunction. 
“The temporary pivot was necessary,” Garcia said last Monday at the Holyoke School Committee’s weekly meeting. Garcia, who, as mayor, chairs the school committee, was an elected school committee member at the time of the 2015 takeover, and said he was “frustrated about what was going on in our district and happy that receivership came in to help blow things up a little bit.”  
Reville still thinks the takeover authority is an important tool for the state to use when districts are struggling to gain traction or suffering from persistently poor local management, but he said it’s increasingly clear that school-focused reforms alone – including receivership – can’t overcome the impact of entrenched poverty and disadvantage present in districts targeted for state intervention. It’s “insufficient to remedy the achievement gap in places like Holyoke,” said Reville. Of the district’s 4,800 students, 84 percent live in low-income households and almost 20 percent are English learners.  
“I think it’s a good step in the right direction,” said Reville of the measures taken under receivership, such as expansion of Holyoke’s dual language programs, addition of pre-K seats, and redesign of the city’s high school. “But a schools-only solution isn’t going to do it,” Reville said, pointing to broader factors such as stable housing for the city’s high-poverty population and adequate health care as out-of-school variables that can play a huge role in student success. 
Reville, now a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, directs a project there called the EdRedesign Lab, focused on identifying ways to promote that kind of holistic approach to student learning. If society is serious about closing yawning achievement gaps, he said, it must be willing to tackle things like housing insecurity and lack of access to extracurricular enrichment activities that put lower-income students at such disadvantage.   
“It just takes more to educate kids who have significant challenges associated with poverty to a level we recognize as sufficient,” he said. “We don’t want to reckon with it because of the cost.”

(Photo by Robin Bravender/States Newsroom)Justice Department attorneys told a federal district judge Tuesday the Trump administration will not impose proposed restrictions on birthright citizenship for a month — but that it reserves the right to “immediately” start planning for that day.
The two-page notice was filed in U.S. District Court in Maryland in response to District Judge Deborah Boardman’s demand a day earlier to know “if the government thinks that it can start removing children from the United States who are subject to the terms of the executive order.”
It is the latest twist in a months-long legal battle over an executive order signed by President Donald Trump on Jan. 21, his first day back in office, that sought to deny citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. unless at least one of their parents was a citizen or a permanent legal resident.
Historically, “birthright” citizenship has been granted to anyone born on U.S. soil, regardless of their parents’ status. But Trump claimed in his executive order that was a misinterpretation of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which he contends was never intended to apply to everyone.
Judge sets deadline for administration to put birthright citizenship plans in writing

The order was almost immediately challenged in court by groups that said birthright citizenship is a bedrock of U.S. democracy, and that denying citizenship to a child born here could make the child stateless altogether. Judges in three different districts, including Boardman, agreed and issued nationwide injunctions to block the order.
The government appeal focused on whether the district court judges had the authority to impose a nationwide ban on the order.
In a 6-3 ruling Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed the judges should not have extended the injunction beyond those people and groups that brought the suits.
It allowed Trump’s birthright citizenship order to take effect in the 28 states, including South Carolina, that were not part of the initial lawsuits challenging it.
But the high court’s ruling noted that a class-action suit could apply nationally.
That’s why the plaintiffs in the Maryland case — CASA, the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project at 15 women who are pregnant or new mothers — were back in court Monday, seeking to get their suit certified as a class action suit for all undocumented parents and their babies.
The latest filing involves pregnant immigrants living in nine states, including South Carolina.
The Supreme Court sent the cases back to the district court but also set July 27 as the earliest date the administration can apply the executive order, to allow time for the cases to be reheard.
On Monday, Boardman ordered Trump’s attorneys to clarify in writing the government’s view of what it can do under the executive order, and when.
Trump’s attorneys agreed in the filing that the earliest date the administration would apply the order is, in fact, July 27. But the court’s ruling also provided for a 30-day ramp-up period, the notice said.
“The Court’s stay thus allows Defendants to immediately begin to ‘develop[] and issu[e] public guidance about the Executive’s plans to implement the Executive Order,’” the filing reads.
Boardman also gave Trump’s lawyers until July 7 to file a response to the plaintiffs’ motion to turn the case into a class action lawsuit.

Ned Lamont’s recent veto of a sweeping housing bill focusing largely on zoning reform, several other laws signed this year will help more people find affordable places to live.
Advocates for housing affordability programs say one major achievement during the most recent legislative session, which ended in early June, was an increase in funding and capacity for Connecticut’s Rental Assistance Program (RAP).
An approved bill will provide $18 million for the program, according to Chelsea Ross, executive director of the housing advocacy nonprofit Partnership for Strong Communities.
The bill provides 275 vouchers for families with young children through Head Start on Housing, 100 for people with intellectual disabilities and 325 for elderly and disabled people, with a priority for those most at risk of homelessness, Ross said.
“That was a big win for housing stability for folks, and RAP typically serves people who are experiencing homelessness and other high need populations,” Ross said.
The new state budget includes a 9% increase in RAP funding for the new fiscal year, which starts this month, and a 30% increase for fiscal year 2026-27, Ross said.
With six housing-related bills that passed, state lawmakers are chipping away at Connecticut’s housing affordability crisis, Ross said.
“They’re wins, but they’re very small, and they weren’t things that folks were pushing,” Ross said. “They’re more of technical changes and fixes that strengthen existing practices, not things that people sort of have been hard fighting for.”
The small wins include establishing an interagency council on homelessness and a task force to study the rise in corporate ownership of apartment buildings, she said.
A bonding bill also included an annual $150 million for the next two years to support the state’s Housing Trust Fund, which would primarily go toward developing workforce, or middle-income, housing developments.
“There’s also programs around supportive housing, middle housing in smaller towns, home ownership initiatives and housing for people leaving incarceration,” Ross said. “The administration and the legislature was able to show real recognition of the need to build and preserve affordable housing at scale.”
Lawmakers and housing advocates are also looking to the future, and considering which measures that failed to pass this year should be reconsidered in a special session this summer or during next year’s legislative session.
One such measure would place limitations on the ability of landlords to not renew a lease. Ross said the push for so-called just cause eviction protections will be renewed next year.
State Rep. Eleni Kavros-DeGraw, a Democrat who represents Avon and Canton, recently said the proposal is evolving as lawmakers reconsider it each year.
“I certainly think that there were more people who understood it and were leaning in the direction of voting for it than we have had before,” Kavros-DeGraw said. “There’s something to be said for the iterative process. I think that that iterative process will be important for just cause.”

(Photo by Sundry Photography/Getty)Rhode Island now has one of the highest maximum fines in New England for those convicted of driving the wrong way on a highway or a highway entrance or exit ramp after after Gov. Dan McKee signed legislation significantly increasing the penalty into law last week.
The penalty if convicted is now a fine of up to $500 and the suspension of a driver’s license for up to six months under legislation sponsored by House Deputy Speaker Raymond A. Hull, a Providence Democrat, and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Matthew L. LaMountain, a Warwick Democrat. Previously the maximum fine was $85.
McKee signed the legislation on June 26.
“We have all seen the tragic news stories about horrible accidents occurring because people were driving the wrong way on the highway,” Hull said in a statement. “Such actions are beyond dangerous for the driver and anyone else unlucky enough to be using the road at the same time. Hopefully, these increased penalties will deter such unsafe behavior.” 
“Driving the wrong way on the highway puts everyone at considerable risk and this danger is only increased if it takes place during the night,” LaMountain said in a statement. “This legislation will hold people accountable for such hazardous conduct and hopefully, it will protect innocent people on our state’s highways from becoming victims in catastrophic accidents.” 
In Massachusetts, traveling in the wrong direction could lead to a fine between $50 and $500, the higher range for Boston’s Sumner, Callahan, or Ted Williams tunnels.
The maximum fine for a wrong way highway violation is $220 in Vermont, $183 in Connecticut, $180 in Maine and $150 in New Hampshire, according to state police officials in those states. But other charges may apply as well. In Maine, for example, an additional charge of driving to endanger is punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 and six months in jail.
The legislation received strong support from AAA Northeast. Fatal wrong-way driving crashes on U.S. divided highways led to 2,008 deaths between 2015 and 2018, according to a report by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety cited in a letter submitted to the House Committee on Judiciary in March by AAA Northeast Vice President of Public and Government affairs Mary Maguire. That number represented a dramatic spike in fatalities across the country: A total of 375 deaths resulted from wrong-way driving in the years spanning 2010 to 2014.
Alcohol impairment, increasing age and driving without a passenger were identified as three main factors contributing to wrong-way driving, the AAA report found.
Approximately 43% of fatal crashes in Rhode Island involve drunk driving, which ties the state with South Carolina for the highest percentage of alcohol-related fatal crashes in the nation. The national average is 30%.
The Rhode Island Department of Transportation installed wrong way driver detection systems at 24 high-risk areas, mostly in the Providence area, in 2015. A driver who enters a highway off-ramp activates a series of flashing signs and the system also notifies the Rhode Island State Police and takes a picture of the vehicle. The system displays a message on overhead signs to warn drivers heading in the opposite direction.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Department of Corrections announced that 35 men that were arrested and detained by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from out of state and held at the Anchorage Correctional Complex were transferred out of state on Monday.
ICE transferred 42 men to Alaska from out of state on June 8, as part of an ongoing agreement between the Department of Corrections and the U.S. Department of Justice, amid a nationwide deportation crackdown. The move sparked daily protests, a fact-finding hearing by the Alaska House Judiciary Committee, and concerns from attorneys and the American Civil Liberties Union of Alaska around the punitive conditions of detention, violations of due process and criminal confinement.  
A spokesperson for the Department of Corrections said department Commissioner Jen Winkelman was not available for an interview on Tuesday to discuss the transfer, concerns around conditions of detention, and ongoing plans to house ICE detainees in Alaska.
“The ICE detainees who were transferred due to severe overcrowding in the Washington facility are no longer in the custody of the Alaska Department of Corrections,” said DOC spokesperson Betsy Holley in an email, in which she included the italics and underlining. She added that all questions on the details of the transfer should be directed to DHS/ICE. 
Cindy Woods, a senior immigration law and policy fellow with the ACLU of Alaska, said the transfer was not unexpected, since DOC had said they agreed to hold detainees for 30 days. She also said she and several other attorneys were not notified of the transfers. 
“Yesterday evening, I flagged the attorneys that I know represent folks who had been transferred, to let them know that they were being transferred again, and but none of them had been told by ICE prior to that,” she said. 
Woods said all the detainees were going through civil immigration proceedings, and faced no criminal charges. 
“These individuals were all in civil detention, so they were not being detained as part of an ongoing criminal proceeding. They were all in administrative immigration proceedings,” she said, and a number of the men have applied for or received asylum protections.
“And then there were also a handful of folks who were waiting for their immigration proceedings to commence,” she said. “And so (they) were waiting for the opportunity to speak with a judge about either a potential asylum claim or some other request for immigration relief.”
The ICE transfer of detainees to Alaska DOC custody raised serious concerns around standards of detention from legislators and advocates. Attorneys testified before the June 20 hearing of the Alaska House Judiciary Committee that despite no criminal charges, their clients reported that they were subject to lengthy lockdowns, overuse of handcuffs and overcrowding — sleeping three to a cell. In addition, they were denied or had limited access to calls with family and attorneys, regularly strip-searched after visits with attorneys, and subjected to use of force by DOC staff members, who pepper-sprayed a unit to stop a “verbal demonstration” on June 12, the attorneys said.
The ACLU of Alaska sent a letter on Saturday to Alaska state officials and ICE demanding detainees be removed from Anchorage Correctional Complex custody, and a stop to any additional transfers “unless and until constitutionally adequate conditions of confinement and attorney access can be guaranteed.”
The letter provided further detail on the pepper-spray incident: “This ‘verbal demonstration’ consisted of detainees requesting access to their belongings, including an individual who was trying to access his property to get the phone number for his consulate. Following the incident, many individuals experienced respiratory distress, including coughing, burning sensations in their mouth, nose, and eyes, and nosebleeds, and did not receive medical attention. They were also unable to change their clothes for an extended period of time.”
Holley said in the Department of Corrections’ emailed response to an interview request that the state did not make the call to transfer the detainees.
“The decision to transfer these detainees out of Alaska rested solely with the federal government. The decision was not influenced by the recent House Judiciary Committee hearing or the letter issued by the ACLU this past weekend,” Holley said. 
“It is important to note the Alaska DOC routinely houses both civil detainees and federal prisoners. While we do not currently know whether ICE will request additional placements in the future, the Alaska DOC remains fully prepared to support DHS/ICE in coordinated efforts that prioritize public safety and the efficient use of government resources.”
The ACLU filed a class action lawsuit against the Department of Corrections in May challenging what they say is “inadequate, dangerous and inhumane” health care provided for incarcerated Alaskans. 
Woods said the DOC protocols and detention conditions are unnecessary, and violated the men’s right to due process. “The conditions that they were all held in were punitive, whether or not that was the intention of the government, and such punitive nature are clearly outside the scope of the law, and especially when it comes to the standards and the requirements for civil detainees, who are not being held under criminal charges,” she said.
ICE did not respond to requests for comment about why the detainees were transferred to and from Alaska. Woods said she was able to search in the ICE inmate locator and confirm the men were transferred back to the ICE detention facility in Tacoma, Washington, with reportedly better conditions.
Woods said detainees reported the experience in DOC custody as humiliating.
“They were being held in really substandard conditions, being subjected to pepper spray and strip searches, and handcuffs, and all of those things. And so it was really hard for a lot of people to deal with that shift,” she said, referring to being transferred from Washington state to Alaska custody. “And especially because they were also largely cut off from those outside relationships that sustained them, particularly those who, you know, regularly spoke with their children and their parents and their loved ones who were not located in the United States — having that kind of completely shut off really impacted the individuals who experienced that.”
On Friday, seven U.S. congressional representatives from Washington and Oregon sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security questioning why detainees were transferred to Alaska,  as well as the cost and criteria for who is transferred. The letter also raised concerns that “ICE is wasting taxpayer dollars, flying dozens of people between detention centers thousands of miles apart, in efforts that do nothing to help protect Americans.”

As factions in Congress go head to head over the Senate and House versions of the bill, here's what it could mean for people in Massachusetts. 
The post 5 ways Trump tax and spend bill would affect Massachusetts appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","AS CONGRESS WORKS out its sweeping tax cut and spending legislation — the budget reconciliation bill also known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — the word “cuts” is being thrown around a lot. But in Massachusetts, should you expect to see cuts to the government programs you rely on?
The giant policy bill has advanced through Congress with only Republican votes. After weeks of divisive debate, the U.S. Senate passed its version of the bill 51-50 on Tuesday and sent it backt to the U.S. House. Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson are eager to get it on President Donald Trump’s desk before his July 4 deadline. 
As factions in Congress go head to head over the Senate and House versions of the bill, people in Massachusetts wonder how it will impact their lives. 
Five key pieces of the legislation that will impact Massachusetts ↓ 
Tax cuts: significant if you’re high-income
Tax cuts are one of the most talked-about items in the reconciliation bill. The Senate version of the bill looks to expand tax deductions, including raising the cap on deductions for state and local taxes (SALT, for short). Both bills extend the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Evan Horowitz, executive director of the Center for State Policy Analysis at Tufts University said for most people in Massachusetts, their experience of paying taxes will largely stay the same, because the bills mostly extend 2017 tax policies. But, he said, for people earning between $200,000 and $500,000, higher deductions on their state and local taxes would constitute a significant cut. 
For tipped workers, about 2.5 percent of the US workforce, a new change eliminating taxes on tips could be a helpful cut, although it might impact fewer people than many realize. More than a third of tipped workers didn’t make enough money to pay federal income taxes last year, according to the Yale Budget Lab, and half earn less than $37,000 a year. This means they can already claim the standard deduction, and receive other tax credits, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit. 
Roughly 68 percent of the tax cuts in the House version go to the richest 20 percent in the US, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. 
While working-class families — the bottom 40 percent of earners — could expect an average tax cut of $361 in 2027 under the House proposal, the nation’s highest-income families — the top 0.1 percent — would receive an average tax cut of at least $255,670 in that year, according to the Institute. These figures don’t account for anticipated cuts to Medicaid and nutritional assistance, which could increase costs for working-class families.
Viviana Abreu-Hernandez, president of the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center, said she worries about how these regressive taxation policies, which see low-income people contributing a disproportionate share as compared to high-income people, will impact the wealth gap in Massachusetts. This wealth gap, Abreu-Hernandez said, is already made worse by sales taxes in Massachusetts, which have an outsized impact on low-income people. 
Medicaid cuts: significant, especially for able-bodied adults
The House version of the bill proposed changes to Medicaid that could deprive 7.6 million people of health insurance. The Senate version would cut Medicaid even further.
In the Southcoast Health system that serves New Bedford, most people are on public pay programs like MassHealth. This puts the region at heightened risk.
Both bills propose work requirements for low-income, able-bodied adults on Medicaid. The Senate bill expands work requirements to the parents of older children as well. The requirement carries a heavy paperwork burden and would deny coverage at application if people could not demonstrate that they are employed, or otherwise engaged.
Josh Archambault, the Pioneer Institute’s senior fellow on health care policy, said this type of requirement would push people towards working.
But others say limited research does not indicate work requirements increase employment. And advocates worry that many would lose health care. 
“It’s not just the feds saying, ‘we won’t pay.’ You can’t pay. These people are ineligible for Medicaid. You can’t cover them,” said Horowitz, of the Center for State Policy Analysis at Tufts University. “In some ways, it’s actually a cost saving for the state. But I don’t think it’ll be treated that way. I think it’ll be treated as a disaster … but it’s not a budgetary problem, it’s a welfare problem.”
Ultimately, Horowitz said, people who lose insurance will still need medical care, and those costs may eventually trickle back to the state. Uncompensated care costs, he said, will be a problem to watch over the next few years should work requirements pass through Congress.
SNAP cuts: will mean significant changes to the state budget
The bills look to push some costs of the country’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program onto the states. SNAP, or food stamps, helps pay for groceries for more than 12 percent of the country. In fiscal year 2024, one in every six people in Massachusetts relied on SNAP, over half of them in families with children.
Under the bills’ legislation, states would have to cover a potentially large portion of SNAP funding. Horowitz worries some states may not be able to do so, opting instead to drop the portion they’d have to fund. 
“Massachusetts is not that kind of state,” Horowitz said. “It’s hard to imagine a scenario where Massachusetts … doesn’t fill in the missing federal dollars. … I think that will be a top state priority.”
Still, Horowitz said, the money to cover such a large expense has to come from somewhere, meaning other state programs face cuts. 
Student financial aid cuts: uncertain — the House bill’s changes are significant; the Senate’s are not
One such area could be student financial aid — one of the key topics the House and Senate disagree on.
The House bill’s restrictions on financial aid borrowing include cuts to Pell Grants. Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey released a statement which said the bill that passed the House would result in 42,000 Massachusetts students at public colleges and universities losing $57 million in federal financial aid annually.
Healey, positioning Massachusetts as a hub for higher education and touting the success of the state’s expanded MASSGrant Plus program, called on the Senate to reject the cuts. 
While the Senate bill does bar students from qualifying for a Pell Grant if they’ve received a full scholarship separately, it would not increase the credit hours required for full- and part-time students to receive Pell Grants. 
Pell Grants are subsidized to help low-income students pay for higher education. The House bill would change eligibility requirements, causing reductions in aid and at least 10 percent of students nationally losing their grants completely. As the bill would eliminate Pell Grants entirely for students attending college less than half-time, community colleges would see the greatest impact.
While important, Horowitz said making up for Pell Grant funding is not likely to be a priority for the state. As he sees it, if the House policies on this won out, the state would not be able to make up the funding. 
Inflation Reduction Act cuts: significant for offshore wind
Former President Joe Biden’s 2022 climate bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, offered tax credits to clean energy projects such as wind and solar energy. That gave a big boost to the offshore wind industry, which has flourished on the South Coast. The Trump administration is seeking to end IRA tax credits, with legislation in both versions of the bill furthering this aim.
As it stands, the House bill would require all energy projects receiving tax credits to begin within 60 days of the bill implementation, and be completed by 2028, before ending the credits for any other projects. The Senate version of the bill is softer on the IRA, giving projects until 2028 to begin. 
Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey told State House News Service he was working with Republicans in the Senate to save IRA funding. Markey said he was especially focused on legislators from red states, “because 80 percent of all that funding has gone to red states in the IRA, and it’s already created 400,000 new jobs.” 
The Trump administration’s clean energy cuts could have an outsized impact on clean energy on the South Coast, and according to Kris Ohleth, director of the Special Initiative on Offshore Wind, the House cuts would only worsen those impacts. 
The IRA made it easier to manufacture for clean energy in the US, Ohleth said, but current projects aren’t safe from changes from sweeping tariffs or changing tax credit policies. 
“There’s a very small margin in profit for these offshore wind developers,” Ohleth said. “So, any half percent change in the cost of steel, or whatever it might be, will ripple through the project and potentially make the projects unfinanceable.”
As the demand for electricity soars in coming years, thanks to technology advancements like the use of artificial intelligence, Ohleth worries about the impact of slowing a “shovel ready” energy source like offshore wind, and its supply chain, for a minimum of four years. 
“It’s not just four years,” Ohleth said. “It’s four years, plus re-establishing that type of supply chain and market confidence that we are losing.”

As factions in Congress go head to head over the Senate and House versions of the bill, here's what it could mean for people in Massachusetts. 
The post 5 ways Trump tax and spend bill would affect Massachusetts appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","AS CONGRESS WORKS out its sweeping tax cut and spending legislation — the budget reconciliation bill also known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — the word “cuts” is being thrown around a lot. But in Massachusetts, should you expect to see cuts to the government programs you rely on?
The giant policy bill has advanced through Congress with only Republican votes. After weeks of divisive debate, the U.S. Senate passed its version of the bill 51-50 on Tuesday and sent it backt to the U.S. House. Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson are eager to get it on President Donald Trump’s desk before his July 4 deadline. 
As factions in Congress go head to head over the Senate and House versions of the bill, people in Massachusetts wonder how it will impact their lives. 
Five key pieces of the legislation that will impact Massachusetts ↓ 
Tax cuts: significant if you’re high-income
Tax cuts are one of the most talked-about items in the reconciliation bill. The Senate version of the bill looks to expand tax deductions, including raising the cap on deductions for state and local taxes (SALT, for short). Both bills extend the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Evan Horowitz, executive director of the Center for State Policy Analysis at Tufts University said for most people in Massachusetts, their experience of paying taxes will largely stay the same, because the bills mostly extend 2017 tax policies. But, he said, for people earning between $200,000 and $500,000, higher deductions on their state and local taxes would constitute a significant cut. 
For tipped workers, about 2.5 percent of the US workforce, a new change eliminating taxes on tips could be a helpful cut, although it might impact fewer people than many realize. More than a third of tipped workers didn’t make enough money to pay federal income taxes last year, according to the Yale Budget Lab, and half earn less than $37,000 a year. This means they can already claim the standard deduction, and receive other tax credits, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit. 
Roughly 68 percent of the tax cuts in the House version go to the richest 20 percent in the US, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. 
While working-class families — the bottom 40 percent of earners — could expect an average tax cut of $361 in 2027 under the House proposal, the nation’s highest-income families — the top 0.1 percent — would receive an average tax cut of at least $255,670 in that year, according to the Institute. These figures don’t account for anticipated cuts to Medicaid and nutritional assistance, which could increase costs for working-class families.
Viviana Abreu-Hernandez, president of the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center, said she worries about how these regressive taxation policies, which see low-income people contributing a disproportionate share as compared to high-income people, will impact the wealth gap in Massachusetts. This wealth gap, Abreu-Hernandez said, is already made worse by sales taxes in Massachusetts, which have an outsized impact on low-income people. 
Medicaid cuts: significant, especially for able-bodied adults
The House version of the bill proposed changes to Medicaid that could deprive 7.6 million people of health insurance. The Senate version would cut Medicaid even further.
In the Southcoast Health system that serves New Bedford, most people are on public pay programs like MassHealth. This puts the region at heightened risk.
Both bills propose work requirements for low-income, able-bodied adults on Medicaid. The Senate bill expands work requirements to the parents of older children as well. The requirement carries a heavy paperwork burden and would deny coverage at application if people could not demonstrate that they are employed, or otherwise engaged.
Josh Archambault, the Pioneer Institute’s senior fellow on health care policy, said this type of requirement would push people towards working.
But others say limited research does not indicate work requirements increase employment. And advocates worry that many would lose health care. 
“It’s not just the feds saying, ‘we won’t pay.’ You can’t pay. These people are ineligible for Medicaid. You can’t cover them,” said Horowitz, of the Center for State Policy Analysis at Tufts University. “In some ways, it’s actually a cost saving for the state. But I don’t think it’ll be treated that way. I think it’ll be treated as a disaster … but it’s not a budgetary problem, it’s a welfare problem.”
Ultimately, Horowitz said, people who lose insurance will still need medical care, and those costs may eventually trickle back to the state. Uncompensated care costs, he said, will be a problem to watch over the next few years should work requirements pass through Congress.
SNAP cuts: will mean significant changes to the state budget
The bills look to push some costs of the country’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program onto the states. SNAP, or food stamps, helps pay for groceries for more than 12 percent of the country. In fiscal year 2024, one in every six people in Massachusetts relied on SNAP, over half of them in families with children.
Under the bills’ legislation, states would have to cover a potentially large portion of SNAP funding. Horowitz worries some states may not be able to do so, opting instead to drop the portion they’d have to fund. 
“Massachusetts is not that kind of state,” Horowitz said. “It’s hard to imagine a scenario where Massachusetts … doesn’t fill in the missing federal dollars. … I think that will be a top state priority.”
Still, Horowitz said, the money to cover such a large expense has to come from somewhere, meaning other state programs face cuts. 
Student financial aid cuts: uncertain — the House bill’s changes are significant; the Senate’s are not
One such area could be student financial aid — one of the key topics the House and Senate disagree on.
The House bill’s restrictions on financial aid borrowing include cuts to Pell Grants. Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey released a statement which said the bill that passed the House would result in 42,000 Massachusetts students at public colleges and universities losing $57 million in federal financial aid annually.
Healey, positioning Massachusetts as a hub for higher education and touting the success of the state’s expanded MASSGrant Plus program, called on the Senate to reject the cuts. 
While the Senate bill does bar students from qualifying for a Pell Grant if they’ve received a full scholarship separately, it would not increase the credit hours required for full- and part-time students to receive Pell Grants. 
Pell Grants are subsidized to help low-income students pay for higher education. The House bill would change eligibility requirements, causing reductions in aid and at least 10 percent of students nationally losing their grants completely. As the bill would eliminate Pell Grants entirely for students attending college less than half-time, community colleges would see the greatest impact.
While important, Horowitz said making up for Pell Grant funding is not likely to be a priority for the state. As he sees it, if the House policies on this won out, the state would not be able to make up the funding. 
Inflation Reduction Act cuts: significant for offshore wind
Former President Joe Biden’s 2022 climate bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, offered tax credits to clean energy projects such as wind and solar energy. That gave a big boost to the offshore wind industry, which has flourished on the South Coast. The Trump administration is seeking to end IRA tax credits, with legislation in both versions of the bill furthering this aim.
As it stands, the House bill would require all energy projects receiving tax credits to begin within 60 days of the bill implementation, and be completed by 2028, before ending the credits for any other projects. The Senate version of the bill is softer on the IRA, giving projects until 2028 to begin. 
Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey told State House News Service he was working with Republicans in the Senate to save IRA funding. Markey said he was especially focused on legislators from red states, “because 80 percent of all that funding has gone to red states in the IRA, and it’s already created 400,000 new jobs.” 
The Trump administration’s clean energy cuts could have an outsized impact on clean energy on the South Coast, and according to Kris Ohleth, director of the Special Initiative on Offshore Wind, the House cuts would only worsen those impacts. 
The IRA made it easier to manufacture for clean energy in the US, Ohleth said, but current projects aren’t safe from changes from sweeping tariffs or changing tax credit policies. 
“There’s a very small margin in profit for these offshore wind developers,” Ohleth said. “So, any half percent change in the cost of steel, or whatever it might be, will ripple through the project and potentially make the projects unfinanceable.”
As the demand for electricity soars in coming years, thanks to technology advancements like the use of artificial intelligence, Ohleth worries about the impact of slowing a “shovel ready” energy source like offshore wind, and its supply chain, for a minimum of four years. 
“It’s not just four years,” Ohleth said. “It’s four years, plus re-establishing that type of supply chain and market confidence that we are losing.”

Laura Kelly objects to 1.5% across-the-board budget cuts ordered by Kansas Legislature,Tim Carpenter,,,,,https://kansasreflector.com/2025/07/02/gov-laura-kelly-objects-to-1-5-across-the-board-budget-cuts-ordered-by-kansas-legislature/,"Republican House Speaker Dan Hawkins lauds, Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly criticizes of mandated 1.5% across-the-board budget cut on state agencies.","Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly and Republican House Speaker Dan Hawkins, photographed during Kelly's 2025 state of the state speech in January, disagreed on the appropriateness of the Legislature's decision to compel the governor to make 1.5% spending reductions in state agencies. (Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly denounced across-the-board spending reductions ordered by the Kansas Legislature that sliced $189,000 from the Kansas School for the Deaf and $124,000 from the Kansas School for the Blind.
The Kansas Adjutant General’s Office lost $118,000 because of the budget mandate, while the Kansas Office of Veterans Services was nicked for $64,000.
It was all part of the $7.1 million reduction required by a bill approved by the House and Senate that took effect Tuesday with start of the state government’s new fiscal year. The Legislature mandated the governor take the money out of state general fund operating expenditures, which included agency salaries, contractual services, commodities and capital expenses.
Kelly said the Legislature’s preference for blanket reductions, rather than precision adjustments, was flawed because the result was “neither targeted nor thoughtful.”
“As governor, I have worked to get Kansas back on the right fiscal track and provide Kansans with the resources they need to prosper without risking the future of the state,” Kelly said. “I share the Legislature’s goal to reduce spending where possible and to increase efficiency in state government. However, the Legislature’s mandate to cut state agencies’ budgets across the board is not the way to increase efficiency.”
Kansas House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican who is a candidate for state insurance commissioner, said the governor was wrong to oppose what he viewed as the “small 1.5%” reduction in spending decreed by Senate Bill 125.
The House voted 89-36 for the bill and Senate approved it by a margin of 24-16.
Kelly said the Legislature compelled her to strip millions of dollars from state agencies managing programs that were “vital lifelines to the most vulnerable Kansans.”
The cuts required of the governor took the biggest bite out of the Kansas Department for Children and Families by stripping $2.2 million from the agency. The second-largest loser in the Legislature’s budget was the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services, which lost $1 million.
Taken together, the two agencies serving children, seniors and people with disabilities absorbed 44% of the reduction because a larger portion of their budgets came from the state general fund.
Hawkins, who controls the debate calendar in the House, said Kelly didn’t present options for shrinking state spending to the 2025 Legislature.
“This year the Legislature forced her hand with a small 1.5% across-the-board reduction,” Hawkins said. “I challenge Governor Kelly to come to the table before next session with meaningful ideas on how to make government agencies more efficient and reduce spending.”
He said if Kelly declined to present the 2026 Legislature with potential steps for lowering expenditures, “you can expect to see another across-the-board reduction.”
Typically, the starting point for annual budget debates in Kansas would be a governor’s recommended budget. GOP legislative leadership departed from precedent by establishing a special committee that drafted a budget bill for consideration by the 2025 Legislature. The objective was to set aside Kelly’s preferences so House and Senate members could concentrate on their objectives.
The final budget bill approved by the Legislature included the 1.5% across-the-board cut to state general fund expenditures.
Other reductions above $100,000 to meet the Legislature’s directive: Kansas Board of Indigents Defense Services, $919,000; Kansas Department of Health and Environment, $799,000; Office of Information Technology Services, $247,000; Kansas Department of Education, $314,000; Kansas Department of Revenue, $266,000; Kansas Department of Agriculture, $219,000; Kansas Department of Administration, $146,000; and Kansas Department of Labor, $142,000.
And, cuts to agencies with annual budgets at or below $5 million: Kansas Historical Society, $75,000; Office of the Governor, $73,000; Kansas State Library, $45,000; Kansas Board of Tax Appeals, $22,000; Kansas Guardianship Program, $21,000; Kansas Human Rights Commission, $18,000; Kansas Office of Child Advocate, $11,000; Kansas Public Disclosure Commission, $8,000; and Kansas Department of Commerce, $2,000.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Kelly-SOS-3-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-02 10:03:03.139449

Like everyone who works around the state Capitol, I was shocked when I learned of the assassination of Melissa Hortman. The intimate, horrifying violence of the act, combined with the loss of such a colossal figure in our state’s politics, was one of the most jarring events of my lifetime. As a child growing up in Brooklyn, I experienced 9/11 up close. That is the only other moment I can compare it to. 
I didn’t know Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman on the same personal level as many legislators, staff and long-time politicos who might read this column, and so I want to extend my heartfelt condolences to everyone personally affected, as well as all of those who, like myself, are fearful of an increasingly violent and unstable political environment. 
There is little in the way of eulogy I could add that hasn’t already been said. She was brilliant, kind, effective, humble and a great many other wonderful things. But in the interest of commemorating a woman I greatly admired, I wanted to write about one issue on which we shared a passionate interest: Planting trees. 
I always appreciated Speaker Hortman’s love for trees and I think it is worth reflecting on the essential wisdom that this interest imparts.
From cooling and cleaning the air around them, to reducing carbon in the atmosphere, trees are one simple and elegant treatment for so many of our social challenges. Trees have been associated with greater economic activity, improved community health and even reduced violent crime.
But far more important than their tangible benefits, it is worth pausing to consider Hortman’s interest in trees as embodying a set of values about how we care for one another and our collective future. 
A commitment to trees is a commitment to future generations. It grows from an understanding that the world we want to create may not come about in our lifetimes, but is still worth our efforts. It is an acknowledgment that the process of democratic governance is one of stewardship, of envisioning and fighting for the world we want to pass on. 
At Hortman’s urging, the state passed tens of millions of dollars worth of funding for new programs aimed at increasing the density and the sustainability of Minnesota’s urban and rural forests. Our state will be healthier and more beautiful because of her efforts. 
But her even broader legacy is reflected in the countless ways she sought leave things better than we found them, often while considering the long-term horizon in which we have the greatest opportunities to improve health of our society. 
Investments in public education, for example, might not benefit high school seniors, but they could forever alter the trajectory of young children and families. Similarly, our investments in infrastructure may take time and result in frustrating disruptions to our daily routines. But in the long run they will provide us with new avenues to connect with one another.
The speaker pushed and supported countless initiatives like this, aimed at ensuring a brighter future for all. 
She also sought to stop policies that might seem pleasing in the moment but would carry negative effects in the future. One particularly close to my heart was the Social Security tax fight of 2023. Hortman was one of a relatively small number of key elected officials who recognized the damage that a top-heavy tax cut for wealthy retirees could do to our state budget. 
As a result of her leadership, the 2023 state budget cut taxes on Social Security income for those making less than $120,000 per year, but maintained them for households earning in the millions or high six-figures. As difficult as that fight was — with many Republicans and Democrats who wanted to deliver on a catchy but universally discredited policy idea — it didn’t take decades to see the importance of Hortman’s long-term thinking: Had Gov. Tim Walz signed a full Social Security income tax elimination, the 2025 deficit would have been over $1 billion larger for the recently budgeted 2026-27 biennium, and the state would have had to put more investments in health, education and environmental protections on the chopping block. 
I am going to miss Hortman’s grounded, thoughtful, far-seeing leadership, and I hope that many others follow her example.
With so much tension and vitriol focused on every headline and latest policy battle in Washington, Hortman’s passion for something as simple as trees reminds us of a larger picture and a longer story. One in which we are not separated by partisanship and geography, but intrinsically connected through our shared planet and a fluid human history of which we are all a part. 
Trees, like much of the work of creating a brighter future, are also easily taken for granted. When we are surrounded by them, we assume that they are an unalterable part of the world we live in. Or worse yet, we don’t even notice them. But the truth is that the healthy, mature trees on our streets and in our backyards were all planted by caring people decades in the past — many of whom never sat in their shade. Another essential reminder of the great collective, ongoing effort it requires to build and maintain a just society. 
Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark committed so much of their lives to the Minnesotan endeavor of creating a better world for all. 
I don’t know that we are living up to that aspiration right now, but maybe the trees all around us can serve as a grounding reminder of all that we share and owe one another as human beings.

(Photo by Robin Bravender/States Newsroom)Justice Department attorneys told a federal district judge Tuesday that the Trump administration will not impose proposed restrictions on birthright citizenship for a month — but that it reserves the right to “immediately” start planning for that day.
The two-page notice was filed in U.S.District Court in Greenbelt in response to District Judge Deborah Boardman’s demand a day earlier to know “if the government thinks that it can start removing children from the United States who are subject to the terms of the executive order,”
It is the latest twist in a months-long legal battle over an executive order signed by President Donald Trump on Jan. 21, his first day back in office, that sought to deny citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. unless at least one of their parents was a citizen or a permanent legal resident.
Historically, “birthright” citizenship has been granted to anyone born on U.S. soil, regardless of their parent’s status. But Trump claimed in his executive order that that was a misinterpretation of the law, which he claimed was never intended to apply to everyone.

The order was almost immediately challenged in court by groups that said birthright citizenship is a bedrock of U.S democracy, and that denying citizenship to a child born here could make the child stateless altogether. Judges in three different districts, including Boardman, agreed and issued nationwide injunctions to block the order.
The government appeal focused on whether the district court judges had the authority to impose a nationwide ban on the order. In a 6-3 ruling Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed that the judges should not have extended the injunction beyond those people and groups that brought the suits.
But the high court’s ruling noted that a class-action suit could apply nationally. That’s why the plaintiffs in the Maryland case — CASA, the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project at 15 women who are pregnant or new mothers — were back in court Monday, seeking to get their suit certified as a class action suit for all undocumented parents and their babies.
The Supreme Court sent the cases back to the district court, but also set July 27 as the earliest date the administration can apply the executive order, to allow time for the cases to be reheard. On Monday, Boardman ordered Trump’s attorneys to clarify in writing the government’s view of what it can do under the executive order, and when.
Trump’s attorneys agreed in the filing that the earliest date the administration would apply the order is, in fact, July 27. But the the court’s ruling also provided for a 30-day ramp-up period, the notice said.
“The Court’s stay thus allows Defendants to immediately begin to ‘develop[] and issu[e] public guidance about the Executive’s plans to implement the Executive Order,’” the filing reads.
Boardman also gave Trump’s lawyers until July 7 to file a response to the plaintiffs’ motion to turn the case into a class action lawsuit.

The number of homeless students in California has risen in the last year.
As CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones explains, schools are required by federal law to count their homeless students. In the most recent data published in June, the state had 230,443 homeless students — a 9.3% increase from the previous year. For the purposes of this data, the definition of homelessness is broader than the state’s point in time count. 
Though some of that increase can be attributed to California’s housing crunch, schools are also getting better at identifying students who are struggling with housing. Part of the reason could be due to a 2021 state law requiring schools to train staff to recognize potential signs of homelessness. Despite falling enrollment numbers last year, for example, the state identified 21,000 more homeless students than the year before. 
Compared to their housed peers, homeless students experience worse learning outcomes and higher rates of discipline and absenteeism. But once schools can identify who is homeless, they can also offer these students extra support, such as transportation to and from school, free school supplies and tutoring.

Barbara Duffield, executive director of Schoolhouse Connection, a national homeless youth advocacy group: “Schools can’t solve homelessness, but they can ensure the students are safe in the classroom and getting the education they need to get out of homelessness.”

Speaking of schools: CalMatters’ Tara García Mathewson and Carolyn also report that California school districts are scrambling after President Donald Trump’s administration sent notice on Monday that it is withholding crucial federal grant money that schools had already budgeted for this year. 
In March Congress approved earmarking about $6.2 billion for K-12 schools nationwide, including nearly $811 million for California. The U.S. Department of Education was expected to release the money on Tuesday, but instead sent an email to schools saying it was still reviewing the funds. The grants go toward teacher professional development, after school programs, services for students learning English and other programs. In response, the state is considering suing the Trump administration.

Congress nixes AI moratorium proposal

In a 99-1 vote, the U.S. Senate struck down a measure Monday that would have included a decade-long ban on state governments from regulating artificial intelligence in Trump’s “big, beautiful” budget bill, writes CalMatters’ Ryan Tate.
Republicans joined Democrats to oppose the measure during its final vote, with some GOP lawmakers publicly denouncing the proposed moratorium as a violation of states’ rights. U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina was the lone “no” vote to not strip the provision from the budget bill.
Had it passed, the proposal would have made enforcing over 20 AI-related laws California passed last year illegal, and jeopardize 30 bills the state Legislature is currently considering. 
State Sen. Josh Becker, a Menlo Park Democrat who authored a law to increase AI transparency, said in an email that he was encouraged that Congress “came to its senses.”

Becker: “In the absence of a strong federal standard, states must retain the flexibility to advance AI in ways that do not compromise safety, privacy, or the rights of our residents.”

Incarcerated firefighters closer to wage hike

Following years of advocacy, California is poised to pay its incarcerated firefighters the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour during an active fire, reports CalMatters’ Cayla Mihalovich. 
The proposed wage hike comes with the finalization of the state budget deal on Monday, which sets aside $10 million of ongoing funds for incarcerated firefighter wages. The Senate would still need to approve the bill that would mandate the pay raise, which advanced through the Assembly last month with strong bipartisan support. If passed, the hike will take effect Jan. 1.
For the physical and mental health strains they must undergo while carrying out their jobs, incarcerated firefighters are paid between $5.80 and $10.24 per day, and an additional $1 per hour during active emergencies.
Assemblymember Isaac Bryan, a Culver City Democrat who authored the bill, said the move was “long overdue.”

Bryan: “It feels really beautiful and life changing for folks who have sacrificed to save others during their time being held accountable for whatever harms they may have caused in their past.”

During the deadly Los Angeles County wildfires in January, Cal Fire deployed at least 800 incarcerated firefighters.

Doug Robison’s 2021 donation to Abilene Christian University helped the institution win federal approval to house an advanced small modular nuclear reactor, which might be finished as soon as next year.
Small modular reactors are designed to be built in factories and then moved to a site. They require less upfront capital investment than traditional large reactors.
The company Robison founded, Natura Resources, is investing another $30.5 million in the project. Only two small modular reactors are in operation, one in China and another in Russia. Natura Resources is one of two companies with federal permits to build one in the U.S.
“Nuclear is happening,” said Robison, who retired from the oil business and moved to Abilene to launch the company. “It has to happen.”
Robison’s words are being echoed across the country with new state laws that aim to accelerate the spread of projects that embrace advanced nuclear technology — decades after the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl calamities soured many Americans on nuclear power.
In the past two years, half the states have taken action to promote nuclear power, from creating nuclear task forces to integrating nuclear into long-term energy plans, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, which advocates for the industry.
SC nuclear reboot sees interest from big tech, large utilities

“I’ve been tracking legislation for 18 years, and when I first started tracking, there were maybe five or 10 bills that said the word ‘nuclear,’” said Christine Csizmadia, who directs state government affairs at the institute. “This legislative session, we’re tracking over 300 bills all across the country.”
The push is bipartisan.
In New York, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul last month directed the New York Power Authority to build a zero-emission advanced nuclear power plant somewhere upstate — her state’s first new nuclear plant in a generation.
In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis in April signed legislation redefining nuclear energy, which doesn’t emit a significant amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases, as a “clean energy resource.” The law will allow future plants to receive state grants reserved for other carbon-free energy sources.
But no state is more gung-ho than Texas, where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott last month signed legislation creating the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office and investing $350 million in nuclear expansion.
“Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this legislation will position Texas at the forefront of America’s nuclear renaissance,” Abbott wrote in a statement.
In addition to legislative action, the Texas A&M University System has invited four nuclear manufacturers to build small modular reactors at the school’s 2,400-acre RELLIS campus in the city of Bryan.
In Texas and other fast-growing states, rising electricity demands are fueling the push.
Tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon that require a tremendous amount of electricity to power vast data centers are teaming with nuclear developers to provide it.
Last October, Google signed an agreement with nuclear energy producer Kairos Power to deploy multiple small modular reactors capable of generating a total of up to 500 megawatts by 2035. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced in December that it is also looking to reach a similar deal.
Some of the largest data centers require more than 100 megawatts of power capacity, enough to power around 100,000 U.S. households.
Constellation Energy announced last September that it would reopen Three Mile Island, shuttered since 2019, as part of a deal with Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI data centers. One of the two reactors at the plant, which is located south of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, partially melted down in 1979. But the remaining reactor reliably produced electricity for the next four decades.
“Folks shouldn’t sleep on nuclear,” Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said as he welcomed back workers to the plant last month. “They should be aware of the important clean role it plays in our energy portfolio.”
But opponents say the renewed interest in nuclear energy is misguided.
Federal money could supercharge state efforts to preserve nuclear power

In Colorado, a coalition of two dozen environmental groups, including the state chapter of the Sierra Club, urged Polis to veto the bill.
“The idea that nuclear power is a clean energy source could not be further from the truth,” the groups wrote in a letter to the governor. “Nuclear power is the only energy resource that generates dangerous waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years.”
Some critics say small modular reactors are actually more expensive than traditional reactors, when they are judged per kilowatt of the energy they produce. And one 2022 study, conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the University of British Columbia, concluded that small modular reactors will produce more radioactive waste than traditional reactors.
“There’s a pretty healthy skepticism about advanced nuclear projects,” said Adrian Shelley, who heads the Texas office of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. Shelley said many environmental groups “are just deeply concerned about Texas’ ability to responsibly manage nuclear storage and especially nuclear waste in the long term.”
 Ramping up

The United States currently has 94 nuclear reactors at 54 plants in 28 states. The oldest began operating at Nine Mile Point in New York in 1969; the newest reactors, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Burke County, Georgia, began operating in 2023 and 2024.
Scott Burnell, a spokesperson for the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said that between the mid-1990s and 2005, there were “no applications at all” for new reactors. In 2007, there was a surge of a dozen applications when the federal government began offering tax incentives.
But interest in new reactors plunged again when the fracking boom boosted fossil fuels as an economical power source.
Over the past several years, activity has ramped up again. “There are a number of factors that we are seeing drive this increased interest,” Burnell said. “Probably the biggest one is the growth in data centers.”
The commission has approved three new nuclear projects in the past three years, including the one at Abilene Christian University. It is reviewing three other applications and is discussing potential projects with a dozen other nuclear developers, Burnell said.

Texas currently has two nuclear plants — Comanche Peak near Glen Rose in North Central Texas and the South Texas Project in Matagorda County on the Gulf Coast.
The two plants, each of which has two reactors, provide about 10% of the state’s electric power, according to the Texas comptroller.
The new small modular reactors would face the same safety standards as these plants.
The project at Abilene Christian began when Robison’s Natura Resources established a research alliance with that school, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at Austin.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the project in 2024.
The reactor will be constructed at a laboratory at a different site, but its home already awaits in a trench at the bottom of a cavernous room at Abilene Christian’s Dillard Science and Engineering Research Center.
The trench is 25 feet deep, 80 feet long and 15 feet wide, with a radiation shield made of concrete 4 feet thick. When the 40-ton reactor is finished, possibly by the end of next year, it will be transported to its home on a flatbed truck.

“The future is uncertain, but we’re ahead of the pack and moving at an amazing clip,” said Rusty Towell, an Abilene Christian engineering and physics professor who is working on the project. “So I think that there’s a great reason for optimism.”
Towell asserted that the project will produce only “small amounts of low-level waste” and that storing it safely will not be a significant challenge.
 ‘What Henry Ford did for cars’

John Sharp, the outgoing chancellor of Texas A&M University, said he invited nuclear companies to build small modular reactors at the school to help meet the country’s desperate need for more power. He said it made sense to give developers access to the faculty and students at the university’s nuclear engineering department.










We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars.


– Matt Loszak, CEO of Aalo Atomics


Sharp said his pitch was simple: “Hey, we got some land. We got it next to some really smart people. Would you like to come and build a plant?
“And four folks said, ‘You betcha.’”
Matt Loszak, the 34-year-old CEO of Austin-based Aalo Atomics, one of the companies that answered Sharp’s call, said he had two employees 18 months ago. Now he has more than 50.
“We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars,” Loszak said, “which is really make them mass manufacturable and make it economical to deploy around the world.”
Robison said he’s been speaking at town halls in Abilene, a conservative community that is home to Dyess Air Force Base, for about five years.
He claims the residents are “overwhelmingly excited” about having the small modular reactors at Abilene Christian, he said.
“Texas is an energy state,” he said. “We understand energy and what happens when you don’t have it.”

,California,2025-07-02 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Homeless student counts in California are up. Some say that’s a good thing,Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2025/07/homeless-students-california/,"In the latest state enrollment data released, California had 230,443 homeless students — a 9.3% increase from the previous year.","In summary
In the latest state enrollment data released, California had 230,443 homeless students — a 9.3% increase from the previous year. 


In Kern County, the first rule in counting homeless students is not saying “homeless.”
Instead, school staff use phrases like “struggling with stable housing” or “families in transition.” The approach seems to have worked: More families are sharing their housing status with their children’s schools, which means more students are getting services.
“There’s a lot of stigma attached to the word ‘homeless,’” said Curt Williams, director of homeless and foster youth services for the Kern County Office of Education. “When you remove that word, it all changes.”
Largely as a result of better identification methods, Kern County saw its homeless student population jump 10% last year, to 7,200. Those students received transportation to and from school, free school supplies, tutoring and other services intended to help them stay in school. For the purposes of this data, the definition of homelessness is broader than the state’s point in time count.
The trend is reflected statewide. In the latest state enrollment data released last month, California had 230,443 homeless students — a 9.3% increase from the previous year. Some of the increase is due to the state’s ongoing housing shortage, but most of the increase is because of better identification, advocates and school officials said.
Homeless students face numerous obstacles in school. They have higher rates of discipline and absenteeism, and fare worse academically. Last year, only 16% of homeless students met the state’s math standard, some of the lowest scores of any student group.
“Schools can’t solve homelessness, but they can ensure the students are safe in the classroom and getting the education they need to get out of homelessness,” said Barbara Duffield, executive director of Schoolhouse Connection, a national homeless youth advocacy group. “That starts with identifying the child who’s homeless.”
Challenges of counting homeless students
Under the federal McKinney-Vento Act, schools are required to count their homeless students throughout the school year and ensure they receive services. Homeless students also have the right to stay enrolled in their original school even if they move.
For many years, schools struggled to identify homeless students. Under state law, schools must distribute forms at the beginning of the school year asking families where they live — in their own homes, in motels, doubled-up with other families, in shelters, cars or outdoors. 

Some schools were less-than-diligent about collecting the form, or reassuring families understood the importance. Often, homeless families were reluctant to submit the form because they were afraid the school might contact a child welfare agency. Immigrant families sometimes feared the school might notify immigration authorities. And some families didn’t realize that sharing quarters with another family — by far the most common living situation among homeless families – is technically defined as homeless, at least under McKinney-Vento. 
A 2021 bill by former Assemblymember Luz Rivas, a Democrat from Arleta in the San Fernando Valley, sought to fix that problem. The bill requires schools to train everyone who works with students — from bus drivers to cafeteria workers to teachers — on how to recognize potential signs of homelessness. That could include families who move frequently or don’t reply to school correspondence.
The bill seems to have helped. Last year, the state identified 21,000 more homeless students than it had the previous year, even as overall enrollment dropped.
Still, that’s probably an undercount, researchers said. The actual homeless student population is probably between 5% and10% of those students who qualify for free or reduced-price lunch, according to the National Center for Homeless Education. In California, that would be a shortfall of up to 138,713 students.
Influx of funding
Another boost for identifying homeless students came from the American Rescue Plan, the federal COVID-19 relief package. The plan included $800 million for schools to hire counselors or train existing staff to help homeless students. Nearly all schools in California received some money.
About 120 districts in California won grant money through the McKinney-Vento Act, which last year dispersed about $15.9 million in California to pay for things like rides to school, backpacks, staff and other services. Districts are chosen on a competitive basis; not all districts that apply receive funds.
But those funding sources are drying up. Most of the pandemic relief money has already been spent, and President Donald Trump’s recently approved budget does not include McKinney-Vento funding for 2026-27.
The cuts come at a time when advocates expect steep increases in the number of homeless families over the next few years, due in part to national policy changes. Republican budget proposals include cuts to Medicaid, food assistance and other programs aimed at helping low-income families, while the immigration crackdown has left thousands of families afraid to seek assistance. For families living on tight budgets, those cuts could lead to a loss of housing.
And in California, the shortage of affordable housing continues to be a hurdle for low-income families. Even Kern County, which has traditionally been a less pricey option for families, has seen a spike in housing costs as more residents move there from Los Angeles. 
Joseph Bishop, an education professor at UCLA and co-author of a recent report on homeless students nationwide, said the loss of government funding will be devastating for homeless students. 
“California is the epicenter of the homeless student crisis, and we need targeted, dedicated support,” Bishop said. “Folks should be extremely alarmed right now. Will these kids be getting the education they need and deserve?” 
Better food, cleaner bathrooms
In Kern County, identification has only been one part of the effort to help homeless students thrive in school. Schools also try to pair them with tutors and mentors, give them school supplies and laundry tokens, and invite them to join a program called Student Voice Ambassadors. There, students can tour local colleges, learn leadership skills and explore career options. 
As part of the program, staff ask students what would make school more enticing — and then make sure the suggestions happen. At one school, students said they’d go to class if the bathrooms were cleaner. So staff improved the bathrooms. At another school, students wanted better food. They got it.
Williams credits the program with reducing absenteeism among homeless students. Two years ago, 45% of Kern County’s homeless students were chronically absent. Last year, the number dropped to 39% – still too high, he said, but a significant improvement.
“Without McKinney-Vento funds, the Student Voice Ambassador program would go away,” Williams said. “How will we keep it going? I don’t know.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/020223-T.-Griffin-Stege-Elementary-SK21-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-02 09:03:55.055627

Scott Hayman
Scott Hayman is chair of the Indian Wells Valley Groundwater Authority.


California is at a groundwater management crossroads as legal loopholes threaten to undo the state’s progress toward responsible groundwater sustainability.
At the core of this legal conflict are two legal processes. The first is the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, the landmark law passed in 2014 to bring order to overdrafting of basins and ensure long-term sustainability of the state’s groundwater resources. The second is groundwater adjudications, a legal tool to determine water rights of who can pump water and how much they can use.  
Increasingly, these two legal processes are clashing. As a result, it is causing confusion, delaying  implementation of groundwater sustainability plans and further putting California’s water future at risk. In fact, nearly a quarter of state-approved groundwater sustainability plans are being challenged in a groundwater adjudication. 
Litigants are using groundwater adjudications to challenge the technical findings of state-approved groundwater plans, data from the Department of Water Resources reveals. These plans are the product of years of science-based research, independent modeling, local stakeholder input and millions of dollars in public investment. 
The lawsuits bypass groundwater management law and are dragging every groundwater user in a basin into costly, years-long litigation, which ultimately is paid for by users who did not choose this water battle. The result? Delayed projects, regulatory uncertainty and a system that favors those who can afford to litigate over those who can’t. 
One of these legal challenges involves the critically overdrafted Indian Wells Valley Groundwater Basin, 597 square miles spanning Kern, Inyo and San Bernardino counties. As the chair of the groundwater authority responsible for managing this basin, I know firsthand the detriment of these legal loopholes.
Assembly Bill 1413 is sensible, straightforward legislation that would strengthen the state’s efforts to manage this precious resource. AB 1413 is intended to protect the right to challenging a sustainability plan, but at the same time, preserve the integrity of the groundwater law’s process and provide clarity to judges in adjudications.
AB 1413 addresses this growing problem by reaffirming the Legislature’s original intent: To afford the ability to challenge a sustainability plan by first introducing evidence as part of a validation  action. This process would be open, transparent and focused — unlike adjudications, which are  broad, expensive and often heard in a court far removed from the communities they affect.
Clarity is needed now. Judges in current adjudications have voiced frustration at the lack of legal  guidance, noting the difficulty of reconciling state law with the demands of adjudication. AB 1413 gives them the tools they need to respect both processes without compromising either. 
The bill also does not take away anyone’s legal rights. It simply ensures that technical disputes are handled in the appropriate venue, without undermining broader groundwater management law. 
Opponents state that adjudications and groundwater management law are separate and can coexist. But in practice, adjudications are being used to override local efforts and delay  sustainability measures. 
This isn’t coexistence — it’s conflict. 
Without legislative action, this conflict will only grow, negatively impacting most groundwater users, and leaving it to legal teams who can afford to fight for wealthy clients who simply want to kick the implementation of sustainability plans down the road. 
AB 1413 is not just a legal fix. It’s a defense of public process, scientific integrity and equitable  access to water governance. It ensures that all Californians — not just those with the deepest  pockets — have a voice in how our groundwater is managed. 
If lawmakers pass AB 1413, they can reaffirm California’s commitment to sustainable, community-driven water management. The future of our groundwater and the communities that depend on it are at stake.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/070622_Kern-Drought_LV_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-02 09:03:55.055627

For months, a plan to create an infrastructure financing agency largely shielded from the public eye sailed smoothly through the state Senate. Lawmakers only backtracked when transparency advocates sounded the alarm. 


California lawmakers wanted to create a nonprofit agency authorized to borrow limitless taxpayer money to finance infrastructure projects — all while shielding most of its operations from the public eye.
Sponsored by state Treasurer Fiona Ma, SB 769 would create the Golden State Infrastructure Corporation, a nonprofit organization within the treasurer’s office that would use public and private financing for projects from transportation to housing. 
The measure initially sought to exclude virtually all of the nonprofit’s records from public disclosure and allow the organization to make decisions behind closed doors.
That kind of authority deserves public scrutiny, good government groups argued, especially as corruption scandals plagued state agencies in recent decades. The proposal follows state officials’ efforts in recent years to shroud themselves in secrecy by using burner phones and non-disclosure agreements and by introducing measures to reduce public access to records and meetings.
After good government advocates and legislative analysts raised transparency concerns, lawmakers on Tuesday approved a new version of the bill that narrows the scope of documents that would be exempt from public disclosure, though it would still allow some to remain secret.
“This is exactly the kind of business (of) the state the public has a vested interest in being able to monitor. Excessive secrecy will only undermine public trust in the corporation,” the First Amendment Coalition and Oakland Privacy wrote in a joint letter to lawmakers last month.
The nonprofit would be overseen by a five-member board including the treasurer, controller and other state appointees. 
The proposal would give the organization full discretion over its finances and would not cap how much debt it can incur. The state would also not be held liable for the organization’s financial decisions. 
Some documents would still be secret
Under the revised legislation, the nonprofit would only be allowed to keep records private if they are corporate financial documents or “critical infrastructure information” that has not been made public. The group would also only be able to hold closed sessions while discussing those records.
“I believe the amendments we are taking today strengthen the bill and strike the right balance,” Sen. Anna Caballero, a Merced Democrat who authored the measure, said in a hearing Tuesday. “It will ensure the success of the infrastructure fund while maintaining the type of open and transparent governmental body the public deserves.”
Neither Caballero nor Ma responded to CalMatters’ request for comment Tuesday on why they sought to keep deliberations and records secret. 
The initial sweeping exemptions went unnoticed for months as the measure sailed through the Senate with no lawmaker raising transparency concerns. The only two senators to vote against the legislation — Sens. Brian Jones of San Diego and Steven Choi of Irvine, both Republicans — did not cite the exemptions as part of their concern. 
When asked about the lack of disclosure, Jones said in a statement that he’s deeply opposed to the entity “being completely exempt from the Public Records Act, especially in California, where government is already notorious for its lack of transparency.”
Choi spokesperson Kelley Rooney told CalMatters: “Senator Choi has consistently voted in favor of legislation that promotes government transparency and public input in the decision-making process.”

Ginny LaRoe, advocacy director of the First Amendment Coalition, told CalMatters she only flagged the proposed exemptions after the measure arrived in the Assembly. She said she wished lawmakers had raised the issue early on in the legislative process.
“We would have better policy debates, and ultimately, better policy if these key public interest provisions were analyzed and discussed early,” she said. “It’s probably not good government if we’re only really grappling with the public’s right to information and meetings at the very end stages of legislative proposals.”
While the proposal limits the nonprofit’s discretion to hold private meetings, Tracy Rosenberg, advocacy director of Oakland Privacy, told CalMatters she hopes the discretion wouldn’t be abused.
“We would hope that when taxpayer money is involved, you know, the (open meetings laws) should just apply without all these special carve-outs,” she said.
Other proposals to block transparency loom
The infrastructure proposal is only one of many this year that would exempt state entities from the open meetings law or reduce their public disclosure requirements, according to a CalMatters analysis. Most of those measures cite concerns about releasing sensitive, investigative or proprietary information as rationale.
At least three proposals would completely shield various entities such as task forces, working groups and advisory committees from the state’s open meetings requirement. They’ve all cleared the Assembly and are being debated in Senate committees.

Another proposal green lit by the Assembly is AB1103 by Democratic Assemblymember Chris Ward of San Diego. It would shield certain members of the Research Advisory Panel of California, a controlled substance study review group, from the open meetings law, and allow the group to continue meeting in private. Members of the group stopped meeting altogether in 2023 after being subject to open meetings requirements, arguing they could not publicly discuss studies without violating copyright and patent protections.
Additional measures aim to loosen public disclosure requirements and reduce the scope of records the state is required to release. One of them, AB 973 by GOP Assemblymember Josh Hoover of Folsom, would allow plastic manufacturers to ask CalRecycle to keep information they submit to the department private. Under the legislation, the department director could grant that request if they believe doing so “is not detrimental to the public interest.”
Two other measures, SB 495 by Sen. Ben Allen and AB 1339 by Assemblymember Mark Gonzalez, would require insurers to report more information to the state but would keep it from public disclosure. 
And AB 1504, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman, a Palo Alto Democrat, would have subjected the California Massage Therapy Council, a nonprofit created by the state to certify massage therapists, to the California Public Records Act. 
Berman balked after the language drew fierce opposition from district attorneys and massage therapists, some of whom argued the requirements represent “government interference with the right of private parties” and would identify the council as a “quasi-public entity” 16 years after it was created. His current proposal merely “encourages” the council to make its information public.
“Despite the significant amendments, I still believe that greater transparency is essential for this Council to remain trusted and effective,” Berman said in a Monday hearing.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/041323-QUITO-VILLAGE-MHN-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-02 09:03:55.055627

Church officials complained after several men on the grounds of two Inland Empire Catholic churches were detained by immigration enforcement officers.  


ICE arrests near two churches in San Bernardino County last month show how ramped up immigration enforcement is disturbing places that were once deemed protected.
On June 20 federal agents picked up a longtime parishioner of Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Montclair on church property, according to the National Catholic Reporter. In a separate incident that day, agents chased several men onto the church parking lot of St. Adelaide parish in Highland. 
Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin disputed what she said were news reports that agents had entered the church hall. 
“The accusation that ICE entered a church to make an arrest are FALSE,” she stated in an email to CalMatters.  “ICE conducted a traffic stop on an illegal alien on June 20 in the general proximity of Our Lady of Lourdes Church, Montclair, California. The illegal alien chose to pull into the church parking lot. Officers then safely made the arrest.”
For almost a decade and a half, U.S. immigration officers steered clear of churches, complying with a directive by former President Barack Obama that limited immigration enforcement at sensitive locations, including schools, hospitals and places of worship. Former President Joe Biden maintained those guidelines to deter immigration action in areas that provide essential services.
On his inauguration day Jan. 20, President Donald Trump revoked that protection, stating that the Biden-era restrictions “thwart law enforcement in or near so-called ‘sensitive’ areas.” 
Catholic leaders have denounced ICE’s aggressive enforcement tactics and protested that many detained immigrants are denied the right to plead their cases.
“Authorities are now seizing brothers and sisters indiscriminately, without respect for their right to due process and their dignity as children of God,” wrote Bishop Alberto Rojas, of the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Bernardino, in a letter to parishioners June 23.
John Andrews, a spokesman for the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Bernardino, said the man detained at Our Lady of Lourdes is a longtime parishioner whose family is involved in the ministry. 
“There was no one present at Our Lady of Lourdes when he was taken into custody,” Andrews told CalMatters in an email. “He was doing some landscaping work there. He is in custody so there is no one who can really speak to what transpired in that apprehension.”
The men arrested at St. Adelaide Church didn’t appear to have a connection to the parish, Andrews said: “Neither the parish nor the diocese has any information about them, their whereabouts or whether or not they were arrested.”
Rojas stated in his letter that church leaders respect law enforcement efforts to keep communities safe from violent criminals, but raiding homes, workplaces and churches creates fear and confusion: “It is not of the Gospel of Jesus Christ — which guides us in all that we do.”
He asked elected leaders to “reconsider and cease these tactics immediately, in favor of an approach that respects human rights and human dignity and builds toward a more lasting, comprehensive reform of our immigration system.”
The Catholic Church has been increasingly vocal on the plight of immigrants and refugees in recent years. The late Pope Francis traveled to Sicily to meet with immigrants from Libya on his first pastoral visit outside Rome and later rescued 12 Syrians from a refugee camp in Greece. As Trump took office in January, Pope Francis denounced his mass deportation plans as “a disgrace.”
On June 20, the day of the Inland Empire church arrests, also World Refugee Day, Michael Pham, the newly appointed bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego, joined a group of clergy to witness immigration proceedings at the federal building in San Diego. 
Pham came to the U.S. as a refugee from Vietnam in 1981. He told reporters that he prayed for “wisdom and insight to help our poor brothers … through the crises in their lives.”

The raids also are beginning to draw criticism from some California Republican lawmakers. Six signed a June 27 letter calling for more moderate immigration action, arguing that raids are hurting communities and businesses.
The lawmakers — including state Sen. Rosilicie Ochoa Bogh, a Redlands Republican — endorsed the letter by Senator Suzette Martinez Valladares, a Santa Clarita Republican, asking Trump to “focus deportations on criminals” and modernize immigration policies.
While they support immigration enforcement against violent criminals, they said, immigrants without criminal records are being swept up in raids, “creating widespread fear.”
ICE workplace raids at farms, construction sites, restaurants and hotels, “are harming the communities we represent and the businesses that employ our constituents,” the letter states.

It's moving toward paying them minimum wage for their work in emergencies.,"In summary
California sent incarcerated firefighters to battle blazes in Los Angeles this year. It’s moving toward paying them minimum wage for their work in emergencies.


In a historic policy change, California is moving to pay incarcerated firefighters the federal minimum wage during active fires. 
The wage increase, funded through the new state budget, follows years of advocacy to improve pay and working conditions for incarcerated labor. That effort took on a new urgency after hundreds of incarcerated firefighters were deployed to battle deadly wildfires that hit Los Angeles in January. 
Incarcerated firefighters currently earn between $5.80 and $10.24 per day, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. During active emergencies, Cal Fire compensates them an additional $1 per hour. 
That appears to be changing. Gov. Gavin Newsom last week signed a new state budget with $10 million to pay incarcerated firefighters $7.25 an hour when they’re on a fire. It will take effect Jan. 1 as long as the Legislature passes a bill that would mandate the policy.
“It’s the right thing to do and it’s long overdue,” said Assemblymember Isaac Bryan, a Democrat from Culver City who authored the bill that would raise incarcerated firefighter pay. “It feels really beautiful and life changing for folks who have sacrificed to save others during their time being held accountable for whatever harms they may have caused in their past.” 
Bryan initially set out to raise wages for incarcerated firefighters to $19 per hour, but settled on the federal minimum wage after budget negotiations. The bill, which received bipartisan support from nearly two dozen lawmakers, was opposed by the California State Sheriffs’ Association over concerns of its potential fiscal impact on counties. 
“To have a bipartisan moment where we’re dignifying incarcerated labor with a federal minimum wage – I think that is the best of who we are,” said Bryan. “My colleagues on both sides of the aisle, on this particular effort, are demonstrating what it really means to be Californian.”
Bryan introduced the bill after voters last year rejected a ballot measure that would have ended forced labor in prisons and jails. California’s incarcerated firefighters have long provided critical support to state, local and federal government agencies in responding to various emergencies, including wildfires and floods. 
Over 1,800 incarcerated firefighters live year-round in minimum-security conservation camps, also known as “fire camps,” located across 25 counties in California, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Those numbers have dwindled in recent years due to a declining prison population. 
The wage increase is an acknowledgment to the people fighting the fires, said Katie Dixon, policy and campaign coordinator for the organization California Coalition for Women Prisoners, which supported Bryan’s bill. 
“I feel like this is a statement of value – in saying: we value you, we honor you, we see you,” said Dixon. 
Dixon dreamed of becoming a firefighter after spending two years on a hand crew while she was incarcerated. But despite her experience fighting hundreds of fires, she found that the career path was not available to her when she was released from prison in 2012 due to her criminal record. 
“It felt like a dream deferred. A dream that’s been cut off due to systemic policies designed to keep people like me — Black people — out of certain professions,” said Dixon. “Deep down inside, I’m supposed to be a battalion chief.”
Both state and federal legislation have been introduced this year to try and shore up the pipeline for incarcerated people to land in firefighting careers once they’ve been released. 
U.S. Reps. Sydney Kamlager-Dove and Judy Chu, both from California, introduced a bill that would establish national protections for incarcerated firefighters, including a uniform framework to clear their records that would ease the barriers to employment. 
“As we are seeing departments contract, as we are seeing that it is harder to recruit and retain firefighters, why would you miss an opportunity like this to connect a pipeline that is trained right into municipalities that need more firefighters?” said Kamlager-Dove. “At the end of the day, it’s jobs and economic stability that help all of us.”

(Courtesy photo)Salt Lake City’s Ballpark neighborhood likely won’t completely lose its namesake, a final design for Smith’s Ballpark unveiled Tuesday shows. 
The 13.5-acre space left behind by the minor league team Salt Lake Bees is set to preserve its west bleachers, with a 3,700 seating capacity, as well as part of the field and other elements at the stadium’s main entrance.
The vision, Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall said, is a place that accommodates year-round activities, including different sports, concerts and festivals, but is also a more accessible spot preserving “a lot of the green space that the kids in this neighborhood have never touched.”

“There’s really good bones in this part of the stadium, the steel structure is actually much more sound than we expected it to be before the engineering assessment was done,” Mendenhall said. “So we’re in a good space to preserve this section of the stadium, which is also cost savings to the public when we take it out to it.”
The Salt Lake City Community Reinvestment Agency will review the design and hear public comment on the proposal next Tuesday at 2 p.m. A final decision is expected in late summer, the agency said in a release.
All options are on the table for Smith’s Ballpark, including demolition

The goal, according to the design plan by the firm Perkins&Will, is to bring new life to what has been a city landmark for over 75 years, with walkable streets and prime views of the Wasatch Range.
The spot is designed to host a new fire station, a library branch and housing units with home-ownership options. Also a linear park of about 0.7 acres along 1300 South, as soon as work to bring the Red Butte, Emigration and Parley creeks back to the surface. 
Salt Lake City Council member Darin Mano, who represents the area, said that after all plans are completed, he imagines the neighborhood looking a lot like “a little second downtown, or another Sugar House-type of place.”
“Another place where you can go and have great food, grab a drink, work here and live here,” Mano said. 
The city has other big plans that could turn the neighborhood into a destination, as well.

“Festival street activation has long been part of our station area plan for the Ballpark neighborhood that is also incorporated here,” Mendenhall said, “which means that West Temple becomes a tree-lined accessible space for markets, different little festivals that can happen, street-facing restaurants, bars and shops.” 
There’s also a proposal for a hotel and ground-floor retail along the edges of the development, where the city hopes to accommodate local businesses.
Phase 1 of the development will focus on the partial demolition of the ballpark, while hosting some interim activities and community events on streets and parking lots, in addition to building multi-family housing on the northern surface parking block at the corner of West Temple and Paxton Avenue, and some lower-density units along West Temple. 



Let us know what you think...


 


There isn’t a set timeline on when the full project will be completed. But, the city may issue a development request for proposals late this year. And demolition won’t start for probably a year or two. 
With offering different types of housing being one of the community’s priorities, Mano said that the city will watch for developers that can deliver different housing alternatives.
“Some of the things that we’re going to be looking for is who feels confident that they can deliver market rate for sale, family-sized housing, mixed in with what we all know we need, which is affordable housing,” he said
The final design comes after the Ballpark NEXT Design Competition launched after the Bees announced their move to South Jordan in January 2023. That effort highlighted professional, resident and student projects, including a hub for small businesses and a women’s multi-sport venue. Ultimately those ideas helped build the design, Mendenhall said.

Presenters and advocates warned last week that Medicaid cuts in the tax-and-spending bill that passed Congress Tuesday could devastate health care in Alabama's Black Belt. (Will McClelland/Alabama Reflector)Researchers and advocates warned the public in a media briefing last week that proposed Medicaid cuts in the massive tax-and-spending package that passed the U.S. Senate on Tuesday would devastate a region that relies heavily on the federal program.
In 2023, 21 of the 24 counties that comprise the region had some of the highest percentages of Medicaid enrollees in Alabama.
“About 28% of people living in the average Black Belt county are covered by Medicaid, compared to 20% in non-Black Belt counties and  23% overall in the state,” said Garrett Till, a graduate research assistant with the Education Policy Center at the University of Alabama.

The bill that passed the Senate on Tuesday includes nearly $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, which provides health insurance to low-income individuals. In Alabama, most of those covered by Medicaid are children, the elderly and those with disabilities. Non-disabled adults only qualify for Medicaid if they have qualifying children and make 18% of the poverty line or less — about $2,817 a year for an individual and $4,797 for a family of three.
According to the report published by the Education Policy Center, 38% of Perry County’s residents were enrolled in Medicaid in 2023, the highest in the state. The Black Belt county with the lowest percentage of Medicaid enrollees was Lamar County at 20%, the only one that is equivalent to the average of a non-Black Belt counties.
“What is in the air is not spelling out well for rural situations here,” Till said. “As we see with all these counties in the Black Belt, which are going to be predominantly, if not all rural counties, are going to be hurting the most.”
About 38% of Medicaid dollars are allocated to hospitals, according to a report from the Alabama Medicaid Agency. Rural areas, like much of the Black Belt, struggle with retaining hospitals after several medical centers have already closed in the past several years.
According to the report from the Education Policy Center, 10 have already closed since 2005. Further cuts, the report says, will endanger the future viability of those that continue to operate. The report states that 27 are reportedly in danger of closing their doors, while 19 are at immediate risk of closing.
Presenters during the briefing spoke of the Medicaid provision that allows the state to impose a tax on providers that is then used to help pay for the state’s portion of the cost it shares with the federal government.  The budget proposal places a cap on the provider tax, which would limit the amount the state can generate to pay for its share of the federal program.
That shortfall becomes an additional cost that Alabama must bear on behalf of residents who are eligible for the program.
Till said the freeze would “just in turn is going to kick more and more people off Medicaid, period.”
Areas in the Black Belt have some of the worst outcomes for diabetes, heart disease and infant mortality. Twelve counties in Alabama with the highest rates of diabetes are located in the Black Belt. In Bullock County, about 20% of the residents suffer from the disease.
Medicaid reimbursements for physicians and other medical providers also remains low.
“The issue is if a provider, a new doctor, comes to Thomasville, Alabama, because of that lowest cost reimbursement per claim per patient in Alabama being the lowest in the nation, guess what, they go to Georgia or they go to North Carolina or they go to Arizona, or they go to another state,” said Sheldon Day, mayor of Thomasville, which is in the Black Belt. “They can see the same 40, 30, 40, 50 patients a day in their practice and probably make $100,000 more a year for the same work.”
Presenters provided several policy recommendations to address the issue. Among them is to oppose the reductions to Medicaid and the freeze to the tax on providers. They also urged communities to invest in health literacy and community initiatives along with finding solutions to the provider shortage.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VaughanRegionalMedicalCenter_McLelland12870-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-02 09:03:55.055627

But despite nearly $400 million in federal support since 2015, backlogs persist, and some states still lack basic oversight. And now, advocates fear such financial support is on shaky ground.
There are an estimated 49,248 untested kits across the country, according to data collected by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group. Although the exact number of backlogged kits nationwide is unknown, a 2022 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that summarized existing research found backlog estimates ranging from 90,000 to 400,000 kits.
After a sexual assault, a survivor may choose to undergo a forensic exam, during which a trained health care professional collects evidence over the course of several hours.
That evidence — which may include clothing, photos of injuries, blood, urine and DNA samples — is compiled into what’s commonly known as a rape kit or sexual assault kit. The kit is then sent to a crime lab for further testing.
Test results are sometimes returned to investigators who check for DNA matches in national or state databases. A match could connect the case to other sexual assaults or link a suspect to another crime.
But processing a single kit can take days, months or even years, depending on when they are submitted and how much other work crime labs have. In some states, there are no laws requiring law enforcement to send rape kits to a lab within a specific time frame or mandating how quickly those kits must be tested.
Survivors are often left in the dark. They may not know if their kit was tested, whether a suspect was identified, or if their case is moving forward.
That silence — the uncertainty about what happened to the kit — has long been the norm in many parts of the country.
“We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault,” said Rachel Lovell, an associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University. Lovell has conducted extensive research on the impact of untested rape kits in Ohio.
The goal of tracking systems is straightforward: bring transparency to a process that for decades left survivors without answers. These systems allow victims to log in and track the status of their kits — from collection to testing to storage — and offer law enforcement agencies a tool to identify and prevent testing backlogs, and strengthen criminal investigations.
At least 37 states and Washington, D.C., have established or committed to establishing a rape kit tracking system, according to the End the Backlog website run by the Joyful Heart Foundation. The foundation supports survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse.
Two more states — New Jersey and Pennsylvania — announced plans this year to build their own tracking systems. In New Jersey, a new law gives the attorney general’s office until Aug. 1 to set up the tracking system. Pennsylvania officials are preparing to launch a statewide inventory of kits to better understand the scope of the backlog before developing their system.
A handful of other states have also enacted or are considering legislation to support their sexual assault kit tracking programs.
In Arizona, for example, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill into law in May requiring all police departments in the state to use a system called “Track-Kit.” The new law primarily affects the Phoenix Police Department, which opted out of using the system in 2016. That department is expected to launch the platform later this year.
At the federal level, support for kit testing and tracking has often come from the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, or SAKI, which has awarded nearly $400 million to 96 grantees, including local and state agencies, across 44 states since 2015.
But the program’s future has not always been certain.
In January, the federal Office of Management and Budget had listed the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative as a program whose funding would be frozen, before walking back the widespread freeze amid legal challenges.
President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would maintain funding for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative at $51.5 million, according to a new report from the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
But a separate round of federal Department of Justice grant cuts in April has raised concerns about the stability of broader support services for survivors. That round of cuts affected a variety of grant programs, including domestic violence shelters, trauma counseling, legal assistance and hospital advocacy.
The timing is especially concerning, advocates say, as victims of crime face growing obstacles to accessing state-provided support. In many states, victims seeking financial compensation encounter long delays, burdensome paperwork or are disqualified entirely by narrow eligibility rules.
 Police investigations and funding

In jurisdictions that have worked to clear their backlogs, testing sexual assault kits has helped identify serial offenders, solve cold cases and connect assaults or other crimes to the same perpetrator.
Nationwide, testing supported by the federal Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has contributed to at least 1,538 convictions. Still, these types of crimes are vastly underreported to police.
Rapes and sexual assaults are notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute, said Lovell, of Cleveland State University. But testing all rape kits can reveal patterns of criminal behavior over time and provide deeper insight into how, when and to whom these crimes are happening — ultimately helping improve support and case outcomes for survivors.
“By prosecuting sex offenders, you can also work to address violent crime more generally and solve past or future crimes with the addition of evidence and DNA,” Lovell told Stateline.
In her research on untested rape kits in Ohio, Lovell has found that since 2015 — when the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative launched — cases overseen by the Cleveland Police Department have been more likely to move forward in the investigative and prosecutorial process, with fewer being labeled as unfounded. Police reports, she said, also have become more detailed and trauma informed.
The initiative itself may not be the sole reason for these changes, Lovell said. Other factors, such as departmental policy changes or officer training, may also have played a role.
Although SAKI grants remain one of the primary sources of support for testing backlogged kits and building tracking systems, communities may face challenges sustaining progress once the federal dollars run out.
Capt. Tim Hegarty, division commander of the Office of Professional Standards at the Glynn County Police Department in Georgia, said local agencies must push through potential funding cuts.
“It falls back on agencies to do the job that they say they’re going to do, even when the money has dried up,” Hegarty said in an interview. “Doesn’t matter who’s in the [presidential] administration.”
Hegarty added that many departments across the country are still catching up when it comes to interviewing victims with sensitivity and investigating sex crimes.
“Law enforcement really has not advanced a great deal when it comes to dealing with these types of crimes,” Hegarty said. “It’s not the universal language when it comes to policing across the country.”
 New statewide tracking systems

Other states are looking to strengthen existing programs through new oversight measures and stricter processing timelines.
Maine is one of the 11 states without a statewide rape kit tracking system. But state lawmakers are considering a bill that would create one and require law enforcement agencies and the state’s crime lab to inventory and test backlogged kits. The bill passed the House in mid-June and is currently under consideration by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill in early June aimed at improving the state’s capacity to process sexual assault kits. The new law establishes the Colorado Sexual Assault Forensic Medical Evidence Review Board, which will evaluate the state’s medical, legal and criminal responses to sexual assault.
The governor and attorney general have until Aug. 1 to appoint board members. A preliminary report is due to lawmakers by Dec. 15.
The law also strengthens oversight of kit processing timelines. Law enforcement agencies must now provide survivors with updates on the status of their kits every 90 days. It also sets a new 60-day goal for crime labs to process forensic medical evidence, shortening the current 90-day goal.
As of May 31, 1,324 kits were backlogged, with an estimated testing turnaround time of about a year and a half, according to the state’s dashboard.
Alaska, which launched its statewide rape kit tracking system in 2023, considered a bill this year that would have expedited processing timelines for sexual assault kits. The bill passed the House without opposition but failed to advance through the Senate before the legislative session ended in May.
Although the number of untested kits has significantly declined since the state began inventorying them in 2017, 254 kits remained untested at the state’s crime lab in 2024 — up from 113 the previous year but well below the 3,484 recorded in 2017.
In Georgia, lawmakers considered a similar bill that would have established new rules for collecting, testing and tracking evidence from sexual assault kits. The bill did not advance before the legislature adjourned in April.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported in December that 2,298 kits were tested between July 2023 and June 2024, with 480 kits still awaiting testing. Another 1,612 older cases submitted before 1999 were flagged for DNA testing, of which 837 had been tested as of June 2024.

The image was captured by the Research Technologies Branch of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases' Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Montana. Alaska officials have now recorded a death from disseminated gonococcal infection, a rare complication of the sexually transmitted disease. (Image provided by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases)An Alaska woman has died from a severe complication of gonorrhea that is rare but has increased in frequency in the state, health officials reported.
The woman, in her 50s, had disseminated gonococcal infection, or DGI, in which the bacteria that causes gonorrhea spreads to bodily organs, according to a bulletin issued Monday by the Department of Health’s epidemiology section. She arrived in the spring at the emergency department of an Anchorage hospital with septic shock and heart failure, and the DGI diagnosis followed before she died, the bulletin said.
She was one of eight Alaskans identified with DGI between January and May of this year, according to the bulletin. Patients ranged in age from 32 to 59. Five were women. All were treated in Anchorage, according to the bulletin.
The woman who died had been treated twice in the prior six months for opioid abuse, but there was no record of her being tested for gonorrhea in the year prior to her death, the bulletin said.
While gonorrhea is curable with antibiotics, some infected people may have no symptoms and therefore miss testing and treatment, said Dr. Liz Ohlsen, a staff physician with the Alaska Department of Health who authored the bulletin.
That puts those people at risk that their untreated gonorrhea will develop into much more serious DGI, she said.
As state health officials track DGI cases, there are concerns that a particular strain may be circulating in Alaska that is less likely to cause symptoms, Ohlsen said.
“We think the most likely explanation for the rise in DGI cases is that more people with gonorrhea are not getting tested and treated in a timely manner. Asymptomatic infections are thought to pose a greater risk of persistent untreated infection because people are less likely to have sought care,” she said by email.
Through a public-education effort, the department is urging Alaskans with multiple sexual partners — or anyone who has a partner with multiple partners — to be tested for gonorrhea regularly, every three to six months, she said.
Alaska has consistently had among the nation’s highest rates of gonorrhea and other sexually transmitted infections. Last year, the state recorded a spike in DGI, with 27 cases reported in 2024 after having had three in 2022 and eight in 2023. That represented 1.3% of total reported gonorrhea cases in 2024, a much higher percentage than what has been reported in earlier years.
In cases of DGI, the gonorrheal infections that are normally confined to mucus membranes of the genital, rectal or mouth areas spread internally. Potential effects include joint or tendon problems, heart infections and meningitis, a potentially fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord.
“Deaths from disseminated gonococcal infection are rare, but DGI can cause serious complications like heart problems that can lead to death. The more cases of DGI we have, the more likely it is that some people have serious complications or death as a result,” Ohlsen said.
Statistics about DGI and DGI-related deaths are difficult to pinpoint, however.
While diagnosed cases of gonorrhea are required to be reported in Alaska, as in other states, cases of DGI are not, Ohlsen said.
There are a few available studies that give some information about DGI occurrences.
One study from California found that from mid-2020 to mid-2021, 0.24% of reported gonorrhea cases had developed into DGI.
Another study of cases in several Western U.S. states found that of 274 confirmed and probable DGI cases reported between 2020 and 2022 to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2.2% of the patients died.

Cook, a two-time Mississippi junior champion, has signed to play at Mississippi State.

Both Moffitt’s 72-hole score and his victory margin set State Am records. Moffitt’s final round of nine-under-par 63 – 10 pars, 7 birdies and an eagle – was just one off the Grand Bear course record of 62, shot by 10-time PGA TOUR champion Steve Elkington in a Champions Tour tournament in 2022. 
When the PGA TOUR held its first round of tour qualifying at Grand Bear two years ago, the winning 72-hole score was 280 – 13 shots worse than what young Moffitt just shot.
Says accomplished, 42-year-old Belden amateur Joe Deraney, who shot 3-under at Grand Bear and finished in a tie for eighth place, “Twenty-one under par on that golf course is an amazing score. He lapped the field. And I can’t tell you how good that final round 63 was. To shoot that score under fire when he held the lead and all the pressure was on him is really, really something.”
Yes, it is, and it qualifies Moffitt to play in the U.S. Amateur Championship at the famed Olympic Club’s Lake Course in San Francisco. That’s a far cry from his hometown course, a nine hole track called Pine Hill Country Club where Moffitt says he plays “95 percent of my golf.” And it’s not bad for a country kid, with a decided Hill Country accent, who took up the game of golf five years ago at age 13 when he was looking for something he could do for fun during the Covid pandemic.

Jake Moffitt tees off.
Before that, Moffitt played all the team sports, especially baseball where his usual position was third baseman. Once he began to play golf, he was hooked. And he got better fast, breaking 80 within a few months of beginning to practice and play regularly.
“What I love most about golf is that it’s an individual sport,” he said. “It’s all on you and you are depending on you, yourself, the whole time. It’s a game where you are always trying to reach perfection but you never can. Every shot, every practice shot, the goal is to get better. I like that.”
Moffitt led Ripley to three Class 4A state championships and won the individual championship himself all three times. Earlier this year, he won the Oxford Country Club Invitational, making birdies on the last three holes to come from behind and beat Deraney.
In April, he qualified for a PGA Korn Ferry Tour event, the Club Car Championship in Savannah, Ga. So of course, he shot 66 and made the field and missed a week of school.
He shot 78 and 76 and missed the cut but says, “It was about as much fun as I have ever had on a golf course.”
Southern Miss golf coach Eddie Brescher, who has finished as runner-up in the State Am three times himself, began recruiting Moffitt three years ago, and Moffitt committed over a year ago.
“We could see his potential three years ago, and he’s gotten a lot better since then,” Brescher said. “We are trying to do in golf what Southern Miss has done in baseball and that’s compete on a national basis. We’re headed in the right direction and signing Jake is a big step. His game has no weaknesses and he’s only going to get better. He’s a humble country boy who doesn’t mind hard work and can really, really play this  game.”
The U.S. Amateur will be played August 11-17 at Olympic, which has hosted so much golf history, including the 1966 U.S. Open when Arnold Palmer lost a seven-shot lead and then the a playoff to Billy Casper. Moffitt says he knows little about Olympic but does know the rough will be high and the greens will be lightning fast, as is the case for all USGA events.
Says the 18-year-old from rural northeast Mississippi, “I can’t wait.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/30142100/State-Am-champion-Jake-Moffitt-.jpeg,,,2025-07-02 09:03:55.055627

,California,2025-07-02 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,California lawmakers finally achieve ‘holy grail’ reform of state’s key environmental law,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/07/lawmakers-finally-reform-environmental-law/,"The social and economic costs of leaving CEQA intact became too high. With Gavin Newsom nearing the end of his governorship, he decided to confront the issue squarely.","Jerry Brown once described reform of the California Environmental Quality Act as “the lord’s work” but he, like other recent governors, was not willing to invest enough political capital to change it.
Simply put, significantly altering CEQA, which then-Gov. Ronald Reagan signed more than a half-century ago, would require confronting two powerful interest groups: environmental organizations and labor unions, which have weaponized the law to achieve their goals.
Brown made one stab at compelling the Legislature to alter CEQA in 2016, but otherwise left it to his successor, Gavin Newsom.
For six years, Newsom echoed the attitudes of his predecessors, critical of CEQA’s misuse to block housing and other much-needed projects, or compel developers to hire unionized labor or jump through other hoops, but unwilling to confront it head-on.
Instead, he and the Legislature nibbled at the edges of the law and gave specific projects, such as sports arenas, exemptions.
Finally, however, the social and economic costs of leaving CEQA intact became too high. The state’s critical shortage of housing continued despite innumerable policy declarations aimed at spurring investment. It became downright embarrassing that a politically dominant Democratic Party pledged to socioeconomic equity was unable to deliver on promises to make housing more abundant and affordable.
California starred in a New York Times video that chastised blue states for failing to live up to their stated principles and in a recent book, “Abundance,” about the nation’s chronic inability to deliver much-needed projects due to regulatory overkill, such as CEQA.
This year, with Newsom nearing the end of his governorship and appearing to cast his eyes toward a presidential campaign, the governor decided to confront the CEQA issue squarely. He endorsed two bills that would impose limits on the law’s reach and, in the end, threatening to block the entire state budget if they weren’t placed on his desk.
On Monday, the last day of the fiscal year, the Legislature passed Assembly Bill 130 and Senate Bill 131 with last-minute changes to dampen opposition from construction unions. Newsom quickly signed them.
“We needed to go bold and big on this holy grail reform,” Newsom said at a hastily staged signing ceremony.
Essentially, the legislation exempts virtually all infill housing projects from CEQA’s provisions, making it more difficult for opponents of high-density housing projects, known as NIMBYs, to block approval.
Such projects, particularly those aimed at low- and moderate-income families, have been the most difficult to gain approval, due largely to opposition in upscale communities dominated by single-family homeowners.
“When you are building housing in an existing community, that is environmentally beneficial, it is climate friendly, that is not something that should be subjected to potentially endless CEQA challenges and lawsuits,” Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat who authored SB 131, told senators before they passed the measure.
Wiener and Assemblywoman Buffy Wicks, an Oakland Democrat who carried AB 130, have been the Capitol’s two most aggressive advocates of pro-housing legislation.

The remaining question, of course, is whether the two new laws, which go into effect immediately, will have a discernible impact on the state’s housing shortage. CEQA is just one factor of many determining whether proposed projects proceed or die. Those who oppose high-density housing in their neighborhoods will not just roll over.
Ironically, as the Legislature was passing the two new laws on Monday, The Atlantic was publishing a lengthy article entitled “The Whole Country Is Starting to Look Like California,” that describes how red tape and local opposition are adversely affecting housing development in red states such as Texas and Florida, which had been viewed as developer paradises.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/052423-Santa-Monica-Construction-ZS-CM-21.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-02 08:00:55.282100

Jones said in an interview Tuesday that he endorsed Alex Braswell, a 30-year-old American Sign language interpreter, in the House District 11 contest because she impressed him with her knowledge of issues affecting Alabamians.
“I don’t know how many candidates that I’ve ever talked to that had done their homework about what’s going on in the state, what’s going on in the district. She has,” he said. “She’s the first woman nominee in that district. I think that’s important too.”

House District 11 has been solidly Republican in the past, but Jones said that endorsing candidates in special elections is important. 
“Those that don’t particularly care for me or Democrats, they’re either going to ignore it, or it’s going to drive them to the polls to vote for her opponent,” he said.
Braswell said she hopes the endorsement will bring more attention to Democrats in Alabama.
“If people should feel inclined to donate because I have Doug Jones’ endorsement, it’s more than welcome. But that was not the goal,” she said. “It’s always been to bring more attention to the Cullman County Democratic Party.”
Braswell has raised over $7,000, according to campaign finance records. Her opponent, Heath Allbright, has raised over $105,000, according to campaign finance records. 
Jones plans to hold a town hall on July 29 for Braswell in the district prior to the general election on Aug. 26, which he hopes will attract people from all parties. Braswell said the venue is not reserved yet, but the event will begin at 6 p.m. Jones said the campaign event will also be an opportunity for his wife, Louise, who is from Cullman County, to go home.
“I’m hoping that whatever people ultimately decide, that the endorsement of a former United States senator will at least get people looking at her platform, what she stands for, and listen to her,” he said. “I think that’s the most important piece of this, is just to bring this election to the attention of voters, regardless of how they end up voting.”
Braswell announced the endorsement on her Facebook page Monday morning and said in an interview Tuesday that Jones has been a role model for her.
“I think it will help us complete our overall goal to win this election,” Braswell said. 
Jones, who served in the U.S. Senate from 2018 to 2021, said he had not made a concrete decision on his political future, including running for Alabama’s governor in 2026. 
“This is about the candidates that are running in this special election. I’ve told people right now, my wife and I are staying in this fight,” he said. “I think that the direction the state’s headed, I’m concerned about it. I’m concerned about where the country is headed, and so we’re going to still stay active and vocal. What that means going forward, we haven’t fully developed yet.”
While Braswell is the only candidate endorsed by Jones right now, he said he would listen to any candidate that called him. There are currently three House special elections in Alabama: District 11, 12 and 63. There will soon be one in District 13 following former Rep. Matt Woods, R-Jasper, being elected to the state Senate in District 5. There is one Democratic candidate in each of the special elections.

Kennedy Jr. testifies during his Senate Finance Committee confirmation hearing on Jan. 29, 2025, in Washington, D.C.. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)Maryland was one of 19 states that won a preliminary injunction Tuesday from a federal judge in Rhode Island blocking the Department of Health and Human Services’ plan to lay off thousands of workers and dismantle several agency programs.
The court victory came the same day that Maryland joined two other lawsuits by Democratic-led states against the Trump administration: One to prevent HHS from providing the Department of Homeland Security with “unfettered access” to personal health data of Medicaid recipients and another to reverse Department of Education cuts to mental health programs.
Tuesday’s ruling by U.S. District Judge Melissa R. DuBose blocked HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s move on March 27 to lay off 10,000 employees and close or consolidate dozens of agcncy offices as part of his Make America Healthy Again program. DuBose, ruling in lawsuit filed May 5 by 19 states and the Distrit of Columbia, said the moves caused “irreparable harms.”
“Critical public health services have been interrupted, databases taken offline, status of grants thrown into chaos, technical assistance services gone, and training and consultation services curtailed. These are not unsubstantiated fears,” DuBose wrote.
When termination notices went out on April 1, the suit says, “employees were immediately expelled from their work email, laptops, and offices, work across the vast and complicated Department came to a sudden halt. Throughout HHS, critical offices were left unable to perform statutory functions.”
“HHS has failed to produce a shred of evidence that services to States and access to critical information would continue uninterrupted, that the harms are minimal or not irreparable, or that it is authorized to act absent Congressional action,” the judge’s order said.
The order also blocked plans to terminate employees at and restructure the offices of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the Center for Tobacco Products, the Office of Head Start and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.
“Marylanders count on HHS programs every single day, from substance abuse treatment programs that help families in crisis to maternal health initiatives that ensure safe pregnancies and births,” Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown said in a statement about the injuction. “Today’s court ruling ensures these life-saving programs remain intact while we continue our legal fight to protect the health and well being of Marylanders and their families.”
Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) has been leading congressional critic of Kennedy’s, and the Maryland Democratic Party continues to urge residents and others to demand his resignation.
Shared personal data
Brown and 19 other attorneys general also filed suit Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against HHS’ mass transfer of personal information, which the states claim violates federal law.
A summary of the lawsuit, a copy of which was not available Tuesday eveninig, claims states learned about the agency’s plan doing through news reports on June 13 that said the move was part of a Trump administration plan to create a sweeping database for “mass deportations” and other large-scale immigration enforcement purposes.
Statements from the attorneys general said HHS claimed it gave the personal data to Homeland Security “to ensure that Medicaid benefits are reserved for individuals who are lawfully entitled to receive them.” Medicaid is a shared federal-state program to provide health care to low-income individuals and those in underserved populations, including children, pregnant women, people with disabilities and seniors.
The attorneys general said Congress created Medicaid for the benefit of all residents of the country, regardless of immigration status.
“Immigrants should not be forced to choose between protecting their families and seeking medical care they are legally entitled to receive,” Brown said. “We are acting to defend the privacy of all Marylanders and ensure hospitals aren’t left to bear the burden when patients delay care out of fear.”
HHS spokesperson Andre Nixon said in an email Tuesday afternoon the agency acted within its legal authority and in full compliance with “all applicable laws” through the agency’s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Mehmet Oz, a physician who appeared frequently on the “Oprah Winfrey Show” and his own television show before he entered politics, is the administrator for the centers.
“Under the leadership of Dr. Oz, CMS is aggressively cracking down on states that may be misusing federal Medicaid funds to subsidize care for illegal immigrants – that includes California,” Nixon said.
“This oversight effort – supported by lawful interagency data sharing with DHS – is focused on identifying waste, fraud, and systemic abuse,” the staetment said. “We are not only protecting taxpayer dollars – we are restoring credibility to one of America’s most vital programs. The American people deserve accountability. HHS is delivering it.”
Education suit
On Monday, Maryland joined 15 other states in a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in the state of Washington to challenge $1 billion in cuts announced in April by the U.S. Department of Education toward mental health programs.
More specifically, the department said cuts targeted contracts to hire more mental health professionals and school counselors, but focused on diversity, equity and inclusion.
The suit says the contract terminations are “unlawful” under the Administrative Procedure Act, a 1946 law that requires that federal agencies proposing new rules and regulations must first publish them in the Federal Register to allow for public comment.
Congress authorized the department to provide an addiitional $100 million in fiscal years 2022 to 2026 through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, in the wake of the mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas, when a teenager shot and killed 19 elementary school students and two adults at Robb Elementary School.
Brown said in a statement the cuts would affect programs such as nearly $2.5 million already approved toward a school-based mental health fellowship program at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. In the last two years, about 67 students have come through the program and worked at 50 public schools “where the need for mental health resources is acute.”
“Established to prevent school violence like mass-shootings, these programs are critical to ensuring the well-being of our students,” his statement said. “We will not allow the Trump administration to threaten our children’s safety or jeopardize Maryland’s programs that support them and set them up for success.”
He called the termination of the grants supporting schools counselors and other mental health professionals “a cruel and reckless action that puts our students at increased risk of suicide and self-harm.”
The suit, filed against Education Secretary Linda McMahon, said the department announced in April it would discontinue the program and “recompete” the funds based on new priorities it identified as “merit, fairness and excellence in education.”
A representative with the department did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

House leaders have said they want to have the bill to President Donald Trump by Friday, but Maryland lawmakers are predicting tough sledding -- Democrats because it cuts too deep, the sole Republican because it doesn't cut enough. (Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)Maryland’s House members slammed the Senate-passed budget bill Tuesday and predicted tough sledding for the measure when it comes back to the House — Democrats because it cuts too much and the state’s sole Republican because it doesn’t cut enough.
“I’m heartbroken – not just because of what this bill does, but because of who it leaves behind,” Rep. April McClain Delaney (D-6th) said in a statement.
“The numbers are staggering!” McClain-Delaney wrote. “To support this bill would be to betray the 1.5 million Maryland residents who rely on Medicaid, which includes 50% of Maryland’s children.”
Medicaid cuts were a prime concern for Democrats among the items in the 1,000-page budget reconciliation bill, which also makes deep cuts to SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and to schools, among other social program cuts.
At the same time, the bill increases defense and Homeland Security spending and makes permanent tax cuts enacted in Trump’s first term that were set to expire at the end of this year. Democrats say those tax cuts benefit the wealthy more than working-class taxpayers.
The Congressional Budget Office released a report Sunday that said the combination of tax cuts and higher spending in the Senate version of the bill could add $3.25 trillion to the federal deficit — a number that is bringing pushback from fiscal hawks in the House.
Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st), the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday. But in an interview with Fox News, he said the Senate bill “is not ready for prime-time.”
US Senate narrowly passes GOP megabill after overnight session, sends it to House

“This is not going to sail through the House,” Harris said. “We’re going to have to negotiate one more time, and that’s just appropriate. That’s the way the legislative process works, and the way it should work on a bill of this size.
Time for lawmakers to negotiate is running out, as President Donald Trump has been pushing to have the bill he calls the One Big, Beautiful Bill on his desk by July Fourth.
But there’s little wiggle room in either the House or Senate on the bill, which Democrats almost universally loathe and Republicans are divided between those in swing districts who worry deep program cuts will alienate some voters and budget hardliners who see a continually growing deficit.
The bill passed the Senate 51-50 Tuesday, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote after three Republicans joined 47 Democrats and independents in opposition. That vote followed a round-the-clock marathon of dealing and voting over the weekend.
House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La) faces a similary slim majority, and can only afford to lose three GOP member if he hopes to get the bill to the president intact by Friday.
Harris said that may not happen.
The first test comes Wednesday, when the House is scheduled to take a procedural vote on the Senate version of the bill. Harris has said he will vote against advancing the bill on the procedural vote, and he expects to be joined by other House Freedom Caucus members.
“I don’t think the votes are there, just like they weren’t in the Senate initially, until some concessions were made,” Harris told Fox Tuesday. “I believe that the rule vote will not pass tomorrow morning, and then the speaker is going to have to decide how he gets this back into the … House framework.”
Harris told the network he thinks it will take “couple of days” to reach a compromise with the Senate. He sidestepped questions about his support for the Senate bill saying only that he was against the procedural vote.
Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th) said Harris should worry about the cuts in the underlying bill — and not because they don’t cut deep enough. Harris’ rural Eastern Shore district is one of the most Medicaid-dependent in the state, Raskin notes.
Four counties in Harris’ 1st District — Caroline, Dorchester, Somerset and Wicomico — all have enrollment rates above the state’s average of 19.8%, according to a study by the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy. Somerset, where 25.7% are enrolled in Medicaid, is second only to Baltimore City’s 29.7%, according to the report.

Raskin also said the cost of the bill should be a gut-check for fiscal conservatives.
“This is really a moment of truth for Andy Harris and others in the Freedom Caucus. Are they just interested in going along with all of Donald Trump’s authoritarian moves. Or do they really care about reducing the debt and the deficit?” he said. “If they vote for this, they can never mention the word debt or deficit again, because this is the single most calamitous contribution to the federal debt in in our lifetime.”
For Raskin, Medicatd funding is the primary concern. The Senate bill cuts $1 trillion in Medicaid funding over a decade. Nationally, that means nearly 12 million people would lose their coverage, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Maryland receives about $8.5 billion annually in Medicaid. Raskin said the Senate cuts would cost the state about $1 billion in Medicaid funding, pusing roughly 245,000 people off the rolls — a number Raskin said included Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program and some residents who have insurance through the Affordable Care Act.
“Essentially, our people face having their health coverage stripped away from them at a time when the state is already reeling from federal policies,” said Raskin, who called the bill “a chainsaw massacre approach to health care.”
He said that approach is unwarranted, given the fact that it will add to the national debt rather than reduce it.
“I just don’t see the logic of doing this,” he said, “We’re undermining the health care of our own people and the well being of our own people, while we’re piling more than $3 trillion of new debt onto our children and grandchildren, and it’s all to pay for just a drunken tax break for people who don’t need it.”

McClain-Delaney said one family in nine in her Western Maryland district relies on SNAP, or food stamps, and nearly one in seven residents, including a third of children in the district, rely on Medicaid, she wrote.
“Balancing the budget shouldn’t come at their expense,” McClain Delaney wrote. “It’s not just bad policy, it’s a failure of compassion.”
As the Senate was voting to pass the bill Tuesday, Rep. Johnny Olszewski Jr. (D-2nd) was already sounding the alarm of how cuts to food assistance could affect some 20,000 families in his district.
“This bill … it is big, but it is not beautiful. It is cruel and it would take food out of the mouths of hungry kids,” he said Tuesday at an event at Cockeysville Library to celebrate the launch of a new summer meals site where lower-income families and their kids can pick up a free lunch.
“Expansions like the one we’re celebrating today … could disappear overnight,” he warned. Summer meal assistance programs implemented by the state often use federal funding to support operations.
Olszewski later told reporters that with Maryland’s tight fiscal outlook, the state would struggle to fill any missing dollars cut that are currently funding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
“I think Maryland would be very hard pressed to find ways to fill the gap for these cuts,” he said. “We’re talking hundreds of billions of dollars of cuts in just food support alone – not mentioning the massive cuts to Medicaid and health coverage … Programs like today that we announced here at this library are unlikely to continue without funding.”
Raskin holds out hope that the bill will “go back to ground zero” once it returns to the House. He said moderate Republicans from districts in California, New Jersey and New York and conservative Republicans including those in the Freedom Caucus have reasons — albeit different ones — to vote against the bill.

(Photo by Jerry Glaser/Customs and Border Protection)State, federal and local officials who fought for years to bring the new FBI headquarters to Prince George’s County said Tuesday the fight is not over, after the surprise Trump administration announcement that the agency will stay downtown.
The FBI will move into existing space at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, just a few blocks down Pennsylvania Avenue from the current dilapidated headquarters in the aging J. Edgar Hoover Building, according to a statement from the FBI and the General Services Administration.
“Moving to the Ronald Reagan Building is the most cost effective and resource efficient way to carry out our mission to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution,” FBI Director Kash Patel said in the statement.
The move reverses a 2023 GSA decision that identified a site near the Greenbelt Metro for the new headquarters, following years of study and of competition between Maryland and Virginia jurisdictions to land the site.
Gov. Wes Moore (D), Prince Georges’ County Executive Aisha Braveboy (D) and almost all of the state’s congressional delegation — calling themselves Team Maryland — insisted Tuesday  that Greenbelt is still the better site.

“Simply moving down the street would ignore the real threats the Bureau faces and further jeopardize the safety of those protecting our communities. That’s why we will be fighting back against this proposal with every tool we have,” the Team Maryland statement said.
The agency has been seeking new headquarters for years to replace the J. Edgar Hoover Building, a brutalist facility that is cramped, has leaks and pieces of concrete occasionally falling onto the street below.
In November 2023, the GSA picked Greenbelt over another site in Prince George’s County, Landover, and over a site in Springfield, Virginia.
Virginia representatives charged that the selection of Maryland was flawed after a federal inspector general’s report released in February found fault with the process. But the report never stated there was a problem with the Greenbelt site itself.
President Donald Trump has never been a fan of moving the FBI out of the District. He tried to cancel it in his first term and in March of this year, less that two months after returning to office, he said he would not let the agency move “three hours away in Maryland, a liberal state.” He quickly said the state’s political leanings had no bearing on his decision, but never corrected the fact that Greenbelt is about 16 miles by car from the current headquarters.
Patel has talked in recent months about relocating headquarters staff to other parts of the country, but Tuesday’s announcement seems to have put that talk on hold.
GSA Public Buildings Service Commissioner Michael Peters said in a statement that move to the Reagan building avoids more than $300 million in deferred maintenance cost the current FBI headquarters.
“We are proud to partner with Director Patel to drive efficiency and improve the quality of space for a productive workforce in service to national security and taxpayers,” Peters said.
According to its website, the Reagan Building is home to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Until recently, it was also home to the U.S. Agency on International Developement, before that agency was gutted by the Trump administration and closed as an independent agency effective Tuesday, presumably freeing up space in the building.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But the building also has 22 event spaces to host weddings and events. Plans are scheduled for two events Wednesday, and a concert series on a plaza starts Monday and continues through September.
Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s), whose legislative district includes the Greenbelt site, called Tuesday’s decision “very interesting.”
“That [Ronald Reagan] building is a very open building. I’ve gone there for private events and conferences,” Williams, who chairs the county’s delegation in the House of Delegate, said in an interview.
“I still maintain that the Greenbelt site is the better location for the relocation of the FBI. It’s disappointing to hear the administration trying to undermine what was already done through the official GSA process,” she said.
“Congress has already appropriated funds for the purpose of the construction of the new FBI headquarters in Maryland. Now the administration’s attempting to redirect those funds really undermines congressional intent,” Williams said, echoing arguments of Team Maryland.
Williams and her two Democratic District 22 colleagues – Dels. Anne Healey and Ashanti Martinez – sponsored legislation that went into effect Tuesday directing the governor to include $200 million in the state budget “for site redevelopment and to improve transportation infrastructure for the Federal Bureau of Investigation headquarters relocation project.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/28785424127_e75ffb3705_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-02 09:03:55.055627

Still, advocates say this year’s legislative session made “substantial progress” advancing the well-being of children.
“We see now more than ever a context where money is leading decisions,” said Tara Raines, the deputy director of the Children’s Advocacy Alliance, which on Tuesday held a virtual panel to discuss the 2025 Legislative Session.
“We want to make sure that folks who don’t have the resources, like children in particular, who can’t vote, can’t write contributions and give contributions and donations, that they have a voice,” Raines added.
This year’s session brought major disappointments, like the veto of a bill to require some businesses to offer paid family and medical leave, but also some under-the-radar triumphs, like the capping of child welfare caseloads, that advocates believe will have an immediate and positive impact on children.
 Ideas that failed

One of the bills the alliance supported that failed was Assembly Bill 185, which sought to prevent most homeowners associations from prohibiting licensed home-based childcare operations within their communities.
“Decreasing those barriers for licensure would mean increasing the ability to serve more of Nevada’s families, and the cost of care would decline as we know that home based care is oftentimes more affordable,” Dr. Jamelle Nance, director of early childhood policy for the alliance, said.
The bill received some bipartisan support, but was vetoed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo.
In his veto message he wrote the legislation “disrupts that balance by stripping HOAs of a key element of their regulatory authority.”
“While expanding access to child care is an important goal for supporting a productive workforce, AB 185 addresses the issue in a way that undermines the foundational principles of homeowners’ associations,” he wrote. 
The alliance also backed Assembly Bill 388, which would have required employers with 50 or more employees to implement a paid family and medical leave. It wouldn’t have gone into effect until Jan. 1, 2028.
Nance said the policy was “important for the financial stability of Nevada families.”
The bill was opposed by business industry groups like chambers of commerce.
In his statement, Lombardo sided with businesses.  
“Nevada has long prided itself on maintaining a business-friendly environment-one that supports growth, innovation, and job creation,” Lombardo wrote in his veto message. “Now is not the time to introduce broad, burdensome mandates that would significantly disrupt this balance, particularly for Nevada’s small and mid-sized businesses.”
Assembly Bill 339 sought to establish an office of children’s mental and behavioral health within the Department of Health and Human Services to streamline and connect the provision of mental and behavioral health services for children.
The bill didn’t advance on its own but its language was amended into the governor’s health care bill to become the framework for the Office of Mental Health, according to Carissa Pearce, the health policy manager with the alliance.
Lombardo’s health care bill, Senate Bill 495, was also amended by Democrats to include language related to freestanding emergency rooms, which caused Senate Republicans to vote against the bill. It never received a vote in the Assembly.
Senate Bill 306 would have required the Division of Child and Family Services of the Department of Health and Human Service to create a task force looking at transitional housing for youth discharged from treatment facilities. 
“The bill proposed the creation of a multi-agency task force to design transitional housing and support services for children when they’re discharged from psychiatric facilities or released on parole,” said Annette Dawson Owens, the community engagement manager for the alliance. “It was commonly referred to as the ‘no eject, no reject bill.’”
The bill went through several amendments and ultimately died.
  What progress was made

Despite several bills the group back failing, Dawson Owens said the session passed legislation that would benefit children in the state.
Among these was Senate Bill 284, which puts more parameters on child welfare agencies regarding how it deals with the federal benefits children in the agency receive.
Jonathan Norman, statewide advocacy, outreach and policy director for the Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers, said on Tuesday that the bill will stop child welfare agencies “from intercepting and using the child’s federal benefit, which could be social security disability, (Veterans Affairs) benefit or a death benefit to cover the cost of that child being in foster care.”
Nevada is the sixth state to pass this type of legislation, he added.
Other bills the alliance highlighted as a positive for the well being of child included:

Senate Bill 183, which prohibits child welfare agencies from assigning more than 30 children to a caseworker. It makes exceptions to allow siblings to be assigned to the same caseworker.
Senate Bill 165, which creates a profession of licensed behavioral health and wellness practitioners by the Board of Psychological Examiners for the supervised clinical use of prevention and early intervention strategies relating to children’s mental health.
Senate Bill 460, a heavily negotiated education bill between Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro and Lombardo that, among other things, attempts to expand pre-kindergarten programs by extending eligibility for state-funded pre-K and raising the household income for eligibility to 250% of the federal poverty level.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMGP2433-scaled-1-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-07-02 08:00:55.282100

Susie Lee holds press confrence at Spanish Hills Wellness Suites in Las Vegas to highlight Medicaid cuts in GOP-backed megabill. (Photo: Jeniffer Solis)Spanish Hills Wellness Suites is one of several nursing homes in Nevada that would be forced to reduce services for medically vulnerable patients who rely on Medicaid as a result of President Donald Trump’s domestic spending and tax cut bill.
Tuesday morning, the Senate narrowly cleared Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” which would cut $930 billion from Medicaid over the next 10 years, a major healthcare program that serves low income families and disabled people. The Senate version of the bill now goes back to the House for consideration as Congress attempts to meet Trump’s self-imposed July 4 deadline.
Under the bill, Nevada stands to lose about $590 million in federal Medicaid funding, resulting in more than 114,500 patients in the state losing healthcare coverage, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Following the Senate vote, Democratic Rep. Susie Lee toured the Spanish Hills Wellness Suites in Las Vegas to emphasize the devastating impact the proposed bill, if passed in its current form, would have on Nevada Medicaid patients.
“What it will do is have an impact of forcing facilities like this one and hospitals to shut their doors. We already have a health care shortage in our state, so this will only exacerbate it,” Lee said.
Spanish Hills Wellness Suites houses about 150 patients who need long-term and short-term care post-hospitalization; 70% of those residents rely on Medicaid to pay.
“These are long-term patients with chronic conditions who’ve been here for years,” said Jyesebelle Ocampo, the director of nursing for the facility. “That’s why they’re scared. If no one is paying, how can we operate?”
The Spanish Hills Wellness Suites is not unique. Nevada relies heavily on Medicaid. Approximately 800,000 Nevadans, or about 20% of the total population, are covered by the program.
“Medicaid is a foundational part of our health care system, with about 60% of Nevada nursing home residents relying on Medicaid to access the care that they need,” said Brett Salmon, president and CEO of Nevada Health Care Association.
The GOP-backed megabill would reduce access to long-term care services for people enrolled in Medicaid by reducing federal funds for nursing facilities. Long-term care providers in Nevada said those cuts could lead to reduced staffing and tightened eligibility requirements in long-term care facilities in the state.
Long-term care services are extremely expensive and are not typically covered by other health insurance programs. Medicaid is the primary insurer for long-term care nationwide, according to the health policy think tank KFF.
“Reductions in Medicaid would impact our ability to operate and care for our residents. It would strain our ability to retain staff, invest in care improvements and meet the growing demand for services that we provide our residents,” Salmon said.
Lee warned that reductions in Medicaid funding through the GOP-backed megabill could lead to significant funding cuts for nursing homes, including reduced services, increased costs for residents and their families, and even potential closures of facilities.
“It’s not just hospitals and nursing homes that will turn patients away or close down, but it jeopardizes hundreds of clinics that provide breast cancer screening, critical health care and so much more,” Lee said.
The largest source of federal Medicaid spending cuts under the Senate bill would come from stricter work requirements on beneficiaries, including people up to age 65. Another major provision would eliminate tax credits used to purchase Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace for those who do not meet work requirements.
Lee argued Republicans in Congress were pushing “the largest cuts to healthcare coverage in U.S. history” in order to give tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will add $3.3 trillion to the national debt.
“We’re literally asking our children, our grandchildren, to pay for these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans,” Lee said.
Medicaid is a major source of health care coverage for thousands in Nevada. The Affordable Care Act allowed states to opt into expanded Medicaid coverage in 2014. 
Prior to the Medicaid expansion, Nevada was among the states with the highest percentage of adults with no health insurance. With the expansion, Nevada’s uninsured rate dropped from 22% in 2012 to 10% in 2024, according to KFF.
“Most Americans have at least some connection to Medicaid, whether it be through health insurance, home health care, nursing home care, or coverage for a child,” Lee added.
On Sunday, before the Senate vote, the White House published a post repeatedly stating that the “big beautiful bill” will not cut Medicaid funding.
Vice President JD Vance, who cast the tiebreaking vote Tuesday to pass the Senate bill 51-50, said in social media posts the Medicaid cuts are “immaterial” compared to savings the bill would bring through expanding immigration enforcement.
Lee rejected those claims, calling the bill a “big bullshit bill.”
“It is a lie. When you cut $7 billion from the state of Nevada, trust me, people will lose their health care,” Lee said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSC07043-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-02 08:00:55.282100

Sign up for their newsletters at ckbe.at/newsletters
Schools are scrambling to plan for what could become a massive budget hole after the Trump administration said Monday it would not release nearly $7 billion in K-12 education funds that had been expected to go out July 1.
The withheld funds, which were approved by Congress earlier this year, include all $890 million meant to help English learners develop their language skills and $375 million to provide academic support to the children of migrant farmworkers, according to an email that was sent to states by the U.S. Department of Education and obtained by Education Week.
The money being held back also includes $2.2 billion in Title II funds that support teacher training, $1.4 billion for before- and after-school programs, and $1.3 billion in funding for academic enrichment programs, such as STEM and college and career counseling.
Several states, Democratic lawmakers, and education advocacy groups are calling on the Trump administration to release the money, calling the move an illegal act of impoundment. The Education Department referred inquiries to the White House Office of Management and Budget, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.
Congress had previously approved this funding as part of a continuing budget resolution in March, which was supposed to keep K-12 education funding mostly level for the 2025-26 school year. But the Trump administration told states on Monday that it has not yet decided how this money will be allocated, and won’t send funding notices until it completes a review, the email obtained by Education Week stated.
In a Tuesday press conference, California education officials said the Trump administration’s letter indicated the money was being held back to ensure the funds were spent in accordance with the president’s priorities. As it has in other recent instances, California will “continue to pursue all available legal remedies to the Trump administration’s unlawful withholding of federal funds appropriated by Congress,” Superintendent Tony Thurmond told reporters.
The unreleased funding aligns with many of the K-12 budget cuts the Trump administration proposed to make in fiscal 2026 — cuts that Congress has yet to vote on and which shouldn’t affect schools’ bottom lines until the 2026-27 school year.
In a written statement, U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, the vice chair of the Senate appropriations committee who also sits on the Senate education committee, said the funding holdup had forced schools to delay hiring staff and pause initiatives for students.
“Local school districts can’t afford to wait out lengthy court proceedings to get the federal funding they’re owed — nor can they make up the shortfall, especially not at the drop of a pin,” Murray wrote.
Ray Hart, the executive director of the Council of the Great City Schools, which represents many of the nation’s large urban districts, said schools were counting on this money to pay teachers and principals, provide summer school, and cover school safety costs.
Holding back the after-school funding affects nearly 10,000 after-school programs, said Jodi Grant, the executive director of Afterschool Alliance, and has left many worried they will have to close.
In a Tuesday press conference, advocates for immigrant children and English learners sounded the alarm about how withholding Title III funds would hurt schools’ ability to hire translators and staff to work with multilingual students and host workshops for immigrant families.
Some summer programs that rely on Title III funds to train school staff were put on hold, said Susanne Pena, an assistant teaching professor at Florida International University. (The Trump administration gutted the Education Department office that used to oversee Title III earlier this year.)
“Families who do not speak English could be cut off from schools and the support system that they need in order to help their students be successful,” said Anabolena DeGenna, the superintendent of Oxnard School District in southern California.

No surprise that supporters of Israel object to Palestinian flags. The flags represent the 100-year struggle for the liberation of the country of Palestine from Zionist colonization and apartheid. 
This colonization was sponsored first by Britain (No Kings!) and then by the U.S. But for the growing movement against President Donald Trump and authoritarianism in the U.S., the struggle for freedom and equality in Palestine means much more.

Listen to the message from Palestinian-American student Hisham Arwatani at the Burlington No Kings rally: “As we stand here today, unified in common cause, we must realize that no struggle stands in isolation. The migrant camps of El Salvador are modeled after the prisons of Israel, and ICE has been unleashed to suppress Palestinian and undocumented alike. We are facing a seething force of hatred and division, and we must stand in lockstep to fight it.” 
Arwatani, a target of a shooting in Burlington, knows about the violence of occupation and genocide boomeranging back to the U.S., fueling the far right and being used to attack our free speech, dissent and aspirations for justice and dignity for everyone.

I’ve seen firsthand how our schools are sustained by the steady, collective effort of people who really care.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Pam Reed: The quiet moments that matter.","This commentary is by Pam Reed, incoming superintendent of Rutland City Public Schools.


In my years working in education, here’s something I’ve learned along the way: the most impactful moments usually happen quietly.
It’s a student finally mastering a skill after weeks of struggle. It’s a teacher staying late to find the right way to help someone who is having a tough time. It’s a quick exchange with a bus driver that brightens a student’s entire outlook.
These moments aren’t flashy, and they can be fleeting. But they are the moments that really shape who we become, both individually and as a community.
As I step into the role of superintendent, I’m mindful that one of my greatest responsibilities is to preserve and strengthen our ability to create those moments. My job is not to have every answer or to impose big ideas from above. It’s to ensure our schools have the resources and support they need to thrive. To create an environment that allows students, teachers and all of our staff to flourish. 
I am sincerely thankful to Superintendent Bill Olsen for his leadership during some of the most tumultuous years in the recent history of education. Since 2020, Bill’s steady guidance and thoughtful decision-making have helped Rutland City Public Schools navigate enormous challenges: from the initial days of the pandemic to ongoing pressures around staffing and shifting models of learning, to his work on securing a more equitable education funding formula in Vermont.
His example has set a clear foundation that I’m committed to building upon. He did far more than simply keep our district afloat; his leadership strengthened our schools and positioned us for continued growth and excellence.
I am also grateful to our school commissioners. Their service is made up of quietly important moments. They aren’t driven by the need for recognition but by genuine care and a commitment to our schools. Their work exemplifies the unsung dedication that keeps our district moving forward.
As someone raised in Rutland, who has spent the majority of my career here and has served in a range of roles across this district, I’ve seen firsthand how our schools are sustained by the steady, collective effort of people who really care. Each role matters, and each contribution makes a difference, creating a community where students know they truly belong.
There will certainly be difficult decisions ahead, as there always are. But when I look at Rutland City Public Schools, I see tremendous reason for optimism and pride. I see resilience and kindness from students every day. I see educators and educational support professionals who go the extra mile without expecting praise. I see a community consistently willing to show up for one another and engage.
It’s these quiet but powerful realities that drive my commitment as superintendent and my love for public education, particularly in Rutland.
From teachers in classrooms to custodians and coaches, from bus drivers to kitchen staff, and everyone else who quietly cares for our students. Every person contributes something meaningful and essential to our school community.
Together, deliberately and thoughtfully, we’ll build on the strong foundation we already have, ensuring that impactful moments continue to happen for our students every day. I am honored to step into this role, and I look forward to the work ahead.

The work is not complete, and both the legislators and the governor admit that. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Eric Peterson: Gov. Scott’s big beautiful bill.","This commentary is by Eric Peterson of Bennington. He was a longtime columnist for the Bennington Banner and Berkshire Eagle and has also written columns for the Albany Times Union.


As the landmark education bill struggled mightily to be born in the Legislature, the question became whether it could be Phil Scott’s crowning achievement. 
Gov. Scott is serving his fifth two-year term as governor of Vermont. Only in New Hampshire and Vermont do governors serve two-year terms, the other 48 states are all four years. It means a Vermont governor only has one year in which to enact his/her major program before having to run yet again for reelection.
A comprehensive bill can take the full two years. Vermont’s legislators work part-time. A session lasts five or six months. There will continue to be meetings during the summer but the whole legislature won’t return to Montpelier until the new year.
The myriad problems of Vermont’s schools have worried governors, legislators, teachers and parents for many years. This year there was finally a serious attempt to vault the state’s education system into the 21st century.
Scott has been a successful and popular governor. His style is often to respond to the legislature. He softens the Democratic majority’s policy prescriptions to make them semi-palatable to the Legislature’s Republicans and to Vermont’s conservative voters.
Scott has been a “make no waves” kind of chief executive. He rarely leads with proposals with his personal vision of a Vermont of the future. The two-year terms are an encumbrance to serious, thoughtful planning for the future. But so is Scott’s seeming reticence to lead.
This is not entirely the governor’s fault. Democrats have been Vermont’s majority party for years, although they did lose their supermajority in the state senate last year. Scott is also a member of a vanishing breed, a moderate Republican. The national party has moved not so much rightward as Trumpward.
There was a time when Green Mountain State Republicans such as Aiken, Stafford and Snelling (More Dick than Barbara) were not entirely out of step with other Republican officeholders throughout the country. The Vermonters were often more cordial and less dogmatic while remaining small-government conservatives. In today’s political world Governor Scott continues the Vermont Republican traditions and finds himself basically adrift in sensible Vermont.
The work is not complete, and both the legislators and the governor admit that. Work is expected to continue through the next session. Vermont parents and school board members will have their say over the next several months as they read about the plan and talk to your representatives and their neighbors.
Rep. Jonathan Cooper is a bright, impressive young first-term member of the Vermont House representing Pownal, Readsboro, Searsburg, Stamford and Woodford. Cooper, a Democrat, is a regional planner with two master’s degrees. He is the father of a young student.
In an email exchange with Rep. Cooper, I asked him about his first session as a representative and questioned him about issues including the education bill. Representing several small towns, he is alert to the many problems facing rural communities with dwindling numbers of students.
In Rep. Cooper’s district there are two schools with a warm place in my heart: Pownal Elementary School and Woodford Hollow Elementary School.
The theatre arts high school class I co-taught in Bennington created a program at Woodford Hollow in which our students worked with their students. I also directed the school play, an after-school program, at Pownal School for several years.
The faculty at both schools were dedicated and their students were bright and enthusiastic. It made me a strong proponent of bringing high school and elementary school students to work together and an admirer of the close bonds students make in small schools.
Mr. Cooper voted in favor of the education bill saying, “I voted for the fairness and accountability within the bill: fairness in how Vermont’s kids benefit from our education resources, and accountability in how Vermont’s education system meets our students’ needs  … We have lost almost 50 percent of our public-school population in the last 40 years, but the administrative presence is even larger than it was back then.”
Rep. Cooper is correct and that, in a nutshell, is the problem. Fewer students, larger expenses.
Cooper referenced the Vermont Supreme Court Brigham ruling that it was unfair and unconstitutional to let each town or school district decide how much it wanted to spend on its own. “At that time, “Cooper wrote, “a student in the highest spending town received 2.5 times the education funding of a student in the lowest spending town.”
But by 2025, Cooper wrote, “A student in Vermont’s highest-spending town received more than three times the education funding of a student in the lowest-spending town.”
Cooper wrote that legislators were “clear-eyed” that more work remained to be done, and that Gov. Scott’s team was involved “every step of the way” and that the number of Republican senators and representatives is proof of that.
Jonathan Cooper is a young man with a bright future. One can hope he continues his legislative career well beyond his first term.
It might also be beneficial if Gov. Scott decides that getting the education bill right and finished will be his goal. That may take sacrifice.
Announcing before or early in the next legislative session that all his attention will be on preparing the Vermont education system for the next 30 years will be his overriding concern. Therefore, he will not seek a sixth term as governor.
That would allow him to go out a winner and to be long remembered as the governor who greatly improved the state’s education model. It will also allow Vermont to acquire new eyes and fresh thinking for other challenges facing the Green Mountain State.

He said he found the firearms culture in New Jersey ""ridiculously white"" when he moved here from Virginia in 1993 and aims to change that. (Photo courtesy of Tony Simon)Paterson police denied Mahmoud “Mo” Ramadan’s request for a gun carry permit after he hounded them — and the mayor — about their poky pace in processing his application. Sharon Palombi got denied in South Toms River because of her past police involvement as a crime victim. And Leonard Mirabal’s extensive — but non-criminal — driving infractions prompted Carlstadt cops to refuse his carry request.
New Jersey law lays out several documentable reasons why police can deny carry permits, including if applicants have criminal convictions, histories of addiction or mental health disorders, or active restraining orders. But it also allows officers to make subjective judgments and reject applicants they deem lack “the essential character of temperament necessary to be entrusted with a firearm.”
Consequently, a growing, disgruntled group of applicants — including Ramadan, Palombi, and Mirabal — have successfully challenged denials, which two recent studies found have disproportionately impacted people of color in New Jersey.
Now, a Republican state lawmaker wants police to answer to the Legislature and the public on the issue, by mandating monthly reporting on permit denials. Municipalities would have to publicly detail their reasons for denying firearm purchaser identification cards and gun carry permits under a bill Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia (R-Sussex) introduced Monday. The measure also would require reporting on the age, race, gender identity, and ethnicity of denied applicants.
“There are barriers to exercising your Second Amendment — prior felonies, mental health concerns — that are valid concerns. But the color of your skin is not a valid concern,” Fantasia said. “There should be no subjective measures. When you allow subjective measures into the conversation, that leaves it up to people, to personalities, to preconceived notions, and to bias, and that’s what we want to remove. There should never be bias associated with your ability to exercise a constitutional right.”
The attorney general’s office already publicly reports applicant demographics but does no analysis of denials and attributes more than two thirds of them to unspecified “public health, safety and welfare” concerns or just “other disapproval reasons.”
John Petrolino, a firearms instructor and freelance writer who focuses on Second Amendment issues, dove into the data last year and found that Black applicants were denied permits for subjective reasons at twice the rate of whites.
Academic researchers with the nonprofit Rise Against Hate drilled deeper into the data and determined the denial disparities reflected “major systemic issues,” given that people of color applying for carry permits passed the same initial screening requirements (to get firearm ID cards) as white carry applicants. Those researchers also found that denials disproportionately impacted Hispanic applicants too, and that disparities (for subjective and objective reasons) were worst in Ocean, Gloucester, and Cumberland counties.
They recommended policymakers mandate more detailed explanations for denials, anti-bias training for law enforcement officers overseeing permit decisions, and increased transparency to eliminate disparities they deemed systemic.
Spokespeople for the attorney general’s office did not respond to a request for comment about racial disparities in denials.

 Targeting restrictions in court — and municipal ordinance
Fantasia, a longtime gun owner and hunter, said she relies on firearms for protection, as both a single mother of three and someone who was held up at gunpoint at the fast-food restaurant where she worked when she was 17.
“Ever since then, it’s always been imprinted in me,” Fantasia said of her enthusiasm for gun rights.
She has introduced other gun-related legislation in Trenton, including measures that would create Second Amendment license plates and allow school security officers with carry permits to take their guns onto school grounds and buildings.
She hasn’t yet lined up a Senate sponsor for her bill to mandate public reporting on denials, but she thinks it should have broad, bipartisan appeal because it’s about transparency and disparities.
“It really is an issue of: why are we discriminating?” she said.
The bill, which Assemblyman Bob Auth (R-Bergen) also signed on to sponsor, would require the state attorney general’s office to report in detail on denials dating back to June 2022. That’s when the U.S. Supreme Court, in a landmark ruling known as Bruen, declared gun owners have a constitutional right to carry guns, and states cannot require gun owners to prove a need to take firearms outside their homes or businesses.
Applications for carry permits have soared in New Jersey since Bruen, with police fielding almost 77,000 between Bruen and May 31, data shows. Less than 1,500 of them were for renewals; the rest were new applicants, the data shows. Four hundred applicants were denied.
The New Jersey Firearms Owners Syndicate is pushing for Fantasia’s legislation, which has the same goals as a measure now stalled in Congress. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Kentucky) introduced a bill in March that would mandate federal reporting on permit denials.
The syndicate endorsed Fantasia’s reelection bid in May and named her Legislator of the Year.
Joe LoPorto, the group’s director of legal operations, said Bruen was clear that subjective denials cannot stand.

“The whole point was to establish that law enforcement agencies couldn’t arbitrarily decide who and who couldn’t exercise their rights,” LoPorto said. “For Second Amendment purposes, background checking should be straightforward. There really shouldn’t be subjective standards at all, and we’re not getting enough information on why these denials are coming out the way that they are.”
Ramadan seconded that sentiment, saying his fight isn’t just one of principle. His permit denial kept him from landing a job in armed security, he said.
“I think the answer here is, literally, just follow what the Constitution says and stop trying to abuse your authority,” Ramadan said.
The bill is part of a widening strategy gun-rights groups have undertaken since Bruen to try to dismantle New Jersey’s famously tough gun restrictions.
Gun owners challenged a state law Gov. Phil Murphy signed in December 2022, in response to Bruen, that barred guns from sensitive places like arenas, polling places and beaches, create new training requirements, and hike permitting fees, among other things.
Two years since lawyers argued the matter in court, a federal appellate panel still has not issued its ruling. The law, though, largely remains on hold until the court challenge is resolved.
Gun owners have also taken their fight to municipal meetings around the state, lobbying local officials to give up the higher gun-permit fees state legislators mandated in the December 2022 law.
Englishtown and Franklin recently became the first towns statewide to authorize municipal officials to refund $150 — the local portion of permit fees — to applicants. LoPorto said officials in about a dozen other towns, including Park Ridge, Dumont, Absecon, and West Amwell, also are considering dropping the local fees.
“It’s as much about providing relief for the residents of these towns as it is about sending that statewide message that this is fundamentally unfair,” LoPorto said of the push to eliminate such fees.

When Tony Simon moved to New Jersey from Virginia in 1993, he found the firearms culture here “ridiculously white.”
Now Simon, a firearms instructor and military veteran who lives in Ewing, runs The Second Is for Everyone diversity shoots at gun ranges around the state to bring people into the gun community who have historically felt excluded.
The subjective judgments built into the gun permitting process in New Jersey ensure police will not enforce gun regulations equally, and denial disparities will persist, Simon said.
“I think it’s a racist system,” he said. “You go in. They say: ‘Well why do you want a gun? Why do you need a gun?’ They make it complicated. I’ve heard stories from people: ‘They treated me like a criminal, an international drug dealer, a terrorist.’ When you have rules like this, it’s not going to be enforced in Berkeley Heights, in the high-end neighborhoods. It’s going enforced on the poor people and the brown people.”

(Photo by Robin Bravender/States Newsroom)Justice Department attorneys told a federal district judge Tuesday that the Trump administration will not impose proposed restrictions on birthright citizenship for a month — but that it reserves the right to “immediately” start planning for that day.
The two-page notice was filed in U.S.District Court in Greenbelt in response to District Judge Deborah Boardman’s demand a day earlier to know “if the government thinks that it can start removing children from the United States who are subject to the terms of the executive order,”
It is the latest twist in a months-long legal battle over an executive order signed by President Donald Trump on Jan. 21, his first day back in office, that sought to deny citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. unless at least one of their parents was a citizen or a permanent legal resident.
Historically, “birthright” citizenship has been granted to anyone born on U.S. soil, regardless of their parent’s status. But Trump claimed in his executive order that that was a misinterpretation of the law, which he claimed was never intended to apply to everyone.
Judge gives administration until Tuesday to put birthright citizenship plans in writing

The order was almost immediately challenged in court by groups that said birthright citizenship is a bedrock of U.S democracy, and that denying citizenship to a child born here could make the child stateless altogether. Judges in three different districts, including Boardman, agreed and issued nationwide injunctions to block the order.
The government appeal focused on whether the district court judges had the authority to impose a nationwide ban on the order. In a 6-3 ruling Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed that the judges should not have extended the injunction beyond those people and groups that brought the suits.
But the high court’s ruling noted that a class-action suit could apply nationally. That’s why the plaintiffs in the Maryland case — CASA, the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project at 15 women who are pregnant or new mothers — were back in court Monday, seeking to get their suit certified as a class action suit for all undocumented parents and their babies.
The Supreme Court sent the cases back to the district court, but also set July 27 as the earliest date the administration can apply the executive order, to allow time for the cases to be reheard. On Monday, Boardman ordered Trump’s attorneys to clarify in writing the government’s view of what it can do under the executive order, and when.
Trump’s attorneys agreed in the filing that the earliest date the administration would apply the order is, in fact, July 27. But the the court’s ruling also provided for a 30-day ramp-up period, the notice said. 
“The Court’s stay thus allows Defendants to immediately begin to ‘develop[] and issu[e] public guidance about the Executive’s plans to implement the Executive Order,’” the filing reads.
Boardman also gave Trump’s lawyers until July 7 to file a response to the plaintiffs’ motion to turn the case into a class action lawsuit.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC_1049-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-02 07:05:30.500466

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Provisions in the new tax and spending bill passed by the U.S. Senate early Tuesday would go even further than the House bill in removing health care and other benefits from immigrants with legal status.
The House version of the massive tax and spending bill penalized states providing health care for some immigrants with legal status as well as those that chose to spend state money to enroll immigrants without legal status in Medicaid.
But the Senate bill is even tougher on immigrants here legally and illegally, reducing benefits for most refugees and immigrants on humanitarian parole, including Afghans and Ukrainians who helped the United States in wars overseas and in return were promised safe haven and a safety net in the United States.
The Senate bill also cuts state reimbursement for emergency care in the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That would force those states to pay more for emergency care for immigrants, cut back services or drop out of Medicaid expansion, a potentially catastrophic move for low-income U.S. citizens as well as new immigrants.
The bill passed with three dissenting Republican votes, from U.S. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Vice President JD Vance broke the tie. The bill, officially the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” now returns to the House for final passage before going to President Donald Trump to be signed.
States face hard choices as budgets expected to tighten

Advocates and experts see repercussions as refugees and other legal immigrants lose health insurance and turn to already-stressed hospitals and charities for help. It could be a nail in the coffin for some rural hospitals that are in financial trouble and scaling back services. Hospitals are required to serve anyone who arrives for emergency care, regardless of their ability to pay.
“In our state, it’s going to be absolutely devastating for rural hospitals,” said Kate Woomer-Deters, a senior attorney at the North Carolina Justice Center’s Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Refugees are not going to go home just because they lost their health care coverage. They’re still going to be showing up at the door of hospitals and clinics needing care.”
Some groups, such as Afghans, Ukrainians and Iraqis, were often brought here after helping the U.S. in war efforts, putting their lives in danger and making life in their home country untenable.
“In the case of the Afghans, this is pretty much a knife in the back to those folks who helped the United States when the United States needed help in their country,” said David Meyer, a board member of the Bloomington Refugee Support Network in Indiana, where he personally helps seven refugee families from Afghanistan, Honduras, Iraq, Nicaragua and Syria.
The Senate bill takes Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and even food stamps off the table for most refugees. There are a few narrow exceptions for people with green cards, some Cuban migrants waiting for citizenship, and some Micronesians and Marshall Islands natives with treaty rights, said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
That also applies to immigrants with legal status who don’t have green cards: people with asylum, immigrant victims of domestic violence, immigrant victims of sex trafficking and parolees — such as Afghans — admitted due to urgent humanitarian reasons, as well as to refugees.












It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.


– Shelby Gonzales, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities




“There’s going to be more emergency health care needs because uninsured people will be delaying care,” Gonzales said. “It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.”
The bill also cuts funding for expansion states to pay for emergency care in hospitals. Increased costs could force some states to drop Medicaid expansion altogether, spreading the pain to low-income U.S. citizens as well, Gonzales said.
“It’s one more reason states are looking at their budgets and they’re having to make decisions about their Medicaid expansion program,” Gonzales said.
In Indiana, Meyer said, Afghan women especially often need food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to get by at first. It takes them a long time to learn to read and write since they were not allowed to attend any school under the Taliban.
“They arrived in our community totally illiterate in their native language and starting from scratch learning English, so that’s a huge impediment to being gainfully employed,” Meyer said. Even once they’ve become self-sufficient enough to get off food stamps and Medicaid, many still need the support of the Affordable Care Act to get health care.
Removing all subsidized health care “would have a devastating effect on those families, and not just Afghans but Syrians, people from the Democratic Republic of Congo and others that have been relocated to south-central Indiana,” Meyer said.
‘Big Beautiful Bill’ dings states that offer health care to some immigrants here legally

Indiana hosted more than 10,500 of the nearly 460,000 refugees who arrived in the United States between 2013 and 2023, according to a 2023 report from the nonprofit Immigration Research Initiative. In fiscal 2024, another 1,380 arrived in Indiana, mostly from Congo and Burma, but including 90 people from Afghanistan, according to State Department records.
In North Carolina, there were 276 new Afghan refugees in fiscal 2024 among 2,730 total new refugees. Even professional Afghans such as doctors and lawyers struggle at first in low-wage jobs, said Woomer-Deters, of the North Carolina Justice Center. It takes time for them to get accreditation and language skills to practice their professions here, she said.
“A lot of these folks need their food stamps, Medicaid — they need these programs for an adjustment period when they get here. And these are people we’ve invited to come and have vetted,” she said.
A Congressional Budget Office report June 29 estimated that almost 12 million people, including 1.4 million immigrants covered by state-only programs, would lose health insurance under the Senate plan.
A Republican response to an earlier CBO report emphasized that the bill would save states $13.1 billion in Medicaid spending over 10 years, “freeing up resources they can choose to reinvest to further strengthen care for the most vulnerable Americans.”
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, however, called that conclusion misleading in its own response in turn.
“These savings would largely result from millions of people losing health coverage — hardly an outcome worth celebrating,” the response said.
More states offer health care coverage for certain immigrants, noncitizens

Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, said there was one small positive change in the Senate version compared to the House version.
States will no longer be penalized for using the option to cover some immigrant children and pregnant women.
And the Senate version would not penalize expansion states for offering Medicaid to immigrants on humanitarian parole, but only because that help for parolees was ended entirely, along with help for refugees and other kind of immigrants with legal status who lack green cards, Cuello said.
“In other words, they are blocking all paths to health care,” Cuello said in an emailed statement. “This is not an attack on the undocumented. It’s an attack on lawfully present immigrants.”

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)State government officials rescinded 8,486 hybrid remote work agreements Tuesday as Gov. Mike Braun’s push to return state employees to the office takes full effect.
Indiana Secretary of Management and Budget Lisa Hershman said there will be no more hybrid arrangements — employees will either work solely in state offices or solely at home. Each agreement applies to a single employee.
“We looked at what makes sense to maximize value and productivity, and so we didn’t have a steadfast goal, but we knew that we were missing out on collaborative opportunities,” she said.
The state dropped from 10,588 active remote work agreements in January when Braun’s executive order was issued to 9,293 as of June 23.
As of July 1 that number is down to 537, the state personnel department reported Tuesday. But they are still documenting employees who have always worked entirely off-site or whose roles have been identified as best performed remotely full-time per the new policy. Once those records are captured, the number of active agreements should rise by roughly 1,200 over the next few months.
“That’s working fine,” Gov. Mike Braun told reporters recently. “Some, of course, didn’t like that. Most, I think, have come back. You know we’ve got a low unemployment rate in the state, so everybody’s going to be able to find something else. But that’s gone pretty smoothly.”
New executive orders seek to ‘deregulate’ Indiana agencies, force state workers back to offices

According to the Indiana Transparency Portal, the total number of state employees fell from 32,212 in December 2024 to 31,222 as of June 21 — a drop of almost 1,000 workers.
Hershman said there is still flexibility in the process. That’s why the administration took months of planning and examined job duties, budgets, office space, parking and technology needs.
“We were taking in a lot of input and to pull the band aid off is a very tough approach. And so that’s why we approached it a little bit in a more fluid way,” she said.
Hershman noted, for instance, that the July Fourth holiday week coincided with some vacations, allowing the state to track limited resources as employees trickle back into the office. Officials are monitoring parking in downtown Indianapolis state lots to see if that’s a problem, and mentioned that shuttles have been used in the past.
State Personnel Director Matthew Brown issued updated guidance on June 29 that establishes eligibility requirements, procedures, and recommendations for limited remote work.
“This policy emphasizes the inherent benefits of in-person collaboration while furthering governmental efficiency and responsiveness without sacrificing accountability,” the new policy said.
Some exceptions allowed
Former Gov. Eric Holcomb tried to bring many state employees back into state office buildings after the pandemic, but employees resisted and left for other jobs. That led to higher turnover and a policy reversal.
Hershman said the concern remains valid, and that Indiana is committed to attracting and retaining talent. She said they listened to employees voicing frustration in key cases.
For instance, while some employees are returning to the office, others might be moving from a hybrid approach to fully remote. That is true for those working state call centers.
She said data shows they are more productive at home and metrics are easy to track on their work.
“We took that into consideration and benchmarked that industry,” she said. “We wanted to understand what the needs of our constituents were, what our workforce talent was needing, and try to marry those so this was not something abrupt, and it we tried to be deliberately designed for the greatest impact.”
Hershman also noted the state will be flexible on when an employee works in the office. She said employees might share workspace and work different hours – perhaps one starting at 6 a.m. and another in late afternoon.
The new guidance has key rules for any remote work, including:

Remote work must be performed within the geographical boundaries of Indiana unless traveling for official functions or expressly authorized by the agency head and cabinet secretary.
Remote Work Agreements for hybrid schedules in existence on June 30, 2025, which are not an authorized exception as a reasonable accommodation, are rescinded. Employees shall work full time in an assigned office, facility, or field location and not from a remote location unless the agency head has determined remote work is required either full-time or on an ad hoc basis to accomplish specific operational objectives.
Remote work is not a substitute for child or dependent care. Employees approved for remote work must continue to arrange for child or dependent care to the same extent as if they were working at the office.
A remote work site must be safe and must have reliable internet access, a state-issued computer (or a personal computer utilizing IOT-approved security technology), and a phone line (that is, a state-issued cellular phone, a personal cellular phone compliant with IOT policies, or a landline). Employees shall be responsible for the security of all data, documents or information used for state business purposes.
Any remote work agreements are good for one year only, and will be renewed each January.

In order to provide the minimum of appropriate care, researchers and the Treatment Advocacy Center regard 30 psychiatric beds for every 100,000 residents living in a state. A 2024 report from the Treatment Advocacy Center, a non profit that advocates for timely access to mental health care, found that Michigan has about 19 beds per 100,000 residents, a shortage of about 1000 beds.
And what that shortage means, particularly for children, is families having to send children going through mental health crises to residential programs in other states, Marianne Huff, president and CEO of the Mental Health Association of Michigan told lawmakers during a meeting of the Michigan House Public Health and Food Security Committee.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
And the only ways kids with serious emotional disturbances can access that specialized residential treatment is if they encounter the juvenile justice system, Huff said.
“We really need to broaden and strengthen the continuum of care. Kids should not have to go into the juvenile justice system to get residential treatment, which is typically out of state,” Huff said. “Unless you’ve experienced or had to navigate behaviors with a child with serious emotional disturbance, it can be really hard to imagine how emotionally and physically and psychologically difficult and draining that can be for parents…I think we need to be looking at the full continuum… not just emergency rooms or state hospitals or outpatient. It’s what we can do to mitigate the behavior and the symptoms so that people don’t need to end up in longer term placements.”

Michigan’s lack of temporary long-term placements for individuals experiencing severe mental health crises both impacts the health care system and the criminal justice system that are each doing what they can to make up for Michigan’s lack of robust mental health infrastructure, former Corporate Counsel for the Kalamazoo County Community Mental Health Authority Steven Burnham told lawmakers.
Having spent time working with the county’s community mental health resources, Burnham said he remembers getting confused when a 12-year-old or 15-year-old would be entering the criminal justice system when it was clear they needed mental health resources. 
“We’re either all the way here or all the way there, and we have nothing in the middle,” Burnham said. “What we need is access to longer length of stay treatment… state hospital level of care, highly trained, fully staffed, specialized residential options.” 
In Grand Traverse County, the county’s sheriff’s office is attempting to address a psychiatric crisis and are unable to connect individuals who are incarcerated with appropriate services in a timely measure, though the department dedicates a great deal of time and money trying, case manager and social worker for the department Sarah Bush told lawmakers.
The department is responsible for 169 incarcerated individuals currently, with 38 individuals being determined to be “severely and persistently mentally ill” Bush said, and 85 of the cases involve diagnosis of substance use and mental health.
When the department attempts to get individuals high acuity hospital beds for individuals experiencing mental health crises, the department has to dedicate an officer to stay with them until they get a bed, which often there is not one that can be made available so they are transported back to the department, Bush said.
This process has cost the sheriff’s department over 197 hours of overtime as officers often have to transport individuals 4 hours down to Detroit to try and get a bed space, Bush said.
“We did start the jail diversion program where we are educating our officers to utilize mental health services… so that’s been working a little, but the bed placement is really where we’re struggling currently,” Bush said. 
From a community mental health perspective, Bush said it’s really difficult to see the same people, over and over again, come through the system and eventually get into the court system over issues that should have been addressed by mental health professionals and not necessarily resulted in an arrest. But once an arrest happens, it’s hard for the appropriate mental health services to be provided.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.

“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.

Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

Vermont has joined more than half the states across the country in banning smartphones from schools, a move state education officials and lawmakers have said will go a long way toward alleviating compulsive social media use among teens while removing classroom distractions.
Phil Scott signed legislation into law Friday that requires Vermont schools to adopt policies prohibiting students from using cellphones and other personal devices like smartwatches from arrival to dismissal. The policies, which would include exceptions for students who need certain accommodations, must take effect in time for the 2026-27 school year. 
The law also includes a first-of-its kind provision that bars schools from using social media platforms to communicate with students, or from otherwise requiring students to have social media accounts to engage in academic and extracurricular activities. That provision took effect immediately. Although the legislation provides exceptions for certain platforms approved by school administrators, it prohibits school officials, teachers and coaches from using platforms like Facebook or Tiktok to make announcements to students.
Vermont’s move comes amid growing concerns nationwide about the emotional and cognitive impacts of smartphone and social media use among teens, which have inspired a bipartisan movement to ban personal devices from classrooms across the country. 
Over 25 other states including Virginia, Arkansas and California have passed laws that either require schools to develop phone-free policies or simply ban smartphones from public school classrooms outright at the state level. A handful of other states like Delaware and Pennsylvania have passed laws incentivizing — but not requiring — schools to adopt policies by offering funding for pilot programs. 
Several countries, including France and Brazil, have also put into place nation-wide versions of a school smartphone ban.
“We need kids to be focused on learning, interacting with their peers, teachers, and friends while they’re at school,” Scott said in a statement upon signing the bill. “And it’s clear now that phones can get in the way of important conversations and class discussions and can also be used for harmful interactions, like bullying.” 
Vermont’s law directs the state’s Agency of Education to create a “model policy” for schools to follow when enacting the device ban, though schools could choose to adopt their own policies provided they are “at least as stringent” as the one developed by the state.
Prior to the passage of the law, many schools across Vermont had already adopted classroom smartphone bans, taking varied approaches to enforcement. 
At the Harwood Union Middle and High School, which adopted a ban last year, students place phones in lockable fabric pouches at the beginning of each day. At K-8 schools in the Maple Run Unified School District, meanwhile, students who bring phones to school are asked to turn them off and leave them out of sight.
“With the passage of our bill, the school day will soon provide all Vermont kids with a respite from the pressures and harms that are now ever-present in their lives thanks to social media and other online products,”  Rep. Angela Arsenault, D-Williston, said in a press release from the advocacy group Fairplay.

CLAREMONT — The Eagle Times announced it is suspending operations, saying it is “not able to achieve business results sufficient to make the paper financially viable,” according to an email sent out Monday.
The announcement comes three weeks after the newspaper ceased printing its three-days-per week print edition, which Eagle Times owner Jay Lucas attributed to the sudden departure of key employees last month.

On Monday, the phone number of its Claremont office was out of order and Lucas did not immediately respond to an email nor a phone call seeking comment.
“Our intent from the beginning has been to do all that we can to make it a success,” said the unsigned email that went out on Monday. “Unfortunately, while the most recent management team was able to generate high quality content and publish three weekly print editions, they were not able to achieve business results sufficient to make the paper financially viable.” As a result, The Eagle Times said it is suspending operations “for the time being, pending a full review of our operations and future options,” adding that “as we move forward we will keep you informed as to our future direction.”

As faith organizations working to prevent hunger, we urge Congress to defend nutrition funding in federal budget reconciliation negotiations to protect and strengthen critical nutrition programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid. These two lifesaving programs are crucial to the health and safety of all of us.
Food isn’t just necessary; it is sacred. Across many faith traditions, there is a holy invitation to care for people in need and to feed the hungry. Faith organizations heed this call every day through serving our neighbors at food pantries, organizing food drives with partners, or coming together in prayer and reflection over local issues and needs, along with hundreds of other faith-based community partners working with the Feeding America network of food banks in Indiana. We believe that access to food and health care are vital foundations for families to succeed, and when neighbors help neighbors, communities thrive.



This commentary was written by the following faith leaders:

Marcus Casteel, Pastor of Community Engagement at Grace Church
Rt. Rev. Jennifer Baskerville-Burrows, Bishop with the Episcopal Diocese of Indianapolis
Rev. David M. Mellott, President of the Christian Theological Seminary
Lindsey Nell Rabinowitch, Director of the Faith & Action Project and
Rabbi Brett Krichiver with the Indianapolis Hebrew Congregation




Today, this sacred call is threatened. Congress is making critical decisions that will impact whether families in our community have access to the food and health care they need to thrive. The budget reconciliation bill would reduce funding for life-saving programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid, programs that support families who come to our pantry and worship alongside us. Cuts to these programs will force many of our neighbors to make impossible choices between paying for food, rent, medical care, and other basic needs.
What’s happening in Washington D.C.
SNAP is our country’s most effective anti-hunger program, providing timely and targeted grocery assistance. In fact, SNAP provides nine meals for every one meal provided by the Feeding America network of food banks and faith-based partners. But the budget reconciliation bill makes significant funding cuts to SNAP, shifting more of the cost to states, proposing new red-tape requirements tied to work and limiting SNAP’s ability to modernize and adapt to inflation. The budget reconciliation bill could take an average of 9.5 billion meals off the table for SNAP participants every year.
State: insufficient planning, funding pauses summer meals program

As costs of living remain high, more and more neighbors are coming to Indiana’s food banks and pantries for support. Living in our values of compassion and care, faith based charities have been operating at full capacity alongside food bank partners across Indiana to get food to where it’s most needed. We need to pair the critical support food banks and community organizations provide with strong federal programs and good policies that support our children, seniors, veterans and working families who are working hard to build better lives.
As the House considers its decision on the changes made to the reconciliation bill, we pray that Indiana’s Congressional Delegation will answer the call to help end hunger and reject any policies that undermine SNAP and Medicaid, programs that invest in the dignity, health and stability of our neighbors and communities. Hunger is not a partisan issue—it is a moral one that transcends divides and speaks to our shared humanity. Now is the time to stand together and ensure every Hoosier has access to the food and health care they need to thrive.

Thirty years after wolves were brought back from near extinction in the U.S. Rocky Mountains, the state of Idaho is back in the wolf-killing business. 
﻿
Based on direction from the Idaho Fish and Game Commission, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game is working to reduce the state’s wolf population by more than 60% over six years.
According to the Idaho Gray Wolf Management Plan 2023-2028, the state’s goal is to reduce the wolf population down from the estimated average of 1,270 wolves to a new average of about 500 wolves, with a low of about 350 wolves. 
Based on the population dynamics in Idaho’s wolf population, the state estimates humans would need to kill about 37% of Idaho’s estimated wolf population each year for six years to reach the goal of an average population of 500 wolves
While nearly everyone in the wolf debate says it’s extremely difficult to get an accurate count of the animals within the state’s borders, some wolf advocates don’t agree with Idaho officials on how many wolves are actually in the state due to the research methods used until recently. 
And some worry that if the state doesn’t have an accurate wolf population count, it doesn’t know how many wolves should be killed under the management plan.
 Current wolf hunting, trapping policies a grim reminder of eradication campaign from the past, early wolf member of wolf management team says
Idaho legislators are driving the policy by responding to concerns from farmers and ranchers who have had animals like sheep and cattle killed by wolves. 
Between 2014 and 2023, wolves in Idaho killed a minimum of 1,291 domestic livestock animals, according to state records. The losses affected 299 different ranchers and farmers. 
But for Marcie Carter, one of the early members of the Nez Perce Tribe’s program that managed wolves in Idaho, the expansion of wolf hunting and trapping and the government-sponsored killing of wolves in Idaho is a grim reminder of the eradication campaign that nearly killed off all wolves in the U.S. Rocky Mountains by the 1940s.
Wolves are a native species in Idaho and all across the U.S. But as setters moved West, the U.S. government passed wolf-killing bounties meant to encourage westward expansion. By 1926, rangers had killed the last wolves in Yellowstone National Park. The last wolf in Idaho was killed in the 1930s, according to the Idaho Department of Fish and Game. 
In one of the most successful and controversial wildlife comeback stories in American history, the U.S. government reintroduced wolves to Yellowstone and Idaho in 1995.



“We did all this great work, and we spent hours and hours out in the woods and then to come to this point where they’re treated like vermin, it’s really disorienting,” said Carter, who now works as the watershed coordinator for the Nez Perce Tribe’s Department of Fisheries Resource Management.
 The impact of wolves on livestock in Idaho

Having livestock killed is a big deal to the rancher who owns that animal.
Cattle Battle: How wolves and livestock collide – and how one Idaho project offers solutions

But some wolf advocates say that, big picture, the number of livestock killed by wolves is pretty low every year. 
From 2018 to 2022, there were an average of 259 livestock deaths each year in Idaho that were deemed “confirmed” or “probable” wolf kills, according to the Idaho Department of Fish and Game. (Depredation is the term officials use when a predator like a wolf kills or maims livestock like cattle. Idaho Department of Fish and Game officials said “confirmed” or “probable” determinations are dependent on sufficient evidence remaining, which is dependent on very rapid detection and investigation of the carcass and minimal disturbance by scavengers. Those criteria often aren’t met in remote environments, therefore the documented “confirmed” and “probable” depredations should be considered a minimum number, Fish and Game officials said.)
That’s in a state with about 2.5 million head of cattle and 235,000 sheep – including on feedlots and dairies where wolves and other predators are not present. 
That means wolves kill an average of about 0.01% of Idaho’s combined cattle and sheep population each year. 
 How does Idaho estimate its wolf population?

All sides in the wolf debate agree it is extremely difficult to produce an exact population count of wolves in Idaho. 
The state is too big, the terrain is too rugged and wolves are too elusive for that to happen.
Instead, officials use multiple different techniques to estimate that wolf population. 
Until recently, Idaho Fish and Game officials used wildlife trail cameras and a statistical model to estimate the state’s wolf population.
Some outside researchers expressed concern with the accuracy of using wildlife cameras to estimate wolf populations. 
Scott Creel, an ecologist and conservation biologist who works for Montana State University, has studied carnivores since 1987 and studied wolf-elk interactions since the 1990s.
Creel has been critical of wolf population methods used in Montana and Idaho.
“I was frustrated with seeing methods being used to estimate wolf numbers that were very indirect and, in my opinion, were unlikely to produce accurate estimates,” Creel said. “I was particularly worried that the methods I was seeing used would produce estimates that wouldn’t change, even if the wolf numbers were really changing. So the wolf population would appear to be constant, even though the policy changed just because of the way we were counting them, which is extremely oblique in both of the two methods that I was reviewing.”

The Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks declined an interview request for this story.
Creel stressed that accurately estimating wolf populations is extremely difficult.
Idaho Department of Fish and Game officials disagree with Creel’s criticism, but acknowledged trail cam population estimation methods become less reliable when the number of images of wolves from the trail cameras declines. 
In July 2024, Idaho Fish and Game announced a new wolf population estimation procedure. 
Instead of using trail cams, officials are using new methods involving combination of genetic and information taken from a tooth of every wolf mortality documented by the state, information on the biological range of wolf population dynamics, a statistical model, and actual wolf hunting and mortality data.
It’s called the ABC method, short for Approximate Bayesian Computation, which Idaho Fish and Game officials said has been used widely in other scientific fields like epidemiology and population genetics. Biometricians use that method to estimate the total number of new litters of wolf pups each year and the average estimated wolf population.
When he introduced the new wolf population estimate in July 2024, Idaho Fish and Game Wildlife Bureau Chief Shane Roberts said the new population estimation method independently produced similar population estimates to the trail cam method’s population estimates from 2019 to 2022 using different data.
Roberts said that gives him confidence the new method produces consistent and reasonable population estimates. He also said it backs up the old trail cam method that outside researchers have publicly criticized.
“Although no population estimation technique is perfect, we now have an independent source of information that validates the camera-based estimates that we’ve been using to guide wolf management since 2019 and refutes the idea that those estimates are wildly erroneous, as some have claimed,” Roberts said during the July 2024 Idaho Fish and Game Commission meeting.
But for 2023, the trail cam method and the new method produced different population estimates.
The new method estimated 1,150 wolves, while the trail cam method estimated 840 wolves, Roberts said. 
Even though it has been a year since Idaho Fish and Game officials announced their new estimation methods, the methods do not appear on the Idaho Department of Fish and Game’s website for public review.
Howl reporters Clark Corbin and Heath Druzin asked Idaho Fish and Game officials for a copy of the state’s new methods for estimating the wolf population.



In March, Fish and Game officials said the only available information is a YouTube video of officials announcing their wolf population presentation. The relevant discussion takes place more than four hours into a six-hour Idaho Fish and Game Commission meeting on July 24, 2024.
Officials said they are working to publish their methods. 
“We are in the process of preparing a manuscript for peer-reviewed publication on the method, which we hope to have submitted for publication later this spring or early summer,” Roberts said in March. 
As of June 24, the department had not yet published its new wolf population estimation methods in a peer-reviewed publication. Roberts said June 24 that officials are close to submitting it and hope to have it submitted for peer-reviewed publication before the upcoming July 17 Idaho Fish and Game Commission meeting.
Despite questions and criticisms of past methods, Roberts said he is confident in using the new population estimation to drive wolf management decisions in Idaho.
“Because we were able to produce five years of virtually identical estimates between (the new methods) and the camera-based methods we’ve used before, we are confident this transition will result in consistent information to inform wolf management in the state,” Roberts said during the July 2024 Idaho Fish and Game Commission meeting. 
 Why Idaho’s wolf population estimate is important

Bob Crabtree, who founded the Yellowstone Ecological Research Center, said accuracy in wolf population estimates is extremely important.
“It’s like asking a business owner to try to make a profit or try to avoid losing money by not knowing what items they have on the shelves that they stock in their store,” Crabtree said. “Population size, or abundance, is the No. 1 criteria used to successfully manage and conserve and restore wolves. And without it, you just can’t.”
Many wolf laws and policies rely on wolf population estimates.
State Sen. Van Burtenshaw, a Republican rancher from the town of Terreton, Idaho, sponsored Senate Bill 1211, which Gov. Brad Little signed into law in 2021. 
The law removed the limit on the number of wolf tags hunters could buy each year, legalized wolf trapping year round on private property and allowed the state of Idaho to contract with federal agencies and other third parties to kill wolves.
Burtenshaw said he pushed for the law because his constituents told him there are too many wolves eating too much livestock.
“The big thing was the amount of farmers and ranchers that were dealing with significant losses because of the wolf population,” Burtenshaw said. “Originally when the wolf was reintroduced, they were talking about 150 or something in the Idaho region. And we had well over 1,500, almost 1,600, for a long time. So the depredation cost was huge to those that had livestock and other animals as well.”
“That population has kind of got out of balance, and that’s what we’re trying to figure out is where that balance is,” Burtenshaw said.

 The impact of wolf hunting in Idaho

Idaho sold more than 53,000 wolf tags to hunters in 2023 even though there are only an estimated 1,150 wolves in the state, according to documents provided by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game. 
More than half of those wolf tags were sold in the popular “sportsman’s package,” which includes a hunting/fishing combo license and tags for deer, elk, bear, wolf, mountain lion, turkey, salmon and steelhead. (State officials said they do not know the percentage of hunters who bought a wolf tag because wolves are the primary animal they are hunting vs. the percentage of hunters who primarily hunted other animal species but still bought a wolf tag.) 
From the 2019-20 wolf hunting season through the 2023-24 hunting season, hunters and trappers killed an average of more than 400 wolves a year in Idaho, according to Idaho Fish and Game.

In addition to expanding wolf hunting and trapping, Idaho also financially reimburses expenses for hunters who successfully kill a wolf.
Since 2019, the state of Idaho has paid out $849,750 in reimbursements to successful wolf hunters, according to data provided by the Idaho Fish and Game.
The money is Idaho Fish and Game funding that is transferred to the Wolf Depredation Control Board for the Foundation for Wildlife Management’s reimbursement program, Fish and Game officials said. Separately, the foundation has applied for and received Idaho Fish and Game Commission Challenge Grants.
“Our end (goal) in this originally was focused on trying to direct the harvest where we were seeing the greatest impacts – chronic livestock depredation, elk populations below objective, where predation was a factor – to try to focus that effort where harvest at that time was not sufficient to stabilize the wolf numbers,” said Idaho Fish and Game Deputy Director of Operations Jon Rachael, who was an original member of the wolf recovery team.
In the context of hunting, the word harvest means successfully killing a game animal such as a wolf. 
The reimbursement money can be used for firearms, ammo, traps, trail cameras, gear, license fees, fuel and even ATV vehicles used to scout or hunt wolves, according to the foundation.
Rusty Kramer, the president of the Idaho Trappers Association, said he has used state reimbursement money to make payments on his truck, which he uses when he is tracking and trapping wolves. 
The standard reimbursement in Idaho is capped at $750 per wolf.
But in areas where elk populations are below their objective, or livestock have been repeatedly killed by wolves, the reimbursement limit increases to $2,000 per wolf.
Some wolf supporters call the program a bounty system and scoff at the idea of the state sending checks to people who shot wolves to help pay off their trucks and ATVs.
But Idaho Fish and Game officials insist it is only a reimbursement program – not a bounty.
“Any of the funds that come from the state of Idaho, from the Wolf Depredation Control Board, or, in the past, from the Fish and Game Commission Challenge Grants did require that this money was not just a straight payment of a certain amount, but rather the individual claiming compensation present evidence of their expenses,” Rachael said. “And so in that regard, it was compensation for their investment of buying traps or fuel to run a trap line.”
 U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed it killed juvenile wolves in Idaho

When the state kills wolves, it doesn’t just kill adult wolves that are confirmed to have attacked livestock. 
The state, other government agencies like the U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services and third party contractors can kill wolf pups in their dens and their nursing mother – even if those specific wolves never attacked a cow or sheep.
“You can kill wolf puppies,” said Carter Niemeyer, a former government trapper who helped bring wolves back to Idaho and Yellowstone National Park 30 years ago and opposes killing wolf pups and many of Idaho’s wolf policies. “They’re plum legal if you kill them at a day old. Stomp their head in with your boot if you want to.”

Students at Timberline High School in Boise spoke out a few years ago after the U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services killed wolf pups from a pack that the school symbolically adopted, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
In an October 2021 letter to Suzanne Asha Stone, a prominent Idaho wolf expert and a member of the wolf reintroduction team, former U.S. Department of Agriculture Undersecretary Jenny Lester Moffitt, confirmed the government killed eight juvenile wolves in Idaho in an attempt to relocate the larger pack and reduce the number of livestock killed.
Carter, who was on the Nez Perce Tribe’s wolf reintroduction team in the 1990s, is sickened that the state would authorize the killing of wolf pups that never disturbed livestock. 
“I mean, it’s one thing to shoot an adult,” Carter said. “But to trap puppies in the den hole? It’s just so awful. And I don’t understand how people can be that hateful to one species of animal that has a right to be here. But for sure, the state has not done their due diligence.”
“I‘ll just stop there,” Carter added. “The state of Idaho is not taking care of this species.”
Since wolves were removed from the Endangered Species List in 2011, the USDA Wildlife Services and other agencies have killed 961 wolves in Idaho, according to Idaho Department of Fish and Game documents.



Since 2018, Idaho Fish and Game has spent $817,668 on lethal control actions to kill wolves in Idaho, according to documents the department provided. That total specifically refers to Idaho Fish and Game funding through the Wolf Depredation Control Board that was not spent on reimbursements made by the Foundation for Wildlife Management. 
One of Idaho’s policies is that even when nonlethal tools are available to reduce conflicts between livestock and wolves, the state can kill wolves without first trying the nonlethal tools.
“Livestock producers may use deterrents to aid in protecting their property; however, they are not a prerequisite for lethal removal,” the Idaho Gray Wolf Management Plan 2023-2028 states. “Regardless of use or success of nonlethal methods, landowners may request a special kill permit from IDFG for use on lawfully permitted public and private lands. IDFG will continue to employ lethal removal as needed to address both individual depredations and overall population goals”
 30 years after wolf reintroduction, some of the people who brought wolves back worry about their future 

Longtime wolf advocates say the government-sponsored killing of wolves and expansions in hunting and trapping is reducing the number of wolves.
Now, 30 years after the first wolves were returned to Idaho and 14 years after they came off the Endangered Species List, several prominent members of the team that brought wolves back worry about the threats wolves face today.
River of No Return: How the Nez Perce Tribe stepped in to save wolf reintroduction in Idaho

Niemeyer is a longtime government trapper who has tracked wolves across Idaho and Montana since before reintroduction in 1995. Intimately familiar with wolves, he was a member of the team that traveled to Canada 30 years ago to capture wolves to reintroduce them to Idaho and Montana.
For years after reintroduction, Carter studied the packs and knew the location of many dens in central Idaho. 
Niemeyer was so confident in his ability to find wolves that he regularly guided donors who supported conservation organizations into the wild to see wolves.  He knew the landscape well enough he could set up camp just close enough for the donors to see and howl for wolves as Niemeyer cooked cowboy-style dinners for the group.
But those days are over.
Over the last few years, Niemeyer said he and his longtime contacts are no longer seeing wolves in the wild the same places they always used to.
“When they’re in there, they see virtually little or no sign of any wolf existence in the Frank,” Niemeyer said, referring to the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness. “If you put together what I’m seeing, or better yet, what I’m not seeing…. Nobody’s finding any wolf evidence. So where are these 1,300 or 1,500 wolves?”
Niemeyer’s luck isn’t any better than his friends.
During a Howl reporting trip in July 2024, Niemeyer found wolf scat and wolf tracks, but no wolves. And during another, separate expedition in 2024, he said he struck out entirely – he didn’t even see a wolf track. 
“The Big Buck Pack, Steel Mountain Pack, Jackson Pack, Archie Pack, I can name all these packs up there, Thorn Creek – there’s no packs in those places anymore, mostly because of domestic sheep that came in there and Wildlife Services just went to hammering wolves,” Niemeyer said. “And then you’ve got the recreational hunting and trapping that started when (wolves) were delisted.”
“You’ll still find a wolf track up in that country,” Niemeyer said. “But to say there’s anything like the numbers there were, I don’t believe it. You wouldn’t convince me.”
Carter worries about new expanded wolf hunting, trapping and lethal control policies in the state of Idaho.
“The state of Idaho is going to – if they haven’t already – plunge wolves back towards extinction, at least in Idaho,” Carter said.
“How do you manage if you don’t know how many you have?” Carter added.
She isn’t alone in worrying about the state management of wolves and the removal of limits on hunting and trapping. 
“Is it a violation of our treaty?” Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee Chairman Shannon Wheeler said. “Is it a violation of something that we were meant to protect? Of course it is. Of course it’s a violation of what was here in 1855 and before then. And that’s a part of tamáalwit, or the unwritten law, which we know that Article Three and the Treaty of 1855 with the Nez Perce represents.”
Some members of the wolf reintroduction teams say attitudes are even worse today than they were 30 years ago.
“Our country’s worse now than it was in terms of polarization, so those extreme divisions have only widened and become more cemented,” said Stone, executive director of the International Wildlife Coexistence Network and a co-founder of the Wood River Wolf Project. “ Back then, if I had told anyone from the opposition that didn’t want to have wolves back that they would be trapping and killing wolves 365 days of the year, using bounties to kill even pups in the den, they would have told me I was crazy and that would never happen – never happen. And we’re living it today. That is the reality on the ground today.”

Stone isn’t alone.
“Oh, I’m pretty worried,” said Doug Smith, who headed up the wolf program at Yellowstone National Park for nearly 30 years until he retired in 2022. 
“Attitudes haven’t changed,” Smith said. “The fact is, they’re worse now. I’ve been studying wolves for over 40 years, and wolves have always been controversial. There’s always been people who like wolves and people who hate wolves. Now it’s like people are willing to do anything to get rid of wolves or anything to protect wolves, and they don’t want to talk to each other. I don’t think that’s progress, and right now the anti-wolf forces are winning in Idaho and Montana especially.”

Tony Evers Tuesday, with the full Senate and Assembly scheduled to take up the budget Wednesday. The committee also passed a  $2.5 billion plan for capital projects, which included a measure to start work on a project that will allow for the  closure of the Green Bay Correctional Institution by 2029. 
The agreement announced Tuesday morning was negotiated by Evers, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) and Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein over the last several months and will invest over $1 billion in education and child care and cut taxes by about $1.3 billion. The deal also includes funding plans for the Department of Transportation, including funding for roads, and changes to the state’s hospital assessment to help cover Medicaid costs.
The committee’s action comes a day after the end of Wisconsin’s fiscal year. Wisconsin’s government continues to run under the current budget until a new one is signed into law. 
Legislators on both sides of the aisle had similar reactions saying the deal did not contain everything they wanted with some signaling support for the bill and others saying they will vote against it.
“This budget has involved an awful lot of compromise, both between the houses as well as with the governor’s office,” Joint Finance Committee Co-chair Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) said at a press conference ahead of the meeting. “A budget is a compromise and this budget is certainly one of those.”
The committee voted 13-3 with Sen. LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee) joining Republicans in favor of approving the deal. It also voted 12-4 along party lines to approve the entire budget bill to advance it to the Senate and Assembly floor.
Capital budget includes plan to close Green Bay prison 
The over $2.5 billion capital budget plan grants funding for projects at the UW system, within the Department of Corrections, Department of Health Services, Department of Military Affairs and the Department of Natural Resources.
Over $480 million — or about 18% — of the capital projects plan is for projects at campuses across the UW system and was negotiated as part of the budget deal. 
The plan also includes $225 million for the Department of Corrections, including $15 million for construction project planning for realignment of facilities and the closure of Green Bay Correctional Institution (GBCI) by 2029. 
Marklein said lawmakers were investing across Wisconsin and the DOC plans would help to start to “right-size” the state’s corrections system. 
As the state has faced a growing prison population and aging facilities, Evers had proposed a DOC capital budget of over $630 million that included renovating Waupun Correctional Institution and making it a “vocational village” as well as several other prisons. The plan culminates in the closure of the Green Bay facility. GBCI, which was originally opened in 1898, is one of the state’s oldest facilities and houses 381 more people than its intended capacity. 
Lawmakers have been interested in closing GBCI for years, but were skeptical of Evers’ plan to make that happen.
Co-chair Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) signaled that the action in the budget is just the beginning of a years-long process.
“I think that this stuff will all be figured out over several budgets,” Born said in response to questions about the capacity of the state’s prison and Waupun. “These fiscal capital projects don’t happen in two years, and they won’t in this case, either.” 
Lawmakers who represent parts of the Green Bay area said the inclusion of the GBCI closure date in the budget is a major step forward.
“Formalizing a decommissioning date into state law will ensure decisive action is taken to solve this long-standing issue and prevent the bureaucratic delays which have plagued this situation for far too long,” Rep. Benjamin Franklin (R-De Pere) said. 
Rep. David Steffen (R-Howard) called GBCI “unsafe, unstable and unsustainable” and said he is thankful for the step forward.
Alluding to Evers’ plan, Rep. Tip McGuire (D-Kenosha), meanwhile, said there is a plan that lawmakers could have moved forward. He said the item in the budget seemed like a plan that was “kicking the can down the road.” 
The budget deal also includes $130 million for a Type 1 juvenile facility in Dane County. The planned 32-bed facility is the second one meant to replace youth prisons Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake — old facilities initially scheduled to close by 2021. The Department of Administration has estimated that with full funding ($124 million in bonding authority) the project could be completed by 2029. 
Lawmakers, advocates have mixed reaction to deal on K-12, higher education and child care 
Evers repeatedly said investing in Wisconsin’s K-12 and higher education systems as well as child care were his top priorities. Republican lawmakers said they were opposed to continuing state payments to child care facilities, supported cutting the UW budget and only supported incremental increases for the state’s public schools. The deal includes investment in each area.
Several Democratic lawmakers, nonetheless, had mixed feelings about the concessions Evers  and Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) got from the majority party. During committee, Democrats proposed investing over $500 million in the UW system, $200 million in child care grants and expanding postpartum Medicaid coverage, though Republicans rejected those ideas. 
Under the deal, the University of Wisconsin system will get a $250 million increase, according to Evers’ office. The motion approved by the committee includes investments for general program operations, mental health, staff recruitment and retention and $94 million for staff wage adjustments.
The increase comes despite threats from Republican legislators to cut the UW system by tens of millions and as federal uncertainty, which has led some campuses to tell departments to prepare cuts
Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) said lawmakers were short-changing the UW system, despite it contributing heavily to the state’s economic successes.
“What they are getting is about 5% of what they said that they needed,” Roys said. Evers and the system proposed an $855 million budget increase over the biennium. “We’re going to continue to see tuition hikes, we’re going to continue to see campus closures. We’re going to continue to see the doors of opportunity closing for our kids here in Wisconsin, and they’re going to have to go out of state or go without access to higher education and I think that’s wrong.” 
Roys voted against the budget in committee, saying it would have needed to do more for the state’s kids to get her vote. “Ultimately, I want a Wisconsin, where every child, no matter who you are or where you’re from, have the opportunity to thrive,” Roys told reporters.
Stakeholders in the UW system also reacted to the budget deal on Tuesday. 
UW President Jay Rothman said on social media he is grateful for the support of Evers and the Legislature. 
“Today’s budget agreement marks the largest overall increase in investment in the UWs over two decades. For generations, Wisconsinites have invested in the UWs to provide affordable and accessible higher education. They should take great pride in what Wisconsin has built,” Rothman said. “With these new investments, the UWs can do more to provide the educational opportunities students deserve and parents expect.”
Public Representation Organization of the Faculty Senate (PROFS), the nonprofit organization of UW-Madison faculty, said it was “heartened” by the funding increase but worried about some of the concessions that Republican lawmakers got.
“We are concerned, however, that the agreement between Republican legislative leaders and the governor includes teaching-load requirements for faculty and instructional staff, which has always been the purview of the universities themselves, not the Legislature,” the organization stated. 
Under the agreement, faculty will be required to teach no fewer than 24 credits per academic year. The UW Board of Regents will have to develop a buyout policy for positions not meeting the minimum credit requirements. The budget will also include a similar policy for the Wisconsin Technical College System. 
The UW portions of the agreement will also include a cap on the number of positions that the system can have funded through general purpose revenue and program revenue and no institution will be allowed to designate more than 10% of its faculty and 10% of its academic staff to administrative duties.
Born said it was part of the compromise that Assembly Republicans made.
“It is a positive number, and most of our caucus on the Assembly side… is not happy about that because they know that there are major problems in that system that need work,” Born said. “We worked through that compromise and gave them $50 million as opposed to $800 million… to get some of those reforms.”
Child care providers will get a $330 million investment under the deal, including direct payments to continue once the Child Care Counts program lapses. A “Bridge” program will provide $110 million to help child care facilities stay open, though it will only last for a year. It also includes funding to kickstart a state-funded child care program targeted at supporting facilities serving 4-year-olds. 
“The reality is this is a small amount of money in terms of the need, and it is only for year one, so all that’s happening here is we’re kicking the can down the road on massive child care closures a year from now… I don’t count that as a huge victory,” Roys said. “To get that money there have been agreements to functionally deregulate child care, to increase ratios, to make it less safe to take away the important protections.”
Sen. Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point), who said he plans to vote for the budget on the floor, said the investment would help make child care in the state more affordable and increase access. 
“While it’s not perfect, this is where we’re at with divided government,” Testin said “Maybe it’s not as far as some would like but it’s a step in the right direction.”
Funding for K-12 education will increase the special education reimbursement rate to  42% in the first year of the budget and 45% in the second year. Republican lawmakers initially approved a maximum increase of 37.5%, while Evers had proposed a 60% increase. 
There will be no general aid increase for public schools. School districts will only be able  to increase their school revenue annually by $325 per pupil by going to local property taxpayers through the referendum process.
Rep. Tip McGuire (D-Kenosha) said it was a “little sad” Evers “had to drag the Legislature kicking and screaming to a place that is frankly insufficient for our needs.” He said the increase to special education funding likely wouldn’t end school districts’ reliance on raising revenue through  property taxes increases.
Some Democratic lawmakers and advocates said Evers needed to negotiate higher increases for schools and said the lack of general aid increase in the deal is a reason to reject it. 
Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison) said no general aid increases for Wisconsin’s public schools is “unacceptable,” calling the budget “Republican-led” and urging people to call their Democratic legislators and Evers’ office to tell them to vote against it. 
“This budget fails to meet the needs of our children and working-class communities,” Hong wrote in all caps on social media. “This budget is guaranteed to raise property taxes and pit students and communities against one another.” 
Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) said he would vote “no” on the budget for similar reasons. 
“The final product falls far short of what our neighbors need and frankly what they have demanded since the beginning of this process,” Larson said, noting the lack of general aid, the school revenue increase that doesn’t keep up with  inflation and the special education rate. “For these reasons and many more, I will be voting ‘no,’ unless massive changes are adopted,” Larson said. “Democrats will be offering several amendments in pursuit of a budget that meets this moment.” 
The Wisconsin Public Education Network sent out a similar message, and called for people to call Senate lawmakers and urge them to vote against the budget.
“The compromise on the table provides $0 (none, not one pencil’s worth) in new state aid for public schools in both years of the biennium — in exchange for a welcome but inadequate increase to the special education reimbursement rate,” the organization said. “A vote for this budget is a vote for widening our gaps. Public schools will close. We will see another two years of record rates of referenda.”
Asked about advocates’ desire to try to negotiate for a general aid increase for schools, Evers said on Tuesday that there were some policies that just weren’t going to happen. He spoke to the Wisconsin Examiner Tuesday afternoon after attending a Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. event in Middleton to announce a business expansion at Catalent, a bio-health company.
“We have the largest amount of money that we’ve ever sent to our public schools coming to them, and so I know there are people that wanted everything, and when you’re in a situation where you have Republicans and Democrats [who make up] about same size of part of the government, you’re going to you’re going to have to compromise,” Evers said. “I do wish we could have put another $5 billion into it of course, but that wasn’t going to happen.”
Democrats say new maps led to budget deal, pledge to do more in majority
The budget needs 17 votes to pass in the Senate and will likely find it from a bipartisan group of lawmakers. Marklein said he was “confident” that there would be enough votes.
Slim margins in the Senate and  several Senate Republicans who said they were inclined to vote against the spending package, even ahead of the announcement of a deal, led to Democratic Minority Leader Hesselbein becoming involved in negotiations, which previously have only involved Republican legislators. Republicans have passed the budget before with only votes from their caucus, but in the Senate this year, the caucus can only afford to lose one vote.
Several Senate Democrats, including several who are serving their first term, said the budget deal was the result of new legislative maps that took effect for the first time in 2024. Under those maps, Democrats in the Senate flipped four seats, trimming the Republican majority from two-thirds to a margin of 18-15.
Freshman Sen. Sarah Keyeski (D-Lodi) said the state would be moving in the right direction with the budget agreement and Senate Democrats helped make it “palatable.” 
“To be clear, this budget is not ideal, but in the spirit of bipartisanship and forward progress, I am pleased to be a part of what Senate Democrats were able to do on behalf of all Wisconsinites,” Keyeski said. 
Sen. Jodi Habush Sinykin (D-Whitefish Bay) said the deal reflects “bipartisanship and progress.” 
“I am proud to see it move forward,” said Habush Sinykin, who is also in her first term. “What we are seeing playing out in this budget is the consequence of Wisconsin’s new fairer maps — legislators working together to find compromise and make meaningful progress for the people of Wisconsin.”
Two other Democrats in their first term highlighted local allocations in the budget. Sen. Jamie Wall (D-Green Bay) celebrated $30 million that was included in the budget for a new railroad bridge at Red Maple Road between American Boulevard and Lost Dauphin Road in West De Pere and Sen. Kristin Dassler-Alfheim (D-Appleton) highlighted some of the items in the budget that will help her district, including the $137 million investment for UW-Oshkosh’s Polk Learning Commons.
“The new, fair maps created a balanced government, and this is the result: a government that can work together to reach an agreement where everyone walks away wishing they’d gotten more but no one leaves feeling kicked in the teeth,” Dassler-Alfheim said. “I’m hopeful that we can work together to get this over the finish line and move Wisconsin forward, together.”
Senate Democrats also said they would do more should they win a majority in future elections. 
“Because of the negotiations that we had for this budget, the outcomes were a lot better than they would have been had those individuals not been at the table, had our voices not been at the table,” said Sen. LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee). “And I just want to say that going forward for every budget. It should be like that, and don’t worry, when we’re in the majority, it will be like that, which will be in 2026.”
She told reporters she is leaning towards voting for the budget, but added, “we’ll have to see.” 
Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) also said electing more Democratic legislators made a difference.
“I am thankful that Governor Evers and my Senate Democratic colleagues were at the negotiating table on our state budget and have gotten some real wins for the people of Wisconsin,” Neubauer said. “There are critical investments in education, child care and the priorities of Wisconsinites in this budget, but we also know that due to years of underfunding by the GOP majorities, there is a lot that remains to be done.”
Andraca praised the new maps in the committee meeting, saying that a nearly 50-50 split in the Senate and Assembly has spurred conversations in a new way.
“Congratulations on the bipartisanship. I think this budget does a lot of good,” Andraca said, but added,  “I’m not sure it does enough to earn my vote at this time.”

As of Tuesday, Wyomingites' access to some corners of the internet was restricted by a new law requiring age verification for viewing pornography. 
The post Porn industry, Supreme Court weigh in as Wyoming requires age verification on adult sites appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyomingites this week found their access to some corners of the internet curtailed as a new state law to prevent minors from accessing sexual content came into effect. 
On Tuesday, Wyoming joined a growing number of states in requiring companies that platform material “harmful to minors” — principally pornography — to verify a visitor’s age upon their landing on the website. 
Though driven by conservative lawmakers’ growing interest in shielding the eyes of the Equality State’s youth from sexual content, the new law means porn-seeking adults will be asked by compliant websites to show government identification or a photograph of their face to their computer camera. Though the law prohibits websites from retaining that data, opponents of similar measures elsewhere have questioned how enforceable that protection will be. 
At least one major platform, Pornhub, has chosen to simply block access to its website from Wyoming IP addresses. Beginning Monday, visitors to the site were greeted with a message criticizing Wyoming’s legislation and arguing it would lead to both less privacy and fewer protections for children. 
Pornhub has initiated the same measure in 19 other states that have required age verification.
Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court gave such laws the green light, ruling against the industry and finding that when balanced against the objective of protecting children, a similar measure in Texas did not violate Texans’ rights to free speech. Armed with that ruling the sponsor of Wyoming’s bill, Rep. Martha Lawley, told WyoFile she would seek to further strengthen her efforts for age verification online. 
“This decision has put to rest the one big argument that the porn industry could make,” the Worland Republican and attorney said. 
The state law that took effect Tuesday does not include criminal penalties and does not call for enforcement by the state. Instead, it gives Wyomingites a route to sue and seek hefty financial damages from companies they believe have failed to verify site visitors’ ages. Lawley didn’t pursue a more aggressive bill, she said, because she knew the issue was unsettled in the courts.

Given the Supreme Court’s ruling, Lawley now believes she can bring amendments to add criminal penalties next legislative session, she said. Such a law change would draw Wyoming law enforcement into the effort to police online pornography, instead of relying on citizens to hire an attorney and file a lawsuit.
Texas’ law found success at the Supreme Court in part because the technology for age verification has evolved to a level where it no longer marks a major intrusion on adults seeking pornography, Lawley said. And she would continue, she said, to ensure that privacy protections for that data are built into future law. 
But in an earlier step in the Texas legal battle, a federal judge concluded that the state couldn’t guarantee adult purveyors of pornography would have their privacy protected, including from the government itself. “It runs the risk that the state can monitor when an adult views sexually explicit materials and what kind of websites they visit,” Judge David Alan Ezra wrote in a September 2023 order blocking the implementation of the law. 
Ezra, appointed to the bench by Republican President Ronald Reagan, was overruled 2-1 by a federal appeals panel the next year, which allowed the law to go into effect while the case continued.
On June 27, the last day of its term, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Texas law with a 6-3 decision, with the three liberal justices dissenting. 
Though the prevailing justices agreed that requiring age verification online “burdens” adults, they found the burden doesn’t outweigh states’ interest in finding ways to enforce the same laws online that prevent minors from going to a gas station and buying nude magazines. “The power to require age verification is within a State’s authority to prevent children from accessing sexually explicit content,” Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in the majority opinion. 
But in a dissenting opinion, Justice Elena Kagan argued that Texas and states following its lead need to find a way to keep minors off pornography sites that doesn’t interfere with adults’ rights to free speech. In her opinion, she echoed Ezra’s concerns that there could be wide-ranging ramifications for people who give their personal data to porn sites in order to access them. 
“It is not … like having to flash ID to enter a club,” she wrote. “It is turning over information about yourself and your viewing habits—respecting speech many find repulsive—to a website operator, and then to . . . who knows? The operator might sell the information; the operator might be hacked or subpoenaed.”
In its message for Wyoming visitors, Pornhub offered an alternative strategy. The site’s home page carried a video from an adult film actress who, fully clothed, conveys the message that Pornhub believes requiring age verification will draw traffic to websites that are less likely to comply with the law because those behind them believe they can dodge enforcement. 
Website operators, who can be anywhere in the world, are difficult to police. Those sites that will dodge age verification laws are also less likely to moderate content and prevent the distribution of child sexual abuse material, the company argued. Instead, the actress and activist Cherie DeVille asks site visitors to “contact your representatives before it is too late and demand device-based verification solutions.” 
DeVille has run for elected office herself — alongside the rapper Coolio, she mounted a brief bid for president in the 2020 election under the slogan “Make America Fucking Awesome Again.” 
Device-based solutions, the safety technology preferred by Pornhub, which would have users register their device as in the control of someone older than 18. Parents could then ensure their children’s devices mark them as minors, and porn websites could block the devices based on their IP address. Such a system would also prevent children from accessing other age-restricted websites like gambling sites, tobacco or cannabis vendors, Pornhub argued in a blog post.
As the most visible avatar for a respectable adult content industry, Pornhub isn’t immune to criticism. Journalists and sexual exploitation victims have documented the presence of abusive videos, including those of minors, sexual assault, rape and other violence, on its site throughout the years. Company officials say they have reacted to such reports by tightening their content moderation procedures.

During a legislative session rife with divisive social issues, Lawley’s bill largely flew under the radar. Only one House member, Laramie Democrat Karlee Provenza, opposed it on its final vote. 
“Unfortunately, there was little appetite from members of the Legislature to consider the potential problems with this legislation,” Provenza wrote in a statement to WyoFile. “We live in a world where countless people fall victim to online scams that cost them tens of thousands of dollars every day, and the government just made it easier for people to ask for IDs for no legitimate purpose so they can steal identities. We put our constituents at risk and solved nothing.” 
In the Senate, it received three no votes, including the Senate’s two Democrats — Chris Rothfuss, also of Laramie, and Mike Gierau of Jackson. A no vote from Sen. Cale Case, a long-serving Lander Republican who leans Libertarian, made the limited opposition bipartisan. 
It remains to be seen if the bill’s implementation will draw out new opposition — whether from an unlikely to-be-outspoken constituency of Wyoming porn aficionados, or from those concerned about broader free speech ramifications. In addition to Lawley’s promise to revisit the statute in light of the Supreme Court’s decision, conservative Wyoming lawmakers are focused on regulating minors’ possible exposure to sexually explicit material in another arena: public libraries. 
Though the justices didn’t touch on libraries in their ruling, Lawley said she believed their decision could play into that debate as well. “It gives those of us who deal with policy some understanding into where the laws are in regards to free speech and obscenity and protection of children,” she said.

Just because Sen. Lee’s misguided amendment went down in flames is no reason to think that threats to public land are no more, writes columnist Rod Miller.
The post Wars on the West appeared first on WyoFile .","Unless you’ve been hiding under a rock for the past couple of weeks, you know that U.S. Sen. Mike Lee withdrew his push to sell off public lands via an amendment to Trump’s budget bill. Faced with widespread and intense opposition from just about everyone west of the 100th meridian, the Utah Republican blinked.

Opinion

For more than a century, our million square mile public domain has been the battleground for more than one “War on the West.” Just because Lee’s misguided amendment went down in flames is no reason to think that these wars are over. If you believe that the good guys finally won, I have a surfside cabana on some beachfront property near Wamsutter that I’d like to sell you.
Public land has been a political fulcrum since long before Lee. Back in the ‘90s, President Bill Clinton and his Interior Secretary, Bruce Babbitt, were accused of waging a “War on the West” for a different reason.
The Clinton administration’s decidedly pro-environment policies rubbed enough Westerners the wrong way to cause a political backlash. Gov. Mike Sullivan, a man whom I admire and respect deeply, lost his ’94 run for the U.S. Senate when his opponent tarred him with the Clinton/Babbitt “War on the West” brush.
The Trump administration’s policy of merchandising the public domain is every bit as threatening to our Western way of life as Clinton’s hands-off preservation policy. If knuckle-headed politicians get their way, “no trespassing” signs will warn us off of land that belongs to all of us.
That prospect pisses us off as citizens and custodians of public land in Wyoming. And, when we get pissed off, we tend to express our anger in the voting booth. We may not vote our opinions on any other issue, but when it comes to public land, we can and do make politicians feel the heat.
Threats to our public land heritage unify us in our rage as Westerners. We galvanize against them.
I am reminded of another “War on the West,” the Johnson County War of the late 1890s. In that boondoggle, the political power structure in Wyoming colluded among themselves to enlist gunslingers from Texas to invade Wyoming to drive out homesteaders and small ranchers, in order for the moneyed elite to have our range all to themselves.
The grassroots folk of Wyoming banded together to resist and drove off the invaders. Nate Champion — anyone in Wyoming should recognize that name — gave his life to protect our public land, and in the next election, the political enablers of the invasion were swept from office. The new governor was John Osborne, the man who skinned Big Nose George and campaigned wearing shoes cobbled from his hide. But that’s a topic for another column.
Suffice it to say that the Big Empty is littered with the political corpses of fools who try to take our public land from us, or fence us out of it.
Our current congressional delegation — Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis, and Rep. Harriet Hageman — would do well to remember this Wyoming history. None of them stood with their constituents while the common folks of Wyoming pushed back against Trump’s new war on our Wyoming values.
I’ve often said that the word “neighbor” is a verb in Wyoming. We might argue and fuss with our neighbor over a fenceline, an irrigation ditch or a stray bull, but when Wyomingites are faced with an outside threat, we neighbor together and fight it.
Our delegation didn’t neighbor with us on this one.
Even though the next election is more than a year away, we should not forget our delegation’s timidity when we were attacked. This Sagebrush Rebellion bullshit is far from over and, like a case of herpes, it’ll be back. We need elected officials who will stand shoulder to shoulder with us to resist it again.
We should demand that our elected officials, from the top down and regardless of party, fight any takeover of our public land. We should make that a core issue of the next election. And the next. And the one after that.
Even if a candidate is running for dogcatcher in Hyattville, we should grill them about their stance on public land, and insist that they side with us. We should know that they share our values before we honor them with our votes. Protecting our public land heritage needs to become the ON/OFF switch for political success in Wyoming. We need to count on our politicians to neighbor with us.
I, for one, want to know who is in the foxhole with me when anyone wages a War on the West.

Instead of cutting tax incentives, Congress should double down on investing in communities that have long powered America, Sophie Rockefeller contends.
The post Key provisions poised to accelerate Wyoming’s energy leadership appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming is a national leader in energy production and innovation. There is an energy transformation underway, and demand is exploding. With Wyoming’s energy workforce, infrastructure and manufacturing bona fides, few states are as poised to seize this opportunity. 

Opinion

In order to achieve these all-of-the-above ambitions, there is a key role for federal incentives to get industries like critical minerals, energy production and carbon management off the ground. Leaders in Washington, D.C. are instrumental in determining the likelihood of success. 
Financial certainty enables businesses to invest in new projects and facilities, expand operations, and hire and train workers. Tax credits are not about picking winners and losers — they are about building economic momentum in Wyoming and making sure our communities are not left behind in the changing energy landscape.
Data from Utah State University and Atlas Public Policy estimate that, catalyzed by tax credits, Wyoming has already seen more than $894 million committed to manufacturing and mining. Further, the Rhodium Group and MIT show that 1,050 operational and construction jobs have been created in Wyoming as a result of energy and manufacturing investments since the second half of 2022.
Industry leaders see the writing on the wall. Rusty Bell, CEO of Energy Capital Economic Development in Campbell County, said in his community, “there’s so much happening in energy leadership and many of these energy credits play a key role in getting those projects off the ground.”
In conversations last week with Wyoming business leaders, the Jackson Hole Center for Global Affairs asked which tax incentives are most important to their operations. Those that stood out were 45Q (carbon capture), 45Z (clean fuels), 45X (advanced manufacturing) and the Energy Community Tax Credit. 45Y (Clean Electricity Production) and 48E (Clean Electricity Investment) were also noted, in part because they qualify for the Energy Community Tax Credit Bonus, a 10% adder for projects built in energy communities like those in Wyoming. 
On Tuesday, the Senate passed its version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and sent it back to the House for the final vote before it goes to the president’s desk. The Senate-passed version restores the original inflation indexing for 45Q and retains 45X (with a phase-out beginning in 2031 for critical minerals and terminated eligibility for wind components after 2027). It modifies Sections 45Y and 48E by eliminating wind and solar projects’ eligibility after 2027 and introducing severe foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions.
The current version of the bill means that the Energy Community Tax Credit, which can be applied to 45Y and 48E but not other key credits, now sits on the chopping block. Rapid phase-outs and reduced credit values threaten developers’ ability to take advantage of this bonus over the long term.
As a leading energy community, Wyoming stands to benefit perhaps more than any other state from the Energy Community Tax Credit. Rather than phasing out the credit, expanding it to align with the existing provisions that look to benefit Wyoming’s energy industries would double down on the energy leadership boom that is already underway. 
Robby Rockey, president and co-CEO of Frontier Infrastructure, supports expanding the 10% adder to drive investment in coal communities.
“It’s a bridge that connects Wyoming’s energy heritage with its innovation future,” Rockey explains. “If it were combined with credits like 45Q, 45X, and 45Z, the ECTC would have a multiplier effect that wouldn’t just attract capital, but also ensure that investment flows directly into the communities that have powered America for generations. With the ECTC, we are guaranteeing that Wyoming’s energy communities are the foundation for our next chapter in critical minerals, carbon management, and advanced manufacturing.”
These key tax provisions strengthen businesses’ ability to invest in infrastructure and supply chain capacity. They are crucial to the energy momentum already underway in Wyoming.
Now is the moment to double down on Wyoming’s energy advantage. By preserving these incentives and expanding the energy community bonus, Congress can secure a future where Wyoming leads the nation — not just in energy production, but in innovation, job creation and economic resilience.

Advocates have mixed opinions about child care provisions in the new state budget released Tuesday. (Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)The proposed Wisconsin state budget announced Tuesday offers child care advocates less than what they sought, and while some reacted with limited optimism, for others it adds up to little better than nothing.
The final deal will spend $110 million to extend direct payments to providers for another year. Starting in mid-2026 It will direct $65 million to providers who join a proposed “School Readiness Program” — similar to 4-year-old kindergarten (4K) but distinct from current 4K programs.
The deal also will add $123 million to increase the reimbursement for child care costs for low-income families under the Wisconsin Shares program. 
The agreement was reached Monday in negotiations involving Gov. Tony Evers, Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg), Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) and Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton).
Kids Forward labeled the child care provisions “significant, but not sufficient, wins for Wisconsin’s working families.” Kids Forward is a policy and advocacy organization for low-income families and families of color.
“This deal doesn’t address the long-term needs of families and providers, but we look forward to working with legislators and the Governor to ensure sustained investment,” said Daithi Wolfe, senior policy analyst for Kids Forward, in a statement Tuesday.
‘Bridge’ payment program
The $110 million in direct payments to providers over the next 12 months will serve as a “bridge” after the end of Child Care Counts, the subsidy program funded with federal pandemic relief money that runs out this month.
Originally paying out $20 million a month, Child Care Counts helped stabilize the child care sector according to research reviewing the program, helping providers increase wages without having to charge parents more.
The money was cut in half two years ago, and since then providers have reported having to raise fees and, in some cases, reduce their capacity because they lacked enough child care workers. A survey report earlier this year found that 25% of providers said they might close if state payments stop.
The new payment program is intended to enable providers to plan and budget between now and July 2026 for the loss of Child Care Counts. It will be funded with interest income on the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds the Evers administration received starting in early 2021.
“The disappointing part is it’s not permanent,” said Ruth Schmidt, executive director of the Wisconsin Early Childhood Association (WECA). WECA has campaigned all year for Gov. Tony Evers’ original proposal, which sought $480 million including for continuing monthly provider subsidies.
“This is not going to be the sort of panacea for child care,” Schmidt said. “We will still see child care programs needing to raise rates. We will likely still see closures throughout the year. But I think we will see them at much lower rates, and I think that’s a really good thing for child care.”
Schmidt praised Evers as a “champion for children” and also credited GOP leaders for being “willing to sit down” and negotiate. “I think bipartisanship has been at play in this,” she said.
A 4K-style program
The new Early School Readiness Program for 4-year-olds is a response to the impact that 4K expansion has had on child care providers. As 4K programs expanded in Wisconsin elementary schools, “that pulled a lot of 4-year-olds out of child care,” Schmidt said.
The new School Readiness Program will set curriculum standards and require child care workers who teach in it to have at least an associate degree. Schmidt said that for child care providers who participate, it will “ensure that child care has more opportunities to continue to serve 4-year-olds.”
Child care providers who take part will for the first time receive direct payments from state funds.
“Child care as an industry has long been very interested in finding out how to continue to do the services that they know are so important for 4-year-olds in their programs, and I think this is a mechanism that will allow for that,” Schmidt said.  “This is a net gain of $65 million in state general purpose revenue into child care. That’s a big thing.”
Providers view deal skeptically 
For some child care providers, however, the details of the budget deal fall short of what they contend their sector needs.
The $110 million bridge program “is less than we’re getting right now, and we can’t keep teachers and we can’t keep prices down the way it is,” said Corrine Hendrickson, a New Glarus child care provider. She doesn’t expect it to achieve its stated goal of increasing the number of teachers along with accessibility and affordability in child care.
Brooke Legler, another New Glarus provider, said the $480 million that Evers had originally sought translated to keeping child care workers’ wages at $13 an hour on average. “This doesn’t even do that,” she said of the bridge program.
Hendrickson and Legler are cofounders of Wisconsin Early Childhood Action Needed (WECAN), a coalition of parents and providers that also campaigned actively for the original Evers proposal.
Hendrickson said she’s concerned that the School Readiness Program will be perceived by parents as “less academic, less school, less quality than the free option at the public school.”
Legler questions whether the new program as structured will succeed in drawing more families of 4-year-olds who would otherwise send their children to 4K. School districts have expanded their 4K programs to all day schedules in part because of a lack of child care, she said.
“I think that’s such a disservice that we have … closed door negotiations and that we’re not including the people at the table that need to be at the table, especially if we want to have effective and efficient policies that work for Wisconsin,” Legler said.
Both Legler and Hendrickson said they’re also concerned about a provision creating a “large family center” category with up to 12 children. Currently there are family centers with up to eight children and group centers with nine or more children.
Another provision would lower the minimum age for entry-level child care workers to 16. Both the age change and the large family provision were in bills that Republicans introduced in the 2023-24 legislative session and that providers mostly opposed.
“That’s not an answer. That doesn’t do anything financially” to help providers, Legler said.
“We have people making life-altering decisions for many people in Wisconsin, yet they have no experience or expertise on the matter,” she said. “This method does not work.”

(Photo: Ray Di Pietro)State attorneys are seeking to dismiss a lawsuit over Tennessee’s near-total abortion ban after a new law adding limited exceptions for medical emergencies went into effect earlier this year.
Jenna Adamson, assistant solicitor general in Tennessee’s Office of the Attorney General, told a three-judge panel Tuesday that the new law “made significant changes” to Tennessee’s abortion ban and “makes this a different case.” She argued the lawsuit is now moot.
But attorneys with the Center for Reproductive Rights countered the new legislation, effective April 29, is written in vague and ambiguous language that still leaves doctors uncertain if they are following or breaking the law when providing an emergency abortion. Doctors found to have violated Tennessee’s abortion law face the revocation of their licenses and lengthy prison sentences.
“This really leaves us in no different place than we were before,” said Nicolas Kabat, a staff attorney with the Center for Reproductive Rights. 
The fear Tennessee physicians have that they will be prosecuted for providing life-saving abortions, and the fear patients have that they will be denied them “have not changed one bit,” as a result of the new law, Kabat said.
Judges temporarily block discipline of doctors who perform emergency abortions in Tennessee

The lawsuit, originally filed in 2023, represents seven Tennessee women denied emergency abortions and two physicians who say they fear criminal prosecution for providing lifesaving care. The American Medical Association joined the challenge in March. 
Tennessee’s abortion ban went into effect in 2022. 
A year later, lawmakers amended the legislation to include a “medical condition exception.”  
The 2023 exception says a doctor may perform an abortion “using reasonable medical judgement, based upon the facts known to the physician at the time” if the abortion is necessary to prevent a pregnant woman’s death or to “prevent serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.”  The legislation also added molar and ectopic pregnancies as exceptions to the state’s abortion ban.  It was this 2023 legislation the lawsuit initially challenged as overly vague.
In 2024, the three-judge panel presiding over the case temporarily blocked the state’s medical board from disciplining doctors for providing emergency abortions. 
Their ruling also outlined four specific pregnancy-related conditions that qualify as “medical necessity” exceptions to the state’s abortion ban, noting the “confusion and lack of consensus within the Tennessee medical community on the circumstances requiring necessary health- and life-saving abortion care.” 
Three judge panel hears arguments over ‘unconstitutionally vague’ exceptions to abortion ban

That temporary injunction remains in place. 
This year  lawmakers further amended the state’s abortion ban to say doctors “may” provide an abortion for certain conditions that mirror those outlined in the panel’s temporary injunction. 
Those exceptions include:  previable preterm premature rupture of membranes (the rupture of the amniotic sac before a fetus is viable); inevitable abortion; severe preeclampsia; mirror syndrome associated with fetal hydrops (a life threatening build up of fluid); and an infection that can result in uterine rupture or loss of fertility. The 2025 legislation also specifically says mental health diagnoses may not be used as an exception to the state’s abortion ban.
The three-judge panel hearing arguments Tuesday were Chancellor Patricia Head Moskal, Judge Sandra Donaghy and Chancellor Kasey Cullbreath gave no timeline on when they will issue a decision about whether the case will move forward or be dismissed. 
Moskal said they would “issue our ruling as soon as we are able to do so.”

But t[...]","Getty ImagesAt a ceremony to commemorate “Michigan Reunification Day,” Michigan Supreme Court Chief Justice Megan Cavanagh said:
Through coordination between courts and child welfare professionals, parents who are struggling and need support in order to reunify with their children are given opportunities in family courts to be met with opportunity, not punishment.
But the data tell a different story:

In Michigan, if you are torn from the arms of your parents and consigned to the chaos of foster care, the odds are nearly two in three that you are never going home – unless you manage to find your parents again once you are an adult. Michigan reunifies only 35% of the children it takes. Only four states are worse.
Michigan is so hostile to families that more children are adopted, usually by total strangers, than return to their own homes – only three other states share that distinction.
Michigan is so hostile to reunification that it would rather let children age out of foster care with no home at all at a rate nearly double the national average than make the effort to reunify more families.
Some states with dismal reunification rates say they make up for it by placing more children in guardianships with extended families.  Michigan can’t even make that claim. In Michigan, children exit to guardianship or some other living arrangement with a relative at a rate less than half the national average.

Of course, some might find this cause for celebration; after all, when we hear about child abuse we usually hear about horror stories. But such cases represent a tiny fraction of what caseworkers see.
In Michigan, 73% of the time, when children are forced into foster care, there is not even an allegation of sexual abuse or any form of physical abuse. In 58% of cases, there is not even an allegation of drug or alcohol abuse.
In contrast, 40% of cases involve housing or homelessness. In Michigan, far more children are taken away because of housing issues than for physical or sexual abuse combined.
The problem with all this is not that it hurts parents, though of course it does, the problem is that it hurts children.
Think back to when children were torn from their mothers’ arms at the Mexican border during the first Trump administration; listen again to their cries. Though Michigan caseworkers almost always mean well, when children are taken in Michigan, they cry out the same way for the same reason. So it’s no wonder study after study finds that in the typical cases, not the horror stories, children left in their own homes typically fare better even than comparably-maltreated children placed in foster care.
But the harm doesn’t stop there. Multiple studies find abuse in one-quarter to one-third of family foster homes, and the rate of abuse in group homes and institutions is even worse. Many children pass through more than one foster home. So that child taken because of housing problems faces frightening odds of being abused in foster care itself.
The fact that in Michigan, foster care is a point of no return for so many children should come as no surprise. It reflects decades of failure. For example: Federal law requires states to make “reasonable efforts” to keep families together. If a judge doesn’t certify this was done, the state’s expenses on the case are ineligible for federal reimbursement. But a 2005 study found that 40 percent of Michigan judges admitted they lied and said “reasonable efforts” were made in cases where the judges really didn’t believe it.
Instead of courtroom theatrics, the state Department of Health and Human Services and the courts need to finally get serious about stopping needless removal and ensuring swift, safe  reunification when removal is genuinely the only option. It’s not that hard and it’s not that expensive.  Multiple studies demonstrate that even small amounts of cash assistance can dramatically reduce what agencies like DHHS call “neglect.”
In addition, every family needs high-quality legal representation from the moment they come under any form of scrutiny from DHHS. No, that’s not to get “bad parents” off. It’s to protect children from being forced needlessly into foster care by finding alternatives to cookie-cutter “service plans” often churned out by DHHS. This approach is proven to safely reduce needless foster care. In many cases, the federal government will pay half the cost, and savings from reduced foster care are likely to cover the rest. There are several such programs in Michigan, but it needs to be available statewide. At a minimum, Michigan needs to enact a key recommendation of the Child Protection Legal Representation Task Force to create an office to set minimum standards for such representation.
Because while DHHS and the courts proclaim a single Michigan Reunification Day, the truth is, in Michigan, every day is family destruction day.

The episode is the latest sign of turmoil in public defense since Gov. Jeff Landry and legislators reworked state laws to give Landry more control over its attorneys and finances. 

State Public Defender Rémy Starns, a Landry appointee, hired new local chief public defenders to take over from five he is seeking to oust this week. By doing so, he sidestepped Louisiana’s Public Defender Oversight Board that is expected to weigh in on whether to stop the terminations next week. 
The public defender board has already attempted to convene twice in the last two weeks to vote on whether to block Starns from dismissing the attorneys. The board hasn’t been able to gather enough members to legally hold a meeting and vote, in large part because six of nine board members have resigned since the end of May. Two board spots still remain vacant. 
“Obviously the four of us who are here would like to get this matter concluded. Unfortunately, we don’t have that authority without having a quorum,” said retired Judge Paul deMahy, one of the governor’s appointees to the board, after a failed attempt to meet and vote Monday. 
Starns did not return phone calls and texts about this story sent to his cell phone Monday and Tuesday. 

He and the board have been in an escalating battle over how much control Starns has over the local chiefs ever since Landry’s public defender overhaul laws went into effect last year.

Louisiana’s sprawling public defense network includes 850 attorneys who represent 146,000 people annually, accounting for approximately 88% of all criminal defendants in the state. They are supervised by 36 chief public defenders who are, in turn, overseen by Starns. 
Starns has been the state public defender since 2020, when former Gov. John Bel Edwards recommended him for the job. He was the rare state appointee who was kept in his position when Landry came into office.  

He helped the new Republican governor push through law changes that dissolved the former public defender board and created a new, weaker board over which Landry has more influence. The board also has less authority over Starns in its reworked form.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE

In March, a few months after the public defender law changes took effect, Starns announced he would not renew the contracts of five chiefs. They had all testified in opposition to Starns’ policies during hearings with the board and state lawmakers. 

The chief public defenders who have been targeted are Michelle AndrePont in Caddo Parish, Brett Brunson in Natchitoches Parish, Deirdre Fuller in Rapides Parish, Trisha Ward in Evangeline Parish and John Hogue who works in Madison, Tensas and East Carroll parishes. 
Their annual contracts expired Monday. Starns sent notice of their replacements to them Monday afternoon after 3 p.m., less than 24 hours before the new attorneys were expected to take over the ousted chiefs’ responsibilities. 

Three of the five ousted lawyers said they did not have a chance to talk to the interim chiefs who were taking over the offices before they started work Tuesday. 

“I think it’s unfortunate that we have this chaos, unnecessary chaos, created by the state public defender’s actions,” Hogue said in an interview Monday night. 
Pamela Grady, who works as the attorney for the city of Tallulah, took over for Hogue as the interim public defender director in a large swath of rural northeast Louisiana. She could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
Brunson, another ousted chief, said the public defender office for Natchitoches Parish has been leased personally by him and doubled as a private law office for several years. He wasn’t clear where the local public defender’s office space would be starting Tuesday or where the office’s old files should be sent since he was being displaced. 

“I’m going to go to my office tomorrow and wait for [the interim chief public defender] to show up,” Brunson said Monday night. 

James Calhoun, who contracts as a private attorney with the Winn Parish public defender’s office, was tapped to take over for Brunson. He could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 

Chad Guillot, who is the chief public defender in Avoyelles Parish, will be doubling up and also running the Rapides Parish office as the interim chief instead of Fuller. He isn’t interested in the permanent Rapides job because he intends to run for district attorney in Avoyelles Parish in 2026. 

“I know it is only going to be until they find a permanent chief,” Guillot said Tuesday. “That can take some time. I’ll serve until they find someone permanent — in one month or six months.” 

Guillot and Fuller planned to meet Tuesday afternoon to discuss the transition. He could not meet Tuesday morning because he had to be in court in Avoyelles, he said. 

In Caddo, AndrePont’s longtime deputy, Mary Harried, is serving as the interim chief. Harried has nearly three decades of public defender experience and said the transition was going smoothly Tuesday afternoon but she does not intend to take the job permanently. 

“I have a great deal of respect for Michelle [AndrePont]. We have been friends and colleagues for 27 years,” she said. “I love her. If she comes back, we’re good.” 
Christopher Ludeau took over for Ward in Evangeline Parish, where he contracts as a private attorney with the public defender office. Ward declined to comment and Ludeau could not be reached at his private law office Tuesday.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX 
Controversial compensation
In addition to the five dismissals, Starns has issued controversial contracts to the rest of the chiefs who he is keeping. The agreements allow him to fire them at any time for any reason, and give him total control over their pay. 

A state law passed as part of Landry’s public defender overhaul in 2024 dictates that the public defender board sets the compensation level of chief public defenders, but Starns has included a provision in the chiefs’ individual contracts requiring them to waive the right to the board’s payscale. 
Starns has tried to get the board to approve his preferred pay plan for the chiefs three times in the last year, but the board has rejected his proposal, primarily because it would cut some chief public defenders’ pay by tens of thousands of dollars. Instead, they adopted a different compensation scale that has been used since 2023.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/gavel-scales-justice-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-02 07:05:30.500466

  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
This might lead to the nonprofit regaining the ability to send used books to incarcerated people in DOC facilities around the state. Meanwhile, WBTP says it has experienced an issue with packages of new books, which were not banned, being sent back. 
Last year, the department enacted a used book ban. The DOC has cited concerns about drug smuggling, leading to scrutiny of how effective the ban might be and whether the impact on prisoners’ access to books was justified. Camy Matthay of Wisconsin Books to Prisoners told the Examiner in September that the ban hobbles the project. 
The agency said in late September that it used to make an exception for WBTP to send used books “due to the organization being based in Wisconsin with leadership who were responsive and willing to work with DOC.” Wardens and librarians could accept used books from certain trusted sources for donation to the institution libraries. 
In late September, the DOC said that under a  policy announced  in January, the department could no longer accept used books from anyone — including WBTP. The department said  “that policy is now being enforced when it comes to library donations as well as books sent to persons in our care.”
In March, the Examiner reported on concerns regarding mail between incarcerated people and attorneys, including the question of the accuracy of the drug tests used on materials coming into prisons.
According to incident reports and a statement from the DOC in late September, three separate shipments in February and March 2024 that were allegedly from Wisconsin Books to Prisoners had multiple items testing positive for drugs.  
In an email to Wisconsin Books to Prisoners in August, Sarah Cooper, former administrator of the DOC’s division of adult institutions, said the concern was not with WBTP but with people who would impersonate the nonprofit. 
“Unfortunately, those who wish to send drugs into the prisons do so under the guise of legitimate agencies, organizations and even legal entities,” Cooper said. 
WBTP said the group expects to be formally approved to resume shipping new and used donated books to people incarcerated throughout Wisconsin upon the successful completion of the second phase of the pilot. 
“We are cautiously optimistic that WBTP will be back or close to our full operations by September 2025,” the nonprofit said in a statement Friday. 
WBTP said it has participated in a pilot program at Oakhill Correctional Institution over the past few months. The nonprofit said that during phase one, it sent three packages of books, one third of which were used books. The books were added to the library collection, making them available for checkout by those who requested them. 
The pilot program aims to allow DOC to test and refine its screening process for donated reading materials to ensure safety, DOC communications director Beth Hardtke said in an email to the Examiner.
Starting July 1, WBTP will be able to send requested materials directly to individuals at Oakhill Correctional Institution instead of the institution library, Hardtke said. 
“The goal is to eventually allow WBTP to send reading materials to individuals at any DOC facility — safely,” Hardtke said. She mentioned a safety concern about people coming into contact with intoxicating substances. 
In a statement in late September, the department said staff reviewed contraband incident reports that facility staff had flagged as drug-related between Jan. 1 2019 and Sept. 19, 2024. 
The DOC said that not all incident reports flagged as drug-related turn out to be drug-related, and that “some drug-related incidents recorded through a medical record or conduct report may not be reflected in these numbers.” 
The department said there had been 214 incidents of drugs being found on paper from Jan. 1 2019 to Sept. 18, 2024  “including in books and letters shipped to DOC facilities.”
WBTP said it was told by DOC that it would continue mailing brand-new books to meet requests made by readers. Many of those packages have been returned to them, WBTP said. The status of some packages is not known, and the nonprofit is investigating the issue. In its statement, WBTP said it has “engaged in discussions” with DOC administrative staff, “in opposition to their policy banning the donation of used reading materials.”
“WBTP remains committed to pursuing every possible avenue to challenge this censorship,” the nonprofit said.

Thousands of Arkansas educators will open their mailboxes this summer to find checks of $1,500 to $10,000 as a reward for high student performance and improved outcomes during the 2024-25 school year.
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and the Arkansas Department of Education announced last week that 4,200 educators qualified for bonuses under the Learns Merit Teacher Incentive Fund Program, which launched in 2023 as part of a major education reform bill. Roughly 3,000 educators received checks during the program’s first year.

“It’s neat to see how surprised [teachers] are, because they think that everybody’s working just as hard as they are, and that all the students are learning as much as their students,” said Jacob Oliva, Arkansas’ secretary of education. “It’s a special moment to really celebrate some of the best of the best.”
This year’s $14 million in bonus pay from the state is meant to incentivize, recruit and retain high-performing educators while reducing staff shortages, according to the department. But the state’s largest teachers union says too many educators are left out of the running for the annual salary boost.
To be eligible, educators have to meet a complex list of requirements, including having three years of experience and either spending 70% of their time in the classroom or working as a librarian or school counselor.
Classroom teachers have to demonstrate growth in their students’ state test results and be ranked as effective or higher in the Arkansas Teacher Excellence and Support System, based on district evaluations of factors like quality of instruction, classroom environment and student engagement.
Educators who don’t have student state assessment data — such as those specializing in subjects not tested, like fine arts — have to be rated highly effective.
Finally, qualifying teachers must rank in the top 25% of student growth scores, based on a three-year average of English language arts, math or science state tests; teach in a critical shortage area; or mentor college students to become teachers.
Bonus amounts depend on which criteria educators meet. A teacher can receive $9,000 for ranking in the top 1% in student growth, while a counselor could receive $1,500 for working in a geographic shortage area. Bonuses can reach $10,000.
But April Reisma, president of the Arkansas Education Association, said many high-performing teachers are left out.
“I’m a special education teacher. One time in my life I’ve had a student that hit ‘exceeding’ on that test,” she said. “I’ve been a great teacher, and I’ve consistently got [highly effective] on my test evaluations, but I may or may not get that bonus, depending on whether or not my kids had a great day. It’s all based on a test at the end of the year for that growth. The results of one test are not an accurate indicator of how a student is performing.”

The legislation that created the merit pay program also eliminated bonuses for national board certified teachers, a recognition that educators can receive after meeting rigorous standards. Reisma said certified teachers used to receive annual bonuses of $10,000, but those dwindled to $2,500 by the end of last year.
Lawmakers and state officials have said the bonus program’s many qualifications were intended to reward, retain and recruit educators who have a significant impact, such as producing outstanding student growth, teaching in short-staffed schools and mentoring future teachers.
“The program is designed to target those specific things, and from my perspective, has done a good job of providing significant additional compensation in those areas, and is likely to improve recruitment and retention across all three of those areas,” said Josh McGee, a professor with the University of Arkansas Office for Education Policy. The university is partnering with the state to implement the program.
The effectiveness of performance-based pay has varied over the years, with earlier programs lacking in impact and more recent attempts producing positive results.
While Arkansas’ program is state-funded, the federal government has awarded merit pay grants to school districts for nearly two decades. Texas, South Carolina, Tennessee and Washington, D.C., have implemented performance pay programs over the years with mixed results.
Federal funding for teacher incentives was eliminated this spring with the Trump administration’s efforts to scrap diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.
The university will conduct research on the Arkansas program’s effectiveness in the coming years. McGee said an initial analysis will most likely take place in the fall, but an overall study won’t happen for a few years.

Today is a day to mourn. Two firefighters responding to a brush fire at Coeur d’Alene’s Canfield Mountain were shot dead and a third badly injured. Their names and photos were released:

As the horror unfolded, we learned that the alleged shooter started the fire to draw in the unsuspecting responders and later died of a self-inflicted wound. More troubling is the news that the suspected perpetrator was a 20-year-old male. His name was Wess Roley.
We may never know the motives of this individual, but what we do know is that a very young person at the beginning of his life was consumed by rage and went down a dark path. And once again, we’re pressed with the hard question: Why?
  This is a screenshot of a picture from Wess Roley’s Instagram account, which is no longer up. Photo courtesy of the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office)
Within the forests of the Pacific Northwest lurks a generous share of far-right extremists and white nationalists, and North Idaho has drawn the spotlight too many times. Given this history, national media immediately jumped to portray the incident as potential terrorism or perhaps another saga of North Idaho lawlessness and white supremacy.
But while extremist voices in the Inland Northwest are spinning this event in ways that are politically-motivated, focus should remain on the perilous journey of this alleged suspect’s youth and others like him.
Before a 20-year-old man lights a fire to execute firefighters, there is a younger boy who was drawn into this violent trajectory. Is it mental illness, family dynamics, bullying or something else?
What we do know is that many young people today feel hopeless, neglected and unloved. When young people are lonely and isolated, they become vulnerable to unhealthy alliances in the form of a substitute “family” that offers a connection they have not found elsewhere. Once absorbed into a group that uses hate and violence to secure loyalty, a young person is more likely to become part of yesterday’s headlines.
We must be mindful that the sheltered years of the COVID epidemic transformed the lives of young people in unprecedented ways. They were deprived of social time with friends and normal “rights-of-passage,” such as graduation ceremonies and public acknowledgement.
Some young adults say they feel disenfranchised, the critical pieces of their growing up years forever lost. Adding to the mix was a slow economic recovery and shifting employment options that created anxieties older adults never had to bear.
Social media, while exposing youth to vast amounts of information, can feed isolation and create echo chambers where bullying takes root and fragile self esteem can be toppled with a photo.
 Our youth are struggling

We need to recognize that our youth are struggling. A key piece of solving this problem lies not in seeking justice after incidents have happened, but in prevention through belonging. According to a 2021 study from the Center for the Study of Social Policy, a strong sense of belonging and connectedness is among the most effective protective factors against youth violence and radicalization.
Donations now accepted for victims in North Idaho firefighter shooting ambush

The U.S. Surgeon General has similarly identified the “epidemic of loneliness” as a critical driver of mental health crises and community harm. In short: When young people feel like they belong, they are less likely to cause harm — to themselves or our communities. 
Idaho for ALL, a coalition of citizens working to push back on hate and violence, is a proud partner of the Idaho Healthy Communities Challenge, a statewide initiative in collaboration with Boise State University and the Wassmuth Center for Human Rights.
This project aims to prevent youth and young adult violence by addressing root causes, like social isolation, lack of purpose and community disconnection, before the harm is unleashed. This is accomplished by listening to young people, building spaces where they can thrive and supporting the adults who care for them.
As we gather for Fourth of July barbecues and fireworks, let’s pay attention to our young people. Be aware of isolated individuals. Talk to them. Ask questions. Show interest. Give them space to talk about this tragedy. Invite them into conversations that matter. Let them know they don’t have to have it all figured out to be loved, accepted and valued. These small moments of presence can be life changing.
When young people feel genuinely seen and supported, they are more likely to ask for help, to take healthy risks and to reject harmful paths. Belonging isn’t created through one conversation. It’s built through a culture of care, consistency and inclusion. Each of us has the power to contribute to that culture, starting now, right where we are.

(Photo by Andy Sacks/Getty Images)A Pennsylvania-based prison healthcare company is suing the state claiming Tennessee officials refused to award it a contract without explanation, a move that risks “destroying” the state’s competitive bidding process.
Wexford Health Sources filed the lawsuit in Davidson County Chancery Court in May, saying the state declined to give it a contract valued at roughly $100 million for health care and behavioral health services in Tennessee prisons even though it scored higher than two other companies in the bidding process. 
The lawsuit targets the Department of Correction, Commissioner Frank Strada, the state’s Central Procurement Office and its director, Mike Perry.
Wexford says in the filing the state was prepared to award it the contract for inmate health care and behavioral services until Centurion, which holds the contract, challenged the decision in February. The state then notified Wexford it would send out new requests for proposals without offering a reason, as required by law, the filing says.

The state’s primary defenses are that Wexford has no standing to file suit and that the court lacks jurisdiction over the subject matter. An August hearing is scheduled to consider a state request to dismiss the lawsuit.
The state’s filing also says the plaintiff’s challenge fails because it contests “a lawful and discretionary decision” before the contract was awarded.
In contrast, Wexford’s challenge says state law obligates public contracting officials to “fairly and honestly” consider bids. Otherwise, competitive bidding “will be undermined” and vendors will be “discouraged” from submitting bids.
It also says Tennessee law recognizes “that rejecting all bids and canceling a solicitation ‘should be the exception in government procurement rather than the rule.’” 
Wexford’s filing further says the state “stands on the precipice of destroying any semblance of competition in the award of the contract.”
Wexford’s primary argument is that it was graded higher than Centurion and YesCare (formerly Corizon) in the state’s bidding process. Yet just before it was to receive the contract, Centurion protested the award and the Department of Correction called for another set of bids.
The March decision marked the second time in recent years the state opted to stick with Centurion and take new bids after the other two companies were to be awarded the contracts. The first time state officials were set to award the contract to YesCare, but reneged on that in 2024, then reversed course on the Wexford contract award this March.
The state’s Fiscal Review Committee extended Centurion’s contract in May because of the litigation.
Corizon, which held Tennessee’s inmate behavioral health contracts from 2012 to 2020, filed an antitrust lawsuit against the Department of Correction five years ago saying the state skewed the bidding process to help Centurion win the contract. That case was settled with prejudice in January 2022.
Documents from that lawsuit led the U.S. Department of Justice to charge two men, former Tennessee Department of Correction Deputy Commissioner Wes Landers and Centurion executive Jeffrey Wells, with bid-rigging in connection with the prison system contract. 
Landers took a job with Centurion after the contract bidding. The company fired both men before the lawsuit settlement, and Landers was found dead in September 2024.
House Speaker Cameron Sexton pushed for Centene’s Rhythm Health, formerly connected with Centurion, to win a TennCare contract for managed care services after it failed to succeed in bidding in 2021. Sexton sponsored a bill that would have required TennCare to add a fourth contractor, but it failed to pass.

(Photo courtesy Stephanie Cooper)Very few places exemplify our country’s shameful health disparities as much as Louisiana’s “Cancer Alley.”
Notorious for its toxic air and alarmingly high cancer rates, this petrochemical hub between New Orleans and Baton Rouge is where oil, gas and chemical corporations make their profitable products at the expense of the local population.
It’s a moral disgrace that neither Louisiana’s government nor the federal government has acted with urgency to end this well known injustice. Even United Nations human rights experts have condemned the environmental racism driving the poisoning of Cancer Alley, whose residents are disproportionately poor, Black or both.
Local communities have done their best to fill these gaps. People living near polluting facilities like those in Cancer Alley have started using pollution measuring equipment to monitor air quality in their communities for themselves. This is an example of “citizen science,” where the collection of scientific data is crowdsourced.
But lawmakers in Louisiana and beyond are trying to quash this work.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
A law enacted in Louisiana last year requires that all air monitoring data that is shared publicly be collected using EPA-approved equipment. But EPA-approved air monitoring equipment has a price tag of $791,000 apiece — and needs more than $200,000 a year for operation and maintenance. It’s simply out of reach for the impoverished communities suffering the worst pollution.
Even worse, the law says that sharing data collected using any other equipment can be punished by fines of $32,500 a day — escalating to $1 million if the violation is done “intentionally, willfully or knowingly.”
The law is specifically targeted toward community air monitoring “for the purpose of alleging violations or noncompliance with the federal Clean Air Act, Louisiana Environmental Quality Act, or any other applicable law, rule, or regulation for which the state has primary enforcement authority.”
But now, residents of the most polluted communities in Louisiana are fighting back in federal court. Community groups — including groups based in Cancer Alley, such as Rise St. James, the Descendants Project, and the Concerned Citizens of St. John — are suing the state, alleging a violation of their First Amendment rights.
The law is clearly an assault on the ability of communities to advocate for themselves. It’s not an isolated example either, but part of a longstanding pattern of government serving wealthy interests by restricting the ability of marginalized communities to protect their air, water, land, and livelihoods.
In a 2020 report, my colleague Gabrielle Colchete and I documented a similar pattern with laws to stifle dissent, which are now on the books in 22 states, including Louisiana. At the time, we looked at states that were pushing increasingly harsh laws against people who protest fossil fuel infrastructure. We did detailed case studies (including one on Louisiana) of the political interests pushing for these laws and the environmental justice campaigners the laws were targeting.
Laws attacking citizen science should be viewed similarly. And in fact these laws work together.
When powerful corporations use their allies in government to block communities from being able to advocate for themselves, they have no other avenue for change except protest — which is then restricted by anti-protest bills.
While these are alarming trends in general, they are particularly alarming today with an increasingly authoritarian White House that’s waging an ideological attack against the very idea of environmental justice. The Trump administration has censored environmental justice data on government websites and eliminated environmental justice programs at both the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Justice.
Given this political environment, there’s a real danger of laws attacking community air monitoring spreading to other states — a similar bill passed the West Virginia assembly last year before failing in the state Senate — and eventually being taken up by Congress.
Bad ideas, especially ones that benefit the wealthy and powerful, often spread far and wide. If we value clean air, clean water, and democracy, we need to be vigilant, and to fight back.

The owners of a Memphis-based health clinic MedPartners and SarJo Pharmacy purported to treat injured United States Postal Service employees, billing the cost of medications to the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act (FECA), according to an indictment filed June 12.
But the medication was never prescribed to patients, and the majority of the medications were not carried in stock by the pharmacy. About 500 of the 4,052 claims billed by SarJo Pharmacy between August 2018 and August 2021 were for drugs that were never actually manufactured or available to be purchased, the indictment states.
Collierville residents Kossie Lamon Simmons, 59, and Katina Marzie Simmons, 48, face charges of health care fraud and conspiracy to commit health care fraud and wire fraud, alongside 47-year-old Memphis resident Tritia Margalizita Townsend, who served as SarJo Pharmacy’s pharmacist in charge.
Between August 2018 and December 2021, FECA paid the pharmacy about $16.3 million. 
“Kossie, Katina and Townsend personally profited from their participation in the scheme by receiving fraud proceeds for the personal use and benefit of themselves and others,” the indictment states.
The trio are among 324 defendants facing charges as part of the U.S. Department of Justice’s 2025 National Health Care Fraud Takedown, according to Interim U.S. Attorney Joseph C. Murphy, Jr. The operation targeted those with alleged involvement in health care fraud and illegal drug diversion schemes throughout the United States. 
Indictment details alleged scheme
Kossie Simmons controlled and managed MedPartners, a health clinic founded in 2016 with locations in Memphis, Nashville, and Little Rock, Arkansas, according to the indictment filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee. Kossie Simmons also controlled and managed SarJo Pharmacy, which was founded in 2018 and had one location in Memphis. 
Katina Simmons managed and held 70% ownership interest in both companies. 
The indictment mentions an unnamed co-conspirator that held 30% ownership interest in both companies. Kossie Simmons, who previously pleaded guilty to health care fraud in 2007 and was barred from participating in any federal health care program for 25 years, exchanged text messages with the co-conspirator in August 2016.
“Been patiently waiting for the planets to come back into alignment from my first go round, now can attack this opportunity with the most valuable weapon of all EXPERIENCE,” Kossie Simmons wrote in one text message, according to the indictment. 
Katina Simmons enrolled MedPartners as a billing agent for the FECA program in August 2016, and enrolled the clinic as a physician office in the program in 2017, though Kossie Simmons was specifically barred from participating in a federal health care program.
SarJo Pharmacy opened in 2018 with Townsend as the only employed pharmacist. Townsend worked one day each week for four hours filling prescriptions for lidocaine and diclofenac, an anti-inflammatory medicine used to treat pain, the indictment states.
The Tennessee Board of Pharmacy began investigating the business in September 2020 and discovered the pharmacy was billing for prescription medications without valid prescription orders. Instead, two nurse practitioners who worked in MedPartners’ clinics would determine whether patients were eligible for compounded medications, or medicines created using drug ingredients “tailored to the needs of an individual patient,” according to the indictment.
Two other physicians who worked with MedPartners never authorized prescriptions for the medications billed, and the nurse practitioners did not have access to prescription pads, according to court documents.
Investigators executed search warrants on the businesses in August 2021. The businesses submitted 227 more claims between the searches and the end of that year, bringing in another $1.1 million in payments.
Kossie and Katina Simmons each face one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and health care fraud, which carries penalties of up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, if convicted. They also face seven counts of health care fraud, which carry penalties of up to 10 years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000, if convicted. 
Townsend faces one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and health care fraud and three counts of health care fraud.

(Getty Images)While I should know better, I continue to be caught off-guard by the growing number of people throughout the nation and the state of West Virginia who can’t seem to see the forest for the trees. Historically, West Virginia has made the list of one of the poorest states in the union and continues to make that list — year after year, decade after decade, which just adds to the incredulity of the number of voters who continue to put in the most powerful positions to lead the state and her people the same candidates of the same ilk. They’ve been drinking the Kool-Aid long before the current powers that be in D.C. and in Charleston took office — now though, the consumption appears to be limitless. 
Following the repeat cycle that keeps West Virginia on that list is, without a doubt, the single most destructive element in moving us forward. And with the last presidential election and West Virginia’s gubernatorial election, our chances of being forever removed from that list continue to dwindle. Still, when asked (and here’s where it gets really unnerving), the majority of voters in the U.S. and in this state would, given the chance, elect the same leaders. 
How is that possible when these leaders are doing everything in their power to make certain that the marginalized among us — you know who they are — continue to receive as little help from the federal and state governments as possible? This segment of society is being scraped to the marrow. Every effort to make it to the top of a very slippery slope only brings about more change that is not in their favor, until they once again slide down to the bottom. It is impossible for those not marginalized to continue to ignore the marginalized. This segment of our society has no choice but to keep grabbing that rope that is thrown to them and that is already thin and try to make the climb again — and again. 
The definition of ignorant is that you simply don’t know. But how can you claim to be ignorant of a clear sign of intentional degradation of a growing segment of the population, when it is in clear view? And if you truly don’t know about the challenges, then let go of your claim to ignorance and educate yourself and then ask yourself what you can do to improve the lives of the less fortunate among us.
When the federal government eliminates programs that are in place to help the marginalized in our country, our states, and our communities we must step up to the plate and do what we can. This directive is not debatable. Mother Teresa said, “If you can’t feed a hundred people, then feed one.” And, “Not all of us can do great things. But we can do small things with great love.” 
I recently read a work by Anne Lamott titled, “Somehow: Thoughts on Love.” The book forces the reader to confront uncomfortable truths, reminding us of our humanity. If you’re often left wondering how you can help those among us less fortunate, this book is filled with so many “can do” suggestions, and with such minimal effort. Yes, you can donate food to a food pantry or send your read books to the Appalachian Prison Book Project. Yes, you can write a check (no matter how minimal) to those who are suffering from the devastating recent floods in our state. And yes, you can discover what the charitable organizations are doing throughout your community and find a way to participate. In the end, each of us matters. It’s a shame that we’ve lost that most certain acknowledgment. 
Until we reinstate what we’ve lost politically, we must find a way — each of us — to make a conscious decision/effort to do what we can. We can’t keep turning away by suggesting that we don’t know that the problems exist. We can’t keep putting more and more weight on ignorance, when we know that we, in fact, know that these situations are front and center throughout our country, our states and our communities. Do something.
Make no mistake about it, this — all of this — is about politics. Perhaps it’s always been about politics, but never has the political scene been so fractured as to make certain that the underserved among us are becoming the first to be pushed so far to the edge that a plummet is on the horizon. We can’t let that happen. Stop leaning on ignorance and educate yourself and find a way to bring some dignity back to the people who suffer most.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/food-pantry-.jpeg,,,2025-07-02 06:00:21.456670

(KY Resist, Facebook)At first I wasn’t sure we ought to go. It was easy to imagine several ways this thing could go off the rails. But pretty soon we got clear. If there was going to be an anti-Trump rally in Manchester, we were going to be there.
We’d watched the massive protests in cities and towns around the country, none of them close to our home in Clay County. This was our chance to participate. Edmund threw two folding lawn chairs in the trunk of the car. I brought the signs.
In a downtown parking lot, we found a small group of young people unpacking boxes of snacks and bottled water. We set up in a small grassy area right in the middle of town. Gradually, one at a time, others joined us, adults of varying ages, men and women, some from around here, others from nearby towns. I counted about two dozen on our side.  
Meanwhile another group about the same size was gathering across the street. Much of the event turned out to be these two groups yelling at one another from across the road.  
From our side we chanted:
No hate, no fear
Everyone is welcome here
Hey Hey Ho Ho
Donald Trump has got to go
We sang “This Land is Your Land ” and “Which Side Are You On?”
We held up signs: 
Medicaid Cuts = Closed Hospitals 
Hillbillies Need Health Care, Too
Trump Gives to the Rich, Takes from the Poor
  Anne Shelby writes she counted about two dozen protesters at the anti-Trump demonstration in Manchester on June 27. (KY Resist, Facebook)
We had chants, songs and signs. They had flags and trucks.  They were gathered around a bright red pickup, parked as if aimed in our direction. There were other trucks, too, not parked, but in constant motion, driving past us up and down Main Street, Trump flags flying, going one way then turning around and coming back the other. It took us a few minutes to figure out that there weren’t as many trucks as there seemed to be, that we were seeing the same ones again and again. And again. 
The trucks, already loud, revved up even louder as they passed us. Some of the people in the trucks got loud, too. Some yelled, GO HOME! To which some of us replied, “We ARE home.” Other truckers shouted something else, which sounded like “other truckers,” but which started with M as in mother and F as in father. I have heard this expression many times in my life, but never so much as last Friday night. It was appropriate, I guess, since earlier in the week the president himself had dropped the F-bomb in a public statement about dropping bombs in Iran. One woman in our group, when they yelled obscenities at us, answered, “We love you.”
Two drivers with diesel engines released clouds of black smoke on our group as they passed. They were promptly pursued and arrested by the police, along with a gentleman in Proud Boy gear who started across the street towards our group and was escorted away by a policeman.
The Manchester police did an amazing, effective and important job. They made it possible for all of us on both sides of the street to exercise our right to protest, and they kept us safe.
There’s another KY Resist protest rally July 5 in London. I plan on being there. It’s a risky business, because Donald Trump has purposefully turned up the dial on anger, hate, fear, and the possibility of violence.   
Which  is — Hey Hey Ho Ho — all the more reason to resist.

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Provisions in the new tax and spending bill passed by the U.S. Senate early Tuesday would go even further than the House bill in removing health care and other benefits from immigrants with legal status.
The House version of the massive tax and spending bill penalized states providing health care for some immigrants with legal status as well as those that chose to spend state money to enroll immigrants without legal status in Medicaid.
But the Senate bill is even tougher on immigrants here legally and illegally, reducing benefits for most refugees and immigrants on humanitarian parole, including Afghans and Ukrainians who helped the United States in wars overseas and in return were promised safe haven and a safety net in the United States.
The Senate bill also cuts state reimbursement for emergency care in the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That would force those states to pay more for emergency care for immigrants, cut back services or drop out of Medicaid expansion, a potentially catastrophic move for low-income U.S. citizens as well as new immigrants.
The bill passed with three dissenting Republican votes, from U.S. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Vice President JD Vance broke the tie. The bill, officially the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” now returns to the House for final passage before going to President Donald Trump to be signed.

Advocates and experts see repercussions as refugees and other legal immigrants lose health insurance and turn to already-stressed hospitals and charities for help. It could be a nail in the coffin for some rural hospitals that are in financial trouble and scaling back services. Hospitals are required to serve anyone who arrives for emergency care, regardless of their ability to pay.
“In our state, it’s going to be absolutely devastating for rural hospitals,” said Kate Woomer-Deters, a senior attorney at the North Carolina Justice Center’s Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Refugees are not going to go home just because they lost their health care coverage. They’re still going to be showing up at the door of hospitals and clinics needing care.”
Some groups, such as Afghans, Ukrainians and Iraqis, were often brought here after helping the U.S. in war efforts, putting their lives in danger and making life in their home country untenable.
“In the case of the Afghans, this is pretty much a knife in the back to those folks who helped the United States when the United States needed help in their country,” said David Meyer, a board member of the Bloomington Refugee Support Network in Indiana, where he personally helps seven refugee families from Afghanistan, Honduras, Iraq, Nicaragua and Syria.
The Senate bill takes Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and even food stamps off the table for most refugees. There are a few narrow exceptions for people with green cards, some Cuban migrants waiting for citizenship, and some Micronesians and Marshall Islands natives with treaty rights, said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
That also applies to immigrants with legal status who don’t have green cards: people with asylum, immigrant victims of domestic violence, immigrant victims of sex trafficking and parolees — such as Afghans — admitted due to urgent humanitarian reasons, as well as to refugees.










It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them. 


– Shelby Gonzales, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities


“There’s going to be more emergency health care needs because uninsured people will be delaying care,” Gonzales said. “It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.”
The bill also cuts funding for expansion states to pay for emergency care in hospitals. Increased costs could force some states to drop Medicaid expansion altogether, spreading the pain to low-income U.S. citizens as well, Gonzales said.
“It’s one more reason states are looking at their budgets and they’re having to make decisions about their Medicaid expansion program,” Gonzales said.
In Indiana, Meyer said, Afghan women especially often need food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to get by at first. It takes them a long time to learn to read and write since they were not allowed to attend any school under the Taliban.
“They arrived in our community totally illiterate in their native language and starting from scratch learning English, so that’s a huge impediment to being gainfully employed,” Meyer said. Even once they’ve become self-sufficient enough to get off food stamps and Medicaid, many still need the support of the Affordable Care Act to get health care.
Removing all subsidized health care “would have a devastating effect on those families, and not just Afghans but Syrians, people from the Democratic Republic of Congo and others that have been relocated to south-central Indiana,” Meyer said.

Indiana hosted more than 10,500 of the nearly 460,000 refugees who arrived in the United States between 2013 and 2023, according to a 2023 report from the nonprofit Immigration Research Initiative. In fiscal 2024, another 1,380 arrived in Indiana, mostly from Congo and Burma, but including 90 people from Afghanistan, according to State Department records.
In North Carolina, there were 276 new Afghan refugees in fiscal 2024 among 2,730 total new refugees. Even professional Afghans such as doctors and lawyers struggle at first in low-wage jobs, said Woomer-Deters, of the North Carolina Justice Center. It takes time for them to get accreditation and language skills to practice their professions here, she said.
“A lot of these folks need their food stamps, Medicaid — they need these programs for an adjustment period when they get here. And these are people we’ve invited to come and have vetted,” she said.
A Congressional Budget Office report June 29 estimated that almost 12 million people, including 1.4 million immigrants covered by state-only programs, would lose health insurance under the Senate plan.
A Republican response to an earlier CBO report emphasized that the bill would save states $13.1 billion in Medicaid spending over 10 years, “freeing up resources they can choose to reinvest to further strengthen care for the most vulnerable Americans.”
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, however, called that conclusion misleading in its own response in turn.
“These savings would largely result from millions of people losing health coverage — hardly an outcome worth celebrating,” the response said.

Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, said there was one small positive change in the Senate version compared to the House version.
States will no longer be penalized for using the option to cover some immigrant children and pregnant women.
And the Senate version would not penalize expansion states for offering Medicaid to immigrants on humanitarian parole, but only because that help for parolees was ended in entirely, along with help for refugees and other kind of immigrants with legal status who lack green cards, Cuello said.
“In other words, they are blocking all paths to health care,” Cuello said in an emailed statement. “This is not an attack on the undocumented. It’s an attack on lawfully present immigrants.”

A bill to ban diversity, equity, and inclusion in North Carolina public schools is now on Democratic Gov. Josh Stein’s desk, where it faces a likely veto after months of heated debate. But for many educators who spoke out this spring as the bill advanced through the legislature, their concerns remain just as urgent. If it becomes law despite the veto, what will this mean for how they teach — and for the students they serve?  


Senate Bill 227, passed last week by the Republican-controlled General Assembly, prohibits instruction, training or professional development that promotes what lawmakers call “divisive concepts.” It would bar school districts from maintaining DEI-related offices, restrict hiring practices tied to equity efforts, and require public schools to certify annual compliance with the law.  


The educators quoted in this story spoke to NC Newsline during interviews in March, as the bill and others like it moved through the legislature. For them, the legislation represents not just a shift in policy but a potential disruption to how they build trust and connection with students.
“If we take away some of these strategies and materials that support engagement — where kids see themselves reflected in what we’re trying to teach — we’re going to lose the buy-in for why we want them to care, to try and to show up at school,” said Sarah Hill, a first-grade teacher at Banks Road Elementary School in Wake County. 
 Teaching in a gray area
Teachers say the bill’s vague language leaves them uncertain about what’s permitted and afraid of facing consequences for teaching topics related to race, gender or history, even when aligned with state standards.  


“The idea that we would educate students in a way that doesn’t acknowledge the world’s diversity is laughable,” said Kimberly Jones, North Carolina’s 2023 Teacher of the Year. “I have never found acknowledging the truth to be divisive. The problem is never in seeing the differences that exist in the world. The problem is when we turn a beautiful and amazingly complex spectrum of life into a ladder of hierarchy.”
While the bill allows for “impartial” discussions of controversial historical topics, some say it’s unclear how those boundaries will be interpreted — or enforced.  


Christina Cole, Wake NCAE President and a former educator, warned that the bill could impact student learning and school inclusivity. She argued that DEI programs are important for supporting marginalized students, particularly those from Black, LGBTQ, and bilingual communities.  
“Public schools are one of the few places in our democratic society where people come together across lines of difference,” Cole said. “It’s our responsibility as educators to welcome students and their families regardless of who they are or who they love.” 


Cole, who worked in Wake County’s Office of Equity Affairs from 2018 to 2022, said those initiatives directly improved student performance, especially for students in special education and for students of color. She warned the legislation could force teachers to remove welcoming classroom displays, restrict book selections and cut support services for diverse student populations. 
 Impact in the classroom


For Elliot Brody, a school counselor at Banks Road Elementary, the loss of DEI-focused professional development would take away critical tools for reaching vulnerable students.
“Diversity is representing all people — all walks of life, all colors, religions, different types of ability levels,” Brody said. “And inclusion is doing practices to make sure that everyone’s voice is heard.”   


He said DEI training gave him tools to better support students dealing with bullying, feeling left out or instability at home. Without that support, he worries some kids may no longer feel supported.
“We’re not trying to push anything onto anybody,” Brody said. “We’re trying to make things more possible for them to reach their potential.” 


The bill would prohibit awarding continuing education credit for DEI-related training and bar public schools from contracting with outside experts for such work.  


 Supporters say the bill promotes neutrality
Republican lawmakers say the legislation is meant to restore fairness and ideological neutrality in classrooms and aligns with a Jan. 29, 2025, executive order by President Donald Trump. 


Supporters argue DEI programs promote a worldview that “stifles opportunity” and “stokes division” by encouraging students to judge others based on race or sex.
“Children should learn in an environment free from discrimination and should not be taught divisive concepts such as that one race or sex is inherently superior to another,” Tami Fitzgerald, executive director of the NC Values Coalition, said in a statement to NC Newsline this past spring. 
“DEI enshrines discrimination into our public schools instead of eliminating it. It creates a toxic, divisive environment. We support its elimination and bringing fairness back to public schools.” 
 A question of representation 


Keiyonna Dubashi, founder and executive director of “Profound Ladies” — a nonprofit that supports educators of color — said the legislation could worsen longstanding racial disparities in North Carolina’s schools. With 80 percent of the state’s teachers identifying as white, Dubashi said DEI work is often about ensuring students see themselves reflected in their education — and in the adults who lead their classrooms.  


“If we don’t force folks to take another look at our talent pool,” she said, “we’re going to continue to see the workforce stay majority white, even though our student demographic is not a representation of that.” 


Dubashi said she didn’t learn about Black history until adulthood, a gap that left her questioning her own potential. “Sometimes I just wondered, can I achieve that? Is that possible?” she said. “Because you don’t see yourself in so many of the great stories.” 


The bill bans instruction that suggests people should feel guilt or discomfort because of their identity, or that meritocracy or American founding principles are inherently racist.
Dubashi said those restrictions leave little room to examine systemic inequality or help students understand their world. “It’s not divisive to welcome more voices and perspectives into the room,” she said. “If you don’t want diversity, then what do you want — the opposite of diversity?
 What happens next


Senate Bill 227 is one of three Republican-backed proposals approved last week that target DEI programs in K-12 schools, universities and state government. All three measures are now before Gov. Stein, who is expected to veto them.  


Senate Republicans have enough votes to override a veto, while House Republicans would need at least one Democrat to vote with them if all members are present.  


Jones, the former Teacher of the Year, said lawmakers should focus on policies that address students’ real needs. 
“There are many things that could happen to support our public schools,” she said. “I just don’t see how this bill is one of them.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Jones-in-classroom.jpg,,,2025-07-02 06:00:21.456670

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)In July 2020, the Virginia Clean Economy Act went into effect, setting the commonwealth on a path towards zero-emissions in its energy production by 2050. The lofty goals were designed to combat climate change and prepare Virginia to fulfill future electricity demands. 
Now as the state grapples with energy needs that have expanded since the passage of the bill — and with looming changes to federal energy policy — there are questions about if, and how, the law should be changed.
Where it started
The law, first proposed by Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, put Virginia ahead of the curve concerning decarbonization of the grid. It was voted into law largely across party lines with only a few Republicans joining Democrats, who held control of both chambers at the time. 
A foundational component of the law focuses on the state’s two largest utility companies: Dominion Energy, which serves 2.7 million customers in Virginia; and Appalachian Power Company that serves nearly 530,000 customers statewide. The law requires the companies to produce their energy from 100% renewable sources by 2045 and 2050, respectively.
Solar and offshore wind must make up two-thirds of energy production by 2035. VCEA mandated 16,100 MW of solar and onshore wind, 5,200 MW of offshore wind, 2,700 MW of energy storage capacity  be generated in the public interest.
To that end, Dominion is aiming to have 80% of its new power generation come from renewable energy sources in the next 15 years, distributed as follows:
Solar: 45%
Natural Gas: 20%
Battery Storage: 15%
Offshore Wind: 15%
Nuclear (Small Modular Reactors): 5%
Dominion is currently building the largest offshore wind projects in the country off the shores of Virginia Beach. The utility states the 2600 megawatt project will be able to power 660,000 homes at peak output. The cost of the project has steadily increased as construction progressed and now totals over $10 billion dollars, adding an estimated 43 cents to customers’ monthly bills. Dominion is required by the law to petition the SCC for approval of 5200MW of wind power by 2035; the offshore wind project will bring the company halfway to that goal.
The VCEA also ordered reductions in energy sales through efficiency programs. This was partially helped through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which brought in hundreds of millions of dollars to the state for efficiency programs through selling pollution credits over the cap of carbon emissions implemented on energy facilities. 
However, Gov. Glenn Youngkin removed the state from RGGI, claiming the cost that was ultimately added to utility bills was a tax on consumers. Courts have ruled his removal was unlawful. Virginia has not been added back into RGGI while appeals play out. It is likely the state’s membership in the program will not be determined until a new governor takes office in 2026.
“When the VCEA was initially passed, it was really about replacing power generation with newer, cleaner forms of power generation,” said Aaron Ruby, Director of Virginia and offshore wind media for Dominion Energy. “Today in Virginia, we’re not replacing generation. We’re adding new generation. We need as much power generation as we can get from every source.”
Since the implementation of the law, each year has benchmark requirements for Phase I and Phase II utilities to  use renewable energy. In 2026, Phase I utilities must be at 17% and Phase II must be at 29% otherwise they must buy renewable energy credits or face penalties of $45 per megawatt hour.
Dominion reports they have petitioned the SCC for 4500 MW of solar power of the 16100MW required by the VCEA. As for energy battery storage, Dominion has petitioned for 550 MW out of the 2700MW requirements.
Relatedly, in 2021, the General Assembly passed the Clean Cars Standard as part of the state’s goals of cutting emissions. The law mirrored California’s standard that banned the sale of gas-only cars after 2035. Virginia’s law ramped up percentages of new cars and trucks required to be zero emissions vehicles along the same time as California. 
The challenge
Since the VCEA was passed, Virginia’s electricity needs have exploded due to the construction of power-hungry data centers and more extreme temperatures that put a strain on the grid. Virginia is the home to over a third of the world’s data centers, with more being proposed across the state.
There is a growing concern as more come online that the cost of that energy use will ultimately land in the laps of consumers. Expanding the energy profile in the state through renewables is a slow-moving process, as county governments debate solar siting ordinances and where transmission lines should be built.
Republicans in the statehouse want to see more natural gas plants and small nuclear reactors built to meet the demand. They see gas as a more reliable energy source in extreme weather that creates more jobs than a solar farm would.
“This can’t really be a piecemeal approach. I think we really got to look at the whole scheme here that was put in place with the VCEA,” said Del. Chris Obenshain, R-Montgomery. “I think we’ve got to go back to the drawing board. I think the VCEA is totally unrealistic. It was implemented without really a plan to make it workable and that the cost of it is being passed on to consumers.”
Democrats acknowledge the fluidity of Virginia’s power needs but say the VCEA is still a valuable tool to help meet those needs responsibly. 
“We understood at the outset that we were setting a 30-year goal and that conditions and technology would change in ways we couldn’t anticipate in 2020. We knew that it would need to evolve and adapt, while keeping with the spirit of the legislation, and that we’d have to address those issues throughout the life of the law,” Sullivan said in a statement. “Indeed, we have made adjustments to the VCEA since it passed.”
The General Assembly has been unable to pass statewide regulations for solar farms and data centers. This has led to fierce debate in counties over whether both large scale solar farms and small community arrays should be allowed to be built. City and county officials also have had to determine rules for data centers as stress on local transmission lines becomes a growing concern.
“We can still achieve those targets through varying forms of solar, wind and storage, but because of the increased level of electrification across the state commonwealth, we need to plus-up on storage components,” said Jim Purekal, Director of Advanced Energy United, a group that was integral in passing the 2020 law.
Dominion has warned that with the increased demand they need to build multiple natural gas plants to serve during peak energy use times. Those plans, including a proposal to build a natural gas plant in Chesterfield, have often met community opposition since it would move the needle back on the carbon neutral goals the VCEA lays out. Others believe investing in energy storage is the right path to meet those peak demands.
“I don’t believe we have had a local government deny a permit for a solar project, we have seen counties impose various different limitations on solar development or restrictions for a certain project,” Ruby said. “At a certain point, we decided not to pursue a given project any further at least for the time being.”
What’s next
There have been numerous attempts to revise or outright repeal the VCEA. The latest attempts in the 2025 legislative session aimed to add hydrogen and fossil fuels to the state’s Renewable Portfolio Standard, expand nuclear power, lessening the requirements for emission reductions, and removing the financial incentives to comply with the RPS. All of those bills failed during the session.
“All of those efforts have been struck down, have been pushed to the side, in some cases haven’t even been considered or haven’t even been given a hearing… we’ve continued to try to get our colleagues to understand the problems that the VCEA has created and specifically how those hurt our constituents,” Obenshain said.
There have also been efforts to strengthen the law in its goals for emission reduction and meeting the power demand. Sullivan passed legislation this year that would expand power storage for the two large utility companies. 
“I tried to improve the VCEA during the last session of the General Assembly, with a bill that would have accelerated and expanded its energy storage provisions, enhancing reliability and helping to lower energy costs for Virginia’s families,” Sullivan noted. “But the Governor chose to veto it.”
Gov. Glenn Youngkin first offered an amendment that completely repealed the VCEA, which the General Assembly ultimately rejected. The bill then met Youngkin’s veto pen. 
“Adding in requirements for the petitioning of additional storage technologies will not change the fact that the law is misguided and does not work. Long-duration energy storage is an expensive technology and if utilities believed it to be the best technology to meet demand, they would be actively seeking permission to build them,” Youngkin said in his veto message.
Advanced Energy United, an advocacy group that represents businesses and energy companies and lobbies for public policies on consumer costs and grid reliability, believes like Sullivan that more energy storage will enable the state to meet its energy demand in peak usage times or after storms.
As for the Clean Car Standard, its future is uncertain after President Donald Trump signed multiple bills to rescind the California law that Virginia’s legislation is tied to. The build out of electric vehicle charging stations in the state has also been put almost entirely on hold after funding for the projects was cut.
The state was set to receive $100 million over five years to build charging stations along every 50 miles of the interstate. Fifty-one of the 53 projects lost their funding, marking a significant setback for the state’s shift towards zero-emission vehicles.
Ruby said Dominion is one of many stakeholders invested in the implementation of the VCEA. With a new slate of legislators and a new governor coming in next year, the utility plans to meet with them to determine how to best move forward with the law.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)A Henrico County Circuit Court judge on Tuesday ordered that licensed counselors be allowed to engage underage clients in a controversial form of talk therapy about gender identity and sexual orientation that medical and mental health experts say can be harmful.
The case underpinning the new consent decree with the Virginia Department of Health Professions stemmed from a 2020 state law banning “any practice or treatment that seeks to change an individual’s sexual orientation or gender identity.” Last year, Front Royal-based counselors John and Janet Raymond  challenged the ban. 
“The Raymonds desired to engage in talk therapy with minors through voluntary conversations, prayer, and providing written materials such as Scripture, but Virginia’s law and regulations prohibited them from doing so,” read a Tuesday statement from the Founding Freedoms Law Center, the Family Foundation’s legal arm that represented the Raymonds in the case. The Center hailed the court’s ruling as a “landmark free speech victory.”
Northern Virginia counselors challenge Virginia’s ban on conversion therapy

Conversion therapy entails attempts to change or influence a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity. The American Psychological Association has denounced conversion therapy, stating that it is not an accepted form of therapy based on medical or scientific evidence, as has the American Medical Association. The groups and advocates have also said conversion therapy is used as a tool to discriminate against LGBTQ+ people and lifestyles. 
Conversion therapy treatments have garnered national controversy over the years and range from inducing nausea, providing electric shocks to having people snap an elastic band around their wrist when they become aroused by same-sex erotic images or thoughts.
The Raymonds told the court they previously practiced talk therapy for conversion therapy clients, as they do with their other clients. The ban meant they couldn’t have conversations to try to guide clients away from embracing their sexual or gender identities. The new consent decree means they can practice conversion therapy again.
Opponents of the practice have argued that conversion therapy can put LGBTQ+ people at higher risk of mental health issues like depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse or suicide. 
The Raymonds emphasized that the talk therapy they engage in with their clients is voluntary and stressed that nothing about their case should be construed as allowing any counselor to perform acts associated with conversion therapy, such as electro-shock therapy. 
“With this court order, every counselor in Virginia will now be able to speak freely, truthfully and candidly with clients who are seeking to have those critical conversations about their identity and to hear faith-based insights from trusted professionals,” said Josh Hetzler, the couple’s legal counsel with the Founding Freedoms Law Center. 
The Family Foundation is a Christian and conservative advocacy group and legal firm that opposes same-sex marriage, supports more parental input in public education, and supports increased restrictions on abortions. 
“We thank God that He gives us the freedom to speak, to believe, to seek His wisdom,” John Raymond said Tuesday in the Family Foundation’s office in Richmond — formerly a house that Confederate General Robert E. Lee rented following his surrender at Appomattox that ended the Civil War. 
Raymond said he felt like Virginia’s 2020 law gave him no choice but to challenge it and called it a “hostile ideological invasion within our country.”
Likewise, Hetzler noted a “growing number of parents” seeking counseling services with a religious lens for their children “in an era when gender dysphoria has become a contagion among young people.”
 Virginia lawmakers weigh in

Sen. Danica Roem, D-Prince William, noted on a press call Tuesday that there have been bipartisan efforts to support LGBTQ constituents in Virginia’s legislature in recent years. When the conversion therapy ban was clearing the House of Delegates five years ago, 11 Republicans joined their Democratic colleagues in voting for it. Seven Republican lawmakers — to include then-delegate and now Attorney General Jason Miyares — abstained from voting. Over in the Senate, a former GOP lawmaker joined Democrats in supporting that version as well. 
While Miyares did not express support or dissent in 2020, his office has signed the consent decree effectively lifting the ban on conversion therapy. 
As attorney general, Miyares has pressed for banning transgender youth from participating in sports teams of their identity as a suite of anti-LGBTQ+ bills have been introduced in the state during Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration.  
Localities have pushed back on former Gov. Ralph Northam’s order that transgender students be able to use the bathrooms of their identities. And an in-progress constitutional amendment to remove a defunct same-sex marriage ban from the state’s constitution has advanced with slim bipartisan support. 
Advocates for that law say it’s important, as Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has expressed interest in revisiting a decade-old ruling that protects gay marriage federally. He expressed the opinion after the court struck down federal abortion protections. Should marriage protections fall, Virginia is among states that would immediately ban the unions. 
Roem reiterated the risks of conversion therapy, saying medical care for transgender people like hormone therapies or surgeries are constantly subject to medical review to assess quality of care, while talk-based conversion therapy isn’t. 
Roem, the state’s first transgender senator, said she has been on the receiving end of efforts to dissuade her from her sexual identity but it never stopped her from embracing being transgender. 
“I spent 13 years in Catholic school — I heard everything,” she said. “I am just as trans today at age 40 as I was when I got into Catholic school in 4th grade.”
Ultimately, what the conversion therapy ban came down to for Democrats, she and Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax said, is public health. Given how various medical associations have denounced conversion therapy, they felt it had no place in state-licensed counselor’s services. 
“I have no problem if somebody wants to go look at religious counseling from their priest or their minister, their rabbi, their mom — that’s perfectly fine,” Surovell said. “When somebody goes to get therapy from somebody licensed by the Commonwealth of Virginia, there’s a different set of rules applied. You can’t just say whatever you want because you have a license. That’s why we have professional standards, that’s why we have statutes.”
While several studies have shown negative mental and physical health impacts of conversion therapy on LGBTQ+ people, the Raymonds said a 2024 report in the United Kingdom  called for more research on gender identity services for minors. However, the report’s author noted their belief that “no LGBTQ+ group should be subjected to conversion practice.”
Challengers could appeal the decree to further deliberate the matter in courts and state lawmakers could further tweak their 2020 law when they convene next year.

(Photo by Charlie Paullin/VirginiaMercury)After 20 years in the Marine Corps, including time as a helicopter pilot and a year preparing congressional testimony on Capitol Hill, I’ve seen firsthand how closely energy security and national security are connected. Here in Hampton Roads, that link is especially clear: Our economy, our neighborhoods and our military bases all depend on reliable, affordable energy to stay strong.
Today, in my work with clean energy policy and large-scale infrastructure projects, I continue to focus on solutions that strengthen both our communities and our energy security. Clean energy tax credits are one of the most effective tools we have to make that happen. They help lower energy costs for families and businesses, modernize our aging electric grid, and ensure Virginia remains a leader in the next generation of energy innovation.
The Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project is a great example. Located about 27 miles off Virginia Beach, the project is on track to generate enough power for 660,000 homes when it becomes fully operational next year. It will provide clean, reliable electricity to a significant portion of our region, without the price volatility and supply chain risks that come with fossil fuels.
During construction, it supports nearly 900 jobs each year, most of them based here in Hampton Roads. Once completed, it will support over 1,100 jobs annually. These are good-paying jobs that support local families and small businesses. This project is not only growing our local economy, it is also helping to strengthen the regional grid that powers critical infrastructure like Naval Air Station Oceana and other defense facilities.
Large scale projects are only part of the picture. Clean energy tax credits also make it easier for homeowners and small business owners to install rooftop solar, add battery storage, and make energy-efficiency upgrades that lower their costs and improve reliability. These improvements help people feel more in control during extreme weather or power outages, by giving them access to backup power or reducing strain on the system during peak demand.
Hampton Roads is leading by example, but continued progress depends on smart policies and strong support from elected officials who understand what is at stake.
I was encouraged to see Congresswoman Jen Kiggans continuing to take a stand against the reconciliation bill that passed the House of Representatives last month. In a bipartisan letter sent to Senate Republican leadership, Kiggans and eleven other House members emphasized common-sense reforms for energy growth to keep our economy growing and our military strong, and highlighted the importance of protecting the tax credits and supply chains that keep projects like Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind moving forward. Although she signed the House bill that would repeal or render many of these incentives useless, the letter she signed outlines a better path. If the final Senate version fails to incorporate these reforms, I hope Kiggans will do the right thing and vote against it once the bill is back on the House floor for final consideration.
Virginia is already home to more than 118,000 advanced energy jobs, and the sector continues to grow year over year. These careers range from engineering and manufacturing to installation and maintenance, offering opportunities across a wide range of skills. But that progress is not guaranteed. If key federal tax credits are rolled back or allowed to expire, energy costs for families and businesses in Virginia could rise by more than 7% by next year. That would be a step backward at a time when we should be focused on building greater energy independence, grid reliability and economic resilience.
We have made great strides, but there is more work to do. By continuing to invest in clean energy and protecting the tax credits that support it, we can build an energy future that is reliable, affordable, and secure. Hampton Roads is showing the country what is possible when we prioritize innovation and smart investment. I am proud to be part of that progress.

But neither of them has jumped into the race. And their decisions are likely the only things holding up a flood of candidates from launching campaigns of their own.
Former Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, continues to “strongly consider” a campaign, his longtime political advisor told Axios on Monday. And Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law and a Wilmington native, has Republicans’ “right of first refusal.”

The two potential candidates would be formidable — Cooper a longtime staple of state Democratic politics who has never lost an election, and Trump carrying the network, fundraising and name recognition of the most powerful politician in the country. But if either (or both) decide not to run, a crowded field of contenders looking to succeed the retiring U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis is all but certain.
“They are both field-clearing candidates,” Western Carolina University professor Chris Cooper said of Trump in a radio interview with NC Newsline on Tuesday. “If either one of them gets in, I don’t think we’re going to see a lot of other action.”
Trump says Lara would be ‘first choice, but she doesn’t live there now’
Speaking to the press pool on Air Force One on Tuesday, the president mentioned his daughter-in-law when asked about the race.
“Somebody that would really be great is Lara,” Trump said.
“That would always be my first choice, but she doesn’t live there now,” the president later added, saying he didn’t know “who the candidates were going to be.”
“I think you’re going to have one of the congressmen step up. But she’d do very well.”
Trump said he hadn’t yet spoken to her about the race.



Richard Hudson withdraws his name, as Republicans call for a unified campaign
North Carolina House Speaker Destin Hall, the 37-year-old who ascended to the dais this year, said Tuesday that Republicans in the state “must unify behind whoever President Trump picks.”
“The NC Senate race is too important to be derailed by a messy, divisive primary,” Hall wrote on social media. “The real fight is against the radical left destroying our country.”
  U.S. Rep. Pat Harrigan (R-North Carolina)
Freshman U.S. Rep. Pat Harrigan, who has been named by several reports out of Washington as a potential candidate, named Lara Trump specifically.
“If [Lara Trump] enters this race, I’ll be the first to endorse her and the first to fight for her victory,” Harrigan wrote.
And another member of the state’s House delegation, U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, removed himself from the running Tuesday.
“My focus remains on representing the people of the 9th district — including the incredible men and women at [Fort] Bragg and their families — and on growing the House majority as NRCC chairman,” Hudson wrote.
On the Democratic side of the aisle, Lt. Gov. Rachel Hunt could enter the race, a spokesperson told National Journal on Tuesday. But first, she’s waiting to see if the former governor jumps in.
“Hunt believes former Governor Roy Cooper will be the likely Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate in 2026 and would be a strong candidate,” the spokesperson told the D.C. publication. “If he decides not to run, she’s not ruling anything out.”
Meanwhile, the only announced high-profile Democratic candidate, former U.S. Rep. Wiley Nickel, announced Monday that he’s in the race to stay and professed confidence that he can “take on whichever MAGA extremist Trump hand-picks to run.”

(Stock photo by Paul Souders/Getty Images)Do you remember the shocking images from the Exxon Valdez or Deepwater Horizon oil spills? The oil-slicked birds, the wrecked beaches, the empty fishing boats, and worst of all, the stories of lost lives? The Trump administration wants to bring polluting and dangerous oil and gas offshore drilling back — including to our New England shores. Here at the Conservation Law Foundation, we’re joining a lawsuit to stop this reckless plan.
In the chaos of the first months of the new regime, you’d be forgiven for overlooking this news story, but we can’t let it go unnoticed. In one of the most outrageous moves coming out of the Trump administration, the president has issued a series of executive orders pushing to open our iconic coastal waters to oil and gas drilling.
They want to exploit the waters of the Outer Continental Shelf, which make up much of the ocean surrounding the U.S. They want to loosen rules designed to protect the marine environment and the coasts. They even want to review national marine sanctuaries and monuments, the national parks of the sea, to see if we can plant some oil derricks on them as well. That means oil rigs in our lobster grounds. Pipelines cutting through fragile marine sanctuaries. The constant threat of spills on our coasts.
If you’re wondering, “Hey, didn’t Biden ban drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf?” Yes, he did, and no, President Donald Trump’s attempt to reverse the ban isn’t legal. That’s what the lawsuit is about.
Trump claims the U.S. is in an “energy emergency.” Spoiler alert: We’re not. In fact, we’re producing more fossil fuels than ever before. This isn’t about energy security. It’s about handing over our ocean to polluters. This flimsy justification won’t hold up in court, which is why we’ve joined Earthjustice and many other environmental organizations to challenge it.
In the last year alone, climate change has fueled a hurricane that swamped North Carolina, wildfires that leveled whole neighborhoods in Los Angeles, and floods that wiped out Vermont communities. As the environmental, financial, and human costs soar before our eyes, we need to be ramping down our fossil fuel production, not ripping up the seafloor in search of more.










In one of the most outrageous moves coming out of the Trump administration, the president has issued a series of executive orders pushing to open our iconic coastal waters to oil and gas drilling.


Fossil fuels pose an enormous danger to our climate, but they also pose a more immediate danger to everyone who has to interact with them. One study found that between 1968 and 2011, fossil fuel accidents claimed the lives of almost 5,000 Americans.
Let’s not forget that offshore drilling is a messy, high-risk business. The previously mentioned Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon catastrophes have dominated the news, but in 2003 an oil barge hit rocks off our own Cape Cod coast and dumped 98,000 gallons of oil into the waters of Massachusetts and Rhode Island. The oil fouled beaches and marshes and, according to NOAA, killed countless birds while destroying oyster, clam, and fish habitat.
Our ocean is too precious to New England’s way of life to risk with dangerous, unnecessary oil drilling. Offshore drilling destroys seafloor habitats, pollutes our waters, and risks destructive oil spills. A New England ocean littered with oil rigs could mean an end to summer holidays on the beach, our iconic lobster industry, thriving fish populations, and more.
That’s why the Conservation Law Foundation is stepping up to stop the Trump administration’s reckless plan to bring offshore drilling to our shores. We’ve fought attempts to drill in our waters for decades, and we’re not stopping now.
The Trump administration’s offshore drilling plan is an insult to every New Englander who values our ocean, our way of life, and our future. We will not let anyone turn our coast into another oil-soaked headline.

President Trump’s massive budget bill moved one step closer to passage yesterday when the U.S. Senate approved it 51-50 over the objection of North Carolina Republican Thom Tillis.
If it becomes law, the bill will have devastating impacts in our state. Among other things, more than half-a-million people will likely lose their Medicaid health insurance.
Amazingly, however, some state politicians remain oblivious – or at least unmoved — by the disastrous storm that’s about to befall our state.
Take Republican state Senate leader Phil Berger. He authored a Facebook post that read quote: “I support President Donald J. Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill and the legislature will work through any implementation issues.”
Uh…earth to Senator Berger: describing the loss of health insurance by hundreds of thousands of people as “implementation issues” is like calling a leg amputation a minor scratch.
The bottom line: The senator and other bill supporters will soon find they are like the proverbial dog that’s caught the bus they were chasing. And all North Carolinians will suffer as a result.

Goodlander was elected in 2024, defeating Williams with 52% of the vote, and has been in office about five months. She announced her reelection campaign in April when she decided against seeking the U.S. Senate seat of Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who had said she was retiring at the end of her term. Williams launched a new campaign to challenge Goodlander almost immediately after the 2024 cycle ended. Williams also ran in 2022.
When the Bulletin reached Goodlander by phone Friday, she was in the car on her way to Claremont to meet a Vietnam veteran who was disabled as a result of his service. Goodlander said the veteran was having issues getting his Department of Veterans Affairs benefits to pay for equipment to get his wheelchair into his van because of “a really outdated, silly law that was easily fixable, but that Congress hadn’t taken the time to address.” She now hopes to work with Republicans to get a legislative fix. The ASSIST Act, which she co-sponsored, passed the House in May.
“(That) really reinforces my basic belief that the North Star is the people who I work for,” Goodlander said. “And that’s what I’m working to do every opportunity I have.”
Goodlander said all she’s learned traveling through New Hampshire are her greatest takeaways since her term began. However, she shied away from questions about what her reelection pitch will look like.
“Today is day 175 for me on this job,” she said. “And my laser focus has been on delivering in every way I possibly can for the people who I work for, the people who have entrusted me with this responsibility at this critical moment in our country’s history. So that’s my sole focus.”
Williams, on the other hand, told the Bulletin she is intentionally beginning her campaign early to avoid what she thinks tanked her previous bid. She said last cycle she wasn’t able to raise enough money or gain strong name recognition. Now, she hopes to start fundraising early, leverage the expansive online presence she’s built — Williams has more than 250,000 followers on X — and attempt to garner donations from out of state.
In New Hampshire’s open 1st Congressional District race, a trio of Seacoast Democrats lead the way

“I was pure grassroots, relying on myself and donors across the country,” she said. “Average donor was $35 last year. And after (the) primary, I basically had no money left for any kind of TV ads. We did Facebook ads, and we did mailers, and all the money was gone. And money, no matter whether you like it or not, is almost like the bread and butter of politics.”
An immigrant’s story
Williams also said if they’re both the nominees again, she’ll challenge Goodlander to more debates. She wants to build off a debate performance that went viral last year. The clip circulated all around the world, she said, and was even translated into Mandarin and viewed by her family in China.
“I’m a legal immigrant,” she said in the debate clip. “I came here the right way. It took me 6½ years to become a citizen. My brother waited in China for 13 years to come here. It is a slap in the face to all the legal immigrants who are still waiting in line all over the world.”
Williams emigrated to the U.S. in 1988. She describes herself as “a survivor of Mao’s (Zedong) Communist regime in China.” She said she hasn’t seen her family in years because she was blacklisted for speaking out against the Chinese Communist Party. Formerly a Colorado resident, Williams moved to New Hampshire as part of the Free State Project — a movement that seeks to recruit libertarian-minded people to move to and run for public office in New Hampshire — though she says she is no longer very involved with the group. Throughout her campaign messages, she references her experience growing up poor in China, where she said she was “brainwashed” by the Chinese government.
She wants the U.S. to crack down on illegal immigration, but she said she supports reform to the legal immigration system.
An emphasis of New Hampshire roots
Before seeking elected office, Goodlander worked in several non-elected government roles. She served in President Joe Biden’s Department of Justice. She was a foreign policy adviser to the late U.S. Sens. John McCain, a Republican, and Joe Lieberman, a Democrat. And, as an attorney, she served as counsel to the House Judiciary Committee during President Donald Trump’s first impeachment hearings.
While she was born in Nashua, Goodlander’s work took her away from New Hampshire. She was sharply criticized for moving back to the district immediately before running for election and for characterizing herself as a renter in the district when she also owns another home in Portsmouth. In her 2024 campaign launch video, she emphasized her roots in New Hampshire. The video shows Goodlander talking to her mom, Betty Tamposi, about the day Goodlander was born — which happened to be an Election Day — and the pair visiting the polling place where Tamposi had voted. In the video, the two also discuss how Tamposi ran for the very same district in 1988, but was unsuccessful after facing sexist attacks from her opponent.
Goodlander told the Bulletin that as a congresswoman, she’s focusing on the cost of child care and elder care and on health-related issues, and is reaching out to work with Republicans. That includes on legislation to include small businesses in federal trade negotiations (the Small Business Advocacy and Improvements Act has passed the House) and an effort to get New Hampshire a full-service VA hospital. She also pointed to her role in the House of Representatives’ Democratic Litigation and Response Task Force, meant to oppose what it views as illegal actions by the Trump administration. She said her experience on the first Trump impeachment trial prepared her to oppose the president.
“I’m working with every tool I’ve got,” she said. “We’re in the midst of one of the most complicated litigation landscapes in the country’s history because of the Trump administration’s assault on the basic functioning of governance.”
Goodlander also has been visiting business throughout the state to talk about the negative effect of tariffs and to hospitals to talk about potential Medicaid cuts.
A change of focus
Williams said she’s also making a point to visit communities in her district she spent less time in in 2024. She said it’s part of her effort to build name recognition.
“Now we have the data to show where I lost by how much,” she said. “And I’m recruiting grassroots volunteers to help me to say, ‘Hey, maybe we can have a town hall here or there or there.’ And that’s No. 1 focus: community outreach.”
Williams sparked controversy during the last cycle when she argued during an October debate there were issues with the 2020 election and wouldn’t say whether she thought the presidential election, in which Biden defeated Trump, was free and fair. She also drew criticism for repeatedly sharing memes online alleging Jews “gave up their firearms to Hitler,” which led to the Holocaust. However, speaking to the Bulletin, she focused on basics, like inflation and immigration, saying “we’re a small state, and lots of people actually are suffering. The inflation, the cost of living is very high.”
“I came here 37 years ago with nothing, and I have lived the American dream and have the financial freedom today to run for Congress and spend lots of time to connect with voters,” Williams said. “It’s because this country is great, and New Hampshire is the only place that allowed me even to be the nominee of a major political party to do it. … I’m very honored for the more than 47% of voters in District 2 who voted for me last year.”
The role of money in the race
Other candidates appear to be mulling a bid for the seat as well. Dean Pennington, a Hudson analytics professional, has filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to create a campaign committee as a Democrat, but has not yet made a formal public announcement. Bill Hamlen, who ran for the Republican nomination but lost to Williams in 2024, told NHJournal in March he would run for the seat again if Goodlander didn’t.
Dante Scala, a political science professor at the University of New Hampshire, said a big factor in the Republican primary will likely be whether enough people see Goodlander as vulnerable enough to challenge her.
“Are there enough encouraging signs for someone else to get in on the Republican side who might have better fundraising strengths, for example, than Williams has been able to show?” Scala said. “Williams has done an awful lot with not much in the way of resources. Is there someone out there, a challenger to Goodlander, who would be able to bring more to the table in that regard?”
Scala said each time Williams has run, she’s gained more name recognition, “just by virtue of sticking around.” Fundraising may remain an issue for her though. He thinks she’ll need to look to small donors outside the district.
“With her particular brand of conservative politics, I think that is where the money would be in terms of digital fundraising,” he said. “Can she build something that approaches a national profile? I mean, that’s a tall order.”
“One thing we’ve learned about Goodlander is she commands a lot of resources within the Democratic Party, and of course, the Democrats will be looking to take back the House,” Scala added. “So if there’s even a whiff of a threat to Goodlander, the money will be there nationally to protect that seat. Whereas, on the Republican side, you’re looking at the national chess board, you’ve got a very, very narrow majority. There will be lots of seats Republicans will be looking to defend, and they’ll get first priority. Then, there will be seats that they might be hoping to flip. Would the 2nd District even make that for the Republicans?”
In 2024, Goodlander defeated former Executive Councilor Colin Van Ostern in a competitive primary. Scala said he’d “be surprised if Goodlander faces that amount of opposition to be renominated.” Still, he mused about the state of the Democratic Party.
“Is there a challenger out there who would be able to capitalize on the discontent that the Democratic base seems to feel about its leadership and would they be able to use that discontent to wage a viable primary campaign against Goodlander?” Scala said. “One advantage for Goodlander is she’s been able to kind of tote up a voting record during the first two years of the Trump presidency. So there have been a lot of votes where she could say, ‘look, I’m confronting Trump in this way and that way.’”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-02 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,A CT child tax credit in 2026? Advocates vow to resume battle,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/02/ct-child-tax-credit-2026-debate/,Advocates say new reports will help make their case for a CT child tax credit by emphasizing hefty tax burdens and a high cost of living.,"Supporters of a new income tax credit for middle-class households with children couldn’t overcome Gov. Ned Lamont’s objections this spring, despite strong grassroots support and broad backing in the General Assembly.
But advocates hope new analyses later this year on tax inequities and Connecticut’s surging cost of living will provide the ammunition they need to overcome any opposition in 2026.
“We are absolutely committed to continuing to make the case for a child tax credit,” said Lisa Tepper Bates, president and CEO of the United Way of Connecticut, which collected nearly 1,300 supporting signatures via an online petition over the winter and spring. “It’s clear that families in our state need more support to make life more affordable.”
The most popular proposal circulating at the Capitol in recent years involves a $600-per-child credit, up to $1,800 per household, for low- and middle-income families. This relief also would have been refundable, meaning that even if a household earns so little it has no state tax liability to apply the credit to, it would still have $600 per child added to its refund.
But that plan came with a $300 million to $350 million annual price tag, and some state officials were wary Connecticut couldn’t spare the revenue — despite an annual average surplus of $1.8 billion between 2017 and 2024, and a nearly $2.2 billion projected cushion in the fiscal year that closed Monday.
Connecticut officials fear state and municipal governments combined could lose hundreds of millions of dollars — and possibly more than $1 billion — in federal aid for health care, education and other core services as Congress works this summer to slash spending and finance an extension of 2017 tax cuts.
But Rep. Kate Farrar, D-West Hartford, a member of the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee and one of the leading advocates for a child tax credit, said the pain from federal cutbacks “will just make the [economic] slide even harder for so many of our struggling families.”
Farrar and others on the finance committee hoped to find middle ground this past spring by endorsing a more modest, $150-per-child credit, with the understanding it could be expanded later once the full extent of federal aid reductions was known.
But Lamont was reluctant to back the credit, even with the annual cost down to about $80 million.
The governor had proposed boosting, from $300 to $350, another income tax credit that offsets a portion of municipal property tax bills for middle-class households. This proposal came with roughly the same $80 million per year price tag.
Lamont, a fiscally moderate Democrat, also has said on several occasions that income and wealth redistribution should be done predominantly through the federal tax system rather than at the state level.
When the smoke cleared, both plans had been scrapped and the governor and legislators agreed to spend an extra $35 million to assist only Connecticut’s working poor. 
The state earned income tax credit, which adds an average of $1,061 to the returns of about 195,000 filers — most earning less than $65,000 per year — would grow by about $250 for those with dependents. But it would be a flat, $250 increase, regardless of the number of children in a household.
Rep. Josh Elliott of Hamden, a liberal considering a run for governor and founder of the House Tax Equity Caucus, said “the No. 1 antagonist in the fight for a child tax credit was the governor,” adding that $600 per child “would be really meaningful” for thousands of households in Connecticut. 
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said “No governor has done more to help our working families with children than Governor Lamont.”
State income tax rate cuts in 2023 were the largest since that levy was created in 1991, he said, adding the governor also supports one of the largest tax credits for working poor families and won passage of a new initiative this year to dramatically increase affordable child care.
“We continue to look for ways to reduce taxes; any additional tax cuts must be sustainable in future years,” Collibee said.
Reports show CT’s middle class is slipping
But advocates for a broad-based child tax credit say that while this year’s tax-cutting compromise will help the working poor, they need much more assistance, as do middle-class families.
“Our elected officials need to meet the urgency of this moment and must prioritize the passage of policies boldly aimed at improving statewide equity, quality of life and access to resources,” said Janée Woods Weber, executive director of She Leads Justice, a nonprofit formerly known as the Connecticut Women’s Education and Legal Fund.
The United Way has tried to make that case every two years through its ALICE methodology for assessing Connecticut’s high cost of living. ALICE is an acronym for Asset-Limited, Income-Constrained and Employed.
A Connecticut family of four needed $108,324 in 2022 not to be economically secure, but simply to survive, the United Way reported last fall. And that’s assuming the household took full advantage of all tax credits available to it, something the United Way says is often missed.
The ALICE calculations represent an alternative to the Federal Poverty Level, a simple metric developed in the mid-1960s by U.S. Social Security Administration economists and based largely on the cost of a minimum food diet. A family of four earning more than $27,750 was considered above the poverty line in 2022 based on that benchmark.
The ALICE survival budget reflects housing, food, utilities, transportation, child care and — assuming the family can’t afford a computer — the cost of one smartphone.
The Urban Institute, a nonprofit economic and social policy research group, echoed the United Way’s projections in a report last November.
The institute found a family of four in the northeastern U.S. needed to earn close to $151,100 in 2022 to be economically secure.
Bates said last week that the United Way will update its ALICE calculations this fall and continue the reports annually to underscore the high cost of raising a family in Connecticut.
Advocates also hope mandates to beef up the state’s own tax fairness study will create enough momentum to establish a child tax credit next year.
The Department of Revenue Services’ 2024 report found the lowest-earning 10% of households effectively spent almost 40% of their income in 2020 to cover state or municipal tax burdens, more than five times the rate faced by Connecticut’s highest earners and more than twice the statewide average.
And since Connecticut began issuing tax fairness studies a decade ago, the imbalance only has worsened.
Even one of the largest state tax cuts in 2023, which included the first income tax rate reduction since the mid-1990s, only slowed — but didn’t reverse — the ever-widening shift onto working families, according to a 2024 analysis from Connecticut Voices for Children, a progressive New Haven-based policy group.
The next tax fairness report, due this December, must consider a broader range of state and municipal levies than prior analyses did, according to changes ordered by legislators.
This report is “one of the few tools residents have to better understand how unfair our tax system is and whether progress is being made to make it fairer,” said Emily Byrne, executive director of Connecticut Voices for Children.
Rep. Maria Horn, D-Salisbury, co-chairwoman of the finance committee and another backer of the child tax credit, said she suspects some opposition was based in the fear Connecticut couldn’t afford to offer this relief without raising income taxes on the state’s richest households.
The finance panel did recommend a 1.75% surcharge on capital gains earnings on individuals making over $1 million and couples over $2 million — which was a non-starter for Lamont, who says taxing the rich would prompt them to flee Connecticut.
But Horn said that was proposed to safeguard state programs against federal funding cuts and was never seen as a necessity to make income tax relief for poor and middle-class families affordable.
Support for a child tax credit, she added, stems from “a broad-based recognition of the cost of raising kids in Connecticut … at a time we want to encourage young families to live here and stay here.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CT-state-capitol-1024x855.jpg,,,2025-07-02 05:02:19.097519

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)While attending the 2025 National Association of Social Work’s Annual Conference in June, I received an email from U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, praising President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” as a transformative legislative package that will prevent economic disaster and uplift American families.
If you have never been in the presence of 2,400-plus social workers, all focused on “Celebrating Our Legacy, Developing the Future,” allow me to paint a mental picture. The environment is nonstop movement acceleration, filled with speakers, activities, and events to rekindle our purpose and then equip and mobilize us for anti-oppressive work that includes addressing policy concerns.
The “big, beautiful bill,” propped up by a mountain of misrepresentations, is a major policy concern for us all.
Most of the presenters at the conference reminded us of our responsibility to challenge injustices, responding to rhetoric that is often mentally paralyzing. These weapons of immobilization must not succeed. Kansans and Americans across the country are struggling with real-life concerns such as affordable child care, access to food and health care, and fair wages. We owe it to ourselves to examine political promises with a discerning eye, especially when the promises directly affect those we serve.
Much of what “Doc” Marshall touted in his email is not only exaggerated, but contradicted by history, data, and his own voting record.
 
The ‘largest tax increase’
Marshall claims that if the Trump-era tax cuts expire, we will face “the largest tax increase in American history.” This is false and fearmongering. I have addressed fearmongering in a previous op-ed.
The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, disproportionately beneficial to the wealthy, is set to expire this year unless renewed by Congress. According to the Tax Policy Center, the majority of the cuts benefit the top 20% of earners. Middle-income families benefitted less than $1,500 per year, not the $12,000 per year that Marshall claims.
To be clear, if these tax cuts expire it would restore pre-2017 rates, not introduce new taxes. The plan’s tax benefits go to corporations and wealthy individuals, not working families.
 
A thousand dollars a month?
Marshall asserts that making the administration’s tax cuts permanent would save American families “$1,000 per month.” Data tell a different story.
The Congressional Budget Office and Brookings Institution have both found that households in the bottom 60% of earners received less than $100 per month from the original tax cut package. The only people saving anywhere near $1,000 per month were those making more than $500,000 annually.
Claiming that “families” would save this much is a distortion designed to garner support from people who will never see those savings.
 
Sleight of hand
The Child Tax Credit is an area where bipartisanship could make a meaningful difference. But the good doctor’s concern rings hollow.
In 2021, the American Rescue Plan temporarily increased the CTC to $3,600 per child. According to Columbia University’s Center on Poverty and Social Policy, this potentially cut child poverty nearly in half in just six months. Marshall and his colleagues opposed this expansion and refused to make it permanent.
Now, Marshall wants to take credit for increasing the credit to $2,200 — just two-thirds of what he once rejected — and portrays inaction as a threat to our children. If concern for families were truly bipartisan, why is the higher credit not already permanent?
 
‘Trump Savings’
Marshall’s mention of “Trump Savings” for newborns, meant to provide a financial head start, is not supported by any legislative framework or credible funding method. While the idea of universal savings accounts should be explored, without transparency about cost, implementation or bipartisan support, it remains campaign rhetoric — not policy.
 
Paid family leave
The senator also claims the Trump bill will extend paid family and medical leave tax credits. Ironically, the expansion of paid leave was included in the American Rescue Plan Act, which he voted against.
When Democrats introduced legislation to provide comprehensive national paid leave in 2021 and 2022, Marshall and most of his colleagues dismissed it as “wasteful spending.” Now, he is attempting to adopt the language of worker protections without a record to back it up.
 
Childcare and SNAP
On child care, Marshall claims that the bill will increase access for single mothers and low-income families. But just last year, Republicans proposed cuts to the Child Care and Development Block Grant, the primary federal program supporting child care access.
And on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the senator blames “blue states” for abusing benefits. The fact is, states are granted flexibility to adapt programs to regional cost of living and workforce conditions, and there’s no credible evidence of widespread fraud or manipulation. What Marshall calls “abuse,” others call feeding children in high-cost cities. Imposing stricter work requirements will harm the very people SNAP is designed to help — the elderly, disabled and underemployed Americans, not freeloaders.
As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, if Marshall wants to propose legislation to help families, he should start with facts, and hold to the promises made at his Yates Center “town hall.” No falsehoods, distortions, or selective memory can withstand the lived experiences of constituents.
After having been passed by the Senate early Tuesday, the legislative package now heads back to the U.S. House for reconsideration. Lawmakers still have can decide whether to change, approve or reject the legislation.
Kansans deserve leadership grounded in truth, not political spectacle. We must demand that our elected officials tell the truth about who benefits from their policies, and more importantly, who gets left behind. Because when policy becomes performance, it’s the people who pay the price.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original story.)In the aftermath of the ruling by Franklin County Common Pleas Court Judge Jaiza Page that the Ohio universal school voucher program is unconstitutional, some public school advocates have an idea for Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman and his Republican colleagues: Enroll in a “Science of Reading” class. 
It is beyond ironic that lawmakers like Huffman mandated a prescriptive reading program like “Science of Reading” and required teachers to complete professional development in the program by June 30, 2025, yet ignored the clear and unambiguous written language in the Ohio Constitution that formed the basis for the anti-voucher lawsuit that was just decided in the Franklin County court.
Science of Reading proponents in the legislature and elsewhere, please process this passage at the literal level of reading comprehension:

Ohio Constitution, Article VI, Section 2
The General Assembly shall make such provisions, by taxation, or otherwise, as, with the income arising from the school trust fund, will secure a thorough and efficient system of common schools throughout the state; but no religious or other sect, or sects, shall ever have any exclusive right to, or control of, any part of the school funds of this state.

In the reading process (no science here), we should extract the main idea of the passage to mean that taxes raised by the legislature are for the purpose of maintaining a system of common (public) schools and not religious schools.
 At the literal level of comprehension in the reading process, the term system, according to the Google machine, means an “interconnecting framework” and the very example given for this definition is “the public school system.”
What seems bizarre about the actions of the Ohio legislature in creating the universal voucher program is that the very folks who were so obsessed with mandating a specific instructional approach to the teaching of reading did not comprehend that there is no inferential level to be deployed in the straightforward text of the state’s constitution. 
Former lawmaker Stephen Dyer succinctly framed Judge Page’s reasoning in making her decision for the plaintiffs:

It creates a separate, uncommon school system
It prevents the state from fully funding its own public school system
It gives control over taxpayer money to religious schools, which is expressly forbidden in the Ohio Constitution.

Astute readers will note that the judge’s reasoning as sketched in the three points above is centered in the clear l851 prose found in Article VI. 
By doing so, the merits of the case can be separated by the plethora of extraneous distractors crafted by voucher proponents that include such terms as “scholarships,” “school choice,” “a matter of social justice,” and “money should follow the student.” 
Textualists and Original Intent scholars please note: None of those words or terms are found in the Ohio Constitution. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In making its findings, the court found that the private school voucher program, in violation of the constitution, “created a system of uncommon private schools,” provides “a religion or other sect … control of, a part of the school funds of Ohio, and that providing private and religious schools an “unknown amounts of public revenue…is not thorough and efficient.”
As a way to add perspective to her findings, Judge Page in her opinion did sketch some earlier attempts to amend Article VI, Section 2. A delegate at the 1873 Constitutional Convention made a motion to delete the phrase “but no religious or other sect, or sects, shall ever have any exclusive right to, or control of, any part of the school funds of this state.” 
However, another delegate at the convention took exception, and Judge Page noted in her narrative that his words composed more than 150 years ago in opposition to the proposed amendment were added into the official record:

(T)he object of the amendment becomes apparent; it is to leave the Constitution so crippled that the various religious denominations may divide the common school fund among them, for the support of sectarian schools.

Inasmuch as the vast majority of state private school voucher funds have been snapped up to further undermine the fiscal needs of the state’s public schools, the 1873 attempt to delete a key portion of the state constitution’s prohibition against funding religious schools should be instructive when this case, as expected, moves to the appellate stage.
The lawsuit was led by William Phillis, the executive director of the Ohio Coalition for Equity and Adequacy of School Funding, with support from nearly half of the school districts in the state. 
In a statement after the Coalition’s victory in the Franklin County court, Phillis posted this brief statement:
“The Constitution of Ohio is very clear. The General Assembly is responsible for a thorough and efficient system of common schools. It is illegal for the state to tax Ohioans for private school ventures.”
In the meantime, June 30 is the expiration date for teachers to complete their professional development training in the Science of Reading. 
Speaker Huffman, Ohio Senate Education Committee Chair Andrew Brenner and other school voucher proponents can always enroll in the Science of Reading professional development training that they mandated for teachers to attend. 
As a result, Huffman, Brenner, et. al. may then be better equipped in the future to approach textual language in their work and thus know that when it comes to reading comprehension, there is a difference between a literal and inferential response to text. 
They may also learn that there is no science required in reading clear prose that was crafted in 1851, and understanding the main idea in the text. 
Huffman said in 2023 about Ohio Republican lawmakers that “we can kind of do what we want.” 
Those who support education as a public good challenge his assertion and will continue to oppose the unconstitutional school voucher program. 
A Franklin County judge has determined that when it comes to reading and comprehending the constitution, these same lawmakers must recognize that respect for the law must start with themselves. 
In the meantime, Ohio lawmakers should consider Science of Reading training. It might help the state avoid future lawsuits and deter them from kind of doing what they want.

Doug Robison’s 2021 donation to Abilene Christian University helped the institution win federal approval to house an advanced small modular nuclear reactor, which might be finished as soon as next year. Small modular reactors are designed to be built in factories and then moved to a site, and require less upfront capital investment than traditional large reactors.
Only two small modular reactors are in operation, one in China and another in Russia. Natura Resources is one of two companies with federal permits to build one in the U.S. After that initial $3.2 million donation, Robison formed Natura Resources and committed to investing another $30.5 million in the project.
“Nuclear is happening,” said Robison, who retired from the oil business and moved to Abilene to launch the company. “It has to happen.”
Robison’s words are being echoed across the country with new state laws that aim to accelerate the spread of projects that embrace advanced nuclear technology — decades after the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl calamities soured many Americans on nuclear power.
In the past two years, half the states have taken action to promote nuclear power, from creating nuclear task forces to integrating nuclear into long-term energy plans, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, which advocates for the industry.
‘The West will lead’: Utah, Idaho, Wyoming team up on nuclear energy development

“I’ve been tracking legislation for 18 years, and when I first started tracking, there were maybe five or 10 bills that said the word ‘nuclear,’” said Christine Csizmadia, who directs state government affairs at the institute. “This legislative session, we’re tracking over 300 bills all across the country.”
The push is bipartisan. In New York, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul last month directed the New York Power Authority to build a zero-emission advanced nuclear power plant somewhere upstate — her state’s first new nuclear plant in a generation. In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis in April signed legislation redefining nuclear energy, which doesn’t emit a significant amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases, as a “clean energy resource.” The law will allow future plants to receive state grants reserved for other carbon-free energy sources.
But no state is more gung-ho than Texas, where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott last month signed legislation creating the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office and investing $350 million in nuclear expansion.
“Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this legislation will position Texas at the forefront of America’s nuclear renaissance,” Abbott wrote in a statement.
In addition to legislative action, the Texas A&M University System has invited four nuclear manufacturers to build small modular reactors at the school’s 2,400-acre RELLIS campus in the city of Bryan.
In Texas and other fast-growing states, rising electricity demands are fueling the push. Tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon that require a tremendous amount of electricity to power vast data centers are teaming with nuclear developers to provide it.
Last October, Google signed an agreement with nuclear energy producer Kairos Power to deploy multiple small modular reactors capable of generating a total of up to 500 megawatts by 2035. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced in December that it is also looking to reach a similar deal. Some of the largest data centers require more than 100 megawatts of power capacity, enough to power around 100,000 U.S. households.
Constellation Energy announced last September that it would reopen Three Mile Island, shuttered since 2019, as part of a deal with Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI data centers. One of the two reactors at the plant, which is located south of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, partially melted down in 1979. But the remaining reactor reliably produced electricity for the next four decades.
“Folks shouldn’t sleep on nuclear,” Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said as he welcomed back workers to the plant last month. “They should be aware of the important clean role it plays in our energy portfolio.”
But opponents say the renewed interest in nuclear energy is misguided.
Federal money could supercharge state efforts to preserve nuclear power

In Colorado, a coalition of two dozen environmental groups, including the state chapter of the Sierra Club, urged Polis to veto the bill.
“The idea that nuclear power is a clean energy source could not be further from the truth,” the groups wrote in a letter to the governor. “Nuclear power is the only energy resource that generates dangerous waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years.”
Some critics say small modular reactors are actually more expensive than traditional reactors, when they are judged per kilowatt of the energy they produce. And one 2022 study, conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the University of British Columbia, concluded that small modular reactors will produce more radioactive waste than traditional reactors.
“There’s a pretty healthy skepticism about advanced nuclear projects,” said Adrian Shelley, who heads the Texas office of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. Shelley said many environmental groups “are just deeply concerned about Texas’ ability to responsibly manage nuclear storage and especially nuclear waste in the long term.”
 Ramping up

The United States currently has 94 nuclear reactors at 54 plants in 28 states. The oldest began operating at Nine Mile Point in New York in 1969; the newest reactors, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Burke County, Georgia, began operating in 2023 and 2024.
Scott Burnell, a spokesperson for the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said that between the mid-1990s and 2005, there were “no applications at all” for new reactors. In 2007, there was a surge of a dozen applications when the federal government began offering tax incentives. But interest in new reactors plunged again when the fracking boom boosted fossil fuels as an economical power source.
Over the past several years, activity has ramped up again. “There are a number of factors that we are seeing drive this increased interest,” Burnell said. “Probably the biggest one is the growth in data centers.”
The commission has approved three new nuclear projects in the past three years, including the one at Abilene Christian University. It is reviewing three other applications and is discussing potential projects with a dozen other nuclear developers, Burnell said.
Texas currently has two nuclear plants — Comanche Peak near Glen Rose in North Central Texas and the South Texas Project in Matagorda County on the Gulf Coast. The two plants, each of which has two reactors, provide about 10% of the state’s electric power, according to the Texas comptroller. The new small modular reactors would face the same safety standards as these plants.
The project at Abilene Christian began when Robison’s Natura Resources established a research alliance with that school, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at Austin. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the project in 2024.
The reactor will be constructed at a laboratory at a different site, but its home already awaits in a trench at the bottom of a cavernous room at Abilene Christian’s Dillard Science and Engineering Research Center. The trench is 25 feet deep, 80 feet long and 15 feet wide, with a radiation shield made of concrete 4 feet thick. When the 40-ton reactor is finished, possibly by the end of next year, it will be transported to its home on a flatbed truck.
“The future is uncertain, but we’re ahead of the pack and moving at an amazing clip,” said Rusty Towell, an Abilene Christian engineering and physics professor who is working on the project. “So I think that there’s a great reason for optimism.”
Towell asserted that the project will produce only “small amounts of low-level waste” and that storing it safely will not be a significant challenge.
 ‘What Henry Ford did for cars’

John Sharp, the outgoing chancellor of Texas A&M University, said he invited nuclear companies to build small modular reactors at the school to help meet the country’s desperate need for more power. He said it made sense to give developers access to the faculty and students at the university’s nuclear engineering department.










We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars.


– Matt Loszak, CEO of Aalo Atomics


Sharp said his pitch was simple: “Hey, we got some land. We got it next to some really smart people. Would you like to come and build a plant?
“And four folks said, ‘You betcha.’”
Matt Loszak, the 34-year-old CEO of Austin-based Aalo Atomics, one of the companies that answered Sharp’s call, said he had two employees 18 months ago. Now he has more than 50.
“We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars,” Loszak said, “which is really make them mass manufacturable and make it economical to deploy around the world.”
Robison said he’s been speaking at town halls in Abilene, a conservative community that is home to Dyess Air Force Base, for about five years. He claims the residents are “overwhelmingly excited” about having the small modular reactors at Abilene Christian, he said.
“Texas is an energy state,” he said. “We understand energy and what happens when you don’t have it.”

The 2026 general election is still more than a year away, but plenty of hats are being thrown into the proverbial ring to run for U.S. senator, Georgia governor and other top positions.
But there are other, smaller proverbial rings into which more modest hats are also already being tossed.
All 180 seats in the state House and all 56 in the state Senate will be up for grabs on ballots around the state, and the results will shape what laws Peach Staters live under in 2027 and beyond, as well as the partisan makeup under the Gold Dome. Currently, the House includes 100 Republicans and 80 Democrats and the Senate has 33 Republicans and 23 Democrats.
Official qualifying doesn’t begin until the spring, but here’s a look at some of the candidates who have already announced their intentions to run or filed paperwork with the Georgia Ethics Commission’s campaign finance system.
Replacements for senators seeking higher office

Expect to see plenty of new faces in the Senate in particular, as ambitious senators shoot their shots at positions of greater power. That includes President Pro Tem John F. Kennedy of Macon, who is stepping down in the hopes of upgrading his title to lieutenant governor.
Two Republicans have filed paperwork so far to run for Kennedy’s seat. Former state Rep. Lauren Daniel, who was defeated in her 2024 GOP primary by now-state Rep. Noelle Kahaian of Locust Grove, is set to face off against attorney Steven McNeel.
In a post on social media, Daniel styled herself as a committed backer of conservative causes.
“In a culture where traditional values are under attack from the radical left and many politicians are afraid to fight, I am willing to do just that,” she said. “As a staunch conservative, mother of four and unabashed supporter of the America First policies championed by President Trump, I believe I can represent middle Georgia in an effective way without compromising our values.”
McNeel was not immediately available for comment, but according to his bio on the website for the law firm where he works, he has a degree in political science from the University of Georgia, is a member of the Georgia Trial Lawyers Association and specializes in bodily injury, wrongful death, workers’ compensation and Social Security disability law.
  Sen. Emanuel Jones. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Two Democrats have filed paperwork to replace Decatur Democratic Sen. Emanuel Jones, who is among the Democrats challenging Congressman David Scott next year.
Larry Johnson, a former longtime DeKalb County commissioner, said on his website that he hopes to “bring his experience, leadership, and bold vision to Georgia fighting for better schools, economic justice, and stronger communities.”
But before he can do that, he’ll need to defeat Kate Denny, a nurse and mom from Avondale Estates, who garnered attention when she pressed U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff to do more to oppose President Donald Trump at an April town hall.
Denny said she plans to make a formal announcement in the coming days and hit the campaign trail early, speaking to voters about kitchen table issues.
“I care deeply about the things that we all care about in this district: housing, health care, childcare, wages, everything that will help all of us come together and elevate ourselves and our neighbors,” she said.
Other notable Senate candidates: 

Rep. Will Wade, a Dawsonville Republican, is seeking to move across the Capitol with a run to replace Dahlonega Republican Sen. Steve Gooch, who is running for lieutenant governor. Lumpkin County Commission Chair Chris Dockery and Dawson County business owner Douglas Sherill have both announced plans to run for Wade’s seat in the House.
Sandy Springs Democratic Sen. Josh McLaurin has announced plans to run for lieutenant governor, and so far, two Republicans have filed paperwork to run for his seat, Michael Dvorscak, who works in commercial real estate, and financial analyst Carson McQueen. McLaurin won his seat in 2022 with 54.7% of the vote. He didn’t have a Republican opponent in 2024.
Four Republican candidates have filed paperwork to replace Athens Republican Sen. Bill Cowsert: Michael Broun, an attorney at Cowsert’s law firm; Oconee County Republican Steven Todd Strickland; Marc McMain, a small business owner and former Walton County GOP Chair, and Doug McKillip, who previously served in the House as a Democrat and later as a Republican.
Bret Dunn, a former Marine Corps captain and judge advocate general, is the sole candidate so far seeking to replace Sen. Brian Strickland, who is running for attorney general.
Toombs County Commission Chairman David Sikes is the only one so far to file paperwork for a bid for the seat of Sen. Blake Tillery, who has filed paperwork to run for lieutenant governor but not officially launched a campaign.

Whose House?

In the House, a high-profile grudge match and a race between a 10-year incumbent and a reality TV dentist could be shaping up to be top races to watch.
Buford Republican state Rep. Sandy Donatucci won her seat by a hair in 2024 – with more than 30,000 votes cast, she won by just 80 votes – over the Democratic incumbent, former Rep. Farooq Mughal.
But Mughal is hoping to mount a comeback – he officially launched his campaign earlier this month, and Democrats are hoping distaste with the party in the White House will help his chances in the swingingest of Georgia’s swing districts.
“Economic uncertainty and Trump’s reckless tariff policies are straining Georgia businesses. Rising healthcare costs and the consequences of Georgia’s extreme abortion ban are harming our families,” Mughal said in a statement. “We need a representative who understands how to bring home resources for safer schools, stronger neighborhoods, and to protect our quality of life from overdevelopment and corporate land grabs. I believe in putting people over politics and delivering real solutions for our community.”

Donatucci, a sales professional and military spouse, has pitched herself as a common-sense Republican who will focus on improving the economy and boosting public safety.
“My promise to the people of House District 105 was to stand up for what is best for our families,” reads a statement on her website. “At the State Capitol, I am working to bring a common-sense approach to the challenges that we all face. Together, I know we can find solutions to secure a safer and more prosperous future for our families and community.”
Lithonia Democratic Rep. Doreen Carter, who was sworn into office in 2015, could be facing a challenge from Dr. Heavenly Kimes, a dentist and one of the stars of “Married to Medicine” on Bravo. The reality TV show follows the lives of Kimes and other women medical professionals in Atlanta.
Numerous incumbents from both parties are set to face challengers in their party primaries and in the November general. For now, some of them are just bracing for it, including Sandy Springs Democratic Rep. Esther Panitch, who, in a fundraising post on social media, said she expects a primary challenger to mount a campaign “rooted in far-left ideology.”
For the most part, the incumbents will be at a strong advantage, but one race House Democrats could be sweating is the one for House District 128 represented by Sandersville Democrat Mack Jackson.
Jackson survived one of 2024’s squeakiest squeakers. Jackson surpassed Republican challenger Tracy Wheeler by 48 votes out of more than 27,000 votes cast.
So far, one Republican may have eyes to squeak past Jackson in 2026. Thomas Wilkerson of Warrenton has filed paperwork to run for the House in District 128.

Studies have shown that food insecurity disproportionately affects Black/African American, Hispanic/Latinx, and refugee families. Within these communities, certain groups, such as individuals with food allergies, face even more complex challenges. Not only may they struggle to secure enough food, but they must also ensure that the available food is safe for them to eat.

Idalis Cardona
Food allergies refer to an overreaction of the immune system to specific foods. Reactions can range from milder symptoms, such as hives, cough, nausea, to severe, life-threatening reactions called anaphylaxis. Avoidance of known food allergens is paramount to prevent allergic reactions. 
An estimated 32 million Americans live with food allergies; for them, food selection is not simply a dietary preference, but a critical matter of safety and survival. For low-income individuals or those experiencing food insecurity, managing food allergies adds another layer of difficulty. Allergen-free foods are often significantly more expensive—sometimes costing between two and four times what non-allergen-free foods cost—and place a significant burden on families who are already struggling to put food on the table.
In early 2024, the Commission on Women, Children, Seniors, Equity and Opportunity released its annual Food Security Report. The report incorporated public data, academic research, input from food organizations, individual experiences, and community feedback. It highlighted the added challenges faced by families managing food allergies due to limited availability and the high cost of allergen-free foods.
The report also reinforced the connection between food insecurity and poor overall health outcomes.  These outcomes are even more concerning for individuals with food allergies, as research has shown that individuals from low-income families have twice the risk of emergency department visits due to food allergies in comparison to their higher-income peers.
The report also identified several public and private initiatives that have helped address food insecurity, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), The Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program, school meal programs, food banks and food pantries. It also offered recommendations to address further food insecurity in Connecticut, including adjusting SNAP benefits, promoting universal free school meals, and supporting locally grown produce.
However, many of these programs are now at risk due to budget cuts at both the state and federal levels. Reductions in funding to SNAP, WIC, and school meal programs threaten to reverse progress and will disproportionately affect marginalized communities, including those managing food allergies. These cuts not only reduce assistance but also limit access to safe, allergen-free food options. As resources shrink, the burden on local food banks and community organizations increases, while the most vulnerable are left with fewer safe and affordable food choices.
For individuals with food allergies, access to safe food is as critical as access to sufficient food. At an individual level, we all have a role to play in fostering a more equitable food system. We can help by raising awareness within our communities, supporting organizations focused on equitable food access, and advocating for allergy-safe options in food pantries, school meal programs, and public food initiatives. 
Just as importantly, we must be creative in how we contribute, whether we actively lead initiatives, educate others, or start conversations. Small, thoughtful actions can lead to meaningful change.

DemasThe Michigan House of Representatives missed their July 1 window to get a new budget bill funding K-12 schools, but there was a chance that the chamber could pass one of several amended versions of the Senate’s school funding plan on Tuesday evening.
Members of the House, however, failed to do so after a nine-hour session that saw no movement on one of eight options to amend the Senate’s plan for the 2025-26 fiscal year.
Both parties were left holding the football and pointing fingers at the other, with Democrats blaming House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) for not speaking to them productively in weeks, and with Republicans calling out the Senate’s early departure on Tuesday as the reason nothing got done.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Earlier on Tuesday, the Democratic-led Senate adjourned and held a press conference announcing that they had no deal with their Republican counterparts in the House majority and that the budget for schools would not be passed by the Michigan Legislature’s self-imposed July 1 deadline.
In the adjacent chamber, the House was in recess but reignited caucus activity to try and see if it could get bipartisan support for a number of amendments to Senate Bill 166, the upper chamber’s school bill that passed the Senate in May. 
Hall told reporters on Tuesday evening that his plan was to give House Democrats a chance to become “relevant” in the budget process by forging a deal on the Senate bill that included some concessions on per pupil funding and putting some of the categoricals the House wanted to cut from their own K-12 bill back into the mix.
“I’ve been working on this for months to try and make sure we had everything we needed for today, to try and get it done even if it was on 30-minutes notice,” Hall said.

The speaker had earlier in the process said that he didn’t need House Democrats to be a crucial part of the budget talks and that he would forge ahead without them if necessary. That changed when the Senate went home early on Tuesday, Hall said.
Hall described his need to include them as giving Democrats an opportunity to reengage, and if they could come to a consensus and pass a substitute to the Senate bill on Tuesday, that might bring Senate Democrats back to the table.
But the speaker said Democrats did not take the opportunity and that’s when things fell apart. At about 8 p.m. – seven and half hours into the House session – Hall said it was clear that wasn’t going to happen.
Michigan Advance asked Hall why he didn’t plow ahead with a party-line vote to at least move an amended bill back to the Senate, given his previous comment on the supposed irrelevancy of House Democrats.
Hall said that wouldn’t have been enough leverage to force the Senate back into session sooner than or on July 15, when they are next scheduled to hold a session day.
Hall said he didn’t think that provided a lot of value to what they were trying to achieve, and that putting up another party-line bill would ultimately get no support in the Senate. With House Democrats involved, that could have been a different scenario.
“I don’t see how that would have brought the Senate Democrats back on July 15 to sign a deal,” he said. “I felt like once they adjourned, we had to come and get a considerable number of House Democrats to vote yes in order to create enough leverage and pressure.”
Following adjournment, state Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton), the chair of the House Appropriations Committee, issued a statement ripping the Senate for their early departure, which Republicans said throughout the evening was the reason they couldn’t continue working on a deal.
“The House was ready to dig in and get this done today, and we remain committed to approving a responsible K-12 budget as soon as possible to give our schools certainty,” Bollin said. “We’ve spent weeks negotiating in good faith with the governor’s office and the Senate, and we were hopeful about the progress being made. Unfortunately, the Senate stepped away before we could reach the finish line.”
State Rep. Ranjeev Puri (D-Canton), the House Democrat’s minority leader, essentially said that was a load of bull.
Puri blamed the Republicans for stalling all day and for not holding productive conversations with their Democratic colleagues. Puri also said that he hasn’t spoken to Hall in weeks, or at least not in any productive manner that would signal progress on the budget.

As to their relevancy in the budget process, Puri said they certainly needed House Democrats on Tuesday.
“Yet again, Matt Hall and the Republicans tried to jam through a process that should be taking months of good faith negotiations into just a couple of hours,” Puri told reporters following session. “I have not been looped into negotiations. They’re still being done in back rooms, and as we have seen today, that is a failed approach. This wasn’t a compromise. It wasn’t a negotiation. He is someone whose feelings get hurt when he doesn’t get his way.”
Puri also accused Hall of wasting his members’ time on Tuesday.
Hall, for his part, didn’t believe that the Senate would actually be back on July 15, further putting the budget for schools in limbo when they need clear plans from the Legislature on funding.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_1251-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-01 23:59:31.989999

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)After months of infighting that exposed deep fractures within the Virginia GOP, the party’s three statewide candidates appeared together for the first time Tuesday evening, projecting a message of unity at a packed rally in Vienna.
The event at the Vienna Volunteer Fire Department drew more than 500 supporters and marked a public effort to move past a bitter dispute that erupted this spring when Gov. Glenn Youngkin privately asked John Reid, the party’s nominee for lieutenant governor, to withdraw from the race. 
At the center of the turmoil was Matt Moran, a longtime GOP operative and head of Youngkin’s Spirit of Virginia PAC, who was accused by Reid’s campaign of spreading false and defamatory claims about explicit images linked to a Tumblr account with the same social media handle as Reid’s. Reid denied being tied to the account in any way. 
Despite that request, Reid took the stage Tuesday alongside Youngkin, Attorney General Jason Miyares, who is seeking re-election, and Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, now running for governor. They shared a stage on a sweltering summer evening, as volunteers handed out water bottles to attendees crowding into the fire station’s main hall.
Reid, a longtime conservative radio host and the first openly gay person nominated for statewide office in Virginia, framed the moment as a turning point.
“Call this Commitment Day,” he told the cheering audience. “I am all in for the Republican ticket of Winsome Sears for governor, Jason Miyares returning as attorney general … because the Republicans have the right policies to save the state of Virginia.”

Without referencing the recent controversy directly, Reid emphasized his credentials and long-standing work within the GOP. 
“I’m the guy, like you, who gets up early on Election Day, opens the polls, and stays until they close,” he said. “I’ve stood up for minorities, for unpopular people — and yes, even for Democrats when they’ve been wronged. I’ll do the same for you in Richmond.”
The remarks attempted to rally Republican voters behind a ticket that has been overshadowed in recent months by damaging internal conflict. 
Youngkin, who had remained largely silent during the dispute, offered a full-throated endorsement of the entire Republican slate at Tuesday’s rally — including Reid.
“It must be winning time again! Are you ready to sweep?” Youngkin shouted to the fired up Republicans in the room. “We’ve demonstrated how to win in Virginia — and we’re going to do it again this November.”
He praised each member of the ticket, calling Earle-Sears “a Marine who knows how to fight,” Miyares “the best attorney general in the country,” and Reid the right choice to break ties in a closely divided state Senate.
“There’s a lot of stuff I don’t know,” Youngkin said, “but I do know this — when there is a 50/50 tie in that Senate, John Reid is going to sign bills the right way, and say no when they’re the wrong bills.”
Miyares leaned heavily on the campaign’s law-and-order message, casting his first term as a reversal of Democratic mismanagement.
“The Virginia of 2021 was very, very different,” he said. “It was like when you watch those mafia movies and the guy wakes up in the trunk of the Buick — he doesn’t know where he’s headed, but he knows it’s not a good final destination. That was Virginia. We were dying as a state.”
Miyares credited the Youngkin administration with driving down the state’s murder rate and addiction deaths, and pledged to continue fighting crime, fentanyl trafficking and lenient parole policies.
Earle-Sears, who now tops the ticket, delivered the most fiery speech of the evening, lashing out at her Democratic opponent, former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger.
“Make no mistake about it: the ideas that my opponent has are socialist in nature,” she declared. “She is reckless and she is radical. I want to grow jobs and she wants to grow government. Folks, this is not hard. This is about freedom!”
She warned that repealing Virginia’s right-to-work laws — a position Spanberger has not openly supported either — would drive businesses out of the state.
“I am not anti-union, I am pro-worker,” Earle-Sears said. “To be pro-freedom is to be pro-liberty… Businesses will get up and go. They’re going to turn us into Maryland, New York, or California.”

And in a moment that brought the crowd to its feet, Earle-Sears rejected the notion that America is inherently unjust.
“If things are so bad, then how is it that here I am — an immigrant, a Black woman — and I am second in command in the former capital of the Confederate States?” she asked.
But Democrats were quick to dismiss the GOP’s show of unity as superficial and out of step with voters’ real concerns. 
Maggie Amjad, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Party of Virginia, said Earle-Sears’ rhetoric at the rally only underscored how closely she aligns with former President Donald Trump. 
“No matter what Winsome Earle-Sears says, Virginians know that she will always put Donald Trump’s agenda before the commonwealth,” Amjad said in a text message. 
She accused the lieutenant governor of cheering on policies that threaten Virginia’s economy and failing to stand up against cuts to Medicaid that could affect more than 300,000 residents. 
“While Virginians deserve a governor who fights for the commonwealth,” Amjad added, “Sears is dismissing workers worried about their jobs and telling Virginians to ‘wait and see’ as their healthcare is at risk.”
Still, Tuesday’s GOP rally served as a public reset for the party after an earlier unity event planned for Henrico County was abruptly canceled in May as tensions reached a boiling point. At the time, former Republican Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling was among those who publicly criticized the fallout, noting that no one had confirmed whether the explicit account in question was ever actually linked to Reid.
“It derailed what was supposed to be the GOP’s first show of unity,” Bolling said at the time.
Republican Party of Virginia Chairman Mark Peake struck a more optimistic tone Tuesday, declaring the current statewide ticket “the best since 2021” and predicting victory across the board.
“We are going to win all three statewide races,” Peake said. “There are three reasons why: Winsome Earle-Sears, Jason Miyares, and John Reid.”
For their part, the GOP party leaders appear intent on turning the page and putting the rift behind them.
“Virginia today is the very best place to live and work and raise a family,” Youngkin told the crowd. “But we have to protect that. We know how to win — and now we have the candidates to do it.”

Lisa Murkowski took questions from Alaska reporters in a 25-minute phone news conference on Tuesday addressing her “Yes” vote for the controversial budget bill – dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” – which the U.S. Senate narrowly passed, 51-50, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote. It now goes back to the U.S. House of Representatives for consideration and a final vote, in order to become law.  
The following transcript of the news conference has been lightly edited to improve readability:
Becky Bohrer, Association Press: Senator, there was a lot of attention and eyes on you. What was it that ultimately secured your vote on this bill? 
Sen. Lisa Murkowski: Well, it was an accumulation of different initiatives that we’ve been working on for a long time. I’ve been really focused on making sure that the most vulnerable in our communities are not made more vulnerable by the provisions in this bill. There’s a lot of good things in the bill, we recognize that. I wanted to get the tax cuts; I wanted to see those continued. That’s significant. There’s some good provisions on the tax side, everything from the child tax credit to some of the things with no tax on overtime, some of those things — the Coast Guard and many of the initiatives.
But the challenge was — and we saw it on the House side, and we saw it here in the Senate — the challenge is where you pay for those. And so the instruction to look to Medicaid was hard for us in Alaska — is hard for us in Alaska (with a) high Medicaid population, and high SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) population. But a reality (is) that those numbers are increasing, and so how can we make some fair and reasonable reforms. I happen to think that work requirements are not something that we should shy from. But we needed time to make them work, and it doesn’t make sense to have penalties for not complying when you’re doing everything you can do to try to make that happen. So I spent a lot of time in these areas. And we made some, I think, good headway on these. It took a lot of time, and literally, we were in the quote “Byrd bath,” where you argue matters before the parliamentarian through the middle of the night, literally going through these provisions. We had been fighting to get a significant increase in the FMAP (Federal Medical Assistance Percentage). We fought very hard, and the provision that we had written did not comply with the Byrd test, and so we had to go back and rewrite it, not once, not twice, but I think maybe three, maybe it was four times, I don’t know. Anyway, it is important to make sure that the higher cost of living in Alaska is recognized, that the cost of health care delivery is high, and that these drive up our Medicaid costs compared to the national average.
So what we ended up with early this morning, or I don’t remember when it was, some hours ago, was a provision that is not a full FMAP fix, but it is through the Rural Health Transformation Education Program, which we just call the Rural Hospital Program, we were able to “plus up” that program by doubling it. So it is now a $50 billion fund. The state of Alaska, well, all states will receive a base minimum from that fund to help their smaller hospitals. … I’m trying to read this legislative text that is all scribbled and scrawled out, so bear with me as I try to get my numbers right. But what Alaska will receive from that program is quite considerable. That, along with the opportunity for the state to receive direct support through this grant funding program under the same section there, we estimate will yield the state close to $300 million a year for the next five years. This is going to be important to us. 
We’ve got a (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) system, an IT system that we know is flawed. In fact, it has failed our state. I think it’s very unfortunate that the state has not chosen to invest in that, I think that there were some decisions made with staffing by the governor that they really kind of knocked us behind, and we’re paying for that now with a very high error rate that’s causing penalties. So what we’re trying to do is not be punitive here, but delay the implementation of the cost share for at least two years, and hopefully beyond two years. To give the state time to get the system underway, it would be a two-year delay with an additional two years — until 2030 — if the state is showing good faith efforts along the way. And so this is a commitment that the state is making. 
So that’s going to be important, because we need to get that error rate down. I think everyone wants to do that and is committed to doing that. So those are some of the things on the Medicaid side. And then again, on SNAP, it was important to get some recognition for the high cost of — just high cost of living there in Alaska, and so changing some of the formula in terms of the work requirements so that it recognizes that you have areas of the state that are higher cost, not necessarily lower density. It’s definitely not lower density.











I think quite honestly, we’ve got more work to do. I don’t know whether the House is going to accept this, and I don’t know whether the president is going to continue to demand that it be passed before the Fourth of July. I think that’s a mistake.


– U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska



	I know I sound rummy, and it’s only because I am super rummy. Haven’t slept in a long, long, long, long, long while now. But the amendment that we were able to secure on that was one that was literally presented to the floor — I don’t know what time it is now. It’s 1 o’clock, like at 11 o’clock this morning, before we went to the final passage. So what I did was I worked my butt off to make sure that Alaskans were not going to be penalized, and we’re not going to be harmed. 
This is not a perfect bill by any stretch of the imagination. I am not happy with the process. In fact, I’m really very disappointed in the process. When you’re working on major legislation like this, to be dealing with a product that you’re looking at for the first time in the middle of the night is not right. But I needed to make sure that Alaska’s interests were represented. I think I did, I think I did well by the state, in terms of trying to get these accommodations. We’ve got some flexibility working with the departments that we’ve received both from CMS (the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) and from the secretary of agriculture. But I think quite honestly, we’ve got more work to do. I don’t know whether the House is going to accept this, and I don’t know whether the president is going to continue to demand that it be passed before the Fourth of July. I think that’s a mistake. I think there is more work that can be done jointly between the House and the Senate, and I would welcome that and work that, with every effort that I can make.
Joe Plesha, communications director for Sen. Murkowski: Nobody has slept in the last 48 hours, so you have to give us a little leeway here.
Iris Samuels, Anchorage Daily News: Thank you, Senator, for taking the time to speak with us. I wanted to ask you about your support for the tax cuts that are in the bill. We heard from several groups in Alaska, including the leaders in the Alaska House and Senate, who basically criticized that these tax cuts disproportionately go to favor upper-income people across the country, and in Alaska too. I’m curious, why do you support some of the tax cuts in the bill that go towards wealthier Americans?
Sen. Murkowski: Well, what we did, we didn’t pick and choose. We basically took the 2017 tax rates and continued that. And so what we effectively are able to do is ensure that at the end of the year, when those tax cuts — which were put in place in 2017 — when they expire, people around this country at all levels do not see a huge, massive tax increase. Because that’s what would happen if we had not extended these: They all would have gone back up at all levels. So when you say, ‘Well, we’re only, we’re only thinking about the wealthy here,’Sen. (Susan) Collins (R-Maine) had an amendment to increase the highest tax rate, which is 39.5% or, excuse me, 39.6% to increase that back up to what it was prior to 2017, and direct that money to into the Rural Hospital Fund. So I recognize that the wealthiest of the wealthy — and in Sen. Collins’ amendment, she was going to get after those who earn more than $25 million a year — I think if you’re making more than $25 million a year, you’re probably not that bothered by whether you go from 39 to 41 (percent). 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXAnd so one of the things that we did try to do, also recognizing more on the lower end of the economic scale, was to advance no tax on tips. You know, when you’re working in a restaurant, you’re not making big money usually. No tax on overtime, you know, if you’re a seasonal employee, you may be making good money during the fishing season, but beyond that, to be able to have that savings is important. There is a provision for those on Social Security to be able to receive a higher deduction. The child tax credit — which, again, I think is important to families — we increased that.
So, you know, when you look just at the tax rates that are out there, that’s one thing. But it was a much, much broader package. I think much of what was advanced for our small businesses, again, is going to be welcome news in Alaska, for our small business owners and their families. So I think it was important to continue the tax cuts from 2017 to avoid really a significant tax hike to everybody.
James Brooks, Alaska Beacon: Senator, it sounded like you were able to also negotiate some changes with regard to both clean energy and North Slope drilling. What were you able to negotiate in the final bill?
Sen. Murkowski: Yeah, thank you, James. Usually I would have led off with some of the energy provisions, because, you know how I like to focus on that. But we were able to deal with some of the, I think, really harsh treatment that we had seen introduced when it came to the energy tax credits that had initially been passed through the IRA (Inflation Reduction Act). For us in Alaska, this has been quite significant. Whether you’re in a small village and you’re putting in some solar or the effort to advance more more wind, whether it’s up in Kotzebue, I mean, these are significant. And quite honestly, I was very concerned about doing any backsliding on these investments. So this was, again, a measure that I’ve been leading, or co-leading for quite some time. We made some progress. It’s not as much as I would like, on wind and solar. Because we know that even though we’re an oil and gas producing state, you’ve got to take advantage of the resources that you have around you. And if it’s wind, and if it’s solar, and it’s battery, you can make a difference in a diesel-powered community.
So we were able to get — they had planned to terminate … the wind and solar credits right away, and we were able to get that pushed back to commence construction, yeah, it’s basically a one-year safe harbor. So I would have liked if it was (extended) to the end of the calendar year, but we did get that one year of safe harbor. So we’ve looked at the Alaska-specific projects, and there are a good number of them that would qualify there. So again, it’s not all we wanted. It could have been worse. 
One of the things that I think we did that was significant, literally, the night before we took this up, an excise tax on wind and solar was inserted, literally air-dropped into the bill. Which I didn’t really appreciate, but that was stripped out completely, so at least we don’t have to deal with that.  And then on the Alaska-specific issues, we got within the NPR-A (National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska), the coastal plain (of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge), and Cook Inlet — it was additional leases in these areas. There was some language regarding terms and conditions for acreage. You know that we had been working on a revenue-sharing proposal for the state. It would have been great to have been able to keep 90-10 (split between state and federal revenue) but parts of it were “Byrd-ed” out. So we ended up with a 70-30. Now that’s a perspective going forward, so it wouldn’t come into play until year nine of this bill. So I don’t know what year that is — 2034, OK. And even though it is prospective, this is on all of the, on all of these areas within NPR-A, coastal plain and Cook Inlet that we will have the 70-30 revenue sharing.
James Brooks, Alaska Beacon: Joe, is it possible that you or someone else on staff could get us the language around the SNAP changes for Alaska and any Medicare changes?
Joe Plesha: You bet.
Sen. Murkowski: James, I think what we need to do, because so much of this literally was laid down publicly for the first time within, I mean, just about six hours ago — so there’s a lot of this that folks just don’t have, much less been walked through. And so I think what we need to do is just put together a list for you. I think that that would be helpful, because Alaskans want to know, and I think that we can make that available for you.
James Brooks: That would be great, I’d appreciate that, because I think there’s a lot of uncertainty. I’ve had state legislators texting me and say, “Hey, can you let us know? Because we need to budget for these changes.”
Sen. Murkowski: Yes, and that has been my concern throughout, and that was why it was so important to get the delay. Because if you are looking at, you know, a $40 million hit, and it’s coming next year, that’s attention-getting. And fortunately for us, there is a two-year delay. And then again, if we are making progress towards reducing that (SNAP) error rate and coming into compliance, we can get a delay until 2030. So that gives planning time. And then with a couple hundred, you know, $300 million practically, coming to the state, granted, in different funds and pots. But that’s what we need to be doing – working with the Legislature and getting the commitment from the governor that you’re going to address this, so that we don’t pay because we continue to have a higher penalty due to the error rate. So we got to get that rate down. But that’s going to require people working at the Division of Public Assistance. It’s going to require work by the state to go out in these communities and be effectively a community navigator to help people understand that. 
Now you know these are how you have to account for meeting these work requirements. So the more time we can get to this, the better it is. And the more the state will be able to plan. And my hope is that it’s not just delaying a bad price tag, but that we will be able to really get our numbers down, and so we’re not paying for the penalties. We are working to make sure that eligible Alaskans are able to qualify for the benefits that they and their family need.  
All: Thank you.

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Provisions in the new tax and spending bill passed by the U.S. Senate early Tuesday would go even further than the House bill in removing health care and other benefits from immigrants with legal status.
The House version of the massive tax and spending bill penalized states providing health care for some immigrants with legal status as well as those that chose to spend state money to enroll immigrants without legal status in Medicaid.
But the Senate bill is even tougher on immigrants here legally and illegally, reducing benefits for most refugees and immigrants on humanitarian parole, including Afghans and Ukrainians who helped the United States in wars overseas and in return were promised safe haven and a safety net in the United States.
The Senate bill also cuts state reimbursement for emergency care in the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That would force those states to pay more for emergency care for immigrants, cut back services or drop out of Medicaid expansion, a potentially catastrophic move for low-income U.S. citizens as well as new immigrants.
The bill passed with three dissenting Republican votes, from U.S. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Vice President JD Vance broke the tie. The bill, officially the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” now returns to the House for final passage before going to President Donald Trump to be signed.

Advocates and experts see repercussions as refugees and other legal immigrants lose health insurance and turn to already-stressed hospitals and charities for help. It could be a nail in the coffin for some rural hospitals that are in financial trouble and scaling back services. Hospitals are required to serve anyone who arrives for emergency care, regardless of their ability to pay.
“In our state, it’s going to be absolutely devastating for rural hospitals,” said Kate Woomer-Deters, a senior attorney at the North Carolina Justice Center’s Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Refugees are not going to go home just because they lost their health care coverage. They’re still going to be showing up at the door of hospitals and clinics needing care.”
Some groups, such as Afghans, Ukrainians and Iraqis, were often brought here after helping the U.S. in war efforts, putting their lives in danger and making life in their home country untenable.
“In the case of the Afghans, this is pretty much a knife in the back to those folks who helped the United States when the United States needed help in their country,” said David Meyer, a board member of the Bloomington Refugee Support Network in Indiana, where he personally helps seven refugee families from Afghanistan, Honduras, Iraq, Nicaragua and Syria.
The Senate bill takes Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and even food stamps off the table for most refugees. There are a few narrow exceptions for people with green cards, some Cuban migrants waiting for citizenship, and some Micronesians and Marshall Islands natives with treaty rights, said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
That also applies to immigrants with legal status who don’t have green cards: people with asylum, immigrant victims of domestic violence, immigrant victims of sex trafficking and parolees — such as Afghans — admitted due to urgent humanitarian reasons, as well as to refugees.



It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.


– Shelby Gonzales, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities


“There’s going to be more emergency health care needs because uninsured people will be delaying care,” Gonzales said. “It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.”
The bill also cuts funding for expansion states to pay for emergency care in hospitals. Increased costs could force some states to drop Medicaid expansion altogether, spreading the pain to low-income U.S. citizens as well, Gonzales said.
“It’s one more reason states are looking at their budgets and they’re having to make decisions about their Medicaid expansion program,” Gonzales said.
In Indiana, Meyer said, Afghan women especially often need food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to get by at first. It takes them a long time to learn to read and write since they were not allowed to attend any school under the Taliban.
“They arrived in our community totally illiterate in their native language and starting from scratch learning English, so that’s a huge impediment to being gainfully employed,” Meyer said. Even once they’ve become self-sufficient enough to get off food stamps and Medicaid, many still need the support of the Affordable Care Act to get health care.
Removing all subsidized health care “would have a devastating effect on those families, and not just Afghans but Syrians, people from the Democratic Republic of Congo and others that have been relocated to south-central Indiana,” Meyer said.

Indiana hosted more than 10,500 of the nearly 460,000 refugees who arrived in the United States between 2013 and 2023, according to a 2023 report from the nonprofit Immigration Research Initiative. In fiscal 2024, another 1,380 arrived in Indiana, mostly from Congo and Burma, but including 90 people from Afghanistan, according to State Department records.
In North Carolina, there were 276 new Afghan refugees in fiscal 2024 among 2,730 total new refugees. Even professional Afghans such as doctors and lawyers struggle at first in low-wage jobs, said Woomer-Deters, of the North Carolina Justice Center. It takes time for them to get accreditation and language skills to practice their professions here, she said.
“A lot of these folks need their food stamps, Medicaid — they need these programs for an adjustment period when they get here. And these are people we’ve invited to come and have vetted,” she said.
A Congressional Budget Office report June 29 estimated that almost 12 million people, including 1.4 million immigrants covered by state-only programs, would lose health insurance under the Senate plan.
A Republican response to an earlier CBO report emphasized that the bill would save states $13.1 billion in Medicaid spending over 10 years, “freeing up resources they can choose to reinvest to further strengthen care for the most vulnerable Americans.”
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, however, called that conclusion misleading in its own response in turn.
“These savings would largely result from millions of people losing health coverage — hardly an outcome worth celebrating,” the response said.

Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, said there was one small positive change in the Senate version compared to the House version.
States will no longer be penalized for using the option to cover some immigrant children and pregnant women.
And the Senate version would not penalize expansion states for offering Medicaid to immigrants on humanitarian parole, but only because that help for parolees was ended in entirely, along with help for refugees and other kind of immigrants with legal status who lack green cards, Cuello said.
“In other words, they are blocking all paths to health care,” Cuello said in an emailed statement. “This is not an attack on the undocumented. It’s an attack on lawfully present immigrants.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-07-02 01:59:29+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,"Tackling housing costs, smart use of AI among top priorities for Mass. business leaders",JD Chesloff and Lisa Murray,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/tackling-housing-costs-smart-use-of-ai-among-top-priorities-for-mass-business-leaders/,"
If we move quickly and collaboratively, Massachusetts has the chance not just to adapt to the new environment—but to lead, and find opportunity in these uncertain times.
The post Tackling housing costs, smart use of AI among top priorities for Mass. business leaders appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","MASSACHUSETTS WAS RECENTLY ranked as having the best economy in the country by WalletHub, which cited our investments in both industry and academic R&D, and leadership in innovation, workforce, and technology as factors leading to “big payoffs in economic growth.”   
In a recent survey of members of the Massachusetts Business Roundtable – CEOs and senior executives from some of the largest employers throughout the Commonwealth – business leaders similarly cite access to world class talent, industry clusters, and research institutions as important factors influencing their decisions to grow and invest in Massachusetts.  
Yet the survey —conducted annually for the past five years in collaboration with McKinsey & Company—also found cracks in our foundation, primarily due to the high cost of housing, cost of doing business, and the quality of our infrastructure, all made worse by federal policy uncertainty.  
More than 84 percent of employers expect national challenges to worsen the state’s economy, citing the threat of recession, the impact of trade and tariffs, and changes in federal policy as top concerns. The uncertainty caused by the constant churn of federal policy change has caused a quarter of respondents to put new investment and hiring decisions on hold, and more than half tabling plans to move, expand or change their footprint in the next year. 
Housing, in particular, is top of mind, with 74 percent of respondents indicating that it is negatively impacting their ability to recruit and retain talent. The most cited challenge in recruiting was employees’ higher expectations for compensation due to the high cost of living, and 73 percent of employers have already increased compensation as a result.  
The cost of living has become a cost of doing business issue in Massachusetts. Over 85 percent of employers now report having at least some staff based outside Massachusetts—up from approximately 75 percent last year and 70 percent the year before. Hybrid and remote work have become lasting elements in the talent strategy playbook. 
To address these headwinds, employers are embracing more talent-friendly policies and deploying AI to continue boosting productivity. More than half are increasing salary and benefits, offering professional development opportunities, and settling on flexible, hybrid work arrangements. In fact, 90 percent do not expect any additional changes in their work model. Regarding AI, more than two-thirds of employers are focused on AI and technology solutions to improve performance. Notably, more than 80 percent believe AI will actually support hiring and retention in Massachusetts. 
The key takeaway from this year’s survey is that in these uncertain times, there is great opportunity to think and collaborate in new and innovative ways. AI adoption, for example, is scaling rapidly, with 35 percent of respondents anticipating AI being a top trend impacting their business over the next year, up from 23 percent last year and 11 percent the year before.  
Half of the survey respondents see expanding workforce development programs to build a stronger AI talent pipeline and continuing to foster AI adoption in key industries as the greatest opportunities for Massachusetts. The Massachusetts AI Hub, created through the MassLeads Act, is already helping to jumpstart implementation of many of these strategies, and the Business Roundtable is working closely with them on education and workforce strategies. 
The Roundtable recently partnered with Citizens to convene a discussion at MassChallenge on “Future-Proofing Massachusetts’ Innovation Economy.” In a flash poll at that event, nearly three-quarters of the audience said they think the region already has the talent it needs to boost innovation, but panelists noted that the region is losing talent as founders start companies here but grow them elsewhere. That means the challenge, and the opportunity, are clear. The state has a robust pipeline to build on, and we need to be intentional about how we continue to do so. 
There is also opportunity to foster new partnerships and alliances of unlikely allies coming together to solve problems. Nearly three fourths of Roundtable members surveyed expressed interest in partnering with other companies and/or state government to tackle competitiveness challenges.  
In areas of AI adoption, workforce development, and job creation, there is the opportunity to, as one Roundtable member said, “reset the working relationship between companies and the state, so that each side contributes to problem solving together.” In Massachusetts, this is what we do – and have always done – best. 
In that spirit, the Roundtable recently joined with our colleagues from the Associated Industries of Massachusetts, Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, and Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation to come together around a framework of competitiveness, convey our urgent focus on ensuring that Massachusetts can compete in an increasingly uncertain global economy, and offer our continued collaboration with state policy makers “as we pursue our shared goal of making Massachusetts a highly desirable place to live, work, and do business.” Encouragingly, productive conversations with the Healey-Driscoll administration and Legislature have followed.   
The vulnerability of the foundations of the Massachusetts economy, and the uncertainty of the moment we are in, is unsettling and threatening. This moment demands that private and public sectors collaborate as we conceive of new and innovative ways to keep Massachusetts competitive.  
As a Roundtable member urged, “The federal government’s retreat from key sectors, while very regrettable, gives the state an opportunity to step up and be a national leader in global industries, secure our leadership role in life sciences, and work together toward establishing the state as a leader in areas such as clean tech and AI.”  
If we move quickly and collaboratively, Massachusetts has the chance not just to adapt to the new environment—but to lead, and find opportunity in these uncertain times. 
JD Chesloff is the president and CEO of the Massachusetts Business Roundtable, a public policy organization comprised of CEOs and senior executives from large employers across the Commonwealth with the mission to make Massachusetts the most desirable place to live, work, and do business. Lisa Murray is the Massachusetts state president for Citizens, and chair of the Massachusetts Business Roundtable board of directors.

Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski joined 48 other Republicans in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday to pass a major budget bill that cuts federal assistance programs in order to partially pay for the extension of large tax cuts, weighted toward the wealthy.
Even with those cuts, the bill is expected to increase the national debt by more than $3.2 trillion over the next 10 years.
The final vote was 51-50, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tiebreaker. Republicans hold 53 seats in the Senate, but three Republicans joined all of the Senate’s Democrats in voting against the bill, requiring Vance’s tiebreaking act.
The U.S. House may vote on the Senate bill as soon as Wednesday. If it approves the bill, it would go to President Donald Trump, who supports it. If the House votes down the Senate proposal, lawmakers would have to craft a compromise between the Senate bill and one passed earlier by the House.
Murkowski had been considered a deciding vote on the Senate version of the bill. By phone, she said an “accumulation of different initiatives” caused her to vote for it.
She wanted to see the continuation of tax cuts, enacted in 2017 during the first term of President Donald Trump.
“I wanted to see those continued. That’s significant,” she said, emphasizing that the cuts affect all income levels.
She cited as an example an extension of the child tax credit, which lowers taxes for families with children, and no taxes on overtime or tips. Both of those items made it into the bill.
“The challenge was — and we saw it on the House side and we saw it here in the Senate — the challenge was, where do you pay for those?” Murkowski said.
Health care bound for cuts, but Alaska could be shielded
For senators, Medicaid cuts were a partial answer. 
Roughly 1 in 3 Alaskans receives health care through Medicaid, a federal-state program for people with low incomes, as well as the primary payer for most nursing home residents. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive think tank opposed to the big bill, estimated that 35,000 Alaskans would lose health insurance if the bill becomes law, both from Medicaid and from a scaling-back in tax credits to pay for individual health insurance.
Sullivan said he believes estimates of the cuts’ effect are inaccurate when it comes to Alaska.
For example, one change would effectively lower payments to providers by reducing a tax on providers that is reimbursed by the federal government. 
“We are the only state that doesn’t use provider taxes or state directed payments, so the Medicaid programs and federal funds that the state receives are not impacted by the provided tax reforms in this bill, because we don’t do that,” he said.
Murkowski and Sullivan sought more than $6 billion in Alaska-specific Medicaid funding to offset any remaining consequences here, but those provisions were rejected by the Senate’s parliamentarian as violations of the rules, known as Byrd rules after the senator who sponsored them.
“We fought very hard, and the provision that we had written did not comply with the Byrd test, and so we had to go back and rewrite it, not once, not twice, but I think maybe three, maybe it was four times,” Murkowski said. 











I had a little bit of a dark night of the soul when that happened.


– U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, on the removal of an increase in federal Medicaid payments in Alaska



	Sullivan said he repeatedly tried to get approval for an amendment that would increase the federally paid portion of Alaska’s Medicaid program, but Democratic senators objected to that idea, causing the parliamentarian to review and reject it.
“I had a little bit of a dark night of the soul when that happened,” Sullivan said.
In the end, Alaska will share a $50 billion rural hospital fund. Murkowski said that and other funding in the bill would result in about $300 million per year to the state, partially offsetting the cuts in the bill.
Sullivan suggested the figure may be closer to $200 million.
That money could prevent five Alaska hospitals — in Valdez, Seward, Kodiak, Cordova and Ketchikan — from closing because of the cuts within the bill. All five were among 338 nationwide considered to be at risk if the bill becomes law.
Adult Alaskans who receive Medicaid will be required to work, volunteer or undergo job training for at least 20 hours per week unless they are sick, have children or care for older people.
Sullivan said he supports that requirement and noted that Alaska Natives are exempt, as are people who live in places with high unemployment, have mental health problems or are pregnant.
New limits on food aid for poorer Alaskans
The bill imposes work requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as food stamps, and it requires states to partially fund the program.
Alaska will be exempted from that state cost share for two years, Murkowski said, and if the state continues to reduce the number of applications flagged for errors — the highest in the country — that pause could be extended.
“I worked my butt off to make sure that Alaskans were not going to be penalized and were not going to be harmed,” she said.
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimated that without the pause, Alaska would have to pay $37 million per year to keep food aid steady.
The federal government already mandates that “able-bodied adults” work in order to receive food aid, and the new bill extends that requirement to people as old as 64, up from the current age-54 limit.
Parents with children under 14 are exempt, as are pregnant people, Alaska Natives and people “medically certified as physically or mentally unfit for employment.”
Other Alaska additions
Parts of the bill add a new tax exemption for Community Development Quota fishing groups and increase a federal tax deduction for whaling captains.
The bill contains more than $7 billion for Coast Guard icebreakers and $300 million to homeport a newly purchased civilian icebreaker commissioned into Coast Guard service. That ship is expected to be based in Juneau.
The bill mandates four new oil and gas lease sales in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and it requires other sales in Cook Inlet and the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. 
A growing proportion of the North Slope’s oil production is coming from NPR-A, rather than state-owned land near Prudhoe Bay. Two previous ANWR lease sales have drawn little interest from oil and gas companies.
Seventy percent of rental and royalty payments from NPR-A and ANWR lease sales would go to the state government, starting in 2034. That’s up from 50% currently.
An earlier version of the bill had 90% of the revenue going to the state.
Voice of the Arctic Iñupiat, a North Slope nonprofit that supports oil drilling, praised the new leases, while Sovereign Iñupiat for a Living Arctic, which opposes drilling, denounced them, as did various environmental groups.
The final version of the bill eliminated a Republican proposal to tax new solar and wind power plants, and it allows new clean energy facilities to claim federal tax credits as long as they begin construction in the near future.
“We’ve looked at the Alaska-specific projects, and there are a good number of them that would qualify there,” Murkowski said. “It’s not all we wanted. It could have been worse.”
A prior version of the bill would have ended the tax credit incentives immediately.
Sullivan had doubts, too
While Murkowski has been dubbed the deciding vote on the bill, any other Republican senator could have killed the bill, including Sullivan.
Until senators added the energy provisions and the SNAP and Medicaid carveouts for Alaska, Sullivan was undecided about whether he would vote for the bill, said his spokesperson, Amanda Coyne. 
When the Senate failed to adopt his proposal to increase the federally funded share of Alaska’s Medicaid program, Sullivan said he was enormously disappointed.
“I’m not sure it was a moment where I was going to say, ‘I’m not going to do this,’ but it was a moment of enormous disappointment. … I feel very passionate about it, and I was close, and it slipped away from me.”
Planned Parenthood medical services cut
A non-Alaska-specific portion of the bill bans Medicaid from paying for any services at Planned Parenthood.
Rebecca Gibron, CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky, said by email that the provision puts millions of lives at risk across the country.
“Our health centers save Alaska nearly $5 million each year by preventing unplanned pregnancies, catching cancers early, and controlling the spread of STIs (sexually transmitted infections). Stripping that care away, especially now — amid rural hospital closures, a maternal mortality crisis, and a deepening provider shortage — would push an already broken system past the brink,” she said. 
Asked about that section, Sullivan said he thinks Alaskans have other options, such as hospitals and community health centers. 
Community health center leaders also have expressed concern about the bill’s effect, citing the loss of Medicaid revenue on their ability to maintain services.
Bill heads to U.S. House next
The Senate’s approval of the big budget bill isn’t the last step in the process. The U.S. House will vote as soon as Wednesday on whether or not to adopt the Senate’s proposal.
If the House votes it down, lawmakers would have to negotiate a compromise between the Senate version of the bill and one passed earlier by the House.
Murkowski said she hopes the House votes down the Senate version, allowing further work.
“I had to look on balance, because the people in my state are the ones that I put first,” Murkowski told reporters on Capitol Hill immediately after her vote. “We do not have a perfect bill by any stretch of the imagination. My hope is that the House is going to look at this and recognize that we’re not there yet.”
That remark drew criticism from Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Massachusetts, during a hearing of the House Rules Committee later in the day. That committee met for a procedural vote to advance the Senate bill toward a vote on the House floor.
“My question to her is, if you really believe that, why the hell did you vote for this bill? It doesn’t make any sense. It’s a dereliction of your duty as a United States senator and a representative of the people of Alaska,” said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Massachusetts. “When was the last time this current House of Representatives has fixed or solved anything?”
A spokesperson for Rep. Nick Begich III, R-Alaska, said the congressman’s office was still reviewing the Senate’s changes and didn’t have immediate comment.
Begich voted in favor of a prior version of the bill despite a campaign pledge to seek reductions to the federal debt.
In a phone interview afterward, he said he doubted the figures provided by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
A vote in the House could come this week. Trump has been asking lawmakers to vote before they leave for the Fourth of July holiday.
“To my GOP friends in the House: Stay UNITED, have fun, and Vote “YAY.” GOD BLESS YOU ALL!” Trump said on social media after the Senate voted.

(Photo by Ryan Berry/Washington state Standard)Washington and Oregon’s attorneys general are suing the federal government for sharing residents’ Medicaid records with federal immigration enforcement officials.
Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield and Washington Attorney General Nick Brown, alongside 13 other Democratic state attorneys general, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday challenging the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for sharing Medicaid patients’ files with the Department of Homeland Security, where Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, is housed. The Health and Human Services Department, it’s secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and the Homeland Security Department and it’s secretary, Kristi Noem, are listed as defendants.
California Attorney General Rob Bonta is leading the lawsuit, which also includes the attorneys general of Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island.
The state attorneys argue that sharing personal health data violates federal administrative procedure laws and federal privacy laws. States are asking the court to block any new transfer of data, and the use of any data currently held by Homeland Security and ICE for immigration enforcement purposes.
Since Congress established Medicaid seven decades ago, “federal law, policy, and practice has been clear: the personal healthcare data collected about beneficiaries of the program is confidential,” officials from Brown’s office said in a news release.
On June 13, the state attorneys general learned through news reports that officials at the Health and Human Services Department transferred Medicaid data files to ICE officials. Those reports indicate that the federal government plans to create a database for mass deportations and other large-scale immigration enforcement purposes, Brown said in a news release.
“Washington residents expect that the confidential information they give to the government to access medical treatment will only be used for healthcare purposes,” Brown said in a news release. “Their data should not go towards creating a giant database of Americans’ personal information or used so that ICE can deport undocumented immigrants because they had to go to the doctor.”
Oregon and Washington are among seven states that offer Medicaid to eligible adults regardless of immigration status, and are among 14 states, plus Washington, D.C., that cover children regardless of immigration status. Oregon has 100,000 people enrolled in its “Healthier Oregon” program, a state-funded program which provides access to Medicaid coverage regardless of immigration status, according to the Oregon Health Authority. About 49,000 people of the nearly 2 million people in Washington who rely on the state’s Medicaid Program Apple Health have an immigration status that makes them ineligible for federal funding.
“This has a chilling impact on people who need healthcare in our country,” Rayfield said in the news release. “Parents may choose not to take their kids to the doctor because they’re afraid of what may happen. We need to protect the privacy and dignity of every person who calls Oregon home.”

The heart of the nearly 1,000-page legislation extends and expands the 2017 tax law to keep individual income tax rates at the same level and establishes permanent tax breaks for business investments as well as research and development costs. The tax cuts are estimated to cost nearly $4.5 trillion over 10 years.
The bill also blocks Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood and shifts significant costs of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to states for the first time. Sustaining Georgia’s current SNAP program is projected to cost the state $812 million annually.
Because the bill was amended in the Senate, it will have to return to the House for another vote before it can advance to the president’s desk.
  Sen. Jon Ossoff condemned the GOP’s signature tax break and spending cuts package, which narrowly passed the Senate after more than 24 hours of continuous debate. Screenshot.
Georgia’s two senators, Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, condemned the bill’s passage, and urged members of the House to oppose the legislation.
“The Senate just voted for legislation that will kick millions off their health care, close rural hospitals, and increase health care costs for everyone, all to give billionaires a tax break,” Warnock said in a statement. “Today’s vote is a disappointing reminder that Washington politicians aren’t working for ordinary people.”
Ossoff, who is running for re-election in 2026, also emphasized the impact that the bill’s cuts will have on Georgia’s access to health care across the state.
“This bill is a trillion dollar cut to Medicaid,” he told reporters shortly after the bill passed out of the Senate. “Seventy percent of Georgia seniors in nursing homes are on Medicaid. Half of all births in Georgia are covered by Medicaid. Forty percent of all children in Georgia are covered by Medicaid, and I have been warning for months that this gutting of the Medicaid program puts Georgia seniors, Georgia mothers, Georgia children at risk.”
Reduced access to health insurance coverage is one of the biggest factors opponents of the bill have seized on, and one that could have downstream effects throughout America’s entire health care system. According to a report from KFF Health News, an estimated 310,000 people across Georgia would lose access to health insurance by 2034 under the bill, due to changes the bill imposes on both Medicaid and Affordable Care Act coverage. That number could rise to 750,000 if Congress allows enhanced tax credits for those insured through the ACA to expire this year.
Health care experts also warn that the bill could have devastating consequences for Georgia hospitals, particularly those in rural areas, where health care providers rely on funding from Medicaid to sustain their facilities.

According to a report from researchers at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, four hospitals in rural Georgia are at risk of reducing services or closing altogether under the megabill: Fannin Regional Hospital in Blue Ridge, Flint River Community Hospital in Montezuma, Irwin County Hospital in Ocilla, and Washington County Regional Medical Center in Sandersville. Three of those hospitals are in districts represented by Republican congressmen who voted in favor of the bill.
Last week, the Georgia Hospital Association signed a letter alongside hospital associations from 13 other states urging Senator Majority Leader John Thune to preserve and strengthen Medicaid in the Senate’s version of the legislation.
“Stable funding is vital not only for serving Medicaid beneficiaries but also for providing care to all patients, including the uninsured, those with commercial insurance, and our seniors and disabled patients on Medicare,” the letter states. “Severe cuts to Medicaid inevitably would lead to cuts in healthcare services for all Americans.”
Though the bill was later amended to include a $50 billion fund to support rural hospitals, critics of the bill worry that the money will not be enough to offset the strain rural providers will face due to sweeping Medicaid cuts. Rural hospitals in Georgia are projected to lose $540 million over the next 10 years, according to a report from the American Hospital Association.
The House is expected to take another vote on the bill this week to meet President Donald Trump’s imposed July 4 deadline for passing the legislation. However, if the House amends the bill further, it will have to return to the Senate for another vote.

John McCosh/Georgia RecorderThis coverage is made possible through a partnership between WABE and Grist, a nonprofit environmental media organization.
After six bill increases in the last three years, Georgia Power rates will now stay the same for the time being. 
Under a deal approved Tuesday by the Georgia Public Service Commission, Georgia Power’s rates will stay the same for the next three years, though the deal does not include some costs, which could still cause bills to increase next year.
“The rate freeze resulting from this plan is a great result for customers,” Georgia Power CEO Kim Greene said in a statement, “balancing the mutual benefits of extraordinary economic growth among all stakeholders and helping to ensure that we remain equipped to continue supporting growth in this state.” 
Under the agreement reached by Georgia Power and the commission’s staff and later cosigned by the Georgia Association of Manufacturers and Utility Management Services, the base rates that help determine power bills will remain the same for three years – except for the cost of recovering from Hurricane Helene, the most damaging storm in Georgia Power’s history. 
Georgia Power is also scheduled to review the cost of fuels such as coal and natural gas next year, which could also drive bills up – though company officials said lower fuel prices could lead to lower bills, or at least cancel out extra costs from Helene. 
“Customers have seen unprecedented inflation in the energy sector across the U.S.,” said commission chair Jason Shaw in a statement. “My fellow Commissioners and I urged staff and Georgia Power to come to some agreement where base rates would not increase. This is nothing but good news for Georgia Power ratepayers.” 
Some critics were less certain. The rate freeze deal bypasses the typically intensive, months-long process of setting rates, during which interested parties – including energy and consumer advocates, municipalities, large power users like MARTA and Walmart and even the federal government – comb through Georgia Power’s finances and proposals. Without those hearings, some have argued, it’s impossible to know if the rate freeze is the best possible deal for customers.
“Every day Georgians cannot be on the hook for Georgia Power’s data center spending spree,” said Bob Sherrier, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, in a statement. “The next three years are very consequential for the electric grid and deserve much more scrutiny than occurred here.”  
Critics of the deal also worried that “rate freeze” is a misnomer because of the adjustment for storm costs that will happen next year. Others raised concerns that by deferring costs to keep rates the same now, the plan will result in an even larger rate hike in 2028. 
Georgia Power officials denied both concerns in hearings last week. They argued that lower fuel costs could balance out the storm costs, leaving rates the same or even lower, and that savings from cost deferrals would extend beyond the next three years.
Commissioner Bubba McDonald objected to the current power rates – the rates now being extended – when they were approved in 2022 because he felt Georgia Power’s profits were set too high. He reiterated that objection Tuesday and proposed a motion to lower the utility’s profit cap, but no other commissioners seconded the proposal and it died without a vote.
In the end, McDonald joined his fellow commissioners in voting for the rate freeze, and it passed unanimously.

Additional orders are expected to follow to replace more than a dozen other aging vessels in the fleet. (Photo by Tom Banse)For the first time in more than 50 years, Washington State Ferries will contract with an out-of-state shipyard to build new vessels. 
Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson made the final call to accept the low bid from Florida-based Eastern Shipbuilding Group to build three new hybrid electric ferries, each capable of carrying up to 160 cars and 1,500 passengers. The vessels will replace aging boats in the state fleet.
Ferguson passed over a considerably more expensive bid from in-state shipyard Nichols Brothers Boat Builders. Whidbey Island-based Nichols Brothers and a range of allies from around the north Puget Sound lobbied the governor unsuccessfully to split the contract for the new ferries to secure local jobs and boost the region’s shipbuilding industry.
“After careful consideration and conversations with legislative leaders, I believe Eastern is the best option to build these critically important vessels at a fair cost to our taxpayers,” Ferguson said in a statement Tuesday afternoon.
The state accepted Eastern Shipbuilding’s bid of $714.5 million for three new ferries, with deliveries estimated to begin in 2029. 
However, the total cost to taxpayers will be much higher because the state plans to purchase the hybrid electric powertrain separately and made allowances for construction oversight, early delivery incentives and change orders. Ferguson’s office said this brings the cost of the first vessel to approximately $405 million, the second to $360 million, and the third to $325 million. The cost and risks decrease with lessons learned from each previous build.
Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, supported Ferguson’s decision to go with the low bid.
“The budget constraints we face — combined with rising construction costs driven by tariffs and inflation — mean we must make the most of every taxpayer dollar to deliver the ferries we urgently need,” he said, adding it won’t be the last boats built. “I’m confident Washington’s shipbuilders will have many more opportunities to compete for and win future contracts.”
Civic and business leaders in Washington urged the governor to choose Nichols Brothers and its sister yard, Everett Ship Repair, arguing that Ferguson should consider the jobs that would be created and economic benefits derived from using an in-state contractor. 
“This is very disappointing news for the working men and women in Snohomish and Island counties and the state of Washington,” said Ray Stephanson, president and CEO of Economic Alliance Snohomish County.
The Washington Legislature previously set aside about $1.3 billion to build new ferries over the next six to eight years. Money is not the only consideration. The ferry system and the state’s Democratic leadership want to reduce the ferries’ air pollution footprint by switching to battery propulsion as much as possible, too.
Eastern Shipbuilding Group submitted the low bid for the state’s desired plug-in hybrid vessels, according to a summary of the bids posted by Washington State Ferries in mid-May. The price tag (without the state-supplied powertrains) was roughly in line with the state engineer’s in-house estimate.
The Panama City, Florida-based company has experience building car ferries for numerous other governments, including in North Carolina, Florida and the Staten Island line in New York. The three new Staten Island ferries were delivered late due first to hurricane damage in 2018 to the shipyard and then to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Nichols Brothers submitted a competing bid that was considerably higher, even after including a 13% credit authorized by the Legislature to incentivize home state construction.
A third shipbuilder, Philly Shipyard, was expected to bid, but didn’t in the end. Seattle shipyard Vigor Marine, which built all of the state’s new ferries since the late 1970s, also chose not to bid. After the state got to loggerheads with Vigor over a ferry construction contract extension around five years ago, the Legislature directed the ferry system to solicit bids from shipyards nationwide for the first time in decades.
The Nichols Brothers and Eastern Shipbuilding bids both included escalator clauses that state House Transportation Committee Chair Jake Fey predicted in May would push prices higher. The escalators put Washington taxpayers on the hook to pay for unpredictable cost increases, such as rising steel prices or tariffs.
‘Real disappointment’ at in-state shipyard
Nichols Brothers CEO Gavin Higgins said his company would not appeal the contract award to his Florida competitor. But he made it clear in an interview Tuesday that he felt “real disappointment” that the state missed the boat to grow its shipbuilding industry and invest in the next generation of apprentice builders.
“We’ve lost the opportunity to hire over 1,300 people and bring them to work. Who’s going to do it now,” Higgins said.
In May, after the state made the ferry bids public, Higgens wrote a follow-up letter to Ferguson to propose a split contract. He laid out a “best case scenario” in which Eastern would build two new ferries in Florida and Nichols Brothers would simultaneously build two more in-state. Higgins said a good chunk of the added cost of building in Washington would be offset by tax collections on the business activity generated by the enhanced local shipbuilding industry.
“I think we made a pretty strong case,” Higgins said, before adding that the “headwinds” posed by the state’s union-level wage and apprentice utilization requirements, small business and veteran set-asides, strict environmental rules and a mandatory DEI officer added costs that could not be overcome.
Cost roughly tripled over past seven years
The 144-car Suquamish was the most recent of the workhorse Olympic-class ferries upon which the new plug-in ferry design is based. The diesel-powered Suquamish was delivered to WSF in 2018 at a cost of about $122 million. Debate about how to proceed with further vessel acquisitions in that size class has stretched from then until now. 
During this dickering, the state pivoted to electrification, costs shot up and the reliability of the existing aging fleet went down.
The bid request published by WSF included the high-level design for a plug-in ferry. Drawings show 460-foot-long boats that resemble a slightly elongated version of the diesel-powered Olympic class ferries delivered between 2014 and 2018. However, the new design has just one passenger deck stacked on top of the two auto decks.
The center of the ship’s hold will be packed with racks of water-cooled rechargeable batteries so the ferry can sail fully on electric power most of the time. The engine room will also feature twin diesel generators as a backup source of propulsion. 
Assuming they use green electricity to charge, the new ferries should achieve a large reduction in fuel consumption and an associated reduction in global warming emissions.
WSF tentatively plans to deploy the new ferries to the Mukilteo-Clinton run first, probably followed by the Seattle-Bremerton route.
What about cheaper options?
Republicans, who are in the minority in the Legislature, pushed unsuccessfully for a cheaper diesel ferry option to be put back on the table. Washington State Ferries leaders have been consistent in warning against reverting to conventional diesel power because that would necessitate a lengthy redesign and re-bid.
BC Ferries has also been in the market for new car ferries and has been able to acquire new vessels at far lower cost. Unlike Washington State Ferries, BC Ferries can solicit bids from shipyards worldwide. This past month, the privatized provincial ferry company stirred considerable controversy at home by announcing it would contract with a Chinese shipyard to acquire four large new car ferries. BC Ferries declined to specify the price, but made clear that no other bidders came close to the cost savings the Chinese state-owned yard offered.
Building ferries to serve domestic U.S. routes at a foreign shipyard is prohibited under a century-old federal law known as the Jones Act. 
Of late, the Trump administration and a bipartisan contingent of lawmakers in Congress have highlighted the need to make the American shipbuilding industry more competitive. But President Donald Trump’s recent statements on the matter make no mention of jettisoning the longstanding made-in-America requirements.
Washington State Ferries currently has 21 vessels of various sizes and ages in its fleet, making it the largest public ferry system in the nation. The agency’s long-range plan contains a goal to grow to 26 ferries to provide reliable service on every route, with allowances for maintenance tie-ups and a vessel in reserve. 
This summer, the ferry system will get nearly back to operating its full pre-pandemic schedule, missing only a second boat on the Port Townsend-Coupeville run during midweeks and the long-suspended international crossing to Sidney, B.C.

(John Cole/Capital-Star)Amy Brickner, a third-generation dairy farmer and owner of Destiny Dairy Bar in Cumberland County, has been able to partner with the Safe Harbour shelter in Carlisle over the past two years to provide milk to people in need. 
The effort is part of a federal initiative known as the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program or LFPA.
Brickner opened the Dairy Bar in 2022 and says it accounts for 10% of her farm’s market share. She looks at the initiative as a win-win.

“At the beginning, I was dumping a lot of milk, and then I started getting pigs. And so I was able to feed the milk to pigs. But it was still bottles and labels and labor that went to waste that didn’t get used,” she said. “So, I was approached by a friend of mine….(who)  got me hooked up with Safe Harbor. They would come out here once a week, and any milk that was close dated, but it was still shelf stable for another week, it would go to that program, and they would give it to their residents.”
The program was established under President Joe Biden’s administration in 2021 as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. At least 189 Pennsylvania farms, just like Brickner’s, are participants and provide products to 14 food banks across the state.
Last December, the Biden administration announced that its contract with the commonwealth was being renewed for three years and $13 million. LFPA has provided nearly $30 million in funding to participating Pennsylvania farms to provide fresh, locally grown products to food banks since 2022, according to Gov. Josh Shapiro’s office.
However, the Trump administration announced in March that they were ending the program, arguing it was created via executive authority under the previous administration and “no longer effectuate the goals of the agency.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
As a result, Brickner says it’s been more difficult to make ends meet as well as contribute to the shelter and the Salvation Army.
“I’m very strapped from a cash flow standpoint, not having that extra 10% come in has been pretty tough,” Brickner told the Capital-Star. “It’s hard to pay my bills sometimes, and I’ve bootstrapped this all on my own.”
Brickner said she’s still donating milk to Safe Harbour every other week, despite the cancellation of the program, because the connection “has been so amazing.” She vows to continue to do so until she can’t make it work economically.

Shapiro, state Agriculture Sec. Russell Redding, and all four chairs of the General Assembly’s agriculture committees (two Republicans and two Democrats), visited Destiny Dairy Bar this week to tour the farm, tout the benefits of the program, and urge the Trump administration to reconsider cancelling it.
“I think it’s important to note that we are all here together,” Shapiro said. “We work together closely to support agriculture in Pennsylvania, and we have all stood together in supporting the LFPA program, which is incredibly important to support places like this and the food banks that they provide their product to.”
“This is an example of what should be occupying people’s attention, Republicans and Democrats working together to support one of the principal industries,” he added. 
Since the cancellation of the program, Shapiro has been front and center at various locations throughout the commonwealth detailing his support for it. The LFPA initiative works as a reimbursement program and the state doesn’t get the federal funding until after it pays farmers and provides receipts.
Early last month, Shapiro announced that his administration filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Harrisburg asking a judge to reverse the federal Department of Agriculture’s decision to cancel its contract with Pennsylvania.
“We had to pursue a legal remedy. I wish we didn’t, and we’re going to work through that process,” Shapiro told reporters on Monday.
A USDA spokesperson previously told the Capital-Star, shortly after the lawsuit was filed, that the agency does not “comment on pending litigation,” and directed inquiries to the U.S. Department of Justice.
Shapiro has said the LFPA funding represents between 10% and 15% of the annual market share for  a lot of other participating farmers.
State Sen. Judy Schwank, a Democrat and minority chair of the chamber’s Agriculture and Rural Affairs Committee, said that in her research, the Helping Harvest food bank serving Berks and Schuylkill counties has lost about 15% of the funds they were previously receiving as a result of the cancellation.
On June 18, Rep. Dan Moul, a Republican from Adams County and minority chair of the House Agriculture and Rural Affairs Committee, penned a letter with the signatures of the other chairs of the Ag panels to the state’s congressional delegation. It urged them to push the federal government to reinstate the funds.
“Given the administration’s stated commitment to supporting small farmers and improving public health through better nutrition, we believe the LFPA program clearly aligns with national priorities and should be continued,” the letter reads.

Moul said that “this program should have been left intact.”
“We all need agriculture. We all need the help, and we need to put this funding back where it belongs,” he added.
Speaking to the Capital-Star following the tour, Moul stressed the chairs of the committees that were on hand are not part of the lawsuit filed by the Shapiro administration, but took part to discuss the benefits of LFPA.
“We’re here to say this is a vital program for Pennsylvania,” Moul said. “Pennsylvania agriculture and the food banks, and in the scheme of things, the money that was taken away is such a small speck in comparison to our federal budget.”
“Why take it away?” Moul added. “It’s agriculture. It’s food. It’s not money being wasted. This money goes to a good, good cause, and it helps people.”
Shapiro has previously said the state doesn’t have the money to backfill the federal cuts, if the lawsuit is unsuccessful.
Moul told the Capital-Star that the legislature could pass a resolution asking the federal government to restore the funding, noting the bipartisan support outlined in the letter should resonate with the state’s congressional delegation.
“I know when they got that letter, when their staff got that letter, they said, ‘Hey, all four chairman of agriculture here in Pennsylvania want this funding put back. Let’s fight for it,’” Moul said. “And that’s what we’re hoping for.”
Moul said that he’s good friends with U.S. Rep. John Joyce (R-13th Distric), and that if he doesn’t see action soon, he will lobby on behalf of restoring the program.
“I will call him personally and say, ‘Hey, John, I want you to do me a favor. Would you go, would you go to D.C. and fight to get this funding restored?’”” Moul said. “I think that’s where a hatchet was used and when it should have been a scalpel.”

Conversations around the reconciliation bill have dominated the discourse for members of the U.S. House and Senate over recent weeks. Noting that, along with the letter only being sent recently and the holiday weekend coming up, Moul said that federal lawmakers have other things on their mind.
“But as soon as that’s over, as soon as the holiday’s behind us, that’s when we’re going to have to pound on it a little bit more,” Moul said. “I’ll start making phone calls.”
Another influential member in regards to agricultural policy at the federal level is U.S. Rep. Glenn ‘GT’ Thompson (R-15th District). The Centre County Republican serves as the House Chair on the Committee on Agriculture.
Moul said that he’s friends with Thompson as well and said he’d contact him.
“He has a lot of pull,” Moul said. “Getting the funding restored, I think we can make it happen.”
Other elected leaders are also optimistic that the program will return.
“I think you know my track record on these legal processes,” Shapiro said. “We win these, because the law is on our side.”
“They had a contract with the good people of Pennsylvania. This was a clear three-year contract,” he added. “They broke it four months in, and I feel confident that we’re going to get there at the end of the day.”
Brickner said she has faith in the lawmakers taking on the fight to ensure she can continue to assist those in her community who are in need, without her business suffering financially.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/dairy_cows_carlisle_720.jpg,,,2025-07-01 21:03:02.603047

With many national parks facing huge backlogs of deferred maintenance — Yellowstone National Park alone is estimated to have more than $1 billion — the federal government is proposing a new fee on foreign visitors to address some of the shortfall. 
The idea, which has long been championed by a Bozeman nonprofit, is part of preliminary 2026 budget documents for the Department of the Interior that simultaneously includes vast budget cuts for various departments, including the Naitonal Park Service. 
The National Park Service budget shows a request for just $2.1 billion, cutting roughly a third of the agency’s 2025 budget. 
But among the streamlining efforts listed in the budget documents, the federal government is proposing to establish a new fee for foreign visitors to some NPS sites, estimated to generate upwards of $90 million “to keep national parks beautiful.”
“An international surcharge is a compelling point because you can raise prices for that cohort, who by definition are spending a lot of money to travel to our country to see these ‘bucket-list’ destinations,” said Tate Watkins, a research fellow at the Property and Environment Research Center. “If you think of the overall trip budget, the gate fee is a small portion of that. It isn’t likely to deter a huge number of people.”
Last year was the busiest on record for the NPS, with more than 331 million visitors spending time at the 433 NPS units, including historic sites, battlefields and monuments, in addition to the 63 national parks.
The increased traffic at the nation’s crown jewels have added to a deferred maintenance backlog of nearly $23 billion to maintain roads, buildings, utility systems and other facilities across the park system. 
One method to address that backlog at individual park sites is to consider changing the fee structure charged for visitors at the entrance gates. 
Only 106 of the 433 sites managed by the NPS charge entrance fees, ranging from $10 per person to $35 per vehicle, with annual pass options available. There is no differentiation between U.S. residents and foreign visitors.
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said during a House Committee on Natural Resources hearing earlier this month that the Park Service is “way undercharging” international visitors. 
“We’ve done a study on what gets charged if you’re going to go see the gorillas in Rwanda or go to the Galapagos Islands … there could be a billion-dollar revenue opportunity, without discouraging visitors,” Burgum said. “That revenue, if it could be redirected back towards deferred maintenance, staffing, a number of things we could do, that would be fantastic.”

The Galapagos Islands cost $200 for foreign tourists, while Ecuadorian adults pay $30.

Watkins said PERC, a Bozeman-based a “free market environmentalism” nonprofit think-tank, has advocated for changes to the NPS fee structure for years.
“There’s a lot of common models where we do this kind of thing anyway,” he said. 
Watkins pointed to states that charge different resident and nonresident fees for hunting and fishing licenses and similar structures for accessing state parks. 
In Montana, residents pay a $9 fee with their annual vehicle registration, which covers access to all state parks for the year. Nonresidents, however, are charged an $8 daily entrance fee with a vehicle ($4 to walk or bike in) or $50 for an annual pass. Camping at a state park costs $12 more per night for nonresidents. 
The same model could easily be applied nationally. 
“The status quo is not one of sustainable and proper management of these sites,” Watkins told the Daily Montanan. “The current model just doesn’t keep up with it.” 
In a report released in 2023, Watkins looked at potential revenue streams from charging international visitors additional fees. 
Using NPS data showing baseline entry fee revenue of $349 million, PERC calculated a $16, $25 and $40 surcharge for foreign visitors, with an estimate that the surcharge would correspond with a roughly 3% decrease in visitation. 
The smallest surcharge would generate an additional $211 million annually, while the highest would bring in $528 million — more than doubling the current revenue. 
The current system is relatively blunt — there are lots of margins you can refine in a logical way,” Watkins said. “That’s where I think you can see big changes happen.”
  Doubling Yellowstone’s fee revenue 

A new report, authored by University of Wyoming economist Steve Newbold and published by PERC last week, focused on that nation’s oldest national park, Yellowstone, which saw 4.7 million visitors last year, roughly 15% of which came from other countries. 
  A chart showing possible scenarios of increasing entrance fees at Yellowstone National Park. Graphic by PERC
The park’s entry fee is $35 per vehicle, per week, with 80% of fee revenues retained at the park to be spent on visitor experience improvements. Park Service data shows entry fees generated roughly $14.2 million annually for the park in recent years. 
The report looked at six different fee structure scenarios and compared the elasticity of demand — how much impact a higher fee will have on visitation — with the increased revenue. 
Scenarios included charging all visitors an additional $5 to enter the park; exempting locals but charging all other visitors an extra $10; and various levels of international fees.
Charging foreign visitors a $20 surcharge is estimated to decrease visitation by 13,000, but generate an additional $11.9 million — an 84% increase from 2024 gate revenue. 
Bumping the international fee to $100 per person would rake in $55.2 million, with a roughly 57,000 decrease in visitors. 
Adding just a $5 per person fee to all visitors to Yellowstone would more than double the revenue from entrance fees.
“In some places you’re hard pressed to find a cup of coffee for five dollars,” Watkins said.
And while that doesn’t make up for the park’s $1.5 billion maintenance backlog — the most of any national park according to the report — it would help, Watkins said. 
“I think you could probably ask the superintendent, and he’d say if we can get closer to the maintenance backlog with fee revenue, that would be great,” he said. 
Watkins said that PERC is excited that the federal government is considering different models of fees for national parks, and that it might take some time to get it right. 
“You’re probably not going to get something that works perfectly the first time,” he said. 
But the whole point is the status quo is not sustainable, Watkins said, and the agencies in charge need to think about what they can do to put the future of the park system in a better position.

“A well-funded park that can maintain its trails, protect its wildlife, and conserve its natural wonders will continue drawing visitors for generations—securing the economic lifeline that sustains surrounding communities,” the report states. “The choice is between short-term thinking and long-term prosperity for both the park and the region.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Yellowstone-National-Park-sign-1024x645.jpg,,,2025-07-01 21:03:02.603047

(Photo by Karen Kasmauski/Getty Images)The federal government’s program that gives payments to people sickened by nuclear weapons testing is one step closer to being reauthorized and expanded. 
On Tuesday, Senate Republicans passed their massive tax and spending package, nicknamed the “big, beautiful bill” — among its many provisions is an expansion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, or RECA, which expired more than a year ago.  
If the bill clears the final vote needed from the House, downwinders in all of Utah will now receive compensation for their medical bills, marking a significant change to the program that advocates say was too narrow to begin with. 
Here are the RECA highlights, found in the final pages of the Senate’s 887-page bill:

Downwinders in all of Utah, New Mexico and Idaho would now be eligible for payments. Coverage would also be widened in Arizona to include all of Coconino, Yavapai, Navajo, Apache, Gila, and Mohave counties. Residents who lived in certain parts of Missouri, Tennessee, Alaska and Kentucky who were sickened due to the Manhattan Project would also receive coverage.
The program’s new expiration date would be Dec. 31, 2028. 
In some cases, people who lived in affected areas for just one year would be eligible for compensation — the program previously required they live there at least two years.  
The compensation amount — originally $50,000 to $75,000 — would be increased to $100,000 in most cases. 
Uranium miners and workers based in Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Wyoming, South Dakota, Washington, Utah, Idaho, North Dakota, Oregon and Texas would be covered. The timeframe of eligibility would also be extended to 1990 (previously, just uranium workers in Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Wyoming and Utah were covered, with a timeframe ending in 1971).

“RECA is generational legislation for Missouri and will finally deliver justice for survivors in the St. Louis region,” said Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley, who sponsored the provision. “I call on the House to quickly pass this legislation and send it to President Trump’s desk.” 
RECA expired in June 2024 after Congress failed to reauthorize it, and in the year since, downwinders who were just recently diagnosed with cancer or who didn’t know about the program were left without compensation.
The program had been in place since 1990, but downwinders have long said it should be expanded. Despite studies suggesting the entire West was blanketed by dangerous levels of radiation during nuclear tests, downwinders in just 10 counties in Utah, as well as a handful of counties in Nevada and Arizona, were covered. 
News that RECA was one step closer to revival was met with mixed reactions on Tuesday from Utah downwinder Mary Dickson. A longtime advocate for RECA expansion, Dickson said it was “bittersweet” — if the bill passes the House, she’ll finally be eligible for coverage, after being diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 1985. 
But Dickson and other advocates hoped a RECA expansion would be broader, covering all of Nevada, Arizona, Montana, Guam and other places impacted by Cold War weapons testing.

“Obviously I’m happy to see more downwinders covered. I’m very happy to see that. But I’m also heartsick to see that so many others that we’ve been fighting with in this battle for so long are left out,” she said. “It feels a bit like a hollow victory to me.” 
Last year, Hawley sponsored a bill that would expand the program to cover much of the West, and parts of the St. Louis area, where creek water was contaminated by radiation during nuclear weapons development. The bill passed the Senate but stalled in the House, mostly over spending concerns. 
It’s not yet clear whether RECA has the support needed in the House to withstand the final vote. The New York Times estimates that the current proposed expansion will cost about $7.7 billion.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-522294832-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-07-01 20:03:45.697863

(Photo by Amanda Mustard for the Pennsylvania Capital-Star).Pennsylvania would ban the sale of firefighting foam containing so-called forever chemicals that have polluted groundwater in dozens of sites across the state, under legislation passed unanimously Tuesday in the state House.
The bill’s prime sponsor, Rep. Brian Munroe (D-Bucks), spoke on the floor about the illness and fear across his district as a result of drinking water polluted by firefighting chemicals used for decades at the former Naval Air Warfare Center in Warminster Township.
“Over those decades, Warminster and the surrounding communities grew. To provide water to these new communities … millions of dollars were spent on our public water system. As of 2015 the Warminster Municipal Authority served over 30,000 residents in Warminster alone.”
That’s when testing alerted officials and residents to the presence of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known as PFAS, in groundwater that was being drawn from municipal wells and used in the community’s public water system. Warminster had three of the most polluted wells in the nation, Munroe noted.
PFAS are human-made chemicals that have also been used since the 1940s in a wide range of products including nonstick and weather-resistant coatings. Because they are slow to break down in the environment, PFAS have been dubbed forever chemicals and are found in the blood of people and animals around the world.

In addition to the cost of finding a new, safe source of drinking water, people were overcome by worry that the pollution was the cause of illness among neighbors throughout the community and that it could affect them in the future. 
“I can tell you from the thousands of conversations with parents and residents in the township, everyone has a story of cancer clusters in my neighborhood,” Munroe said. “I have heard of nightmare stories of children diagnosed with rare cancers. I have shared hugs with more people than I can count who have been recently dealt with the blow of receiving a cancer diagnosis — the horrific fear that hangs over every single street in Warminster Township.”
Munroe has been diagnosed with cancer twice himself, he said. While his family underwent blood testing to detect levels of PFAS in their bodies, Munroe said he was not tested because he is a firefighter. 
According to the National Institutes for Health, exposure to PFAS is an occupational hazard for firefighters. Sources include foam containing PFAS, but also turnout gear that contains the chemicals to make them more water and dirt resistant. Munroe’s bill would require manufacturers to label personal protective equipment that contains PFAS.
“We owe it to our fellow firefighters to allow them to make educated decisions about the PPE they use and the risk involving and being exposed to PFAs in firefighting gear,” Rep. Gregory Scott (D-Montgomery) said. “They deserve to know that the gear they’re using could potentially impact their health later in life.”
Because PFAS were flagged as cause for concern only in the last two decades, it’s still unclear how harmful these chemicals are, but scientific studies have repeatedly shown exposure imay be linked to harmful health effects including cancer, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Also used in foaming agents used to fight fires involving aircraft and aviation fuels, PFAs contamination is commonly found in groundwater in the areas around military bases. That includes the Naval Air Warfare Center in Bucks County, where the U.S. Navy began testing new aircraft and systems in the 1940s through the 1990s.
According to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, PFAS have been found in at least one location in 19 counties. The EPA adopted drinking water regulations for six PFAS in 2024. It set the maximum contaminant level for two of the most common PFAS at 4 parts per trillion.
Munroe’s House Bill 1261 would ban the sale of firefighting foam containing PFAS, starting in 2026 and would ban the use of such products in 2027, with exceptions for federal requirements.
It would task the state fire commissioner with identifying alternative products and working with the DEP to dispose of leftover PFAS products after the ban takes effect. The bill would require the DEP to take and investigate complaints of violations and refer any  offenses to the state Attorney General. Violations could carry civil penalties of $5,000 to $10,000, which would be used for fire company and emergency medical service grants. 
H.B. 1261 now goes to the state Senate for consideration.

Josh Kassmier, R-Fort Benton, with his stack of bills at the end of the 69th Montana Legislature. (Keila Szpaller/Daily Montanan)The problem didn’t start this year. In fact, it probably started, like so many things, around the COVID-19 pandemic when lawmakers had to figure out how to hold legislative meetings safely, without the spread of the virus.
But as the Montana Legislature has seen a record number of bill drafts, more interim committees in between legislative sessions, and implementation of a new database because the longtime computer server was nearly dead, the number of compensatory hours, — or additional work hours — Legislative Services Division employees have banked has ballooned to more than 15,000 hours.
The issue, first reported by the Montana Free Press, can be broken down in a number of ways. For perspective, 15,000 hours is roughly the equivalent of two-years’ worth of time. In a state department that numbers around 100, that translates to an additional work-month of time off for the average full-time employee, although the director of Legislative Services, Jerry Howe, notes that the comp time is not necessarily evenly distributed among all of its employees.
However, the burgeoning number of comp-time hours is an issue that continues to grow, and recently Howe and the Legislative Council, the bipartisan committee that manages the operations of the Legislature, met to talk about how to meet the challenge.
Comp time, which is used as a benefit to fairly treat staff members during the long and sometimes grueling legislative session held every two years for 90 days, is a tool to avoid what would be either an oversized staff or exorbitant overtime.
However, Montana law caps comp time at 120 hours per employee, Howe explained, and at the end of the year, any comp in excess of the equivalent of three full-time weeks off is wiped out, essentially shorting employees who have worked the hours but didn’t get compensated. That thought keeps Howe up at night.
“It’s not just that this happens every two years, for a busy session. It’s that we have people who work here their entire careers. Employee morale is my top concern,” he said. “I’ve got to figure out how we get our staff time to decompress, recharge the batteries and enjoy this beautiful state we all love.”
Montana Senate President Matt Regier, R-Kalispell, said that he wants to make sure the state is fair to its employees who have worked such long hours at the behest of the lawmakers.
“They deserve to either have the vacation time or a buy-out,” he said.
One of the other compounding factors in this comp-time puzzle is that the additional time is already on top of normal benefits, like personal time off or vacation time.
  More work, same staff 

The causes for the comp time conundrum are multi-faceted: High numbers of bills introduced, high number of amendments, extra committees during the interim, and new technology, including remote meetings that take considerably more time and expertise to run.
For example, two special committees created after the 2023 session included one established to consider voting regulations and another to look at the state’s judiciary, a top priority for the Republican majority. Then, there was a special committee during the 2025 session that investigated former Senate President Jason Ellsworth for ethical violations. Howe told the Daily Montanan that the committee took huge staff time, amounting to more than 1,000 hours after it was completed.
During session, the Legislative Services Division wrestled with a new database to track and display the committee meetings, all the bills and their respective amendments. It replaced technology that had been in use for nearly two decades, but was on the verge of failing after the original software developer said that it would no longer be supporting it, causing Howe and his information-technology team to begin migrating to a new server and software that would normally be a four-year process. Instead, his team attempted to do it in 14 months.
Also, a lawsuit now before the Montana Supreme Court regarding whether junque files, which are the drafting files kept by Legislative Services for every bill and resolution introduced, are part of Montana’s public records. That lawsuit, which is being litigated in part by a coalition of media, including the Daily Montanan, has also taken considerable time, Howe said — one of many atypical but not necessarily rare occurrences that has contributed to the increase in comp time.
“None of those things can be put off,” Howe said. “One thing that impresses me about the Legislative Services staff is how dedicated they are to the legislators and the legislative process.”
Howe said Montana has experienced busy legislative sessions previously. It has experienced busy interims — the time between the legislative sessions. But, it has never experienced busy times back to back to back, seemingly without an end. That trend, Howe said, is new.
  No one solution, but several possible solutions 

Howe also identified four different options or “levers,” the Legislature has to address the problem, including adding full-time staff; buying out compensatory time; limiting the number of interim studies; or limiting the number of bill drafts or changing rules about bills requiring legislative hearing.
“We have these different levers we can pull, and we have to decide which ones to pull and when, and it will probably be a combination of all of them,” Howe said. “You don’t get into this situation with one really busy interim or one long session. They build up. They accrue.”
Previously, the Legislature has considered “buying back” the comp time, Howe said, but that measure failed this session. In 2023, the Legislature spent $325,000 to buy down comp time. This session, there was a proposal for “buying back” another $300,000, but that failed.
Regier has been both the Senate’s top leader as well as a former Montana Speaker of the House. As a part of the Legislative Council, he said lawmakers from both parties are wrestling with this issue.
He said unexpected things, like the thousand-plus hours of work for the “Ellsworth investigation,” were unforeseen.
“I hope to never have another ethics committee meeting again,” he said.
Instead, Regier said the problem of too much work is something that is being created by the Legislature, therefore the solution probably lies within the Legislature, as well.
He said that legislative leadership needs to better prioritize bills and amendments to bills — which take top priority during the busy legislative session.
“Our legislative staff has delivered. They have an incredible work ethic,” Regier said. “Sometimes, our lawmakers don’t know what they’re asking.”
For example, holding a remote session can take days of advance notice and technological hurdles for the IT department in order to ensure that public participation, mandated by state law, can be available virtually anywhere in the state.
Regier said even some very small changes could make big impacts. For example, as the legislative session winds down, some lawmakers have less to do — no new bills to introduce. Instead, they begin proposing topics for lawmakers to study when the Legislature is not in session. And the number of study bills and topics has ballooned. Regier suggested that simply walking back the deadline for interim study bills could help lighten the workload.
  Not just Montana 

Howe, who has worked for the Utah Legislature and stays in contact with counterparts from other states, especially those in the West, says the problem is one that many western states are experiencing as national issues bleed down into state politics.
Howe said that in a place that prides itself on being a “citizen Legislature,” many Montana lawmakers aren’t experts in law or even how state code works. Sometimes, ideas from constituents come to Legislative Services scrawled on the back of a napkin or scratch paper. But taking those ideas and changing laws through the state’s code can take weeks or months, even for ideas that seem straightforward.
“These ideas seem so easy,” Howe said. “But most people just don’t have the understanding of how laws relate to one another and how they are organized in code. Public policy is not a simple endeavor. If it were, we would not need to meet constantly and continuously.”
Some of the increase in work is also natural, Howe said. Montana, like many other states in the West after COVID, is growing. And that growth can challenge laws or aspects that haven’t been touched for years — if not, decades.
“The policies of the 1940s and ‘50s don’t work anymore, and the policy needs to adapt to that environment,” he said.
Some of the work increase is also related to term limits. Many lawmakers request fewer bill drafts and have a better handle on state law the longer they serve in the Legislature, Howe said. However, with term limits, legislative staff is often re-teaching or explaining the legal and legislative process to new members.
“People kind of hit their stride when they’re nearing the end of their limits,” Howe said.
Howe would love to believe that the long hours and the complex back-to-back-to-back sessions and their interims were an outlier, but he said as the appetite to legislate continues to be brisk, driven in part by national politics, he is also looking ahead. And Montana, like many other states, may be called into special session to patch budget holes created by Congress.
If that happens, there’ll be a sort of double-whammy: More demand for legislative services and less time to spend down comp time.
“We don’t know what is in the ‘big, beautiful bill’ and how will affect us,” Howe said. “But cuts in Congress could mean a special session in Montana as well as other states.”
And that translates to more staff time for Legislative Services.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_4046.jpg,,,2025-07-01 20:03:45.697863

DemasMichigan State University will eliminate staff and faculty positions as part of the “next steps” the university will follow amid current financial issues.
In a public letter delivered by President Kevin M. Guskiewicz to the MSU faculty and staff, he argued these future job cuts that are starting in July will follow “external pressure” to the university finances.
“Today, Michigan State faces external pressures such as rising employee health care costs and increased operating costs due to inflation,” Guskiewicz said in the letter.
He also wrote the university is being affected by research state funding cuts and restrictions on international enrollments as part of general funding cuts from the federal government.
Guskiewicz added the future position layoffs come along with tuition increases which are part of the university’s “effort” to manage a 9% spending reduction of the general budget.
“As we’ve worked to reduce general fund spending by 9% over the next two years, I’ve appreciated the efforts of our colleges and units to prioritize non-personnel budget reductions,” Guskiewicz wrote.
  Michigan State University President Kevin Guskiewicz speaks at the Mackinac Policy Conference, May 30, 2024 | Anna Liz Nichols
It wasn’t specified in the letter which positions or how many workers will be directly affected.
He pointed that these budget and staff cuts should not impact important student services such as police, food service, and payroll. However, it was not specified the academic impact on MSU students.
‘Unfortunately, we will still have to eliminate some positions, the extent of which will vary by colleges and units. Although many units looked first to identify existing vacancies that could not be filled, there also will be some direct reductions in currently filled positions,” Guskiewicz wrote.
He also wrote that MSU will work with employee unions and offer benefits to those affected such as voluntary retirement incentive plans for some tenure track faculty and employee assistance program.
A request for comment on the specific impact on the MSU community was sent by the Advance to a university spokesperson, but has yet to be returned.

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)A proposed constitutional amendment aimed at protecting direct democracy in Arkansas was rejected a second time Tuesday by the state’s attorney general because it failed to comply with a new law that prohibits ballot titles from being written above an eighth-grade reading level. 
Approved by state lawmakers in April, Act 602 prohibits the attorney general from certifying a proposed ballot title with a reading level above eighth grade as determined by the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level formula. The test uses word complexity and sentence lengths to calculate what grade of education is needed to comprehend written material.  
According to Tuesday’s opinion, which was prepared by Assistant Attorney General Kelly Summerside and approved by Attorney General Tim Griffin, the latest ballot title proposed by the Protect AR Rights coalition ranks at a 9.3 reading level. While closer than the 11.5 level assigned to the original submission, Griffin said it still doesn’t meet the requirements of the law.
Arkansas group refiles direct democracy ballot measure after AG rejection

The Arkansas Ballot Measure Rights Amendment would amend Article 5 Section 1 of the Arkansas Constitution, the section that governs the state’s initiative and referendum process. It would designate the right of voters to make and repeal laws by petition as a “fundamental right.”
Among its various provisions, the measure would explicitly prohibit Arkansas lawmakers from amending or repealing a constitutional amendment approved by voters, require voters to be notified if their petition signature will be disqualified and given an opportunity to correct any problems, and require signatures to be gathered from at least 15 counties instead of 50.
A lawsuit challenging the 2023 law that increased the threshold from 15 to 50 counties is awaiting a judge’s decision following an October hearing. David Couch, a Little Rock attorney representing the plaintiffs, filed a letter Monday requesting that the case’s new judge issue an order or schedule another hearing soon.
Conflicting language regarding the measure’s provision on collecting signatures from 15 counties is another reason Griffin cited for Tuesday’s rejection. The attorney general said he suspects that sponsors intended the measure’s language to require signatures from at least 15 counties and to prevent any law that would require signatures to be gathered from more than 15 counties, but that’s not what was written.
“Rather, your proposed language requires that signatures be gathered from at least 15 counties, and it requires that the signatures be from no more than 15 counties,” Griffin wrote. “In other words, the signatures must come from exactly 15 counties.”
Griffin said this language is inconsistent with another provision in the proposal as well as the ballot title. Because this “key ambiguity” prevents the attorney general from ensuring the ballot title is not misleading or from substituting a more appropriate ballot title, Griffin said he could not certify the proposal.


Let us know what you think...


 

Gennie Diaz, a member of the Protect AR Rights coalition, said in a statement that the group “remains committed to safeguarding Arkansans’ rights to participate directly in the democratic process.” 
“We are reviewing the Attorney General’s feedback, and our drafting team will revise and resubmit the measure without delay,” Diaz said. “As we’ve previously stated, we believe the 8th grade readability requirement conflicts with our legal obligation to provide voters a clear and accurate ballot title — a concern we are addressing through ongoing litigation.”
Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids, another ballot question committee pursuing an education-focused constitutional amendment, are trying to challenge the eighth-grade reading law by intervening in a federal lawsuit that challenges several other new laws governing the state’s direct democracy process.
Court filings reveal opposition to intervening motion in Arkansas direct democracy lawsuit

Supporters of the new laws have said they will ensure the integrity of the initiative and referendum process, while opponents have argued the laws will make it more difficult for citizen-led initiatives to qualify for the ballot. 
The direct democracy process allows Arkansans to propose new laws or constitutional amendments and put them to a statewide vote. Arkansas is one of 24 states that allows citizen-led initiatives, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
The League of Women Voters of Arkansas filed the lawsuit against the secretary of state in April. The League proposed its own direct democracy-related ballot measure this year that was thrice rejected by the attorney general, including once for violating the new reading-level law. Griffin substituted and certified the popular name and ballot title so it met the eighth grade-reading level requirement in May. The League has begun gathering signatures to try to place its measure on the 2026 ballot.
In response to the motion, both the League and the state argued in court filings that Protect AR Rights lacks standing and is not entitled to intervene in the case. A judge has not yet ruled on the motion to intervene.

Over 800 people – including nearly 300 children – were slated to exit the program on Tuesday, as an executive order that extended their stays expired, according to data provided by the Department for Children and Families.

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin and VTDigger reporter Greta Solsaa, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.

Chris Duprey was looking for a tent. One large enough to shelter his fiancée, his toddler and his 6-year-old kid.
It was time to check out of the Motel 6 in Colchester, where the family had lived for the better part of a year. They lost their manufactured home to the flood that swept through Plainfield last July, Duprey said. And now, the motel voucher that had allowed them to stay here was expiring.
“I’m hoping for a prayer right now,” said Duprey, 47, as he lingered in the motel parking lot on Tuesday morning. Packing up the room proved too painful. “We need a prayer.”
This latest round of evictions from the motel program has specifically targeted families with children and people with acute medical needs, like those who are homebound or receiving cancer treatment. It is the result of the expiration of an executive order that extended motel stays for those groups, deemed by Gov. Phil Scott’s administration as the most vulnerable to harm if they lost shelter.
Over 800 people – including nearly 300 children – were slated to exit the program on Tuesday, according to data provided by the Department for Children and Families. (An additional 138 people were scheduled to exit the program between June 23 and July 1 because their vouchers had timed out, according to the department.)

A back injury Duprey suffered after a fall while on a construction job had left him unable to work – and addicted to painkillers. He and his partner, Jessica Delary, 31, each had a criminal history stemming from a period when both struggled with substance use disorder, which proved a barrier to getting an apartment, he said. 
But for over a year, both Duprey and Delarey had been in recovery. They were focused on staying clean for the sake of their kids. Last month, their toddler had celebrated his first birthday at the motel where he’d spent most of his life, with a little party under the trees at the edge of the asphalt. They had recently landed a rental voucher, and were waiting to hear if a landlord they’d spoken to would accept it, but nothing was final.
By 11 a.m., the couple had decided to pay $80 out of pocket to stay at the motel one more night. They’d been calling around to service providers trying to find a tent, and hadn’t landed one yet. Purchasing one themselves would eat into the $900 a month they survive on from state welfare funds. And then there was the cost of paying for a campsite with water and electricity during the peak summer season.
“We can’t even afford a campground,” Duprey said.

State action 
The executive order, signed by Gov. Scott in late March, granted a three-month extension for families with children and people with acute medical needs who were sheltered in motels “to allow time for DCF to ensure” they have access to services and supports needed to transition to a long-term housing, shelter, or health care placement.
Without the order, those groups would have faced eviction when the motel program’s more flexible winter rules ended for the season in April. Democratic leaders in the Legislature had sought an extension for everyone sheltered through the program at that time, but Scott, a Republican, twice vetoed their effort – opting instead to protect a much narrower cohort his administration deemed most vulnerable. 
Yet homelessness advocates had not anticipated a mass exodus upon the executive order’s expiration. Because the order stated that existing time limits on motel stays “shall be waived” between April and June, they expected people would have more days left to use after the order lifted, forestalling the next wave of evictions until later this year.

But DCF sent out notices in early June specifying that nights sheltered under the order would in fact count towards each individual’s 80-day clock.
In recent days, service providers, Burlington city leaders and several lawmakers have issued letters to Scott imploring him to rescind those early-June notices, effectively giving motel residents more time in shelter. They have also called upon the governor to declare a state of emergency and direct officials to create shelters for people exiting the motels, among other demands.
So far, Scott has not taken action. A spokesperson for his office told VTDigger/Vermont Public in mid-June that he did not intend to extend the executive order.

Miranda Gray, deputy commissioner of DCF’s economic services division, said in an email that the department is encouraging people slated to lose their motel rooms to connect with local housing agencies. State employees and contracted case managers “have been working with the households housed under the [executive order] to identify plans for July 1st,” Gray said. 
DCF has not provided data on how many households it has helped ensure alternative accommodations for past June 30.
Last fall when Vermont saw a wave of families evicted from motels, the state opened a new family shelter at the Waterbury Armory. State officials shut it down on June 13. Asked if officials are considering reopening the shelter, Gray said that “all potential opportunities, including those involving existing facilities, are considered as part of this ongoing effort to expand safe and appropriate shelter capacity.”
Overnight parking and tents 
In at least one instance, a municipality is preparing to offer a sanctioned location for people to park their vehicles and sleep overnight.
On July 4, the city of Burlington will begin allowing up to twelve vehicles to park overnight at Perkins Pier, at the foot of Maple Street along the city’s waterfront. Individuals will need to get a permit from the city by noon on the 3rd in order to begin using the site the following day, said Sarah Russell, Burlington’s special assistant to end homelessness.

Those interested in using the site can reach out to Russell directly at 802-829-6326 or srussell@burlingtonvt.gov Monday-Friday. People will need to vacate the lot during the daytime. The city plans to install an ADA-accessible porta-potty onsite, but the site does not have access to electricity or running water. 
Russell called the sanctioned parking area a “pilot” project and a “harm reduction strategy.” Last fall, the city offered campsites at North Beach to families exiting motels, but now the popular campground is booked for the season, she said.
In Burlington and elsewhere, service providers are handing out tents to people in need.
At the Econo Lodge in Rutland Tuesday morning, Brenda Siegel, executive director of End Homelessness Vermont, offered supplies for people exiting the motel voucher program like tents, sleeping bags, blankets and tarps that the organization had purchased.

End Homelessness Vermont and other emergency providers have been “repetitively drained” after each motel exit, Siegel said. The need around the state far outweighs the resources the organization has available to give to the unhoused, she said.
“Their likelihood of survival is not high. I think they should at least have the right to get to and through a fair hearing to appeal this,” Siegel said. “Our system is failing, because it really means that it’s impossible for people to argue for their rights, and that’s not what should be happening right now. We should have a system that works.”
Casey Stevens, 38, of Rutland, said she had been staying at the Econo Lodge for six months after staying at hotels through the motel voucher program intermittently for a year and half. 
Stevens said she finds it unfair to be required to exit the hotel without sufficient time to figure out her plan. She did not know where she would be staying the night Tuesday, she said, but had reached out to BROC Community Action to inquire about shelter for the next few days. 
Stevens gained sobriety with the help of the organization Better Life Partners in Rutland and was in the process of interviewing for jobs, she said. She was planning to earn her bookkeeping certificate, but exiting the hotel may jeopardize her progress on those goals, she said. 
“Being able to be here has helped me become sober. I secured my plan. I actually signed up to go back to school this fall,” Stevens said. “I fear losing it all again.”

This story by Teresa McMinn was first published in the Cumberland Times-News on July 1.
CUMBERLAND, MD — Escorted by sheriff deputies, Jack LaSota used her restrained hands to carry a roughly two-foot stack of files and papers as she entered the courtroom. She sat at a table with her codefendants Michelle Zajko and Daniel Blank, and each of their attorneys.
LaSota, Zajko and Blank on Tuesday made initial appearances before Allegany County Circuit Court Judge Michael Twigg for a variety of recent charges, including misdemeanor gun and felony drug offenses, that stem from their February arrests on private property in Frostburg. Individually, each said they are not guilty of the crimes, but added they want to fight their legal battles as a team in a joint and jury trial.
“We’ve never had the opportunity for our clients to discuss these issues together,” Blank’s attorney Rebecca Lechliter said.
At her request, Twigg agreed to clear the courtroom for the defendants and their lawyers to strategize. Roughly 35 minutes later, the court reopened.
LaSota’s attorney, Elizabeth Lamm, requested the hearing be tabled until next week when her co-counsel David Schram, who was absent, is available and can provide input about individual versus joint trials. Twigg agreed and set 1:15 p.m. Tuesday for the continuation. Lechliter complained that the state has withheld information and evidence.
“I’m concerned about the way this case is dragging on,” she said and added it began with misdemeanor trespassing and has grown to include felony narcotics charges.
LaSota, Zajko and Blank are linked to a group known as the Zizians tied to violence in multiple states. Court records on Tuesday showed LaSota faces 12 charges, Zajko 17, and Blank 15, in Allegany County. Possible penalties for the various charges range from three months to 20 years of incarceration, plus fines.
The defendants need to decide how to pursue their cases “sooner rather than later,” Allegany County State’s Attorney James Elliott said and added a joint trial would last at least five days. He said his office is preparing documents to share with defense attorneys.
Zajko also faces a federal charge in Vermont for allegedly providing a gun used in a fatal shootout that left a U.S. border patrol agent dead earlier this year, according to VTDigger. Zajko has not appeared in court in Vermont to face that charge.
LaSota, who blogged under the name “Ziz,” was federally indicted last month in Maryland charged as an armed fugitive related to the Frostburg arrest.
On Tuesday, Zajko, whose brown curly hair marked time passed since a February mugshot depicted her crew cut, read from handwritten notes.
“I’m not a drug trafficker … never sold a drug in my life,” she said, raising her voice at times. “My friends and I are being held captive here,” Zajko said.
“What is happening in this courtroom won’t be forgotten,” she said. “This prosecution is malicious.”

Gov. JB Pritzker signed a pair of health care-related bills Tuesday that he said would put more controls on the pricing of pharmaceutical drugs sold through insurance plans while expanding insurance coverage for certain kinds of hospital costs.

“For too long our health care system has been infected by profit-seeking middlemen and predatory actors looking to make an extra dime at the expense of Illinois patients,” Pritzker said at a bill signing ceremony in Peoria. “Seniors have been forced to pay through the nose for life-saving medications. Families have had to delay or decline medically necessary treatments because they can’t afford it anymore. And family businesses like independent pharmacies have had to shut their doors.”

House Bill 1697, known as the Prescription Drug Affordability Act, will impose new restrictions on practices of pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, a powerful but little-understood segment of the pharmaceutical industry.

PBMs are companies that act as a kind of middleman between health insurance plans and pharmaceutical companies by negotiating drug prices and designing drug formularies that are intended to steer patients toward lower-cost medications.

But they have come under intense criticism in recent years for steering patients toward their own affiliated retail chain pharmacies, often to the detriment of smaller independent pharmacies, and for operating pricing systems that are designed to maximize profits for the PBMs rather than producing savings for patients.

Under the legislation, PBMs will be prohibited from steering consumers toward large pharmacies in which they have a financial interest. They will also be prohibited from engaging in “spread pricing” – the practice of charging health plans a higher price for a drug than the PBM pays a pharmacy for dispensing the drug.

The bill also establishes a grant program that will distribute $25 million a year in financial support for independent pharmacies, funded through a tax levied on PBMs operating in Illinois.

David Bagot, an independent pharmacist from Petersburg who is also president of the Illinois Pharmacists Association, called the bill “landmark legislation” that he predicted would be studied and replicated in other states.

“This bill represents the most comprehensive reform of pharmacy benefit managers we have seen in Illinois,” he said. “For far too long, these companies have used our nation’s drug supply chain to benefit shareholders and executives while driving up costs for people who rely on medications and driving pharmacies out of business.”

But the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, the lobbying organization that represents PBMs, called the bill “misguided legislation” and predicted it would have little or no impact on the prices consumers pay for medications.

“Unfortunately, the legislation does nothing to address the fact that Big Pharma sets the price of the prescription drugs – and the price is the problem when it comes to some Illinoisans facing difficulty affording their prescription drugs,” the group said in a statement. “Lawmakers have passed 20 bills regulating and restricting PBMs since 2016, none of which have led to lower drug prices.”

Insurance coverage expansion

Pritzker also signed House Bill 3019, known as the Healthcare Protection Expansion Act.

Among other things, it prohibits state-regulated health plans from requiring prior authorization for outpatient mental health services. Last year, lawmakers imposed a similar prohibition for inpatient and emergency mental health services.

It also requires insurance plans to cover a patient’s travel-related expenses whenever they have to travel long distances to receive in-network care, a problem often faced by patients who live in rural areas of the state.

“Building on protections that make mental health care accessible for all Illinois residents, this law gives people more opportunities and flexibility to receive necessary services,” state Sen. Laura Fine, D-Glenview, a lead sponsor of the bill, said in a statement.

Republican Lance Russell announced his candidacy Tuesday for the seat current Attorney General Marty Jackley will leave behind to run for U.S. House of Representatives in 2026. South Dakota’s current U.S. representative, Dusty Johnson, announced a long-rumored 2026 bid for governor on Monday.
Russell, 55, lives in Hot Springs and serves as the state’s attorney for Fall River and Oglala Lakota counties. 
“I am running to work as our next attorney general to ensure safer communities and open government for all South Dakotans,” Russell said in a press release. 
Republicans choose their attorney general candidate by a vote of state convention delegates. Russell sought the nomination in 2018 but fell to Jason Ravnsborg in a second ballot, 37% to 63%. 
Ravnsborg won the general election. His term was cut short by a legislative impeachment and removal after he struck and killed a man with his vehicle. Then-Gov. Kristi Noem appointed former Pennington County State’s Attorney Mark Vargo to serve the remainder of Ravnsborg’s term, and Jackley ran uncontested in the 2022 general election to return to the post he’d previously held. 
Russell holds a law degree from the University of South Dakota and a master of laws degree in natural resources and environmental law from the University of Denver. In addition to his work as a state’s attorney, he has a private practice and serves as a city attorney for several communities in the southern Black Hills.

,DC,2025-07-01 22:34:04+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Republicans rewrote the US Senate megabill in its last moments,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/republicans-rewrote-us-senate-megabill-its-last-moments,,"WASHINGTON — The final “big beautiful bill” approved by Senate Republicans Tuesday included some last-minute changes on hot-button issues such as safety net programs and clean energy tax credits.Senate Republicans had wrangled for weeks to deliver legislative text to satisfy concerns from lawmakers who objected to cutting Medicaid, the federal-state insurance program for low-income families and some individuals with disabilities.Other sticking points included threats that the health cuts pose to rural hospitals, and tax revisions that hamper clean energy jobs and investment, most of which are in states that elected President Donald Trump to his second term.The lawmakers debated amendments for more than 24 hours. Even with final changes, now under consideration in the House, three Republicans held out: Susan Collins of Maine, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky. Vice President JD Vance cast the tie breaking vote.Here are several rewrites that popped up in the bill’s final minutes and hours:Rural hospital fundSenate Republicans doubled the amount for a rural health “transformation program,” or money to compensate rural hospitals for the funds they would lose as a result of the proposed Medicaid cuts.The latest proposal sets aside $50 billion, up from $25 billion, and moves up the distribution timeline to begin in 2026, up from 2028.Collins had unsuccessfully introduced an amendment to bump the fund to $50 billion. Despite some support from GOP colleagues, the amendment was blunted by a technical budget point of order.The Maine Republican still voted “no” Tuesday on the final bill.SNAPThe lawmakers also made a late change to how and when states would begin to shoulder the responsibility for costs of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.According to the new version, if a state’s payment error rate in 2025 multiplied by 1.5 is equal or greater than 20%, then that state would be permitted to wait until 2029, rather than 2028, to begin footing a portion of the bill for food assistance.  A state’s accuracy rate is the annual measurement of over- or underpayments to recipients.Nine states would hover in the territory of meeting that threshold, according to the Department of Agriculture’s latest error rates published Monday. They are: Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York and Oregon.Alaska had the highest payment error rate of all states in both 2023 and 2024. Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski’s final decision on the bill was largely unknown until she cast a “yes” vote Tuesday.A late amendment to strike the language offered by Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota failed 45-55.Critics say the measure incentivizes states to keep the payment error rates high this year.Solar energyGOP senators late Friday added a clean energy excise tax into the bill, taking the industry by surprise. Then it vanished.The tax that would have been imposed on new solar and wind projects was no longer in the legislation that senators voted on around noon Eastern Tuesday.Other text loosened a squeeze on tech-neutral tax credits meant to incentivize the installation of energy systems that do not use fossil fuels. Senate Republicans added a year of leeway for new projects to break ground and avoid cutting short two of the tax credits.",,,,2025-07-01 19:05:00.477586

Rihanna Kelver used the women’s restroom at the Wyoming Capitol building Tuesday in defiance of a new law prohibiting transgender people’s use of public facilities. 
The post Transgender woman protests new law with visit to a Wyoming Capitol bathroom appeared first on WyoFile .","CHEYENNE—Standing outside a women’s restroom in the Wyoming State Capitol, Rihanna Kelver gazed downward, clasped her hands and took a deep breath. 
Like countless times before, Kelver, 27, was about to use a public restroom. But today was different. A new law had just gone into effect. 
Starting Tuesday in Wyoming, “in each public facility, no person shall enter a changing area, restroom or sleeping quarters that is designated for males or females unless the person is a member of that sex,” according to the statute.
In other words, the new law requires people to use the facility that corresponds to the sex they were assigned at birth, regardless of their gender identity, physical appearance or what appears on their legal documents. While it does not impose criminal or civil liability on anyone who violates the law, it leaves governmental bodies on the hook if they fail to enforce the restriction. 
Kelver, a transgender woman, had driven from her home in Laramie, accompanied by a small group of friends and supporters, to test the bounds of the new law. 
“That’s the thing. We’re showing up to the state and asking them to put their money where their mouth is,” Kelver told WyoFile outside the capitol building. 
In the days and weeks leading up to this moment, Kelver had felt anxious, she said. 
She’d made public statements before. In high school, she came out to her peers in her campaign speech for student body president. And when she was 18, Kelver ran for Albany County School Board as an openly transgender candidate. 
“This one, the ‘what ifs’ are a lot more diverse,” Kelver said. “They’re a lot more unknown. And there’s more severity to some of those ‘what ifs’ for today.”
And yet, Kelver said she felt compelled to go through with it. 
“I want to be here today because I know the fear and anxiety I felt with these laws and within the national conversation,” Kelver told WyoFile outside the Capitol. “I want to be here so [others] know they don’t have to feel alone, and that’s the biggest message.”
Ahead of her demonstration, Kelver gave the Wyoming Highway Patrol and governor’s office a heads up about her plans to use a women’s bathroom in the capitol. 
In case she got arrested, Kelver gave her keys, wallet and phone to her fiancé before walking into the building. She tucked her ID card into the front pocket of her black jeans. 
“I do not inherently believe in the state’s interpretation of my own identity, nor will I willfully be silent in the enforcement of where and how I can exist in public as who I am. I mean no one else harm,” Kelver said in a short speech before ascending the capitol steps.

“Today, I am about to enter [the Capitol] with a couple of my friends, to use the women’s restroom in accordance with my gender identity and legal identity,” she said. “I don’t know what’s about to happen, but I’m ready for whatever happens.”
Outside the bathroom doors, a friend, who’d been recording Kelver on a phone, stopped while Nichol Bondurant, Kelver’s former English teacher, walked in ahead of Kelver to make sure it was empty. (Kelver later said she “didn’t want to throw anybody in the middle” of her decision.)
When it was all clear, Kelver walked in, used the facility, washed her hands and exited. That was it. 
“Have a good day,” Kelver, in passing, told the highway patrolmen at a nearby desk. 
“Same to you,” he responded. 
How we got here
Wyoming’s new bathroom restrictions were just one of a slate of measures lawmakers passed in the 2025 session to restrict the rights of transgender people. 
A second bathroom-related bill puts the onus on public school students to use restrooms, locker rooms and sleeping quarters that align with their sex at birth. And an extension of the 2023 sports ban now applies to collegiate athletics in Wyoming. 
While LGBTQ+ advocates hope to use the legal system to defeat the new laws, no such legal challenge has yet to be filed. 
Meanwhile, the legislation’s sponsors have said the new laws are not about restricting rights, but safety and privacy. 
As Tuesday’s demonstration unfolded uneventfully, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus took to social media. The group, which represents the Legislature’s further-right flank, has been outspoken in its opposition to transgender rights.
“We call on Governor Gordon to utilize the good men and women of the Wyoming Highway Patrol on site at the People’s House to defend House Bill 72, now House Enrolled Act 48,” the caucus posted on X. 
The governor’s office declined to comment to WyoFile. 
Jessie Rubino, the Wyoming state director for the State Freedom Caucus Network, was at the Capitol to watch the demonstration, but declined to comment. 
In April, a transgender woman was arrested in Florida after washing her hands in a bathroom at that state capitol. The woman was protesting a law that criminalizes using restrooms in public buildings that don’t match one’s sex at birth. The case was dropped this week. 
Decision
Outside the capitol building, Kelver returned to the rest of her supporters, standing in the shade of a cottonwood tree, who cheered her return. 
“As some of you know, I ran away from Laramie and Wyoming for a little bit because I got scared,” Kelver said, referring to a recent year-long spell in Colorado. 
“But I made my decision. I’m back. I’m gonna be loud. I’m gonna be obnoxious for the state, not out of volition, but just because of who I am. 
“So I love you all,” she concluded. “Thank you for coming.”

In a lawsuit filed in Cole County Circuit Court Monday, MNEA argues that state funds cannot be directly given to MOScholars under the current statute.
MNEA vice president Rebeka McIntosh and member Kimberly Duvall, who serves as president of the Blue Springs chapter of the National Education Association, are suing on behalf of the organization’s 30,000 members.
“The General Assembly has far overstepped its authority and violated five provisions of the Missouri Constitution by using an appropriations bill to construct out of whole cloth a scheme to divert general revenues to what are essentially vouchers for the payment of private school tuition for elementary and secondary school students,” MNEA’s attorney Loretta Haggard wrote.
MOScholars currently operates using nonprofits dubbed “educational assistance organizations” to gather donations and distribute scholarships to students in private, parochial or home schools. Donors can receive a tax credit equal to 100% of their contribution but can use it to cover no more than half of their state tax liability. 
State law allows 4% of donations to be reserved to cover the costs of administering the program, including marketing.
But the budget passed by the lawmakers  “dramatically changes the landscape,” Haggard contends.
The budget signed by Gov. Mike Kehoe Monday includes an injection of general revenue to the MOScholars program, budgeting $50 million for scholarships and $1 million to assist marketing the program.
This, MNEA argues, breaks state law for multiple reasons.
The 2021 law that created MOScholars prescribes the use of tax-deductible donations to educational assistance organizations (EAOs), not general revenue, as a funding source.
“The money for (MOScholars) scholarships comes from donations that taxpayers make to EAOs, and EAOs then remit to families. The donated funds never come into the custody of the state, and the state does not select scholarship recipients,” Haggard wrote.
The direct appropriation to the program effectively amends the MOScholars statute, the lawsuit says, which violates laws requiring legislative authorization and limits bills to a single subject. Changing statute in a budget bill is not allowed.
  State Treasurer Vivek Malek speaks during the Disability Advocacy Day rally in the Missouri State Capitol Wednesday (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The money would have to flow through a fund overseen by the State Treasurer’s Office which currently does not hold scholarship money. The fund is “to be used by the state treasurer for marketing and administrative expenses or the costs incurred in administering the program, whichever is less,” according to state law.
Using the fund to administer scholarships is “unauthorized,” the lawsuit says.
MNEA is asking for a preliminary injunction, which would block the $51 million appropriation from being transferred to the MOScholars fund while litigation ensues.
“Once the unlawful appropriations are disbursed to private entities or individuals, it will be difficult if not impossible to claw those funds back to the treasury where they belong,” the lawsuit says.
MNEA argues that the money, if given to MOScholars, would hurt public education statewide.
“Politicians in Jefferson City and their privatization lobbyists are stealing from our kids,” said Missouri NEA President Phil Murray. “In rural Missouri, that $51 million means losing our music teacher, canceling basketball, and watching our schools crumble. They’re killing our small towns.”
Missouri Treasurer Vivek Malek, in an interview with The Independent in May, addressed the possibility of a lawsuit.
“We will deal with it when that happens,” he said. “I cannot predict which course it will take.”

Colorado Democrats blasted the measure, highlighting potential harms it could cause to the state budget and programs. Republicans largely applauded tax provisions in the bill.
The bill, which passed the Senate in a 51-50 vote, would extend tax breaks that were passed by Republicans in 2017, make cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and significantly increase border security and defense spending, among many other provisions.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a calculation Sunday showing the bill would add at least $3.3 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years.
Colorado’s U.S. senators, Democrats Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper, voted against the bill.
Reps prepare to vote
Members of the state’s U.S. House delegation — four Democrats and four Republicans — are expected to vote on the Senate version of the GOP bill in the coming days, with the House reconvening Wednesday. The House passed the initial version of the bill in May, but now it must approve changes made by the Senate. Colorado’s House delegation voted along party lines in May, with Republicans in favor of the measure.
Rep. Gabe Evans, a Fort Lupton Republican, praised a provision in the Senate bill to eliminate taxes on qualifying tips until 2028. 
“I believe that if you earn it, you should keep it,” Evans said in a social media post. “That’s why I voted for No Tax on Tips. It’s the perfect recipe to put more money back in the pockets of #CO08 workers and invest in Main Street.”
In another post, he wrote, “Without the One Big Beautiful Bill, Colorado families will have to pay thousands more in taxes. That’s why I voted for the OBBB. Less money in taxes means more money in Coloradans’ pockets.”
Evans represents Colorado’s 8th Congressional District, one of only a handful of House swing districts in the country. He has faced fierce criticism over his support of the megabill, particularly due to the cuts it would make to Medicaid.
Colorado Democrats are sounding off about how the bill’s cuts to health and food safety net programs and other measures could put Colorado in a billion-dollar budget crunch. Based on the House version of the bill, estimates say that at least 100,000 Coloradans could lose Medicaid coverage.
Rep. Diana DeGette, a Denver Democrat, plans to vote against the bill, calling it a “cruel piece of legislation.”
“This bill gives tax breaks to billionaires while gutting Medicaid, slashing SNAP benefits, defunding Planned Parenthood and undermining our clean energy future,” DeGette said in a statement. “I won’t support it.”
Democratic Rep. Jason Crow of Centennial said in a statement that the bill is “one of the worst” he has ever seen.
“I cannot support this Republican bill that takes health care and food assistance from working people to give tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans,” Crow said. “This bill is bad for Colorado and America.”
The offices of Colorado’s other representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment for this article.
Polis slams Senate bill
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, urged the House to scrap the Senate’s version of the bill and start over, calling for an “end to the madness.”
“Today, Republicans in the Senate voted to kick Americans off health care, raise costs on insurance, kill jobs, increase our deficit and debt, and make it harder for kids to access food,” Polis said in a statement. “This shameful vote comes at the expense of hardworking Coloradans. This bill is bad for our communities, bad for our economy, and will increase the deficit and balloon our national debt. It’s time for the House to rise to the occasion and do their part to protect Americans from this bill and start over.”
Colorado’s Office of State Planning and Budgeting estimates that the bill would decrease the state’s revenue by $500 million and increase the state’s expenses by up to $650 million.

Wyoming Sens. Cynthia Lummis and John Barrasso voted yes on the bill, which narrowly cleared the U.S. Senate Tuesday.
The post Medicaid, insurance cuts in ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ will harm Wyoming, health care advocates warn appeared first on WyoFile .","At least 12,000 Wyoming residents are projected to lose health coverage if President Donald Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill” is signed into law, health care advocates say. 
The voluminous bill inched closer to passage Tuesday when it cleared the Senate by a single vote cast by Vice President J.D. Vance. Wyoming’s two Republican senators, Cynthia Lummis and John Barrasso, both voted yes. 
“While this bill certainly isn’t perfect, it’s a major step in the right direction that further unlocks Wyoming energy and delivers significant wins for working families across Wyoming,” Lummis said in a statement. She released a tally of industries and areas that stand to benefit from the bill, which included coal, livestock and rural economic development. 
Meantime, opponents are ringing the alarm bells on legislation they say will have devastating health care impacts on the nation’s low-income residents. In Wyoming, they say, that will mean more uninsured patients, climbing health care costs and mounting pressure on already-strained rural hospitals. 
“The cuts to Medicaid and the [Affordable Care Act] will have devastating and dramatic impacts on health coverage, care, and costs for American families, and in many ways, especially in Wyoming,” Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA, said in a statement. “The cuts will not just mean that tens of thousands of Wyoming residents lose coverage, but federal cuts will force state budgets into crisis, forcing states to drastically scale back services, leading to closures of rural hospitals and community clinics.” 
​​The president’s enormous tax and spending bill has implications for an array of policies. Along with slashing Medicaid spending, it sets aside money for immigration enforcement, including mass deportations, extends tax cuts and axes spending for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which helps low-income people pay for food. 
Coverage
The bill is projected to reduce federal Medicaid spending by $793 billion over 10 years, resulting in 10.3 million fewer people enrolled nationally, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Changes include increased work requirements and potential penalties for states that have expanded Medicaid. 
Wyoming is one of the few states that hasn’t expanded Medicaid and so would avoid some immediate hits, said Josh Hannes, vice president of the Wyoming Hospitals Association. However, impacts are still expected here, he said.

“Some of the concerns for us are around reducing the proactive look-back period of Medicaid from 90 to 30 days,” he said. That change would cut two months off the current provision that allows Medicaid patients to get coverage for health care costs incurred during the three months prior to their enrollment. 
The Wyoming Medicaid program covers 62,000 patients, according to Families USA. Some 46,000 residents, meanwhile, get health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace coverage, which is available for people who don’t qualify for Medicaid and don’t have insurance through an employer.
Another big worry, Hannes said, is related to enhanced premium tax credits on the Affordable Care marketplace. Those are set to expire at the end of 2025 — and the bill does not renew them. 
Since 2021, when those credits were enacted, Hannes said, “we more than doubled our enrollment on the marketplace … because it provided greater subsidies to more people.” 
Without those subsidies, he said, thousands of people are expected to lose their ability to afford insurance premiums. “It’s a big concern,” he said. “We already have one of the higher uninsured rates in the country, and this will make it worse.”
Nate Martin, executive director of Better Wyoming, honed in on the tax-credit related costs in a recent opinion piece for WyoFile. “Currently, a single person earning $62,000 a year in Wyoming can buy a year’s worth of medical insurance for $5,270 thanks to Marketplace tax credits,” he wrote. “If the Big Beautiful Bill eliminates those credits, that price will increase to $11,810, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.”
The hike would be even more dramatic for older Wyoming residents who aren’t quite eligible for Medicare, Martin wrote. “Right now, a 60-year-old couple earning $80,000 a year together can buy health insurance from the Marketplace for $6,970 to cover both of them. Again, this is thanks to tax credits. Under the Big Beautiful Bill, the cost will shoot up to $44,392 a year just for insurance premiums.”
Hospital, clinic strain 
The bill poses significant damage to rural health care in particular, four Democratic senators stressed in a June 12 letter to Trump. A majority of adults living in rural areas are concerned about the cuts, according to the letter. 
“They are right to be worried, as these cuts will have devastating consequences for health outcomes and costs, jobs, and the economic success of rural communities,” the letter stated. 
Too many rural hospitals are already operating on the brink, they said, pointing to data from the Sheps Center that identifies more than 300 at-risk hospitals across the country that the senators assert would be further endangered by the cuts. 
Wyoming hospitals are all vulnerable, Hannes has said, due to the challenges of operating rural health care. Low patient volumes, administrative burdens from insurance companies, high rates of uninsured patients, rising labor costs and increasing prescription drug prices create a difficult landscape for financial sustainability, he said. In addition, Wyoming’s 15 hospital districts are facing steep property tax revenue cuts thanks to a new state law.

Facilities like the Downtown Clinic in Laramie would also certainly see impacts, according to a recent op-ed by its director, Pete Gosar. The clinic serves low-income, uninsured patients, including those without Medicare, Medicaid or VA benefits. 
“We are proud to do this vital work, and 90% of our funding is derived from privately raised dollars,” Gosar wrote. “But how, I ask, do you expect an additional 12 to 16 million people to enter this system without a shred of additional financial support? This puts clinics like ours in an utterly precarious situation.”
Gosar called the damage to rural health care “catastrophic.” 
“If Congress truly wished to support rural healthcare, they would ensure people have access to healthcare in the first place, rather than offering inadequate props after inflicting such profound damage,” he wrote. 
Presidential promises
Barrasso, who is Senate Majority Whip and a physician by training, has repeatedly celebrated the bill as a win. It translates into tax cuts and less government spending, he posted on the social media platform X, which means more money in the pockets of Americans.
In a Monday interview on Fox News, Barrasso addressed Medicaid when he said millions of undocumented Americans are on the federal program. 
“We need to stop that,” he said. “Taxpayer dollars should not be going for Medicaid for illegal immigrants.”
Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Medicaid or other federally funded coverage, as reported by KFF Health News.

Following Tuesday’s Senate vote, Barrasso posted another triumphant message. 
“Americans elected Republicans to make our country safer, stronger, and more prosperous,” he wrote. “This bill does it.”
Critics, however, believe it will do the opposite. The organization Healthy Wyoming has been focused on expanding Medicaid in recent years. In a May webinar, the group’s interim executive director, Jenn Lowe, emphasized the harm the bill posed to Wyoming’s precarious health care network and its largely aging patients. 
“Any cuts to Medicaid, regardless of how they are sold or justified, will result in long-term harm to children and families and will put at risk many healthcare clinics that we all rely on as we travel across this great state,” she said. 
The act now returns to the House of Representatives, which passed its own version in May. 
Trump has set a Friday deadline for the legislation to be on his desk.

“Every contribution made through these official channels goes directly toward supporting the families in their time of unimaginable loss and need,” the Professional Firefighters of Idaho said in a news release. 
The brush fire officials believe the suspect caused, named the Nettleton Gulch Fire, grew to 38 acres by Tuesday morning, largely because of better mapping, the Idaho Department of Lands reported. The fire is not contained. 
The U.S. Forest Service on Tuesday closed roads near Canfield Mountain until July 15, unless the order ends earlier. A temporary flight restriction is still in effect for the area. Flying drones or aircraft in the area without authorization poses “a serious hazard to firefighting and law enforcement activities,” Idaho Department of Lands officials say.
Structures are still not at risk from the fire, and no evacuations have been ordered, Department of Lands officials say. The fire is in steep terrain.
Crews on Tuesday will work to contain the fire by installing hose lays and setting up water access for the fire’s perimeter, officials say. Fire operations on Tuesday also changed from the Idaho Department of Lands’ Mica Fire Protection District to the North Idaho Type 3 Incident Management Team.
The active shooter situation Sunday delayed firefighting efforts. The fire’s cause remains under investigation.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)The plot thickened as billionaire Elon Musk waded into the feud between President Donald Trump and defiant Kentucky Republican U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie.
Musk promised Monday evening to help Massie fend off any Republican primary challenger recruited by Trump who is vowing to unseat Massie next year.
Massie most recently drew Trump’s wrath by opposing his bombing of Iran and before that voting against the mega-bill that supporters say delivers on the president’s campaign promises, though clashes between Masie and Trump date back to Trump’s first term.
And Massie is not the only Kentucky Republican who has defied Trump and party leaders by voting against the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
Even after a round of golf with the president on Saturday, Sen. Rand Paul voted against starting debate on the bill and on Tuesday against the bill itself, which required a tiebreaking vote by Vice President JD Vance to squeak out of the Republican-controlled Senate.
In a Republican Party that has fallen in lockstep behind Trump and a state that Trump has easily carried three times, Paul and Massie may face risks getting on the wrong side of Trump and his MAGA base. 
Political observers in Kentucky say the two can get away with it because they are coming from Trump’s right on questions of government spending and fiscal responsibility and because they are viewed as acting on principle.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)
Stephen Voss, a political science professor at the University of Kentucky, said Paul, Massie and Musk “have been motivated by a right-leaning libertarianism that shows up in their politics regularly.”
“It’s a matter of principle that separates them from other Republicans and having Republican President Donald Trump dive so thoroughly into a big government, strong presidency, model of leadership cuts against the principles of all three of those men.”
Massie, an MIT-educated engineer who served as Lewis County judge-executive, was elected to Congress in 2012. His 4th Congressional District stretches from Ashland in the Appalachian hills westward along the Ohio River to the conservative suburbs of Northern Kentucky and Louisville. 
Trump’s political operation has $500 million ready to bolster — or punish — Republicans heading into midterm elections. Trump-affiliated PAC, MAGA Kentucky, launched a $1 million ad buy against Massie last week, Axios reports, Ahead of the ad buy, Trump took to Truth Social to say Massie “is not MAGA, even though he likes to say he is” and vowed to campaign in Kentucky for “a wonderful American Patriot” candidate against the congressman. 
Trump’s candidate has yet to emerge, but first-term Republican state Sen. Aaron Reed of Shelby County has been mentioned as a possibility in some political circles.
On Monday, Musk, who has been publicly feuding with the president over the GOP domestic policy bill, waded into the fray, saying on his social media platform X that he would support Massie. Moments before Musk had vowed that Republicans “who campaigned on reducing government spending and then immediately voted for the biggest debt increase in history” would “lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth.”

The congressman welcomed Musk’s support by sharing a Fox News article about the post Tuesday morning, to which Musk replied, “You’re awesome.” 
Voss said it may become “a Trump versus Musk proxy war in Northern Kentucky,” though both men have a tendency to “jump from controversy to controversy.” 
If attention on the primary blows over by next year, Massie could have an easier time keeping his job, Voss said, but “he may have other ambitions than merely keeping his job.” 
“Thomas Massie has become a household name in a way few members of the House of Representatives get to be,” Voss said. “The fame and notoriety he’s getting might put his current seat in greater jeopardy, but it opens up lots of opportunities.” 
For Republicans hoping to position themselves as the future of their party, particularly if Trump’s popularity with voters dwindles and the GOP takes losses in midterm elections, “being on the side of the GOP that resisted Trump can start to pay off.” 
“Right now, going against Trump is the kiss of death, but that may change,” Voss said. 
At least one Republican in Congress, North Carolina Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, said he won’t seek reelection after voting against Trump’s bill. Tillis’ opposition stemmed from the bill’s funding cuts which he said would force “painful decisions” about Medicaid and hurt his state.
In contrast, Massie and Paul objected to the bill because it will send federal deficits soaring. 
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a calculation Sunday showing the Senate version of the bill would add $3.25 trillion to federal budget deficits over 10 years.
Tres Watson, a political consultant and former spokesperson for the Republican Party of Kentucky, said Massie’s 2026 primary is “definitely going to be a fight” especially with Musk’s interest in the race. Watson added that the endorsements of Trump and Musk might have less impact on the contest than the resources each could put behind a candidate.
Watson said Massie has a strong set of beliefs and he will vote for them “whether that puts him in very awkward positions with very awkward bedfellows or not.” As a fiscally conservative, libertarian Republican, “he’s going to be against this bill.” 
Paul is similar to Massie but “occasionally will play ball a little bit more,” Watson said. Paul and Trump likely developed rapport during the 2016 campaign, “whereas Massie has kind of always been a thorn in Trump’s side dating back to the first administration.”
Paul hasn’t faced Trump’s wrath like Massie has. 
Musk’s involvement could also mean the primary will be quite expensive. Groups affiliated with Musk spent nearly $20 million backing a conservative candidate in the Wisconsin Supreme Court election earlier this year, according to media reports. Musk also gave the state Republican Party $2 million. Despite all that, Musk’s candidate lost.
Massie thanked Musk Tuesday from his campaign account on X, adding Musk’s purchase of X, formerly Twitter, and making it the “platform for free speech has already helped my cause immensely,” allowing the congressman to “bypass conventional media to refute the lies of both political parties and to provide transparency about how Congress works and what’s actually inside of the bills we vote on.”
Massie said opposing the megabill and the Iran strikes “recently earned me the ire of the swamp and a fight for my re-election,” but the race is instead “a referendum on whether members of Congress can think and act independently based on what’s best for the country, or whether all members of congress must be reduced to rubber stamps for their respective political parties and swampy special interests.” 
“I’m extremely thankful to have Elon Musk’s financial assistance to continue my mission as an independent voice in Congress for my constituents,” Massie wrote.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2204622175-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-01 18:07:52.296274

(Photo by Justin Garcia / Las Cruces Bulletin)The New Mexico Department of Justice announced on Tuesday it has joined 15 other states in a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Education’s discontinuation in April of grants under the 2022 Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. The law, which U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) played a role in crafting, included enhanced measures to address gun violence, including more funding for school-based mental health programs.
Specifically, a news release from New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez’s office notes, the bill allocated $1 billion to expand access to school-based mental health services. However, the federal education department in April “issued boilerplate notices discontinuing the grants based on vague and unsupported claims of conflict with current policy priorities,” the news release said. “The coalition lawsuit argues this violates federal law, including the Administrative Procedure Act and statutory protections under the Safer Communities Act” and has asked the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington to block the cuts.
“It is one of our greatest responsibilities to protect the mental health and safety of our children,” Torrez said in a a statement. “This funding was secured by Congress—thanks in large part to the leadership of Senator Heinrich—to address the trauma and mental health challenges students face after school shootings and during an ongoing youth mental health crisis. The Department’s decision to abruptly eliminate this funding is not only reckless, but it also defies the law and threatens to dismantle programs that are saving lives.”
The state in April also joined in a lawsuit against the federal education department’s cancellation of funds for three programs funded through the American Rescue Act to help vulnerable school children recover from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The new suit comes as the Trump administration puts on hold $6.8 billion in federal funds for K-12 schools, according to an Education Department notice obtained by States Newsroom.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch) During Tuesday’s first meeting of the Iowa State University presidential search committee, members of the ISU community, alongside state officials and search consultants, began crafting a list of qualities of a future university president.
The committee includes faculty and staff representatives, students and alumni from ISU, as well as Iowa Board of Regents members. They are working with board staff and presidential search firm AGB Search to first identify the type of candidates they want the position to attract, review candidates and select those that would serve best in the role that will be left vacant by Wendy Wintersteen in January 2026.
“The hiring of a university president is the most important thing the board does, and your work will be critical in identifying the best possible finalists for the board to consider,” Board President Sherry Bates told committee members during the meeting. “Your efforts will be rewarded when we hire the next great leader for Iowa State.”

AGB Search Managing Principal Rodrick McDavis, who previously spoke with the regents on best practices for a collegiate presidential search, provided the committee with a tentative, “very, very, very tight” timeline that would have the search wrapped up by the board’s November meeting.
With the first presidential search committee completed, McDavis said the next step is to conduct listening sessions with campus stakeholders throughout mid-July ahead of the July 23 official search launch. At that point, the position will be posted online and advertised, and search consultants will begin recruiting candidates.
The “best consideration” deadline for applications is set for Sept. 19, three days after which the search committee will gain access to documents to start reviewing candidates, McDavis said. The committee will meet the week of Oct. 6 to choose semifinalists from the pool of candidates and develop interview questions that they will have the opportunity to ask during interviews Oct. 20.
From those interviews, finalists will be selected and their names will be released one-by-one 24 hours ahead of their campus visits, scheduled for the week of Nov. 3.
“The goal of our process is that the board of regents will be in a position to make its selection of a president-elect at the board meetings that will occur on November the 11th through the 13th,” McDavis said.
The group recorded a long list of qualities, skills and experiences they’d like to see in candidates, including political savvy, an entrepreneurial spirit, relatability and the capacity to make difficult decisions.
ISU Professional and Scientific Council President-Elect Jennifer Schroeder said candidates need to be able to communicate and collaborate both internally, across ISU’s colleges and departments, and externally on all levels.
“They need to go from speaking to a student in poverty, coming in first-gen, all the way up to a multi-millionaire businessman in the industry and everything in between, and being able to adjust their approach so that they are relatable they feel genuine to the person they’re speaking with,” Schroeder said.
All of the chosen qualifiers will be used to create a leadership profile, McDavis said, that once reviewed by the committee and board of regents, will be sent across the country for potential applicants.
During the meeting, committee members expressed the need for the future ISU president to have at least an appreciation and understanding of — if not actual experience in — higher education and all that comes with it: research, shared governance, building community and business relationships, and the wants and needs of students, staff and faculty.
ISU’s unique attributes as a land grant university with the Ames National Laboratory and the ISU Research Park should be emphasized as critical aspects of the university’s identity and operations, members said, and should also be recognized by candidates.
Janice Fitzgerald, a senior executive search consultant with ABG Search, said it is these qualities that will intrigue potential candidates, with Rod adding that there are people across the U.S. who are waiting for a position like this to open up for them.
“Iowa State has unique characteristics, and it’s going to be very attractive to individuals,” Fitzgerald said. “Every university or college has a personality, and Iowa State has always been upscale and welcoming, so that is also going to be very attractive to candidates and advocates.”
Suggestions by the search consultants for criteria to think about in a candidate included their level of degree and their plans for and experience with both enrollment and crisis management. McDavis said good candidates should also be able to both visualize and implement a strategic plan.
The group also brainstormed challenges ISU and higher education are facing, including the enrollment cliff, lost or uncertain federal funding and more.
Roger Underwood, an ISU alum on the committee, said the problems faced by ISU right now like research funding being cut are “nickels and dimes” compared to what’s coming — U.S. Social Security “going upside down” after 2032 and states having to absorb more costs relating to Medicare and Medicaid. He said the state, which only funds around one-third of university budgets through appropriations, could pull back funding even more.
“I think it’s going to be a rare bird out there, that we’re going to find that person that can balance the three-to-five year plan but can also look out well beyond that and then sell that back to all the groups represented here, which are going to be dramatic, dramatic changes, not incremental,” Underwood said.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)While dozens of New Mexico acequias continue reckoning with  damage from natural disasters over the last three years, they are making progress, according to officials helping them navigate multiple layers of bureaucracy.
Disasters like the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire near Las Vegas in 2022, along with the South Fork and Salt fires in Ruidoso and the Rio Chama Flooding in Rio Arriba County last year, resulted in damage to 150 acequias, according to Paula Garcia, executive director of the New Mexico Acequia Association. That amounts to about one-sixth of the state’s roughly 900 acequias. 
Garcia gave a presentation to members of the Legislature’s interim Water and Natural Resources Committee, which is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday in Las Vegas, a town of about 12,000 that continues to grapple with the aftermath of the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire, particularly when it comes to post-fire flooding and potential drinking water contamination. 
The presentation occurs as President Donald Trump’s administration mulls deep cuts to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the potential end of disaster declarations that keep certain emergency funding streams flowing to individuals and public entities. 
After fire and flood, ash chokes acequias in northern NM

It also comes after dozens of people were fired locally from the Natural Resources Conservation Service, a federal agency that funds emergency watershed repair and other programs acequias rely on. 
Last week, Western governors agreed to explore formalizing inter-state partnerships to address the  aftermath of post-fire flooding, a concern they dedicated an entire panel to during the annual Western Governors’ Association conference in Santa Fe. 
Agriculture that relies on acequias in and around the burn scar remains largely halted more than three years after the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire, Garcia said, and every rainstorm brings the threat that acequias will flood or fill with silt that flows off fire-scarred mountainsides.
But she said her nonprofit organization and state government agencies are making progress when it comes to finally untangling a complicated federal bureaucracy that was initially unfamiliar with acequias and is still inflexible when it comes to ongoing flooding. 
Amid FEMA uncertainty, Western governors commit to more coordination on post-fire flooding

“I would like for FEMA to clean up the bureaucracy and red tape, but we’re managing it now,” Garcia said. 
One major hurdle acequias faced concerned upfront costs they must produce before work can be completed, Garcia said. Even though state or federal agencies reimburse most or all costs,  even modest upfront costs are often insurmountable for the small, volunteer-led irrigation canals. 
As such, more than 100 acequias statewide have sought help from the NRCS’ Emergency Watershed Protection Program, Garcia said, largely because that program allows acequias to offload the paperwork to a local sponsor like a county or a local soil and water conservation district. 
Thanks to a partnership between FEMA and state agencies, the state Transportation Department has entered into agreements with about 70 statewide acequias, including 54 in the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire burn scar, to allow the DOT to remove debris from silted-in acequias. FEMA then reimburses DOT for the associated costs. 
Acequia steward strains to get help to recover historic southern NM irrigation systems

About 67 Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon acequias also have pending claims with the FEMA office overseeing a $5.45 billion fund aimed to compensate victims of the fire, according to Garcia’s presentation.
Garcia called on the state Legislature to find ways to help acequias pay the upfront costs and to formalize a system to remove debris from acequias. 
She also called on the state to create its own version of the Emergency Watershed Protection program, which is popular among acequias and also reliant on an agency undergoing staffing cuts. 
According to various reports, NRCS laid off at least 35 people locally.
“NRCS is a really wonderful agency, and it’s tragic to see those cuts,” Garcia said. “I think there’ll be implications for these programs if those cuts continue.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0556-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-01 18:07:52.296274

COTS, a housing and shelter services nonprofit, has announced a new campaign to help complete a new, larger adult overnight shelter in Burlington that’s expected to open in December.
Having successfully met the $200,000 challenge grant announced in May, COTS has launched a final $200,000 challenge grant, provided by the Courtney and Victoria Buffum Family Foundation, to close a final funding gap, according to a press release.
“This project is about much more than bricks and mortar, it’s about dignity, hope, and a
fresh start,” Jonathan Farrell, executive director of COTS, formerly known as the Committee on Temporary Shelter, wrote in the release.

The $400,000 COTS is hoping to raise will help renovate a downtown former Social Security building bought in January to create a more modern, spacious, ADA-compliant night shelter.
The current night shelter on Church Street, called the Waystation, has long outgrown the space and demand. In the last fiscal year, it served 159 people.
The new 7,361-square-foot property at 58 Pearl St. will triple the space available in the Waystation and provide beds for up to 56 adults, allowing COTS to expand its shelter services by 55%. The current location will be converted into permanent affordable housing.

“We’re proud to support this campaign and hope this challenge will inspire others to help COTS cross the finish line,” he wrote in the release.

Youngkin focused on education and tapped into parents’ anger over pandemic policies and classroom lessons in his upset win over McAuliffe, also the former Democratic National Committee chairman and chief fundraiser for the campaigns of Bill and Hillary Clinton. The winning “parents matter” message helped fuel a GOP focus on parents’ rights.

Before resigning to run for governor, Youngkin spent 25 years at The Carlyle Group, a Washington, D.C., headquartered private-equity firm , where he became co-CEO in 2018. Youngkin used his personal wealth to fund a large portion of his campaign, spending $20 million of his own money, according to The Associated Press.
His term expires in January 2026.
“His bold, conservative leadership in Virginia has inspired Republicans across the country,” SCGOP Chairman Drew McKissick said in a statement. “He’s shown that strong principles and smart policy win elections — and more importantly, deliver results.”
The black-tie optional event, known as the Silver Elephant Gala, is the SC GOP’s biggest fundraiser of the year.
Past speakers include President Donald Trump in 2023, ahead of his bid for a second term. More than 1,300 people came to hear Trump speak, the largest crowd in the dinner’s history, McKissick previously told the SC Daily Gazette.
Other past headliners include former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in 2021 and former Vice President Mike Pence in 2008, when he was an Indiana congressman. Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders was the speaker in 2020, before Trump’s former White House press secretary announced her bid for governor.
Then-Gov. Ronald Reagan was the speaker in 1967 for the inaugural Silver Elephant. Other former presidents to give the keynote address include Richard Nixon and George W. Bush.
The event is scheduled for Aug. 9 in Columbia.
It comes a little over two months after South Carolina Democrats’ own high-dollar fundraiser, the Blue Palmetto Dinner, which was headlined by Maryland Gov. Wes Moore. Attendees also heard from 2024 vice presidential candidate and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Youngkin-2025-session_Charlotte-Rene-Woods-VA-Mercury-1024x708.jpg,,,2025-07-01 18:07:52.296274

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)About a dozen state disability case managers spent their lunch break outside a Rhode Island Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals (BHDDH) brick office building in Cranston — not to eat, but to protest what they say is a lack of action on staffing shortages and dragging their feet on pay negotiations.
The case managers, organized under SEIU Local 580, have been working without a contract since July 2024. They have asked for a higher pay grade in line with what similar workers make at the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF).
But Matthew Gunnip, a DCYF case manager and president of SEIU Local 580, told Rhode Island Current that BHDDH managers rejected the proposal without offering an alternative.
“Good faith bargaining is coming with a counter proposal,” he said, standing in the grass as temperatures reached the mid 80s. “That’s not leadership.”
Gunnip acknowledged the state’s tight budget but said that lawmakers have given BHDDH more than enough funding to bump pay for the 16 budgeted “conflict-free” case managers. Conflict-free case managers are tasked with helping clients be more involved and independent in the community.
BHDDH has a budget of roughly $219 million for fiscal year 2026.
“Like other health care and human services employers, BHDDH is navigating a challenging labor market,” BHDDH spokesperson Randal Edgar said in an email. “The department wishes to address concerns raised by employees and is scheduled to meet with the union on July 8.”
The biggest concern for case managers is pay. A job posting from nine months ago lists the salary range between $61,460 and $71,507 per year.
“That may sound like a lot, but living on that is challenging,” case manager Alex Blue said. “We have to have cars that work, insurance is expensive, living is extremely expensive, and food is getting more expensive.”
Rep. David Morales, a Providence Democrat, joined the unionized case managers for the lunchtime 45-minute press conference arranged by SEIU Local 580. Rhode Island was one of three news outlets that attended. 
“Our frontline caseworkers are being burnt out,” he said. “Having to continuously take on higher case loads and work environments that are just plain stressful.”
Erin MacDougall, who started work as a case manager for the state last August, knows those stresses all too well. 
“I’ve lost weight, and I’ve lost hair,” she told reporters.
MacDougall said she’s had to juggle 45 clients, some of whom are unhoused. Clients include a man with continued to stay at home for five days with the body of his dead father, and someone who was so severely malnourished they weighed 69 pounds. She said case managers are effectively doing two jobs: acting as frontline social workers while also drafting individualized plans for each client, which had been a separate role.
“It’s now a brand-new, unmanageable responsibility,” MacDougall said. “This task is intently time-consuming and complex with many steps and constant changes, as many clients are new to BHDDH.”
Crafting a plan, she said, requires multiple meetings with clients. That’s on top of the monthly check-ins that case managers are required to conduct, which involves driving across the state to connect with clients in person. Some, MacDougall said, require weekly or daily check-ins.
“It’s constantly putting out fires,” MacDougall told reporters.
Because of the high-stress workload, MacDougall said she’s seen five case managers leave the job. But Edgar said he believed there are now three open positions, which he said were in the process of being filled. 
As of Tuesday, the state’s job portal lists three open positions at BHDDH: a clinical psychologist, janitor, and certified occupational therapy assistant.

,California,2025-07-01 21:32:29+00:00,CalMatters,California schools are scrambling as Trump administration withholds almost $811 million,Tara García Mathewson and Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2025/07/education-funding-california/,"California districts have not received Congressionally appropriated money for after school programs, academic enrichment, English-learner services, teacher professional development and migrant education.","In summary
California districts have not received Congressionally appropriated money for after school programs, academic enrichment, English-learner services, teacher professional development and migrant education.




California school districts are short hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grant money they had already budgeted for this year. While Congress approved the funds as part of its 2025 budget, the Trump Administration today refused to release them, sending districts across the country scrambling.
The grant money pays for teacher professional development, after school and other enrichment programs, services for students learning English and migrant education. Across all five programs the money funds, California schools are due almost $811 million, according to an analysis by the Learning Policy Institute. Nationwide, the grants total $6.2 billion for K-12 schools. 
After Congress approves the total funding amounts, the U.S. Department of Education has historically discussed state-level allocations between March and May, releasing the money on July 1. On Monday, states received an email saying the department was still reviewing 2025 funding for the five affected programs. In many California districts, that money was built into school budgets this spring and administrators expected to start spending it this month and next. 
Without the money, some school districts will have to cancel teacher professional development events this summer and summer learning activities as soon as this week. 
“The harm of this decision is immediate. The costs are real and the impact is long lasting,” said Tatia Davenport, director of the California Association of School Business Officials. “By withdrawing those funds, our district leaders will be forced to reduce staff, delay programs and cancel services. That means disrupting the learning for the students who need us the most.”

The state is considering several options, including suing the Trump administration, said State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond. The state has sued Trump over school funding several times already, after Trump threatened to withhold funding over diversity and other initiatives. 
Meanwhile, Thurmond encouraged school districts to find resources to keep summer programs running, in hopes of a resolution soon. Schools start re-opening in late July with the majority opening in August.
Student services at risk
Among the programs that didn’t receive funding is the 21st Century Community Learning Center grants, which provide about $146.6 million to California schools and community organizations for after-school programs. The state provides the bulk of after-school funding, but 21st Century grants are the primary source of money for middle and high schools. The money pays for tutoring, snacks, field trips, enrichment activities and other investments intended to help students stay on track academically while gaining social skills and having fun.
Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance, called after school and summer learning programs an American success story, providing a lifeline for working parents. She said every hour of delay on the federal funds could lead to closures and cancellations that will ripple into the start of the 2025-26 school year.
“It’s going to mean more children and youth are unsupervised, and at risk, more academic failures, more hungry kids, more chronic absenteeism, higher dropout rates, more parents forced out of their jobs and a less STEM-ready and successful workforce as our child care crisis worsens dramatically,” she said. 
In the Oxnard School District, in Ventura County, Superintendent Anabolena DeGenna said the programs this federal money supports “are not luxuries in our schools; they’re lifelines,” supporting student services, teacher training and critical family engagement programs that help caregivers support their children. All of this as the district continues to recover from challenges brought on by the COVID pandemic.
The U.S. Department of Education has released some money Congress approved for K-12 schools this year as part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and its various programs. All of the withheld funding was destined for programs the administration has proposed defunding in 2026. 
Amaya Garcia, director of PreK-12 research and practice at the left-leaning D.C. think tank New America, said this is not a coincidence. 
“By [withholding] these funds, the Trump administration is finding a way to enact their budget priorities without the approval of Congress,” Garcia said. 
In the department’s Monday email to states, it said it “remained committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities.” 
Education leaders and advocates roundly condemned the funding delays and the administration’s claims that it had anything to review. 
“There’s nothing to review from the department because Congress has already approved this funding back in March,” said Amalia Chamorro, director of education policy for UnidosUS, the largest Latino civil rights organization in the country. “This action is illegal and it is an overreach of the executive branch,” she continued. “We are calling on the administration to stop playing politics and immediately release these funds without further delay. Our students deserve better.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/102924-BILINGUAL-RECOVERY-LV_CM_05.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-01 18:07:52.296274

Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va.
Shelley Moore Capito’s post on X — which also said Jefferson County Prosecuting Attorney Matt Harvey was nominated to serve as U.S. Attorney for the northern half of the state — did not make mention of the relationship between her and Moore Capito. 

Thrilled and extremely proud that @POTUS has chosen two stellar candidates to be West Virginia’s U.S. Attorneys, Matt Harvey in the Northern District and Moore Capito in the Southern District. I look forward to supporting their quick confirmations so they can get to work on…
— Shelley Moore Capito (@SenCapito) July 1, 2025

Her social media praise for her son’s appointment came just four minutes after she voted in support of her party’s “big, beautiful bill,” which narrowly passed the U.S. Senate 51 to 50. Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote on the legislation.
The bill slashes funding to the Medicaid program and shifts significant costs of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to states for the first time. West Virginians in particular are especially reliant on those social safety nets, according to numerous advocacy groups.
In a statement Tuesday, the West Virginia Democratic Party accused Shelley Moore Capito of trading her vote on the spending bill for Moore Capito’s nomination.
“One has to wonder why Sen. Capito would be such an enthusiastic cheerleader for a bill that is so devastating to West Virginia and its citizens,” said Del. Mike Pushkin, chair of the Democratic Party, in a statement. “One logical explanation is that she’s holding out for a deal… her vote in exchange for her son’s political advancement. If so, that’s not public service — that’s corruption.”
Moore Capito previously sat as a Republican in the West Virginia House of Delegates from 2016-2023. While there, he served as chair for the House Judiciary Committee.
In 2024, he ran a failed gubernatorial campaign, garnering 27.6% of votes — the second-highest vote getter in the race, which was split between four major candidates — in the Republican primary. He lost to current Gov. Patrick Morrisey, who won 33.3% of Republican primary votes.
In a statement on X, Moore Capito said being nominated by Trump was “an honor” and that “Trump’s commitment to law and order is making our state safer and stronger.”
During his Republican run for governor, Moore Capito regularly made “sanctuary cities” and anti-transgender rhetoric staples of his campaign materials, including in TV ads, mailers and more.
Most recently, Moore Capito works as an attorney representing “publicly-traded and privately-held clients in corporate mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, as well as business structuring, governance, commercial contracts, and real estate transactions” at the Babst Calland law office.
Harvey, Trump’s nominee for U.S. Attorney in the Northern District of West Virginia, has served as the Jefferson County prosecutor since 2017. 
He also currently sits as chairman of the West Virginia First Foundation, a private nonprofit created by the state Legislature in 2023 to distribute an expected $1 billion in opioid settlement funds across West Virginia.
Both Moore Capito and Harvey will have to be confirmed by Congress before taking the offices they’re nominated for.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Central Iowans can fill their pools, use a water slide enjoy other at-home water activities this Fourth of July weekend, though a lawn watering ban for the region remains in effect due to high nitrate levels in source water rivers. 
The update, given at a Tuesday press conference with Central Iowa Water Works, followed the public release of a water quality report, commissioned by Polk County, that tagged agriculture as the main contributor to the nitrate problem. 
Iowa Capital Dispatch obtained a copy of the first-of-its-kind Central Iowa Source Water Research Assessment report earlier this month. According to the report, nearly 80% of nitrates in the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers can be directly traced to agriculture. 
These rivers are the source water for several systems in the Central Iowa Water Works regional water production authority which issued its first lawn watering ban June 12 in order to reduce demand on the system enough to keep water output levels below federal safe drinking water limits, or below 10 milligrams of nitrate per liter. 
Polk County Board Chair Matt McCoy said in a statement about the water quality report, he hopes it will “lead to further investments in improving our watersheds.” 
“We hope that residents and community groups use this report as a guide to advocate and take positive actions to improve water quality at local, state and national level,” McCoy said in the statement.
Tami Madsen, executive director for CIWW, said the regional water group would “need some time” to review the study and determine if, or how, it could utilize the study. 
“We are grateful that there are so many scientists involved in the discussion, but right now, we’re really focused on continuing to provide safe drinking water to all of our 600,000 water users,” she said when asked about the report. 
Madsen said Tuesday she had not spoken with either McCoy or Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig about the report. 
Naig said in a social media post Thursday “no one source or activity is the singular cause or solution” to central Iowa’s high nitrate issue. 
“The blame game is unproductive,” Naig wrote. “There is work to be done on both sides of the point/non-point source equation … Every Iowan has a role to play in improving water quality.” 
Nitrate levels in the Des Moines River and especially in the Raccoon River have fluctuated over the past week, with levels reaching as low as 6 milligrams per liter in the latter. 

CIWW maintains that water remains safe for drinking and cooking. Customers on the system are also able to water their gardens as needed under the ban. 

Ted Corrigan, CIWW’s system operator, said heavy rains filled the Raccoon River almost to full banks, which diluted the nitrate levels. But river fullness doesn’t last. 
“After that surface water runoff passes, the nitrate levels climb back up to where they were before the rain, or sometimes even a little higher because of additional nutrients being washed off the landscape,” Corrigan said. 
As of Tuesday, nitrate concentrations in the Raccoon River were 15.9 mg/l, 12.3 mg/l in the Des Moines River and treated water coming out of CIWW plants were slightly above 7 mg/l. 
Lawn watering ban in place until further notice
Madsen said it is still difficult to articulate a timeline for when the ban will be lifted. She said CIWW would need to observe a “sustained, consistent downward trend” in the source waters before the ban could be lifted. Madsen said the rivers would need to be at least below the federal drinking water standards of 10 mg/l for a period of time. 
Madsen said CIWW also plans to work in a “phased lifting” of the ban to help businesses, namely sod farms and the turf-grass industry, return to work. 
Lawn watering, according to Madsen and CIWW, can account for 30 million to 40 million gallons of water demand, daily, on the system which is why it is the easiest way to cut down demand. 
Madsen said pools and water slides are a “very insignificant fraction” of the total capacity and CIWW is confident it can handle the demand. In an email following the conference, CIWW officials said pool filling should be done “slowly” to help spread out demand.
“We need everyone’s continued help and cooperation in observing the lawn watering ban to begin moving forward with a phased approach to lift restrictions,” Madsen said.

The public outcry was so forceful that the measure’s sponsor pledged to scale back the proposal. Then on Saturday, before an initial U.S. Senate vote on Republicans’ tax and spending cuts package, he withdrew it altogether.
But even though the land sales proposal was defeated, experts say federal lands face a slew of other threats from President Donald Trump’s administration. Agency leaders have proposed rolling back the “Roadless Rule” that protects 58 million acres from logging and other uses. Trump’s Justice Department has issued a legal opinion that the president is allowed to abolish national monuments. Regulators have moved to slash environmental rules to ramp up logging and oil and gas production. And Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce have gutted the ranks of the agencies that manage federal lands.
“This is not over even if the sell-off proposal doesn’t make it,” said John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration. “The whole thing about leasing or selling timber or throwing them open to mining claims, that’s a form of partial privatization. It’s pretty much a giveaway.”
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum has repeatedly described public lands as America’s “balance sheet.” He has argued that some lands could be used to provide housing, while calling for an expansion of mining and oil and gas drilling to increase their economic output.
“President Trump’s energy dominance vision will end those wars abroad, will make life more affordable for every family in America by driving down inflation,” Burgum said before his confirmation hearing.
Public lands advocates are bracing for ongoing battles for the rest of Trump’s term in office. They expect Republicans to add last-minute public lands amendments to other bills moving through Congress, and for land management agencies to attempt to strip protections from other federal lands. Given the vocal backlash to the initial sell-off plan, advocates expect future attempts to be shaped behind closed doors and advanced with little time for opponents to mount a defense.
Meanwhile, they expect states to play a key role in shaping those battles. In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, many leaders from both parties view public lands as special places open to all Americans and critical for clean water, wildlife and tourism. But some conservatives resent the fact that large portions of their states are managed by officials in Washington, D.C., limiting development and private enterprise.
Officials in some states, including Idaho, Utah and Wyoming, have pushed lawsuits or resolutions seeking to force the feds to hand over huge amounts of land. Public land experts say the lawmakers behind those efforts will likely press harder now that Trump is in the White House. Such state-level takeover attempts could shape the proposals that emerge from Trump’s allies in Washington.
 Sell-off proposal

The firestorm over federal lands exploded when U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, introduced legislation that would force the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 3.3 million acres of land. The measure also would direct the agencies to make more than 250 million additional acres eligible for sale.
“We’ve never seen a threat on this magnitude ever,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “There’s been an overwhelming amount of opposition. We’ve seen record-breaking engagement on this issue.”
Lee, a longtime federal lands opponent, claimed the lands were needed for housing and argued the government has been a poor manager of its land.
“Washington has proven time and again it can’t manage this land,” Lee said earlier this month when announcing the proposal. “This bill puts it in better hands.”
But a wide-ranging coalition of opponents argued that the proposal had no protections to ensure the lands would be used for affordable housing, and that many of the parcels eligible for sale had little housing potential. A furious social media campaign highlighted cherished hiking trails, fishing lakes and ski slopes that were in danger of being sold, urging people to call their lawmakers to oppose the measure.
In recent days, Montana Republican U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, as well as Idaho Republican U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch, came out in opposition to the land sale proposal. That put into question whether Lee’s legislation could earn even a simple majority.
Then the Senate parliamentarian ruled the sell-off could not be included in the reconciliation bill without a 60-vote majority. That ruling came a day after Lee posted on social media that he would be making changes to the bill in response to concerns from Hunter Nation, a nonprofit whose board includes Donald Trump Jr.
Lee released a scaled-back measure last week that would exempt national forest lands but would direct the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 1.2 million acres. It would require land for sale to be within five miles of a population center and developed to provide housing.
Public land advocates say Lee’s changes did little to assuage their concerns. They argue that federal land sales or transfers should happen through the current, long-standing process, which requires local stakeholder input and directs the proceeds from land sales to be reinvested into conservation and public access on other parcels.
“It’s the overwhelming belief of hunters and anglers that the budget reconciliation process is not the appropriate vehicle for public land sales,” said O’Dea, with the hunting and fishing group.
On Saturday evening, Lee announced that he was withdrawing the proposal, saying that Senate rules did not allow him to include protections that land would not be sold to foreign interests. But he pledged to continue the battle over federal land ownership, working with Trump to “put underutilized federal land to work for American families.”
 States’ role

While the sell-off proposal aligned with some state officials’ goal of taking over federal lands, some lands experts say private developers would have been the real winner.
“If the lands are transferred to the states without money, the states lose,” said Leshy, the former Interior Department official. “It’s a hit on their budget, which means they’re gonna have to sell them off. If states got a significant amount of public lands, a lot of that would end up in private hands.”
In Utah, where leaders have made the most aggressive push to take over federal lands, lawmakers argue that they could raise lease prices for oil and gas operations, bringing in enough revenue to cover the state’s management costs.
“The policy of the state is to keep these lands open and available to the public,” Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican, told Stateline last month.
O’Dea pointed to an economic analysis of what it would cost Montana to take over federal lands. The report found it would cost the state $8 billion over 20 years to take on wildfire management, deferred maintenance and mine reclamation. He noted that many Western states have sold off a majority of the “trust lands” they were granted at statehood, undermining claims that a state takeover would leave lands in the public domain.
 Other proposals

While Lee’s land sales proposal has gotten the biggest headlines, public land advocates are fighting a multifront battle against the Trump administration’s moves to roll back the protected status of certain lands, slash environmental rules, and expand logging, mining and drilling operations.
“The approach is to throw as much as you can at the wall and see what sticks,” O’Dea said. “There’s only so much you can mobilize opposition to. There’s a huge risk that some of these things could fly under the radar.”
Some conservative states and industry groups say Trump is allowing federal lands to be used to their full economic potential. Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, a Republican, said his constituents are “keenly aware of how the federal government’s ownership of 60 percent of Alaska’s lands can inhibit economic development and cause challenges for our communities.”
Leshy noted that public lands have proven to be a popular cause, but Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce could undermine public confidence that the federal government is capable of managing the land.
“if you make it terrible for long enough, maybe people say, ‘The feds shouldn’t be managing this, they do such a bad job,’” he said.

The program drew scrutiny from the state auditor due to its slow rollout. Now, Vermont State University leaders say they will invest in expanding their dental hygiene program instead.

Despite years of work and more than $2 million spent, the Vermont State Colleges system announced it would stop working to create a dental therapy program. 
“After nearly a decade of diligent effort, it has become clear that the dental therapy program is not a viable path forward to address our state’s acute and pressing oral health workforce challenges,” Elizabeth Mauch, Vermont State Colleges’ chancellor, said in a press release Monday. 
“We are committed to investing where we can have the greatest impact — and that is in our highly successful and expanding Dental Hygiene Program,” Mauch continued.
Vermont State University offers the dental hygiene degree and would have operated the dental therapy program. The school runs an on-campus dental clinic in Williston. 
A dental therapist is a position analogous to a nurse practitioner and allowed to perform more procedures than a dental hygienist. In Vermont, a shortage of dental professionals has contributed to insufficient access to oral care. 
In 2016, the Legislature paved the way for the dental therapy initiative, which would have been the first of its kind in the northeast. Supporters argued the new professional certification would help address the state’s dental needs. The state allocated $400,000 to help establish the college course.
But the program struggled to get off the ground, drawing scrutiny in 2023 from State Auditor Doug Hoffer, who investigated its delayed launch.
The Vermont State Dental Society had opposed the dental therapy licensure, arguing it would lower the standard of oral care in Vermont. 
In a statement, Jeff Blasius, the society’s president, said the group is glad the state college system “is committed to expanding its dental hygiene program and stands ready to assist in that effort any way we can.”
In a feasibility assessment of the cancelled program dated last month, Mauch wrote that the school couldn’t pay would-be staff enough to recruit them away from the dental field and into teaching. And if the college could pay market rate, the per-student cost of the initiative — estimated at $96,000 — would be too much. Plus, the state colleges’ budget problems — and the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic — further undermined development.
According to the assessment, the state college system needs to find $5 million in “structural budget savings” for the new fiscal year that began July 1 to fully balance its budget.
Kayla Dewey, an assistant to Mauch, said in an email that the cost of the program’s development is $2.3 million, but of that total, $1.5 million worth of equipment, supplies and facilities improvement would go toward expanding the state’s dental hygiene program.
That expansion, bolstered by more than $6 million in “newly secured” federal funds, will increase the dental hygiene program’s enrollment from 24 to 48 students starting in the fall of 2027.

While the Democratic-led Senate advanced its general government and education budget proposals months ago, the Republican-led Michigan House of Representatives have yet to put forth their own proposal for general government funding, though the chamber passed its K-12 budget and its higher education budget on June 11. 
Although lawmakers are legally required to pass a budget by the end of July 1, there is no penalty if they exceed the deadline. However, failing to pass a budget before the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30 would result in a government shutdown. 
For months Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) downplayed the July 1 deadline, later shifting course on June 18, telling reporters that the House would make a good faith effort to finalize the state’s education budget on time.

Michigan schools pass their budgets at the end of June, and have faced uncertainty without a deal to work off of. 
Senate PreK-12 Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Darrin Camilleri (D-Trenton) identified Hall as a direct obstacle to negotiations, telling reporters that if he and his House counterpart Rep. Tim Kelly (R-Saginaw Township) were given free rein to negotiate, they’d have something together pretty quickly.
While some schools have already moved forward with their budgets, Brinks and Camilleri both said they’d heard from school leaders that they’d rather have a good budget rather than a rushed budget.

Despite Camilleri’s comments about Hall, he, Brinks and Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing) were reticent when asked about the sticking points in their negotiations out of concern of undermining any active conversations. 
One area of agreement, Camilleri noted, is that both chambers wanted a higher per-pupil allowance for students in the education budget, but getting to a number will be difficult when looking at how much money can be spent in each of those budgets. 
And while there would not be a complete deal by the deadline, Brinks stressed that the Senate would continue to do its due diligence to reach a solution, whether it takes weeks and months.
“We have been in conversation with the three legs of this stool on an ongoing basis, they have been present in all of those and continue to be there. And so I won’t characterize their positions at all, but just to say that we are actively engaged with the House, the [Executive Office of the Governor] and the Senate, and will continue to have those conversations to iron out differences and come to a negotiated agreement on any and all budgets, and to do so as expediently as possible,” Brinks said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_3846-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-01 18:07:52.296274

Infected child may have exposed people in Casper hospital’s ER waiting room to highly contagious virus.
The post Wyoming reports first measles case since 2010 appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s first reported measles case since 2010 may have exposed some people at the state’s largest hospital to the highly contagious virus, the Wyoming Department of Health said Tuesday.
Health officials confirmed the measles case in an unvaccinated child who lives in Natrona County. It’s unclear how that child was exposed to the virus, according to the health department.
Wyoming’s first case in 15 years comes amid increasing measles outbreaks nationally and in the Mountain West. All of Wyoming’s neighbors, save for Idaho and Nebraska, have reported cases in the past four weeks, according to a tally kept by NBC News.
The infected Natrona County child visited the emergency department waiting room at Banner Wyoming Medical Center in Casper on two occasions last week: 

11 a.m. to 1 p.m. on June 24.
12:55 p.m. to 2:55 p.m. on June 25.

People in that waiting room during those times could have been exposed to measles, the health department reported. State health officials were working with the hospital to notify those individuals.
“We are asking individuals who were potentially exposed to self-monitor for measles symptoms for 21 days past the exposure date, and consider avoiding crowded public places or high-risk settings such as daycare centers,” State Health Office Dr. Alexia Harrist said in a statement. 
That’s especially critical for people not vaccinated for the measles, mumps and rubella, commonly known as the MMR vaccine.
Measles is notably contagious: Nine out of 10 people near an infected person will become infected themselves without protection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Measles symptoms, which can appear one or two weeks after exposure, include a rash, high fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes. The virus can cause serious health complications — especially in kids under 5 years old, according to the CDC.
The measles vaccine is highly effective, with two doses preventing measles 97% of the time, Harrist said.
Vaccination rates, however, have been falling in the United States. The number of school-aged children vaccinated against measles fell from 95% to 92% between 2019 and 2023, according to Harvard Health. Herd immunity for measles requires a 95% vaccination rate, the World Health Organization reported.
In Wyoming, vaccine exemptions have risen since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020. Meanwhile, the number of Wyoming kindergartners who received the MMR vaccine has ticked down from 97.5% during the 2012-13 school year to 93.5% in 2023-24, according to CDC data.
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a vaccine skeptic who’s been criticized for his response to the national outbreak and for his inconsistent stance on the measles vaccine in particular.

Panelists included (from left) Jenkins Enterprises owner Steve Jenkins, University of Arkansas at Little Rock economics professor Michael Pakko, Farmers for Free Trade Executive Director Brian Kuehl and state Sen. Blake Johnson. (Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansans are paying millions more for daily necessities like car parts as a result of tariffs placed on imports by the Trump administration, according to a report from Farmers for Free Trade. 
The national nonprofit discussed the report during a town hall meeting Tuesday in North Little Rock. According to the report, Arkansans paid $747,700 in import taxes for vehicle parts in April 2024, with an average tariff rate of 7.3%. In April 2025, that number more than tripled to $3.5 million, with the average tariff rate reaching 27.3%.
Vehicle parts are especially exposed to the tariffs instituted by President Donald Trump in response to what he has described as unfair trade practices by other countries. American car manufacturers have increasingly turned to Canada and Mexico for manufacturing parts for their vehicles in recent years, with more than half of American vehicles and parts coming from those two countries.
But the tariffs — and the back-and-forth they have created for businesses as the administration announced new levies and then backed away from them in order to negotiate — don’t only affect car parts. Arkansas also imports hand tools and air pumps and fans from other countries, and paid large tariff costs as a result.
“Arkansas companies have already experienced sharp tariff increases in March and April of this year. But the breadth of these proposed trade actions — if fully enacted — could result in even more severe cost burdens in the months ahead,” the report said.
The broader trade war also poses risk for agriculture, the state’s largest industry. 
During a panel discussion at Tuesday’s town hall at Jenkins Enterprises, longtime farmer and Corning Republican Sen. Blake Johnson said he believed the tariffs could force 20-30% of U.S. farmers to close their doors by December if relief doesn’t come, even as he said that tariffs were necessary and needed “so we can sell and buy in a fair market.”


Let us know what you think...


 

Farmers face a double-whammy from tariffs. They have high input costs for items like tractor parts and fertilizer that could increase more because of tariffs. Johnson said fertilizer that cost $450 a ton last year now costs close to $650.
Tariffs imposed by other nations in retaliation for U.S. import taxes are another risk. For example, about half of the state’s soybean exports were sent to China last year, according to the report. But after Trump levied tariffs on Chinese goods, the east Asian country imposed reciprocal tariffs on American-grown crops. Soybean exports from the U.S. to China were down 43.7% in April compared to the same time last year.
“That’s why we see the 50% fall off in Arkansas exports of soybeans, because our soybeans now are more expensive when we’re trying to sell into overseas markets [as a result of reciprocal tariffs],” said Brian Kuehl, the executive director of Farmers for Free Trade. 
Trump has argued that businesses should absorb the tariff costs. Short-term pain is necessary for long-term gain, he and his allies have said, in order to bring back manufacturing jobs to the U.S.
However, Steve Jenkins, the owner of Jenkins Enterprises, which makes branded products such as Arkansas Razorbacks flags and coffee cups, said that while the administration’s goal was admirable, it was not necessarily possible.
“People will say to me, ‘Well, why don’t you just buy it in America?’ Because those products are no longer made in America, and one of the reasons for that is simply because we don’t have enough people to do it,” Jenkins said.
The issue, Jenkins said, was that even if manufacturing came back to the U.S., there wouldn’t be a workforce to fill those jobs. As America’s economy developed, he said, manufacturing of many goods was sent to Japan, then Taiwan. And as those countries’ economies developed and began focusing on more complex products, some of that manufacturing then made its way to China.
“We’ve got jobs in America, we don’t have workers…those jobs are not going to come back to America,” he said. “They’re not going to be available in America, and we just don’t have the workers to support it.”
The U.S. unemployment rate was 4.2% in May, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Meanwhile, existing U.S. manufacturing has continued to contract, according to the Institute for Supply Management. Respondents to its June survey said broad uncertainty as a result of the tariffs has impacted their orders.

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Provisions in the new tax and spending bill passed by the U.S. Senate early Tuesday would go even further than the House bill in removing health care and other benefits from immigrants with legal status.
The House version of the massive tax and spending bill penalized states providing health care for some immigrants with legal status as well as those that chose to spend state money to enroll immigrants without legal status in Medicaid.
But the Senate bill is even tougher on immigrants here legally and illegally, reducing benefits for most refugees and immigrants on humanitarian parole, including Afghans and Ukrainians who helped the United States in wars overseas and in return were promised safe haven and a safety net in the United States.
The Senate bill also cuts state reimbursement for emergency care in the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That would force those states to pay more for emergency care for immigrants, cut back services or drop out of Medicaid expansion, a potentially catastrophic move for low-income U.S. citizens as well as new immigrants.
The bill passed with three dissenting Republican votes, from U.S. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Vice President JD Vance broke the tie. The bill, officially the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” now returns to the House for final passage before going to President Donald Trump to be signed.
States face hard choices as budgets expected to tighten

Advocates and experts see repercussions as refugees and other legal immigrants lose health insurance and turn to already-stressed hospitals and charities for help. It could be a nail in the coffin for some rural hospitals that are in financial trouble and scaling back services. Hospitals are required to serve anyone who arrives for emergency care, regardless of their ability to pay.
“In our state, it’s going to be absolutely devastating for rural hospitals,” said Kate Woomer-Deters, a senior attorney at the North Carolina Justice Center’s Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Refugees are not going to go home just because they lost their health care coverage. They’re still going to be showing up at the door of hospitals and clinics needing care.”
Some groups, such as Afghans, Ukrainians and Iraqis, were often brought here after helping the U.S. in war efforts, putting their lives in danger and making life in their home country untenable.
“In the case of the Afghans, this is pretty much a knife in the back to those folks who helped the United States when the United States needed help in their country,” said David Meyer, a board member of the Bloomington Refugee Support Network in Indiana, where he personally helps seven refugee families from Afghanistan, Honduras, Iraq, Nicaragua and Syria.
The Senate bill takes Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and even food stamps off the table for most refugees. There are a few narrow exceptions for people with green cards, some Cuban migrants waiting for citizenship, and some Micronesians and Marshall Islands natives with treaty rights, said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
That also applies to immigrants with legal status who don’t have green cards: people with asylum, immigrant victims of domestic violence, immigrant victims of sex trafficking and parolees — such as Afghans — admitted due to urgent humanitarian reasons, as well as to refugees.










It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.


– Shelby Gonzales, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities


“There’s going to be more emergency health care needs because uninsured people will be delaying care,” Gonzales said. “It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.”
The bill also cuts funding for expansion states to pay for emergency care in hospitals. Increased costs could force some states to drop Medicaid expansion altogether, spreading the pain to low-income U.S. citizens as well, Gonzales said.
“It’s one more reason states are looking at their budgets and they’re having to make decisions about their Medicaid expansion program,” Gonzales said.
In Indiana, Meyer said, Afghan women especially often need food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to get by at first. It takes them a long time to learn to read and write since they were not allowed to attend any school under the Taliban.
“They arrived in our community totally illiterate in their native language and starting from scratch learning English, so that’s a huge impediment to being gainfully employed,” Meyer said. Even once they’ve become self-sufficient enough to get off food stamps and Medicaid, many still need the support of the Affordable Care Act to get health care.
Removing all subsidized health care “would have a devastating effect on those families, and not just Afghans but Syrians, people from the Democratic Republic of Congo and others that have been relocated to south-central Indiana,” Meyer said.
‘Big Beautiful Bill’ dings states that offer health care to some immigrants here legally

Indiana hosted more than 10,500 of the nearly 460,000 refugees who arrived in the United States between 2013 and 2023, according to a 2023 report from the nonprofit Immigration Research Initiative. In fiscal 2024, another 1,380 arrived in Indiana, mostly from Congo and Burma, but including 90 people from Afghanistan, according to State Department records.
In North Carolina, there were 276 new Afghan refugees in fiscal 2024 among 2,730 total new refugees. Even professional Afghans such as doctors and lawyers struggle at first in low-wage jobs, said Woomer-Deters, of the North Carolina Justice Center. It takes time for them to get accreditation and language skills to practice their professions here, she said.
“A lot of these folks need their food stamps, Medicaid — they need these programs for an adjustment period when they get here. And these are people we’ve invited to come and have vetted,” she said.
A Congressional Budget Office report June 29 estimated that almost 12 million people, including 1.4 million immigrants covered by state-only programs, would lose health insurance under the Senate plan.
A Republican response to an earlier CBO report emphasized that the bill would save states $13.1 billion in Medicaid spending over 10 years, “freeing up resources they can choose to reinvest to further strengthen care for the most vulnerable Americans.”
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, however, called that conclusion misleading in its own response in turn.
“These savings would largely result from millions of people losing health coverage — hardly an outcome worth celebrating,” the response said.
More states offer health care coverage for certain immigrants, noncitizens

Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, said there was one small positive change in the Senate version compared to the House version.
States will no longer be penalized for using the option to cover some immigrant children and pregnant women.
And the Senate version would not penalize expansion states for offering Medicaid to immigrants on humanitarian parole, but only because that help for parolees was ended in entirely, along with help for refugees and other kind of immigrants with legal status who lack green cards, Cuello said.
“In other words, they are blocking all paths to health care,” Cuello said in an emailed statement. “This is not an attack on the undocumented. It’s an attack on lawfully present immigrants.”

Free.,Trump administration tells states it’s freezing $6.8 billion for K-12 school programs,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-tells-states-its-freezing-68-billion-k-12-school-programs,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has put on hold $6.8 billion in federal funds for K-12 schools, according to an Education Department notice obtained by States Newsroom.The agency informed states on Monday that it would be withholding funding for several programs, including before- and after-school programs, migrant education and English-language learning, among other initiatives.But the agency notified states just a day ahead of July 1 — the date these funds are typically sent out as educators plan for the coming school year.“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the Education Department wrote to states.The notice, which did not provide any timeline, said the funds are under review and “decisions have not yet been made concerning submissions and awards for this upcoming academic year.”The affected programs, according to the Democrats on the Senate Appropriations Committee, include:Title I-C, on migrant educationTitle II-A, on improving the effectiveness of teachers and school leadersTitle III-A, on English language acquisitionTitle IV-A, on STEM education, college and career counseling and other activitiesTitle IV-B, on before- and after-school programs and summer school programsGrants geared toward adult education and literacy programsStates have been on the lookout for these funds. For instance, just last week, Oklahoma’s Department of Education reported that it had yet to get money from the federal government for migrant education, English language acquisition and other programs, according to Oklahoma Voice. ‘Winding down’ the departmentAdding fuel to the fire, Trump is looking to eliminate all these programs as part of his fiscal 2026 budget request. That wish list, according to a department summary, calls for $12 billion in total spending cuts at the agency.That proposed $12 billion cut “reflects an agency that is responsibly winding down,” the document notes.Meanwhile, a coalition of 16 states is also suing the Trump administration over the cancellation earlier this year of roughly $1 billion in school mental health grants — a different piece of school funding — to try to restore that money.The lawsuit was filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington in Seattle. The states include California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Mexico, New York, Nevada, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Wisconsin.Uncertainty createdIn a Tuesday statement, Washington state U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate spending panel, urged the Trump administration to immediately release the frozen funds.“President Trump himself signed this funding into law — but that isn’t stopping him from choking off resources to support before and after school programs, help students learn, support teachers in the classroom, and a lot more,” Murray said. “The uncertainty he has created has already forced districts to delay hiring and other initiatives to help students. The only question left now is how much more damage this administration wants to inflict on our public schools.”“Local school districts can’t afford to wait out lengthy court proceedings to get the federal funding they’re owed — nor can they make up the shortfall, especially not at the drop of a pin,” Murray added.Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, blasted the administration’s actions, saying this is “another illegal usurpation of the authority of the Congress” and “directly harms the children in our nation.”“K-12 public school leaders across the country who should have been able to start planning months ago for the summer and the upcoming school year are instead left mired in financial uncertainty,” added Weingarten, who leads one of the largest teachers unions in the country.Approved by CongressCarissa Moffat Miller, CEO of the Council of Chief State School Officers, said “the administration must make the full extent of title funding available in a timely manner,” in a statement shared with States Newsroom on Tuesday.“These funds were approved by Congress and signed into law by President Trump in March,” Miller said. “Schools need these funds to hire key staff and educate students this summer and in the upcoming school year.""In response to a request for comment on the frozen funds, the Education Department referred States Newsroom to the Office of Management and Budget, which is responsible for administering the federal budget and overseeing the performance of departments throughout the federal government.OMB did not immediately respond to States Newsroom’s inquiry.",,,,2025-07-01 18:07:52.296274

(Dan Koeck/For the North Dakota Monitor)FARGO — North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong on Tuesday said the state didn’t need to collect a lot of data to realize that farmers have an urgent need for grain storage after storms swept across the state last month. 
The state has responded with a program to help farmers pay for temporary storage through low-interest loans and repair and replace damaged farm assets such as barns, irrigation systems, bins and grain-handling equipment.
He called the program an area “where the state could do the most good, the fastest,” Armstrong said in a press conference at North Dakota State University. 
Storm impact on North Dakota agriculture ‘tremendous,’ ag commissioner says

Farmers can apply for the Grain Storage and Facility Rebuilder Program starting July 9 by contacting their banker. 
Farmers can get up to a $150,000 loan for temporary storage. 
The repair and rebuild program will take into account insurance settlements from the storm.
If the cost of rebuilding exceeds the insurance payment by 25% of the farmer’s net worth or $500,000 (whichever is less) collateral may be required.
Both loan options have a maximum term of 24 months at an interest rate of 2% while requiring an annual interest-only payment. All remaining principal and interest will be due when the loan matures. 
The program will be paid for with up to $37 million from the state’s emergency fund and will be administered by the Bank of North Dakota. 
The Bank of North Dakota will also coordinate directly with grain elevators impacted by storms.
“We wanted this to be as flexible as possible,” Armstrong said. 
More information on the program from BND can be found at bnd.nd.gov/gsfr.

High winds and tornadoes on June 20-21 damaged property and crops from near Bismarck across the eastern half of the state and into Minnesota. Four people were killed by the storms.
Steve Johnson, a farmer from Page, northwest of Fargo, joined Armstong Tuesday in announcing the loan program. 
He had storage for 400,000 bushels of grain. After the storm, he has zero. 
The storms hit with corn and soybean harvest about two months away. Small grains, such as wheat, will be harvested even sooner. 
North Dakota State University Extension is gathering data on storm damage to agriculture with more than 100 responses so far. Miranda Meehan, the disaster education coordinator for Extension, said Tuesday that data will be aggregated and reported at the county level, with no information collected that would identify an individual farm. 
Armstrong declared a statewide disaster after the storms.
Tuesday, he encouraged all farmers with damage to talk with their banker about the state program as a first step in recovery from storms. 
He said he has been in contact with Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins about federal assistance but said the state needs to compile more information. 
He said he told Rollins, “I don’t know what I am asking for yet but you’re going to get an ask.”

Kevin Stitt explains the new safety guidelines for Oklahoma events developed by an advisory council he led on June 5, 2025 at the state Capitol in Oklahoma City. (Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Gov. Kevin Stitt on Tuesday praised a ruling by the Oklahoma Supreme Court that said the state can impose income taxes on tribal members living and working on a reservation.
Stitt called the 6-3 ruling a big win for the state.
“Tribal governments, liberal groups, and some elected officials have pushed for special tax exemptions that would create a two-tiered system – one set of rules for tribal citizens and another for everyone else,” Stitt said. “That’s wrong. It would divide our state and weaken the public services every family relies on.”
The case was closely watched because it could have expanded the landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling in McGirt to civil matters.
The McGirt ruling held that the state could not prosecute certain crimes committed by tribal members on the reservation.
“This ruling makes it clear that attempts to expand McGirt into civil and tax matters have no basis in the law,” Stitt said.
In its Tuesday ruling, the Oklahoma Supreme Court found that McGirt, decided in 2020, was narrowly limited to criminal jurisdiction under the Major Crimes Act.
“The United States Supreme Court’s declaration – 113 years after statehood – that nearly half of Oklahoma is a reservation is unprecedented,” the ruling said. “To date, the United States Supreme Court has not extended its ruling to McGirt beyond the Major Crimes Act. To date, the United States Supreme Court has not extended its ruling in McGirt to the State’s civil or taxing jurisdiction. And it is not this Court’s place to do so.”
Alicia Stroble had sought a tax exemption for years 2017, 2018, and 2019, saying she was exempt because she was a Muscogee (Creek) Nation member, worked for the tribe and lived on her tribes’ land.
The Muscogee Nation was disappointed by the ruling, said Principal Chief David W. Hill in a statement.
“Ever since the McGirt ruling, we have seen Oklahoma state courts go through legal gymnastics to come up with results that are not in compliance with federal law and that do not even follow pre-McGirt state court precedent on the limits of state authority in Indian country,” Hill said. “The Stroble ruling is another example of those antics.”
The tribe is reviewing the decision and preparing for its next steps, he said.
Michael D. Parks, the attorney representing Stroble, did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)You wouldn’t know a contested hike in state taxes on fuel began Tuesday by scanning local gas stations.
Average gas prices in Rhode Island dropped 1 cent per gallon from Monday, and were 2 cents less than the daily average in neighboring Massachusetts, according to AAA. 
Yet the extra 3-cents-per-gallon tax — bringing the per-gallon tax to 41 cents — drew sharp criticism from Gov. Dan McKee. The gas tax was already scheduled to rise by 1 cent per gallon, from 38 to 39 cents, on July 1 before the legislature stepped in to aid the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA).

In a June 25 press conference, McKee blasted lawmakers for “unnecessary” tax and fee increases in the approved fiscal 2026 budget, including on gasoline.
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi countered that the revenue from the extra tax on motorists was crucial to shoring up the state’s cash-strapped public bus system.
“RIPTA can’t afford service cuts,” Shekarchi said in an interview Tuesday. “They’re a lifeline for a lot of people.”
But the road to fiscal solvency for RIPTA requires more than raising prices at the pump. Looking to close a remaining $10 million fiscal 2026 shortfall, RIPTA is eyeing service cuts and fare increases, with a series of public hearings starting July 28.
Annual revenue from the state gas tax is already falling amid a rise in electric vehicles and a work-from-home culture that decenters driving. Transit advocates insist the state needs to look for alternative solutions.
“The gas tax is a losing proposition when relying on it to fund transportation infrastructure or public transit because it’s a melting ice cube,” said John Flaherty, senior adviser for Grow Smart RI. “The question is how to fund public transportation in a more stable and robust way, without there being a lot of pain and tradeoffs.”
McKee says the pain has already begun. He insisted the hike in state gas taxes would hurt working families while putting Rhode Island “out of line” with neighboring states. 
Before Tuesday’s increase, Rhode Island already ranked 14th among states for motor fuel taxes, according to the Tax Foundation. Massachusetts remains at 27 cents per gallon, while Connecticut sits at 52 cents per gallon, including a state excise tax and a separate, 8% wholesale tax on petroleum products.
Flaherty acknowledged that Rhode Island’s higher gas tax, compared with Massachusetts, might sway drivers to fill up across state lines. Others may not even notice.
“Some people won’t give it another thought, they just go where it’s convenient,” Flaherty said. “Then you have people who have apps on their phone to check the price at every gas station.”
Shekarchi is among the latter, favoring Harss gas station on Warwick Avenue in Warwick for its competitive prices. He was unsympathetic to McKee’s declaration that raising gas taxes would hurt working families.
“I drive down West Shore Road in Warwick and pass 10 gas stations,” Shekarchi said. “The cost varies by 10 to 12 cents, depending on where you go.”

Will motorists even notice?
Compared with a new, $4 per person monthly fee on state health insurance premiums, the gas tax increase is not a noticeable burden for most people, said Michael DiBiase, president and CEO of the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council. 
The business-backed policy group typically opposes tax increases that could jeopardize the state’s economic standing. But DiBiase supported the move to raise gas taxes to create a sustainable revenue source for transportation — something the state has been sorely lacking.
In the fiscal 2025 budget, lawmakers used one-time federal pandemic aid to help RIPTA fill its deficit, making a return to the table inevitable.










The gas tax is a losing proposition when relying on it to fund transportation infrastructure or public transit because it’s a melting ice cube.


– John Flaherty, senior adviser for Grow Smart RI


Throughout the 2025 session, lawmakers considered a host of ideas for more alternative RIPTA funding sources — a straight allocation of general revenue, money from fees on rideshare companies, a mileage-based user fee, and a greater share of the state gas tax. 
Lawmakers last updated the state’s century-old gas tax in 2014, calling for a biennial adjustment in the per-gallon rate based on the Consumer Price Index. But subsequent adjustments only considered inflation from the year immediately prior, rather than the two prior years.
Sen. Samuel Zurier, a Providence Democrat, introduced legislation to ensure that the two prior years are included in biennial inflation adjustments. Zurier’s bill failed to advance out of committee, but he viewed the budget provision increasing the gas tax for RIPTA’s benefit as achieving the same goal.
Zurier sponsored a second bill, which also stalled in committee, to increase RIPTA’s share of gas tax revenue. 
A short history of the gas tax
Money from the motor fuel tax has historically been divided across a host of state agencies and programs. More than half of funds go to the Rhode Island Department of Transportation, with a 27% share to RIPTA. Other beneficiaries include the Rhode Island Bridge and Turnpike Authority, the Office of Healthy Aging, and the Underground Storage Review Board, which receives half of a 1 cent-per-gallon environmental fee tacked on to state gas charges to address underground storage tank leaks. The other half of the 1-cent environmental fee has gone to RIPTA since 2009. A portion of the gas tax revenue is also used to pay down debt service on state transportation bonds backed by future federal highway funding.
The inflation adjustment approved in 2014 has gradually increased the per-gallon tax, from 33 cents when it took effect on July 1, 2015, to 38 cents as of July 1, 2025, according to the Rhode Island Division of Taxation. All of the extra revenue has gone to the state transportation agency, which received 21.25 cents per gallon in fiscal 2024. RIPTA, by comparison, has flatlined at 9.75 cents per gallon — including its 50 percent share of the environmental fee — since fiscal 2010.
With the extra 2 cents per gallon tax that began Tuesday, RIPTA now receives 11.75 cents in tax revenue on every gallon of gas, which is estimated to generate $8.7 million in fiscal 2026. An increased share of the state’s Highway Maintenance Account, funded by vehicle registration fees, will bring in an extra $5.9 million for RIPTA in fiscal 2026, for a combined $14.8 million boost in the state budget.
Shekarchi backed the pair of structural changes to state funding as “the most fair” option for helping to close RIPTA’s deficit.
“I stand behind it,” he said. “I’d do it again tomorrow.”

Efficiency study or ‘downsizing study’?
But Shekarchi also echoed McKee’s emphasis on a not-yet-complete study of agency operations to address the remaining shortfall.  
“RIPTA has to run efficiently,” Shekarchi said, naming a slight increase in ridership fares, smaller buses and trimming management as potential ways to cut agency costs. He singled out the agency’s partnership with Rhode Island FC, offering free bus rides to attendees at the soccer team’s home games at its new Pawtucket stadium, as a questionable choice given its financial straits.
“That needs to be justified,” he said.
Shekarchi also flagged the agency’s decision to hire a lobbyist to advocate for its funding needs during the 2025 session. RIPTA hired New Harbor Group on May 23, with an $175 hourly rate, according to the state’s public lobbyist tracker. An initial filing from May 2025 shows RIPTA did not give New Harbor any money for lobbying work that month.
David Preston, president of New Harbor Group, said the firm’s agreement with RIPTA is for public relations, not lobbying. Seth Klaiman, executive vice president for New Harbor, registered as a state lobbyist for RIPTA as a precautionary measure due to conversations with lawmakers about the agency’s budget, Preston said in an email Tuesday afternoon.
Cristy Raposo Perry, a RIPTA spokesperson, did not directly respond to Shekarchi’s comments.
“We appreciate the continued support of the Speaker and the General Assembly,” Raposo Perry said in an emailed statement Tuesday. “We remain focused on using these resources as effectively as possible, guided in part by an ongoing efficiency study focused on optimizing operations. Our top priority is to grow ridership and ensure that public transit continues to align with and support the state’s broader economic goals.” 
Flaherty suggested the oft-audited quasi-public agency has little if any operational wiggle room, evidenced by the study consultant recommending service cuts and layoffs to address the immediate, remaining agency shortfall. 
“I honestly don’t look at this as an efficiency study, I look at it as a downsizing study,” he said. “It’s a roadmap of sorts about what services the agency can cut first while minimizing pain or damage.” 
Even with the extra gas tax money, Flaherty feared deeper cuts ahead, especially given the state’s own projections for diminishing gas tax revenue. Estimates adopted by state budget analysts in May projected the revenue stream will drop by more than $7 million through the end of the decade. The estimates do not reflect the extra 2 cents per gallon included in the fiscal 2026 budget, which will appear in biannual projections in November.
Flaherty backed a “value capture” approach already used by other local and state governments in which area-specific taxes and fees on land and development near transit are used to pay for transit operations. Zurier, meanwhile, planned to spend his summer break researching what he suspects is an increasing share of state funds for federally funded highway projects, outstripping spending for public transit.
Shekarchi said he was open to ideas for more funding for RIPTA.
“Every year, everybody comes asking for more money, no matter who it is,” he said.

“I’ll also tell you some of the GREAT things I’ve already done on Trade, especially as it relates to Farmers,” Trump wrote. “You are going to be very happy with what I say — Should be a BIG Crowd!”
Some farmers, agricultural producers and other business owners in Iowa and worldwide expressed concerns about Trump’s tariff plans earlier this year, when he had announced plans to set a baseline 10% levy on all international imports beginning in early April. Though he set a 90-day pause shortly after the announcement on many of these tariffs, that break is set to expire July 9.
The window before tariffs are set to go back into place was meant to give time to countries that have said they are open to negotiating new trade deals. The president has said this deadline could be extended, but has not offered additional details on timelines or ongoing negotiations.
While tariffs have not been finalized for many countries, Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcement and levies on certain goods already in place caused massive economic unrest earlier this year. In Iowa, many local business owners and farmers said the tariffs could cause disruptions to their businesses, and lead to higher costs for consumers. A study from the nonprofit advocacy group Farmers for Free Trade found tariff costs for Iowa importers increased by 304%, roughly $68 million, from April 2024 to April 2025.
There are also agricultural producers who say tariffs have not significantly impacted their business outlooks. In the pork industry, where 25% of U.S. pork production is within the export market and 55% of exported U.S. produced pork going to China, some business owners and producers said profitability is up despite trade war concerns.

(Photo Illustration by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Georgia kids can continue liking, commenting, and subscribing without notifying their parents this summer after a federal judge put a temporary hold on the state’s new social media age verification law while the case moves forward — but the bill’s author says a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling bodes well for the ban.
Senate Bill 351, which was set to go into effect July 1, would require social media companies to get a parent’s permission before they allowed a minor to create an account. All Georgians would also have to verify their age before accessing websites with material deemed harmful to minors.
On Thursday, Judge Amy Totenberg of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia ruled in favor of NetChoice, a coalition of social media companies, who argued that the law as written would likely violate free speech protections.
“The Court does not doubt the dangers posed by young people’s overwhelming exposure to social media,” Totenberg wrote. “But, in its effort to aid parents, the Act’s solution creates serious obstacles for all Georgians, including teenagers, to engage in protected speech activities and would highly likely be unconstitutional.”
Totenberg said the law would curb the speech rights of young people, impose a burden on all Georgians to participate in online speech, potentially put Georgians’ private data at risk, and step into parents’ decisions on how to raise their children.
But Totenberg said the law’s biggest downfall comes in its long list of exemptions, which include news, sports, and entertainment sites, interactive gaming platforms, streaming services, and more.
“For example, SB 351 would presumably apply to the Georgia Bulldogs Reddit forum, which features user-generated content. But it would exempt Barstool Sports, which features provider-generated content. It would apply to news coverage posted by users on X, but not news coverage posted by The New York Times to its own liveblog.”
Totenberg found that amounts to a content-based restriction on speech, which triggers a higher level of scrutiny – which she said Georgia’s law doesn’t meet.
“Because of the enormous burdens imposed on the First Amendment rights of children, adults, and social media platforms — along with the significant tailoring issues inherent in the law — even the State’s serious interest here cannot justify SB 351 under the First Amendment’s rigorous standards,” she said.
NetChoice celebrated the win in a statement.
“This is a major victory for free speech, constitutional clarity and the rights of all Georgians to engage in public discourse without intrusive government overreach,” said Chris Marchese, NetChoice director of litigation. “We are grateful the court recognized what we’ve long argued: SB 351 isn’t just poorly crafted — it’s profoundly unconstitutional.”
Short-lived win
But the bill’s author, state Sen. Jason Anavitarte, a Dallas Republican who is now the Senate majority leader, said their victory is likely to be short-lived.
In a statement, Anavitarte pointed to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that backed a Texas state law requiring age verification for pornographic websites.
“One day after liberal Obama Appointee, US District Court Judge, Amy Totenberg, issued an injunction preventing Georgia’s age verification law from taking effect, The Supreme Court found that laws like SB 351 ‘have only an incidental effect on protected speech and that The First Amendment leaves undisturbed States’ traditional power to prevent minors from accessing speech that is obscene from their perspective….Requiring proof of age is an ordinary and appropriate means of enforcing an age-based limit on obscenity to minors,’” Anavitarte said.
“Based on Friday’s ruling at The Supreme Court, Judge Totenberg should be left with no choice but to allow SB 351 to go into effect,” he added. “I am immensely grateful for Justice Clarence Thomas’ well written opinion and remain optimistic that SB 351 will go into effect in its entirety.”
A Texas court issued a similar finding, uphold that state’s social media law.
Attorney General Chris Carr’s Office said Carr intends to appeal the ruling.
“We will continue to defend commonsense measures that empower parents and protect our children online,” said Carr spokesperson Kara Murray.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-01 20:57:10+00:00,CT Mirror,Lamont doubles down on natural gas after signing two climate-related bills,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/01/ned-lamont-ct-climate-bills-natural-gas/,"Immediately after signing the bills, Lamont reiterated his support for a chief cause of concern among climate advocates: fracked natural gas.","Within minutes if signing legislation on Tuesday that pledged to put Connecticut on a path toward reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, Gov. Ned Lamont flipped the script by reiterating his support for one of climate advocates’ chief causes of concern: an expansion of pipelines carrying fracked natural gas.
Specifically, the Democratic governor hinted that he’d been engaged in talks with the Trump administration and state leaders in New York about building or expanding pipelines that could deliver more gas to Connecticut and the rest of New England.
“We’ll see, but it’s back on the table,” Lamont told reporters, without offering further details. 
Lamont’s comments were delivered immediately after he signed two of Democrats’ priority climate bills passed during this year’s legislative session. The first, House Bill 5004, set the state’s net-zero emissions target and added incentives for solar canopies, energy-efficient heating and cooling systems, green jobs and sustainability-focused businesses.
The term “net-zero” refers to a point where any greenhouse gases produced by humans are offset with carbon-capture technologies or natural means such as reforestation. There are no penalties under the bill if the state fails to reach that target. 
The other legislation, Senate Bill 9, included several climate-resiliency measures along with tougher restrictions on the use of rat poisons and class of pesticides known as neonicotinoids.  
The juxtaposition between the governor’s praise of the climate legislation and his embrace of natural gas was jarring for several of the advocates who have fought for years against the expansion of gas pipelines. They argue pipelines can leak potent methane gases, and increase dependency on fossil fuel power plants, making it harder for the state to fulfill its promise to slash emissions.
“It was horrific to hear,” said Sam Dynowski, director of the Sierra Club’s Connecticut chapter, who had posed for photos behind the governor as he signed both bills into law Tuesday.
“It’s as dirty as coal when you add up the combustion emissions and the leaks,” Dynowski said. “So we cannot bring more gas into Connecticut if we really want to solve the climate crisis.” 
It was not the first time that Lamont has angered advocates with his pitch for natural gas. As if sensing that pushback again on Tuesday, Lamont said that a larger gas supply is necessary to wean the region off its reliance on aging, oil-fired plants that are needed to meet demand in winter months.
“We’re taking out some things that are even more polluting,” Lamont said. 
“Long term, what it means if we got more gas up from, say, the Pennsylvania area, you know, we’re working on that,” the governor added. “We’re working with all the different players. That doesn’t take our eye off the ball, what we’ve got to do as a state to make sure we stay green and clean.”
On Tuesday, Lamont was asked about a reported deal between Donald J. Trump’s Interior Department and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul to allow work to resume on a offshore wind farm, Empire Wind 1. As part of that deal, Trump administration officials said Hochul had signaled her willingness to move forward on pipeline projects that could deliver gas to New England.
Hochul’s office denied that any explicit agreement had been made to approve a pipeline, according to Politico.
Lamont, who met with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in Washington earlier this year, said Tuesday that he had been “clued in” to those discussions around wind and natural gas.
“We were really cheering on Kathy Hochul to make sure that that Empire Wind kept going,” Lamont said. “Trump pulled it back, then he allowed it to go back again, maybe with some relief on what they want to do on natural gas.”
The Department of the Interior did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.  
One project mentioned by several outlets as a potential chip in negotiations between the states and the federal government is the so-called Constitution Pipeline, which would carry fracked gas from Pennsylvania to upstate New York, where it would connect with existing pipelines serving Connecticut and New England.
The developer behind that proposed pipeline, The Williams Companies, submitted applications with state and federal regulators earlier this year to approve the pipeline, with an estimated completion date in 2027.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_5581-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-01 17:07:53.475258

July 1, 2025. | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceElection clerks from across the state spoke up before the House Election Integrity Committee Tuesday, offering their support for a piece of legislation aimed at preserving their say in pre-election testing of voting machines. 
Committee Chair Rachelle Smit (R-Martin), a former election clerk, told her colleagues that for years, local clerks have successfully conducted logic and accuracy testing of their machines by working with vendors of their choosing. However, Smit raised concerns that a recent contract acquired by the Michigan Secretary of State could require clerks to use only their contracted vendor to generate test decks. 
“This represents a fundamental shift from our local control to state mandated centralization, a shift that raises concerns about the integrity, transparency and fiscal responsibility. The bill before us today provides very clear, common sense protections that preserve local autonomy while ensuring proper standards. Specifically it protects local choice,” Smit said.

Smit’s House Bill 4602 states that the Secretary of State cannot bar or restrict local clerks from using any lawful source for creating testing materials.
“Our local clerks are directly accountable to their communities. This legislation ensures that they retain the tools and autonomy necessary to fulfill that responsibility. When problems arise, clerks need direct control over the processes and relationships with their vendors,” Smit said, later emphasizing that local jurisdictions operate under tight budgets. 
However, Smit’s proposal drew some questions, both from the committee’s Democratic members and representatives from the Department of State. 
State Rep. Matt Koleszar (D-Plymouth) questioned if Smit’s proposal would eliminate all oversight on these kinds of vendors, raising concerns that this could benefit bad actors, or vendors who simply are not good at supplying testing materials. 
However, Smit said the election commission in each county would retain their oversight under her bill.

Adam Fracassi, deputy director of elections for the Michigan Bureau of Elections broke down the contract with Ballot IQ, which is intended to create an expanded form used in testing the voting machines used in the state. This expanded deck would include an additional test to ensure results between different races have not been swapped, he said. 
“The reason for this is in an effort to provide just a stronger safeguard against errors, a stronger safeguard against the processes, and enhance the integrity of our election,” Fracassi said. 
As the bureau begins to roll pieces of this new system out, Fracassi said some clerks were interested in having this deck available as an option, and the bureau is looking at ways to make the test deck available to them. 
“The idea is that this test deck would be available to clerks without cost, so it’s an option for them to be able to utilize it to save them money,” he said.
Having this test deck as an option, not as a requirement, would offer clerks another resource in the testing process, Fracassi said. 
The second part of the contract with Ballot IQ would be to develop an electronic system for clerks to submit ballot proofs to the Bureau of Elections, so the bureau can review them more efficiently.

Michigan’s election law requires county clerks to submit ballot proofs for approval, which Fracassi emphasized is largely done manually, and must be done in a very short period of time. 
“One of the other requirements for the contract is to provide us with additional resources to be able to streamline that a little bit better, to make it faster for us to review ballot proofs, and to make it easier for clerks to transmit the information to us and us to transmit the information back to the county clerks,” Fracassi explained. 
Erin Schor, the Michigan Department of State’s legislative policy director, echoed earlier concerns about Smit’s bill stripping oversight over testing vendors, asking for a potential change to clarify that these vendors would still be subject to the Department’s rules on the testing process.
 The department also holds concerns about one of the bill’s provisions barring the Secretary of State from centralizing ballot information for the purpose of creating test decks. 
“It would be one thing if that just talked about mandating, but I’m concerned that with the language, the way it’s written, if we were in a situation where best practice required Michigan to update our rules, and for some reason, there was only one vendor that was prepared to meet the new threshold at that time, we would not be able to update the rules to meet the best practice,” Schor said. 
Schor also raised concerns about the bill’s requirements for the test deck creation process to be reproducible, noting that the rules they had recently put forth on election system testing were not that specific as far as how to set up the math and programming to create these decks.

While the Department of State did not offer a position on the bill, multiple election clerks offered their support to Smit’s legislation.
Kent County Clerk Lisa Posthumus Lyons, a former Republican state representative, told members of the committee that the contract’s requirements around streamlining the process of sending and keeping ballot proofs means they want official ballots with timing marks, not valid proofs. 
This creates significant security concerns, Posthumus Lyons warned, as holding a centralized record of ballots could result in nefarious action, where these ballots are duplicated and sent out.
She also emphasized that local clerks know what works best for their jurisdictions. 
“I and my colleagues have spent years promoting how transparent testing of our equipment before each and every election ensures the accuracy of our votes. We’ve also touted our decentralized process as an important element of election security,” Posthumus Lyons said. “We can and we should seek to improve our process, but we shouldn’t do so at the expense of foregoing these foundational, tried and true elements that work so well.”
Oakland County Clerk and Register of Deeds Lisa Brown opened her testimony, joking that her agreement with Posthumus Lyons on policy was a historic moment given the pair’s past on opposing sides of the House. 
However, she emphasized that this policy is not a partisan issue, and is solely aimed at preserving the authority of local election commissions to create and oversee their testing process. 
“I understand that it’s being said that it’s an option right now. I’ve also heard that it’s eventually going to be mandated, and that is so problematic,” Brown said, noting her discomfort in sending her ballots to someone she did not contract with. 
“I think that’s problematic. I think it’s overreach, and I think that there is a security issue to it,” she said. 
Extending terms for local office
Prior to hearing testimony on Smit’s policy, the committee also took comments on House Bills 4358, 4359, 4698, 4699, which Rep. Mike Hoadley (R-Au Gres) said would extend the terms of office for various local elected officials until after election results have been certified by the appropriate board of canvassers. 
Under Proposal 2, approved by voters in the 2022 election, clerks are permitted to tally absentee ballots submitted by servicemembers and overseas voters that are postmarked by election day and received up to six days after election day. 
However, local officials take office not long after the election, meaning they can take office before these ballots are even counted, Hoadley noted.  
The bills also received strong support from the clerks in attendance.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)A former South Dakota Department of Social Services employee was sentenced Tuesday to seven years in prison after earlier being convicted of stealing $1.78 million in state and federal funds from the department’s division of Child Protection Services.
“This jury conviction and sentence confirm that public trust is not for sale,” said state Attorney General Marty Jackley in a press release. 
Lonna Carroll, age 68, of Algona, Iowa, was sentenced in Hughes County Circuit Court to pay back the entire amount of her theft and serve 13 years in prison, with six years suspended. She’ll avoid serving those extra years if she complies with all the terms of her sentence. She was convicted in April by a Hughes County Jury on two felony counts of aggravated grand theft.
‘Don’t do that’: Attorney general says guilty verdict in state theft trial sends a message

Carroll’s conviction and sentencing are the highest-profile outcomes in a recent wave of white-collar prosecutions in South Dakota state government, which have also spurred reforms and increased scrutiny on departmental financial controls. Other criminal allegations against state employees have included creating fake vehicle titles to avoid excise taxes, the use of foster family food vouchers for a state employee’s own expenses, and the alleged forging of a state employee’s own medical marijuana card.
During Carroll’s trial, Jackley’s prosecution team laid out a paper trail illustrating Carroll’s scheme, played her recorded confession, and showed a document she signed saying she committed the crimes.
Carroll formerly worked as an administrative assistant for Child Protection Service. Her crimes were discovered by a department employee after Carroll had retired and moved to Iowa.
Carroll’s crimes involved submitting fraudulent financial requests on behalf of children no longer in the state’s care, depositing the funds into accounts opened under their names, and withdrawing the money in cash for herself. Prosecutors said she did that 215 times between 2010 and 2023, stealing a total of $1,777,665.73.

The three University of Iowa international students and one UI international-student graduate are suing Homeland Security for having revoked their status as students — a step they fear could lead to them being detained and deported.
U.S. District Court Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger initially issued a short-term temporary restraining order barring Homeland Security from deporting the four, and later, on May 15, granted them the additional protection of a preliminary injunction that is intended to last while the plaintiffs’ underlying case against the government is being litigated.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
According to the lawsuit, each of the plaintiffs was admitted to the United States on an F-1 student visa. The students claim Homeland Security has violated their due process rights by terminating their student status without legal justification or explanation.
Named as defendants in the case are Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, of which Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, is a part. Also named as a defendant is Acting Director of ICE Todd Lyons.
Since the injunction was issued on May 15, there has been little activity in the case, with Homeland Security still having filed no formal answer to the students’ original petition, which was filed April 21.
Recently, lawyers for Homeland Security asked for, and received, a 60-day extension of time to either file an answer or a motion to dismiss the case.
As justification, they say “the small civil division for the U.S. Attorney’s Office has recently been experiencing significant staffing shortages,” and the issues raised in the UI case have been the focus of “significant litigation around the country,” resulting in a need for additional time is needed to coordinate any response to the lawsuit with others inside the U.S. Department of Justice.
Also, the government’s lawyers say, the lead counsel for Homeland Security and ICE “will be departing federal service within the next few weeks,” which means the new lead counsel and their team will need more time to familiarize themselves with the case.
The government’s lawyers now have until Aug. 21, 2025, to respond to the students’ lawsuit.
Judge expressed ‘little confidence’ in Homeland Security
In her May 15 decision granting an injunction, Judge Ebinger rejected Homeland Security’s claim that its actions were not arbitrary and capricious – the standard for reversing administrative action, which is what the four UI plaintiffs seek as part of their lawsuit.
The judge noted there was “no suggestion” made by anyone that the four plaintiffs met Homeland Security’s own standards for revoking student status, such as conveying falsehoods to Homeland Security, engaging in unauthorized employment, committing a serious crime or failing to engage in educational studies.
In deciding to issue the injunction, Ebinger also stated that she had “little confidence” that going forward, Homeland Security and ICE would comply with the law and “act consistently with pertinent regulatory factors.”
In a statement that underscores the difficulty lawyers for Homeland Security are likely to face as the underlying case moves forward, Ebinger stated in her decision that “imposing immediate negative consequences on persons while disregarding governing law and regulations is arbitrary and capricious.” The four UI plaintiffs, she said, “have demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits” of their case.
The injunction bars Noem, Homeland Security and ICE from initiating or ordering the arrest, detention, or transfer of the four plaintiffs — Prasoon Kumar, Songli Cai, Haoran Yang, and Sri Chaitanya Krishna Akondy — out of the court’s jurisdiction without first providing adequate notice to the court so the plaintiffs’ counsel can contest any such action.

Ty Pinkins, a former Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate in 2024, announced recently that he would run as an independent candidate for the U.S Senate in 2026. Shuwaski Young, a former Democratic candidate for Congress and Mississippi secretary of state, announced that he will campaign as a Republican for secretary of state in 2027. 
The announcements from the two politicians come in an election cycle where the Democratic Party is trying to make inroads in a state dominated by Republicans. 
Pinkins, a Rolling Fork native, unsuccessfully challenged incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker in 2024. 
The Delta resident in a recent blog post attributed the lack of support from the state Democratic Party and Democratic officials as part of the reason for his poor performance. Pinkins wrote that certain party leaders were “gatekeepers” who attempted to block him from advancing in politics.
“Gatekeeping is how the party protects its fragile status quo — by silencing anyone who might disrupt it,” Pinkins wrote. “Candidates who challenge convention or dare to ask hard questions are often ignored, undermined, or outright punished.”
If he qualifies to run for the seat, he will challenge incumbent U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, who has announced she is running for reelection and has the endorsement of President Donald Trump. 
Scott Colom, a state prosecutor in the Golden Triangle area, is considered a likely candidate in the Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate, but he has not publicly announced his plans. 
Young, a Neshoba County native, has worked in various roles at the California Democratic Party, the Department of Homeland Security under President Barack Obama’s administration, and the Mississippi Secretary of State’s Office under former secretaries Eric Clark and Delbert Hosemann.

The Democratic Party nominated Young for secretary of state in 2023, but after the Daily Journal and Secretary of State Michael Watson’s office raised questions about Young’s residency, he withdrew from the race due to medical reasons.
Other candidates who are considering running for secretary of state are Republican state Sen. Jeff Tate of Meridian and Republican state Sen. Joel Carter of Gulfport. Current Secretary of State Michael Watson has not announced his plans, but is widely considered a top contender for lieutenant governor. 
Candidates for U.S. Senate and other congressional offices can begin qualifying in January, and candidates for Mississippi’s statewide elections can begin qualifying for those offices in January 2025.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/05023726/3X0A6264-scaled.jpg,,,2025-07-01 17:07:53.475258
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-01 20:36:35+00:00,CT Mirror,CT sues Trump administration over funds for mental health services in schools,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/01/trump-school-mental-health-funding-ct-lawsuit/,The cancelled grant included funds meant to support graduate social work students in providing mental health services in four CT districts.,"Connecticut Attorney General William Tong has joined a lawsuit seeking to stop the Trump administration from cancelling certain mental health grants for public schools — including one meant to fund social work interns serving four low-income districts in Connecticut. 
The University of Connecticut’s Graduate School of Social Work had been awarded a five-year grant of just over $3 million as part of the 2022 Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which Congress passed in the aftermath of the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Tex. The grant was meant to support 25 graduate students in social work to provide mental health services in four Connecticut school districts — Hartford, New Britain, Waterbury and Vernon.
UConn spokesperson Stephanie Reitz said the program was set to begin this fall. The grant is now set to be terminated in December. 
Along with Tong, sixteen other states signed onto the lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington on Monday. All the states they represent, with the exception of Nevada, have Democratic governors. 
The federal Department of Education did not respond to a request for comment.
The UConn grant was part of $1 billion that Congress put aside for mental health services in high-need school districts in the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. The funds have allowed for the hiring of 1,300 mental health professionals and supported almost 775,000 K-12 students across the country, the lawsuit stated.
According to the lawsuit, suicide risk for students in participating high-need schools has dropped by half, while absenteeism and other problematic behavior also decreased. The programs that received funding also have been able to keep many of their mental health workers on staff, which has reduced the amount of time that students have to wait for help. 
In December, UConn announced that it would use $588,000 received through the federal grant to launch the School Social Work Scholars program. The program would send graduate students at the School of Social Work into Hartford, New Britain, Waterbury and Vernon public schools, with the goal of broadening diversity among social workers in those districts. 
Reitz declined to comment further, citing the pending lawsuit. 
In their complaint, the attorneys general called the Trump administration’s move to discontinue the grant as “arbitrary and capricious.” They said the government’s notices that the grants would be discontinued — which programs received in April — contained “boilerplate language” that left unclear the reasons for cuts to each particular program. 
They also claimed the cuts would force districts to lay off people they’d hired and place graduate students in the position of having to decide whether to pursue their studies without financial support. They said this would negatively affect students seeking mental health care.
If the grants are discontinued, the attorneys general wrote, “grantees in Plaintiff states will be forced to lay off school-based mental health service providers, reducing access to much-needed mental health services to their rural and low-income schools.”
“These grantees will lose qualified mental health service providers; and the benefits of the relationships their students have developed with these providers,” the lawsuit went on. “The spillover effect of students turning to community mental health services — to the extent they are available — will tax Plaintiffs’ already-strained mental health care system.”
Connecticut Democrat Rep. Rosa DeLauro criticized the cuts in recent days. On Monday, along with fellow Connecticut Democratic Rep. Jahana Hayes and Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, DeLauro introduced a bill that would fund additional mental health workers in schools. 
Kate Dias, President of the Connecticut Education Association, the state’s largest teacher’s union, praised Tong for taking legal action against the federal government.
“Cutting this funding is not only shortsighted and unjust — it’s reckless. Our kids depend on school-based mental health professionals now more than ever,” she said in a statement.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_6543-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-01 17:07:53.475258

(Courtesy of CPW)The head of Colorado Parks and Wildlife told lawmakers on Monday that it is the department’s “preference” to release more wolves into the state next year, despite calls to pause the reintroduction program.
“I don’t have the right answer to whether or not a pause is the right thing to do, or get the last 15 (wolves) out and move on to the management piece,” CPW Director Jeff Davis said. “Every time we release more animals, it’s more emotional and difficult for us to pull off that operation, and it’s also challenging for the (livestock) producers at the same time.”
Davis appeared in front of the Colorado Legislature’s Water Resources and Agriculture Review Committee to give an update on the state’s wolf reintroduction plan, which voters approved in 2020. Wildlife officials have released 25 wolves in the state since December 2023 from Oregon and Canada.
The original goal was to release 10 to 15 per year for three to five years, beginning in 2023, to get to a stable population of at least 50 wolves in the state.

Davis said the department’s preference is to sign a new agreement with British Columbia to relocate more wolves from Canada.
But the program is highly controversial, especially among rural Colorado farmers and ranchers who decry wolves killing their livestock. Between April 2024 and April 2025, wolves killed at least 25 cattle and sheep, according to the recently released annual report on the reintroduction effort.
The Copper Creek pack was responsible for many livestock deaths in Grand County in 2023, prompting to CPW to capture the six wolves last September and release them alongside the Canadian wolves earlier this year in a different part of the state. That decision, producers said Monday, led to an erosion of trust in CPW.
“A depredating pack was known to have depredated in Oregon before they put them in Middle Park. They had a serious impact there. They packaged them up, put them away for a while and then they put them back out right in my backyard,” said Tom Harrington, a cattle producer in Roaring Fork Valley and previous president of the Colorado Cattlemen’s Association.










I think the entire reintroduction and restoration is at risk if we can't get our legs underneath us and be in a position to do this the way we need to.


– House Speaker Julie McCluskie


A September 2024 petition filed by a coalition of livestock associations and other agricultural interest groups requested a pause in CPW’s planned reintroductions until the department could implement strategies to prevent depredations. CPW’s commission rejected the petition in January.
“I believe that we need no more new releases until plans are in place and the basics are working,” Harrington said Monday. “We need metrics to measure the success of what this program is. I believe we can — and here comes that word that I really don’t like — coexist with the wolves that choose to not prey on our livestock.”
CPW has worked through some of the seven points of the petition, including defining “chronic depredation” as three or more depredations by the same wolf or wolves within 30 days. The division has also outlined a lethal removal approach that starts by killing one or two wolves, evaluating the pack’s behavior and its effect on depredation, then considering additional lethal removals. CPW also started a range rider program to deploy riders in areas with high wolf conflict to “proactively haze predators using non-lethal techniques,” according to the annual report.
CPW killed a wolf for the first time in May in Pitkin County.
“The idea of a pause continues to make sense to me, if it creates more time for more robust implementation and completion of those seven items, and maybe now beyond those seven,” House Speaker Julie McCluskie, a Dillon Democrat, said. “But I think the entire reintroduction and restoration is at risk if we can’t get our legs underneath us and be in a position to do this the way we need to.”
Representatives from CPW also told lawmakers Monday that the cost of the reintroduction has reached about $3 million. In 2020, voters were given an estimate of about $800,000 for the program.
“I understand a lot of this money is going to ranchers and producers to help to compensate them,” Sen. Dylan Roberts, a Frisco Democrat, said. “That’s money hopefully being well spent, but that’s also money in the state of Colorado right now — in the budget situation we’re in — that is not going to fixing potholes in roads. It’s not going to classrooms across the state. It’s not going to people who are losing their health care and many who are about to lose their health care. This seems out of control.”
Davis said there are a lot of factors that go into realizing the reintroduction plan that were not considered in the ballot cost estimate, such as the state’s decision to compensate for livestock weight loss and fewer pregnancies due to wolf presence and the high cost of beef.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A constitutionally created board overseeing nearly $2 billion in public dollars on Tuesday asked the Oklahoma Supreme Court to overturn a recent state law saying it threatens its independence.
House Bill 2783, which Gov. Kevin Stitt let become law without his signature, allows the appointing authorities of the Tobacco Settlement Endowment Trust board to remove members at will. It also limits members of the board to seven years. 
Members currently serve staggered, seven-year terms and are tasked with overseeing the public endowment fund.
“The purpose of having staggered terms is to provide continuity by new appointees joining other board members who have institutional knowledge,” the suit said.
The seven members are appointed by the governor, treasurer, state superintendent, attorney general, state auditor and leaders of the Oklahoma House and Senate.
Each of those officials is named as a defendant in the suit.
The suit asks the high court to put the law, which takes effect Aug. 28, on hold and find it unconstitutional and invalid.
“As I have stated publicly for several months, the Legislature stands ready to work with TSET and our members were genuinely excited about commitments made by them at the start of session to collaborate on projects,” said House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow. “Unfortunately, they’ve since decided to change course and now, instead of ever talking to us about their concerns with pending legislation, are going straight to the courts.”
TSET is not a private sector entity, Hilbert said.
“This endowment consists entirely of public funds and as such, the elected members of the Legislature will exercise our authority in overseeing the expenditure of public funds,” Hilbert said.
Lawmakers over the years have unsuccessfully attempted to force TSET to fund various projects, including Medicaid expansion.
Some Democratic lawmakers have said they believe the new law is retaliation and an attempt to strip the board of its independence after TSET declined to immediately provide $50 million for a University of Oklahoma children’s pediatric hospital in Oklahoma City. Lawmakers put $200 million into the project.
Oklahoma voters created TSET, an endowment trust, in 2000 through a constitutional amendment after 46 states sued tobacco companies. The companies paid the states damages for illnesses caused by smoking.
TSET’s Board of Investors invests the funds. The earnings, which have grown to about $2 billion, are used to support efforts to improve health. 
“The intent of voters was to keep politics out of the administration of the TSET trust, which has grown to about $1.9 billion,” said Bob Burke, an attorney representing TSET.
He said TSET uses the fund’s interest to pay for about $80 million annually in grants and programs including the Oklahoma Tobacco Helpline, cancer research, and other community efforts to improve health. 
The suit alleges that only a vote of the people can alter the terms board members serve.
“Allowing an Appointing Authority to replace his or her appointment to the board at will violates the plain and unambiguous meaning of the constitutional provision and the voters in approving the amendment,” the suit said.

James Grady speaks to reporters following a joint meeting of the Michigan House Oversight Committee and the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Michigan State Police. July 1, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceMichigan State Police Director Col. James Grady said Tuesday that a no confidence vote from troopers and command officers didn’t represent the full scope of his department, and that he was working to address issues of low morale that began before his time as the head of the agency.
Grady’s comments came during a joint hearing of the Michigan House Oversight Committee and the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Michigan State Police. Some members of the Republican-led House of Representatives and the GOP members of the Senate have called for Grady’s resignation due to complaints from troopers and command officers who have claimed they are fearful of speaking up about department policies under Grady and have faced retaliation when they have.
Grady said that the vote of no confidence from the Michigan State Police Troopers Association and the Michigan State Police Command Officers Association in June was not an MSP-sanctioned survey nor was it reflective of employee surveys issued by the department. Overall, Grady highlighted his years of service to the department and the discretion that comes with his position to make leadership and command changes if needed.
“I’m doing the work, representative,” Grady said in response to questions from Republican state Reps. Mike Mueller and Jay DeBoyer, the respective chairs of the joint committees. “I’m doing everything that I can to ensure that the morale increases, because I, again, respect all of the members of our agency, and I want them to be well. I want them to be in a good place. I want them to want to come to work, because when they’re in a good place, they can come and do the work effectively and efficiently every day. And that’s something that I support as a leader of this department.”

That was how Grady responded to most of the questions lobbed at him from Republicans and Democrats alike on the joint panel, much of which were fastballs and somewhat critical of Grady and his handling of the department. Grady further noted multiple worksite visits, feedback missions and an open door policy as ways he was trying hard to boost morale.
Grady was appointed in Sept. 2023 as director of the department by Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, following the departure of former director Joseph Gasper.
Over the last few years, troopers and command officers have complained that Grady was out of line when he came out with a statement that did not initially support former trooper Brian Keely when he was charged in May 2024 in the death of Samuel Sterling. The charges against Keely have since been dropped by a U.S. District Court judge, but the Michigan Department of Attorney General has said it would appeal the dismissal.
Troopers and command officers also took issue with Grady promoting Chief Deputy Director Aimee Brimacombe as his second-in-command because of her alleged lack of experience and multiple complaints made against her before she was elevated several ranks.
Other grievances include Grady’s decision to not keep existing command or leadership staff and replacing them with a new team, which Grady said Tuesday was a means to better serve the department and bring commanders on board with unique strengths.
Troopers filed an ethics complaint against Grady and Brimacombe in January. A handful of troopers also filed lawsuits against Brimacombe questioning her leadership, and questioned performance bonuses Grady and Brimacombe received after only a short time in their roles.
The morass culminated in the vote of no confidence, which Grady said was a first, but later noted that similar questions have been posed to trooper and command officer unions in the past questioning the leadership of previous directors, dating back to 2018.
Some have questioned whether the complaints have an undertone of racial or gender bias, seeing as troopers have in the past complained or sued over the department’s diversity recruitment policies that emerged under Gasper, but before Grady’s ascension to his current role. Although Grady is not the first Black officer to be promoted to colonel, some have called into question the deluge of complaints against the combo of Grady and Brimacombe as the department’s leaders.
That said, DeBoyer, Mueller and others noted that although they have great respect for the department and Grady’s years of service in law enforcement, maybe he wasn’t the right leader for the agency despite his commitment to the department and its troopers.
“I appreciate that, and I don’t have any reason to believe that that is not who you are, but the results of the survey, unfortunately, and with all due respect, says otherwise,” DeBoyer said. “You made the statement that the Michigan State Police is one of the most respected agencies in the entire country, frankly, and it has been for decades. So, when you see that level of lack of confidence, that’s very concerning to us as legislators.”
Mueller, a former law enforcement officer, also said that it appeared to him Grady wasn’t a bad person, but sometimes good people aren’t great leaders.
“It’s not anything about your character at all. It’s about the men and women, 98% of the men and women, that drive around those police cars [who] fear retaliation,” Mueller said.
The gloves were off, however, after that first bit of cordial opening statements.
A “culture of fear”
DeBoyer noted that the House Oversight Committee, which he chairs, has deposed several members of Michigan State Police in the matter of his leadership and had several say that there was a culture of fear in the department for either saying the wrong things, sharing their opinions or speaking up on leadership matters. The depositions, which were not shared in full during the committee nor made public elsewhere, also showed troopers and command officers experienced retaliation for doing so, resulting in work assignment loss or other reprimands.
State Rep. Jamie Greene (R-Richmond) read some of the commentary from MSP’s 2024 employment engagement survey. One response noted that it was allegedly well known within the department that Grady and Brimacombe didn’t take kindly to criticism on their leadership decisions, and if they do, they pay the price.
“This is incredibly disturbing,” Greene added. “This department seems to be fostering a culture of fear and isolation, which is extremely harmful in such a high stress career.”
Greene asked Grady why retaliation was the running theme in some of the responses if he was working to mend bridges and communicating with his troopers about their concerns.
Grady again leaned on his commitment to hearing officers out and said again that he believed those comments did not represent that majority of the department. The director also defended Brimacombe and his decision to elevate her, noting that she has 25 years of experience with the department and a law degree.
Greene asked him if she thought the results of the surveys were fabricated. Grady did not directly respond, but did say there appeared to be copycat or repeated similar responses.
State Rep. Will Snyder (D-Muskegon) said it was his understanding that there were approximately 700 vacant positions within the department and that 500 of them are at the trooper level. Snyder worked that out to be a 20%  vacancy rate, which he said was exceedingly high.
Grady said the department had over the last 10 years hired nearly 1,000 troopers, leading the nation in hiring among state police organizations. He also noted that the department has an aggressive recruiting plan.
Accusations of doxing
But DeBoyer later countered by saying that morale continues to dip and then turned to question Grady about reports of doxing within the department. The names of some of the troopers and command officers who were deposed during recent closed-door hearings of the House Oversight Committee were reported by the Detroit Free Press ahead of Tuesday’s hearing.
DeBoyer said that revelation was appalling, and grilled Grady about how and why someone within the department who was familiar with those discussions leaked that information to the press. The chair as
“That is doxing people within your organization, people who we have asked to communicate with us in private … in fairness and openness and transparency with others members of our committee,” DeBoyer said. “And this morning, in the media, we read three names that only your agency had. That’s inexcusable. … The fact that someone in your agency would dox their own members, Colonel, that is a clear demonstration of why there’s a lack of confidence in leadership at Michigan State Police, because at all costs, they will protect themselves and they will sacrifice their members.”
While DeBoyer called for an investigation, Grady said he wasn’t aware of that leak and would look into it.
Following testimony, Grady spoke to reporters and said he thought the committee hearing was generally unfair and that he was proud of the job that he was doing.
“I’m not the type of Colonel that doesn’t make himself available or accessible. I’ll talk to anybody, and so I have those conversations, and they’re positive,” Grady said of his outreach to troopers. “People enjoy working for the State Police. That’s why, when we do have vacancies, they don’t last long. They don’t remain vacant, because people apply to the positions they want to work here in this department. People want to be state troopers.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/20250701_104525-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-01 17:07:53.475258

Assembly wants to avert the cut.,"Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin on the Assembly floor on June 30, 2025 (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Another fight is brewing over New Jersey’s already beleaguered public worker health plans.
A provision in the $58.8 billion budget Gov. Phil Murphy signed into law Monday night calls for the state or its unions to identify $100 million of savings within the state part of the State Health Benefits Program for the first half of 2026. It spurred alarm among public-sector unions and a promised fix from Assembly Democrats, all of whom are on the ballot this fall.
“It’s clear that there is no immediate need to require state workers to pay more for their health benefits,” said Assembly Majority Leader Lou Greenwald (D-Camden).
New Jersey’s public health plans are in distress amid rising health care costs, spiking prescription drug utilization, frequent deadlocks in Plan Design Committees that set coverage rules, and soaring premiums spurred by — and spurring — municipal departures.
Treasury in May warned local government workers’ public plan was at risk of complete collapse as more and more municipalities with larger, healthier workforces leave for cheaper private options.
The state workers’ plan is shielded from that dynamic because its workers cannot choose private alternatives, but it too faces the threat of more premium increases. In 2024, the state workers’ plan lost roughly $113 million, and it is loaning funds to mitigate costs in the local workers’ plan, which Treasury has said could not repay its debts without a mid-year rate increase in 2025.
Union leaders say hospital pricing is the main driver of growing health benefit costs.
“Until you control the costs, you’re not controlling the dollars. When hospitals are getting paid four to five times as [much as] Medicare for service because they allow the state’s vendors to negotiate in their interests instead of directly negotiating with them,” said Kevin Lyons, executive director of the New Jersey State Policemen’s Benevolent Association.
Lyons, a member of the State Health Benefits Program’s Plan Design Committee, said New Jersey also could seek to impose caps on the growth of health services.
The state’s actuary in March reported per-visit costs had increased 7% for outpatient services and 12% for outpatient emergency visits in the 12 months preceding October 2024, with similar increases for behavioral health visits, lab work, and primary care appointments. Per-visit costs for urgent care declined by 8% over that period.
Administration officials appear to favor less generous health plans. Plans under the State Health Benefits Program typically cover between 93% and 98% of health care costs. Lowering that number — called an actuarial value — could shave off a significant portion of the state’s health benefit spending, which is expected to total roughly $2.9 billion in fiscal 2026.
Health benefit committees are due to approve rates for the 2026 plan year later this month. The state’s actuaries will make their recommendations public during committee hearings next week.
Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex) in a statement following Monday’s budget vote said legislators last week had learned of an additional $200 million in revenue that could be used to forestall the $100 million cut to the State Health Benefits Program.
“Although I firmly believe New Jersey’s public worker health plans need significant reforms to control costs, the funds allow us the opportunity to find ways to reduce those costs, while treating workers fairly,” Coughlin said, adding his chamber would hold rare hearings July hearings on public worker health benefits.
But it’s not clear what revenue he’s referring to.
A spokesperson for Assembly Democrats initially pointed to revenue growth in taxes on energy sales and the state’s pass-through business alternative income tax, but those figures were unveiled in mid-May. The spokesperson then deferred to Coughlin and Greenwald’s statements, which noted the windfall but made no mention of its source.
Overall revenue projections for the state’s general fund were $247.9 million higher in the budget signed Monday than they were in the budget Murphy presented in February. The budget’s $305 million increase to a $250 million transfer from the state’s Debt Defeasance and Prevention Fund Murphy proposed in February more than covers the difference.
Lawmakers have limited ability to use gross income tax and other Property Tax Relief Fund revenues to reduce state worker health benefit costs. The state’s constitution requires those monies be used “exclusively for the purpose of reducing or offsetting property taxes.”
A Treasury spokesperson did not return a request for comment. Spokespeople for the governor did not address the discrepancy.
“Labor and management can work together over the next five months to find real, sustainable health care savings that ultimately help both workers and taxpayers. With public health benefit plans facing astronomical rate increases, all sides must roll up their sleeves to do the hard work necessary to address this problem,” said Natalie Hamilton, a Murphy spokeswoman.
The proposed cut represents about 3.4% the state’s expected spending on its employees’ health benefits in the current July-to-June fiscal year.

Antonio “Moe” Maestas (D-Albuquerque), pushed back on the idea that police would be held personally liable for damages under the law. (Photo by Brandon Bell / Getty Images)The organization that represents the vast majority of local police departments in New Mexico on Monday claimed that the state’s civil rights law has been a “complete disaster” for recruiting police.
A New Mexico Municipal League official shared a presentation with lawmakers on Monday that lists “actual or perceived risks” of “liability concerns” stemming from the New Mexico Civil Rights Act as a possible factor contributing to recruitment and retention struggles, along with demoralization; expanded duties; and pay gaps, to name a few other issues attributed to law enforcement agencies.
In passing the New Mexico Civil Rights Act in 2021, New Mexico became one of the first states in the country to abolish qualified immunity — which shields public officials from lawsuits — making it possible for people to sue police officers and others in state court for constitutional rights violations.
On Monday, Municipal League Public Safety Director Tim Johnson told the interim legislative Courts, Corrections and Justice Committee that the Civil Rights Act, which he referred to by its formal bill number, House Bill 4, has been a “complete disaster” for recruiting police.
“Perception is reality. Some of the legal risks, the debates, the timing, the misinformation during and post-House Bill 4 was a complete disaster for recruiting law enforcement, a complete disaster,” said Johnson, a former State Police chief. “I understand why we did it but again — talk about perception is reality — disastrous for our profession.”
Committee Chair Joseph Cervantes, a Democratic senator from Las Cruces who carried the legislation on the Senate floor in 2021, and Sen. Antonio “Moe” Maestas (D-Albuquerque), pushed back on the idea that police would be held personally liable for damages under the law.
If juries do award damages to a person alleging civil rights violations, the law does not make police officers personally financially liable, Cervantes said. That responsibility lies with the government agencies that employ them, he said.
Moreover, Cervantes contended the false perception held by police stems from a misinformation campaign.
“Law enforcement were lied to, and they’re still being lied to, and that’s why it’s disastrous, because they’re being told that the bill exposes them to personal liability,” Cervantes told Johnson. “I sat there and watched the Association of Counties and the Municipal League — who you work for now — and others, suggest to law enforcement that this bill was going to expose them to personal liability and that’s just not true.”
“It was an attempt to defeat the bill, let’s be honest,” Cervantes added.
Maestas said if polled, the vast majority of New Mexico police officers and sheriff’s deputies would wrongly think “that they’re in jeopardy of having to pay out in a lawsuit…They literally think that, and you could tell them straight in the eye, and they would not believe you,” Maestas said.
While Johnson repeatedly told the committee on Monday that “perception is reality,” Cervantes responded by saying the Municipal League is in the best position to change the wrong perception about the Civil Rights Act.
Johnson responded by saying he will do that, “and I would ask you to try to make them feel safe that it’ll never happen.”

Mike DeWine on Monday vetoed it, saying that lawmakers in the Ohio House and Senate asked him to.
In his veto message, DeWine acknowledged that Ohio pharmacies are closing rapidly, and said he and Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel will keep working on the problem.
Last year, Ohio lost 215 pharmacies and the total number dropped below 2,000 for the first time in memory, according to an online tracker launched by the Ohio Board of Pharmacy. Pharmacy owners have long complained that huge pharmacy middlemen with conflicted interests have used a non-transparent system to underpay them and drive them out of business. 
In response, legislation was introduced in the Ohio House earlier this year that would require the middlemen to reimburse pharmacies for drugs based on a public database compiled by the federal government. 
That would only allow pharmacies to break even on drugs. So the legislation also required the middlemen to pay a $10 per-prescription dispensing fee to cover pharmacies’ overhead such as payroll, rent, taxes, and insurance. It’s based on a statewide survey regularly conducted among pharmacies.
Then the Ohio Chamber of Commerce got involved, telling state senators that the dispensing fees were a tax and that they should oppose them. The chamber made that claim even though the Ohio Department of Medicaid in 2022 adopted a similar system and saved $140 million in the process.
Despite requests, the Ohio Chamber hasn’t disclosed how much money it gets from the middlemen, known as pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs. The company that owns the biggest PBM, CVS Health, was a “presenting sponsor”  of the Chamber’s 2024 Healthcare Summit, and an executive with the company delivered a keynote speech. 
The Ohio Senate attempted a compromise between the House legislation and the Ohio Chamber’s demand for no dispensing fees. It would have required PBMs to reimburse pharmacies in a transparent system, but it would have eliminated minimum dispensing fees.
The Ohio Pharmacists Association said that would be much worse for pharmacies than the current, inadequate setup. Pharmacies could only break even on their drugs, and they couldn’t recoup their overhead, they said.
“It’s any pharmacist’s suicide bill,” Dave Burke, the organization’s executive director, said last week.

In vetoing it, DeWine agreed.
“This item was intended to strike a compromise between interested parties on how to best regulate the practice of pharmacy benefit managers in Ohio and the requirements for fair and transparent reimbursement for Ohio pharmacies,” the governor’s veto message said. “However, due to drafting errors, the language will not achieve the legislative intent of providing the needed oversight of pharmacy benefit manager practices. Subsequently, the language as written, may result in further detriment to Ohio pharmacies, especially those in small, rural communities, and could result in a reduction in health care access for many Ohioans.”
The message explained that those who wrote the legislation into the state budget asked that it be pulled back.
“Due to the errors in drafting final language, the Ohio House of Representatives and Ohio Senate have requested this veto,” DeWine’s veto message said. “Therefore, a veto of this item is in the public interest.”
In an interview Tuesday, Burke said he didn’t think there was any ill intent on the part his former colleagues in the Ohio Senate.
“I think people are getting misinformation from the PBMs, who are trying to maintain their foothold and prevent a free and transparent market,” he said.
Burke also said he didn’t believe the Ohio Chamber was selling out its Ohio membership in favor of out-of-state, Fortune 15 health conglomerates that own the big-three PBMs.
“I don’t think the Ohio Chamber is anti-pharmacy,” said Burke, who is himself a pharmacist. “I think they just don’t understand how their benefits are actually being administered.”
But he added that every business in Ohio has an interest in a healthy network of pharmacies.
“I don’t know what they’re going to do when their employees can’t get their prescription drugs where they live,” Burke said. “That’s happening now in real time. We have pharmacy deserts and they’re getting worse every year.”
Denise Conway, who in 2019 restored pharmacy services in Danville, said the veto is far from enough to solve the problems besetting Ohio pharmacies.
“It is a slight win for pharmacies across Ohio and I am grateful for the governor’s vision to see that things aren’t being addressed,” she said in a text message Tuesday.
In his veto message, DeWine said more needs to be done.
“It is important to note that the DeWine-Tressel Administration is committed to further reforms of pharmacy benefit managers, as already demonstrated in improvements made in Ohio’s Medicaid program through the adoption of the Single Pharmacy Benefit Manager,” it said, referring to the measure that saved taxpayers $140 million. “This administration is committed to working with the Ohio General Assembly in the future to deliver a pharmacy-benefit-manager regulatory bill.” 
Burke said that he might be partly to blame for the PBM-aligned position taken by the Ohio Chamber.
“I have to think, knowing (Senior Vice President) Rick Carfagna and (President and CEO) Steve Stivers, that they’re not ignorant and they’re not bought and paid for,” Burke said. “They’re intelligent people. Maybe it’s my fault for not stopping by and sitting down with them.”
He added that he’s ready to work with the Ohio Chamber or anybody else to shore up Ohio’s dwindling network of pharmacies.
“We’re in a bad place,” Burke said. The Ohio Pharmacists Association “definitely has an open hand and an open mind for anyone who’s willing to work with us on this issue. But we are running out of time.”

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)A former Boise Democratic legislator on Sunday stepped down from his role in the Statehouse to run for the U.S. Senate as an independent against longtime Idaho U.S. Sen. Jim Risch.
Todd Achilles, who was appointed to fill a District 16 position and won the November 2024 election for the Idaho House, said he became an “unaffiliated voter” over the weekend because he is increasingly frustrated by both parties.
“It begins with the fact that the two-party system is just fundamentally broken right now in the United States,” Achilles told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview.
He cited the increased federal debt, deficit and involvement in overseas conflicts as some of the reasons he did not want to run as a member of either of the two major parties.

Achilles will challenge Risch, who has served as one of Idaho’s two U.S. senators since 2009. Risch will be up for reelection in November 2026 and announced in April that he plans to run again. He was endorsed by President Donald Trump.
“It’s a great time for America,” Risch said in a press release. “I want to continue working with President Trump to get government out of the way.”
Achilles told the Capital Sun that he believed Idaho voters — who have not elected a non-Republican U.S. senator since Democrat Frank Church in 1974 — will be receptive to an independent candidate.
“People are tired of a system that is more and more divisive,” he said.
 Idaho Democratic Party will submit three potential candidates for governor to choose from to fill vacancy

Because Achilles stepped down before the end of his term in the Idaho House, the Idaho Democratic Party will select from applicants three potential candidates for Gov. Brad Little to choose from.
Little will make the appointment by July 14, according to a statement from the Idaho Democratic Party.

It will become illegal next month to use a phone while driving in Louisiana unless it’s for hands-free calls or navigation.
On Monday, Gov. Jeff Landry signed House Bill 519 by Rep. Brian Glorioso, R-Slidell, that bans most cellphone and other wireless communication use while operating a motor vehicle.
The new law prohibits phone use during driving except for voice calls on hands-free systems, including wrist-worn devices such as the Apple Watch, and looking at a hands-free navigation system.
The hands-free exception doesn’t permit all usage of a cellphone while driving. The law still prohibits most texting and emailing even when the phone is paired to a remote system. It outlaws driving while “accessing, reading, viewing, composing, browsing, transmitting, saving, or retrieving electronic data” from any phone app unless it’s for voice calls or navigation.
In a phone call Tuesday, Glorioso said the intent of the law is to prohibit phone use whenever it creates a distraction and requires looking away from the road.
The ban doesn’t apply to the use of a phone when the vehicle is stationary or when making calls to report traffic collisions or emergencies. It also contains exceptions for emergency officials, first responders and certain professional drivers who use radios or communication devices affixed to their vehicles.
Gov. Landry taunts Republican senator at bill signing event

The law takes effect on Aug. 1 and is part of the Louisiana Legislature’s effort to tackle the high cost of auto insurance in the state. Studies have shown that cell phone use while driving significantly increases the risk of an accident, which could drive up insurance rates.
Before this year’s legislative session, lawmakers had tried repeatedly to enact similar laws but always came up short due in part to concerns that police officers might use the phone ban as an excuse to perform traffic stops and vehicle searches. But lawmakers settled on a compromise that added a provision to prevent officers from conducting searches or making arrests based solely on a cell phone use violation.
“Finally, this year we were able to pass a distracted driving bill,” Landry said before signing the bill Monday.
Violations of the new phone ban can fetch a fine of up to $100 or up to $250 if the offense occurs in a school or highway construction zone. However, those fines will not take effect until Jan. 1, 2026. Until that time, violators will receive a warning.

Thompson Federal Courthouse in Nashville on June 13, 2025. (John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)This story originally appeared on Tennessee Lookout. 
NASHVILLE — Kilmar Abrego Garcia will remain temporarily in jail at the request of his own attorneys, who cited conflicting positions taken by the government over whether he is at risk for immediate deportation.
An order issued Monday by U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes keeps Abrego in the custody of the U.S. Marshals until a July 16 hearing in Nashville.
The order also directs the U.S. Marshals to hold him “separately from persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody pending appeal” and to ensure he is able to privately confer with his attorneys.
Abrego, an apprentice sheet metal worker living in Maryland, was deported to a Salvadoran prison in March after a traffic stop as the Trump administration began ramping up immigration enforcement efforts.

A government lawyer later admitted Abrego, who entered the country illegally about a decade ago, had been deported in error. A 2019 order from an immigration judge prevents him from being deported to his native El Salvador due to fears of gang violence. The Supreme Court ordered the government to facilitate his return.
A grand jury indictment unsealed June 6 alleged Abrego served for years as a paid driver to transport immigrants who had crossed the U.S. border illegally to points around the country.
Abrego, 29, has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Attorneys for Abrego, who initially sought his pretrial release over the objection of federal prosecutors, last week asked for a delay due to “contradictory statements” made by government officials over his potential deportation.
Abrego Garcia lawyers want Trump administration fined for defying court orders

Both federal prosecutors and Abrego’s attorneys have conceded he will most likely be taken into the immediate custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials should he be granted pretrial release.
But government attorneys in Abrego’s separate immigration case told a Maryland judge last week that they expected ICE to begin the process of sending Abrego to a “third country.” The attorneys did not provide a timeline.
A White House spokesperson later denied Abrego would face imminent deportation.
In arguing their client be temporarily kept in jail, Abrego’s attorneys acknowledged the “irony” of their request.
“In a just world, he would not seek to prolong his detention further. And yet the government — a government that has, at all levels, told the American people that it is bringing Mr. Abrego back home to the United States to face ‘American justice’ — apparently has little interest in actually bringing this case to trial.”

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Florida’s two Republican U.S. senators — Rick Scott and Ashley Moody — voted in support on Tuesday of President Donald Trump’s signature tax break and spending cuts legislation, which needed Vice President J.D. Vance’s vote to pass, 51-50.
Both lawmakers celebrated passage of the bill, but Scott didn’t deny the measure as written does nothing to address the growing federal deficit. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a calculation Sunday showing the bill would add $3.25 trillion to deficits over 10 years.
“In this bill, there are many spending projects you will be surprised to see with our nation more than $37 trillion in debt. I was, too,” Scott acknowledged in a written statement released following the vote.
“But, that is the imperfect process of bringing elected individuals together to pass a bill that works for their states. I have been warning my colleagues for years about the dangers of massive deficit spending and debt for the American people, and we have our work cut out for us to ensure Congress fully understands this.”
“This bill delivers the LARGEST tax cut for the working and middle class in history,” Moody said in a press release.
“This is just the beginning, and with President Donald Trump, we will not stop pushing forward, around the clock, to deliver wins for the American people. There is a lot of work to get done so that our country returns to financial freedom, but together, we will restore policies that ensure Florida is stronger and safer than ever before.”
Moody added that passage of the bill puts “an end to the Biden-era madness.”
The measure now moves back to the U.S. House of Representatives. Among Florida’s 20 members in the House, eight issued a statement on Monday indicating they support the measure. The bill is opposed by all eight Florida House Democrats.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Digital driver’s licenses are one step closer to being filed in New Jerseyans’ virtual wallets under a bill the Legislature advanced Monday with overwhelming approval. 
The proposal is one Gov. Phil Murphy unveiled during his final State of the State address in January. At the time, he called it “common sense” and said it would “make life easier for people we serve.” 
But the bill — which now sits on the governor’s desk awaiting his signature — wouldn’t take effect for more than three years. It’s also likely the state would have to apply for a waiver for mobile versions under Real ID requirements, which began in May. 
The state Motor Vehicle Commission would be able to charge a “reasonable” fee for issuing mobile driver’s licenses or non-driver identification cards.
Thirteen states already offer mobile driver’s licenses, including Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Ohio, and neighboring states like New York and Delaware. Some states’ mobile licenses can be used at certain airports and federal agencies, according to the Transportation Security Administration. 
The bill also states that if someone hands off their phone to show their ID, that doesn’t constitute consent to search their phone or access information that isn’t on their identification card. It also requires the commission to equip the digital IDs with certain features to ensure “security and integrity” of the documentation to protect people’s personal information. 
The American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators called mobile driver’s licenses the “future of licensing and proof of identity.” They’re a significant improvement over physical IDs, which can be lost, stolen, broken or damaged, outdated, and easily replicated for counterfeiting, the organization said.
A spokesman for the Motor Vehicle Commission did not respond to a request for comment.
The bill passed the Assembly with a vote of 75-3, with two abstentions. In the Senate, it passed 31-6. The no votes were all Republicans.

The charges were part of a national investigation billed as the largest in history. All told, 324 people across the country were charged with submitting false billing statements amounting to more than $14.6 billion and diverting more than 15 million pills containing controlled substances, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said.
The alleged schemes in South Carolina involved falsified reimbursement claims that in some cases originated in other states but targeted the Palmetto State’s Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as the federal Department of Veterans Affairs, according to a news release.
“Health care fraud steals from the American taxpayer and harms the systems meant to serve those in need,” said Bryan Stirling, acting U.S. attorney in South Carolina. “The cases in South Carolina, like those nationwide, demonstrate our unwavering commitment to protecting vulnerable citizens, especially our veterans, and ensuring the integrity of programs designed to care for them.”
Two of the cases will be litigated in South Carolina’s federal court. Eight cases involving the Palmetto State will go through the Western District of North Carolina because the scheme took place primarily in Charlotte. One was filed in South Carolina state court, according to a list of cases nationwide.
A $21 million scheme
Between 2017 and 2024, eight people established nine fake behavioral health clinics in North Carolina and enrolled them in South Carolina’s Medicaid program through a program that allows people using Medicaid to visit doctors within 25 miles of the state line, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.


Defendants involving South Carolina
Charged in the Western District of North Carolina

Donald Calvin Saunders, 62, of Charlotte, North Carolina
Vanessa Ragin Boatright, 59, of Manning
Latarsa Hitchcock, 56, of Raleigh, North Carolina
Dajuan Strickland, 46, of Buffalo, New York, and Charlotte, North Carolina
Cynthia Jenkins Harris, 60, of Elgin
Stephanie Corbett, 59, of Jonesboro, Georgia
Karen McClary, 51, of Kingstree

Charged in the District of South Carolina

Tina Marie Armstrong, 67, of Florence
Dee Alice Moton, 51, of Hephzibah, Georgia

State charges

Latisha Alexandria Massey, 37, of Greer



Three of the people charged lived in South Carolina. Others lived in North Carolina and Georgia, according to the office.
Once the businesses were enrolled in the Medicaid program, the defendants would obtain real names and identification numbers of licensed medical professionals.
Most of the medical professionals whose names and identification numbers were used didn’t know about the scheme. The people running the clinics would get their information from job applications for the fake clinics and by hiring them to review clinical notes — a task that doesn’t require actually meeting with patients, according to the indictment.
The patients supposedly coming to the clinics for treatment were sometimes real and sometimes fake. None of the real patients actually came to the clinics, but the owners paid people with legitimate access to the state’s Medicaid rolls between $200 and $300 per name provided, using about 180 real names in total, according to court filings.
Using those names and identification numbers, the owners of the fake clinics would submit false reimbursement requests for services not actually performed. In some cases, the services couldn’t possibly have happened, since they added up to more than 24 hours of service per day for a single health care provider or covered dates from before a person was deemed eligible for Medicaid, according to the indictment.
Altogether, the fake clinics in North Carolina received more than $21 million in reimbursements from South Carolina’s Medicaid program for services not actually performed, according to the indictment. The conspirators then transferred that money from bank account to bank account in a way that constituted money laundering, the U.S. Attorney’s Office claimed.
One of the defendants in the scheme, North Carolina resident David Hill, has agreed to plead guilty, according to the state Attorney General’s Office.
Services to veterans
As an approved health care provider under the federal Veterans Affairs department, Dee Moton’s massage therapy company Flowing Hands, located in Aiken, was allowed to provide certain health care services to veterans who received referrals.
What Moton, a 51-year-old from Georgia, submitted to the company with which she contracted, however, did not align with the services she provided, leading to charges of health care fraud, according to a federal indictment.
Many of her submissions for reimbursements involved mutually exclusive reimbursement codes. Others were for services she couldn’t have performed, such as wheelchair therapy to patients who did not use wheelchairs, aquatic therapy despite the clinic not having a pool, and remote monitoring of pacemakers for patients who didn’t have pacemakers, according to the indictment.
Over two years, Moton billed the Veterans Administration for more than $2.3 million for services she didn’t actually perform, claimed the state’s U.S. Attorney’s Office, which will prosecute the case.
It’s unclear who is representing Moton, who could not be immediately reached for comment.
False equipment claims
Tina Armstrong, a 67-year-old woman from Florence, was charged with submitting nearly $200,000 to the state’s Medicaid and Medicare programs for medical equipment that was no longer in use, never authorized or not delivered, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.
Armstrong pleaded not guilty, according to court filings.
An indictment listing her charges claimed she received about $105,000 from the claims.
Under the company Safe at Home Medical Equipment and Supplies, located in Dillon County, Armstrong submitted claims for equipment for patients who had died or didn’t use the equipment she claimed they needed and asked for reimbursements for monthly rentals long after the time limits established in federal law had passed, according to the indictment.
Financial fraud
Latisha Massey, a 37-year-old certified nursing assistant, was charged in state court with financial crimes involving the nursing home where she worked, according to an indictment.
The Greer resident transferred funds from the bank account of an adult in her care to her own account and used a card belonging to a resident of the facility where she worked, according to the indictment.
The indictment did not include the amounts Massey is charged with transferring. The state Attorney General’s Office will prosecute her case because — unlike the others — the alleged crimes do not cross state lines.
A message on a phone believed to be Massey’s was not immediately returned.

The transformation is far from guaranteed. Lawmakers first need to agree on a new school district map before proceeding with other facets of the law.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Gov. Phil Scott has signed Vermont’s education bill into law. Here’s what happens next..","Gov. Phil Scott on Tuesday signed a landmark education reform bill into law, laying the groundwork for a historic transformation of Vermont’s public education system.
“While this session was long and difficult and uncomfortable for some, we were able to come together and chart a path towards a system that better serves our kids and one that taxpayers can afford,” Scott said, surrounded by top legislative leaders and other dignitaries, before signing the bill.
He noted, however, that the legislation was “just the beginning,” and work to continue public education reform in future legislative sessions “will be just as difficult and just as important as what we did this spring.”

The signing marks a significant political milestone for the Republican governor, now in his fifth term, who used electoral gains in the state’s Republican Party in November to set the tone for education reform. While the ambitious plan that Education Secretary Zoie Saunders set before lawmakers in January was not adopted wholecloth, what came to Scott’s desk contained similar elements.
Over months of contentious debate this session inside committee rooms and both chambers, Scott put pressure on the Legislature’s Democratic leaders to press on with reforms he wanted, even through deep disagreement within their own caucus.
But lawmakers at the signing lauded what they called a bipartisan achievement. 
Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, said the legislation that emerged “was a substantially bipartisan bill.” House Speaker Jill Krowinski, D-Burlington, called it the “most significant education transformation” in decades. And Rep. Peter Conlon, D-Cornwall, said the bill will “ensure that every Vermont student will have access to high quality public education regardless of where they live.”
The law comes as the state’s public education system faces declining enrollment. The bill states that over the last three decades, the number of students being educated in the public school system has dropped by almost a quarter, from around 110,000 students to approximately 84,000 students.

“Many schools have lost a significant number of students and, with them, the ability to offer robust services and programs at every school,” the bill’s preamble reads. “Vermont’s youth need to be prepared for a rapidly evolving future.”
Lawmakers went into overtime to get a bill passed this session at Scott’s insistence, working weeks past the Legislature’s typical end date to get the bill over the finish line. The governor went so far as to tell lawmakers that if they adjourned without a major overhaul bill, he would use his emergency power to call them back into session.
Votes in the Senate and House were far from unanimous. Most of the Senate’s Democratic caucus members voted against its passing. The bill then passed the House via a controversial voice vote.
Broadly, the new law tries to achieve two goals: equalize educational opportunities across the state, and, over time, make public education more affordable for taxpayers.
Supporters of the legislation have said the law’s changes will slow the rise of education costs and stabilize property tax increases, which were exacerbated in 2024 by changes to the current education finance system and the transition mechanism for them that the Legislature put in place.
But, as the governor noted, the wide-ranging reforms laid out in the bill are far from guaranteed, and the work is hardly over.

“There’s so much work to do that I can’t even see the finish line,” Senate Minority Leader Scott Beck, R-Caledonia, said at the signing ceremony on Tuesday.
The law contains several caveats and contingencies, and will require years of work by state agencies — particularly the Agency of Education and the Department of Taxes — and various advisory committees and working groups before the transition is complete.
Specifically, several dominos need to fall before the Legislature can enact a new education funding formula, which itself will be phased in over a five-year period and, like many of the biggest reforms, would not begin to go into effect until 2028 or beyond.
However, right away, the law puts limits on Vermont’s longstanding practice of public school districts paying tuition to send students to private schools (called independent schools in Vermont law). Starting July 1, out-of-state private schools will no longer be eligible to receive public tuition for new students. Public schools in other states will remain an option. 
Private schools located in the state will have to meet two tests to maintain their participation. First, they must be physically located in a school district or in a supervisory union — an administrative unit made up of multiple districts — where at least one district does not operate a public school for some or all grades as of last July. 
Second, they will need to have at least 25% of the student body composed of students funded by a public school district during the 2023-24 school year. 
A spokesperson for the Agency of Education said the state is working to validate enrollment data for these schools, and has set a July 28 deadline for independent schools to certify their enrollment.
“Once we have those numbers validated, we will have a clearer picture of how many schools will no longer be eligible to receive public tuition,” said Lindsey Hodges, an agency spokesperson.
A transition written into the law requires public school districts to continue paying for current students, or students who have already been accepted through graduation.
Now, the next step for a select group of lawmakers is to craft the proposed boundaries of new, larger school districts. Their colleagues must then approve a proposal next year, sure to be a contentious undertaking. 
“At the end of the day, we will have another vote next year to continue this effort, so people will have a chance to speak with their representatives, and the entire process will begin over again,” Baruth said Tuesday.
If lawmakers cannot come to an agreement on those maps, the rest of the law’s provisions likely won’t see the light of day.
Here’s what will happen next now that Scott has signed H.454 into law.
Redistricting
The next step for lawmakers is to adopt a new configuration of school districts by consolidating the state’s 119 school districts — contained within the 52 supervisory districts or supervisory unions.
The School District Redistricting Task Force, expected to meet “on or before” Aug. 1 this year, will work on “not more than three” options for new school district boundaries, according to the law.
The task force will have 11 members, including six lawmakers and five former superintendents and school business managers, according to the law. To compose the six lawmakers, three will be nominated by the leadership of each chamber and cannot all be from the same party nor same school district. Of the five others, two each will be nominated by leaders of the Senate and the House, with one nominated by the governor. 
The group is expected to bring back plans with anywhere from 10 to 25 future districts. At least one of those options will incorporate the supervisory unions and supervisory district structure, which advocates believe are required to allow for the continuation of historic tuitioning relationships between certain independent schools and specific geographic areas without an operating public school for at least some grades.
These new larger districts would oversee a minimum of 4,000 prekindergarten through grade 12 students, but no more than 8,000 students “to the extent practical,” according to the law.
That directive is likely to bring major upheaval to Vermont’s public schools. Currently, only the Champlain Valley School District in Chittenden County has more than 4,000 students, with other larger districts, like Burlington and Essex-Westford in Chittenden County, hovering around 3,500 students.
The new law mandates that the task force “work closely” with the Commission on the Future of Public Education in Vermont, created as part of 2024’s Act 183 to study Vermont’s public education system.
The commission is tasked with conducting public outreach sessions, and making recommendations to the Legislature about what roles and powers should remain at the local school district level versus what should be moved up to the state level.
Secretary of Education Zoie Saunders testifies before the House Education Committee at the Statehouse on Feb. 4. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
But that commission has floundered since January, when Scott and Saunders released their education proposal. And last week, two members of the commission resigned, saying in emails to colleagues that the commission was “never fully embraced” by the Legislature.
The commission will submit its final report in December, and will then dissolve by the end of the year.
The redistricting task force, meanwhile, is expected to finalize and deliver new school district maps to the Legislature by Dec. 1. Lawmakers will then take up the new maps for consideration during next year’s session, which begins in January. 
Because of the time needed to create representative voting districts for school boards within the new districts, their boundaries would need to be approved and signed into law before the end of the year for the rest of the timeline to remain viable. 
Class size minimums
Under the law, at least 10 students per classroom would be required in first grade, 12 students in grades 2 through 5, 15 in grades 6 through 8; and 18 students for grades 9 through 12. These class size minimums would take effect in July 2026 for the 2026-27 school year and would apply to both public schools and private schools that receive tuition from public school districts.
Some classes and programs would be exempt from those requirements, including prekindergarten and kindergarten, as well as Advanced Placement courses and career and technical education programs, according to the law.
The law allows the State Board of Education to close a school that doesn’t meet these minimums after three years, but the board isn’t required to do that, and the bill allows for a waiver process that would let schools petition for an exemption.
The law does anticipate that small rural schools will continue to exist and reserves some support for them. By Dec. 1, the State Board of Education, per the law, will submit a written report to the House and Senate Committees on Education with proposed standards for schools to be deemed “small by necessity” or “sparse by necessity.” 
Districts with schools meeting those definitions would be eligible for additional support funds.
New school board elections
While the redistricting task force begins its work, the School District Voting Ward Working Group, set to first meet by Oct. 1, will keep an eye on its progress. The law requires the group to consult with the task force by Oct. 15.
That working group will begin creating voting wards for the new districts as soon as possible, depending on what’s been accomplished.
Chaired by the secretary of state, the group, like the redistricting task force, will make recommendations to the Legislature for how to draw voting districts within each new school district “that are compact, contiguous, and drawn to achieve substantially equal weighting of votes” while meeting other state and federal requirements.
The group will recommend to the Legislature the “optimal” number of members on each new board, as well as the boundaries for voting wards within each new school district.
The first school board elections for the new districts are expected to take place in a special election in November 2027, according to the law. The new school districts, with their new board members, would then take over operating schools in July 2028 for the 2028-29 school year.

The law provides staffing and resources to the Agency of Education and State Board of Education to help guide current school districts as they transition their operations to the newly formed districts. That will involve a myriad of legal and administrative tasks, ranging from a new district adopting shared rules and procedures to taking over a former district’s debt obligations.
Prior to the transfer of school operations, the law will also attempt to address one of the more significant expenses affecting local school districts: aging school infrastructure and its cost to repair or replace.
The law creates the State Aid for School Construction Advisory Board, expected to meet in September of this year, to advise the Agency of Education and both current and new school districts on state financial assistance with construction.
That board would work to develop rules for accessing the School Construction Aid Special Fund, which the Agency of Education will administer once the fund is created on July 1, 2026. That fall, the law anticipates that the agency’s budget request will include the fund’s expected spending. 
Education finance
One of the more contentious issues the bill hopes to address is how to allocate funding for public education in the state.
The new law has the state gradually pivoting away from its current funding mechanism — which allows school districts wide latitude in determining how much to spend or not spend — toward a so-called foundation formula, a construct used in most states across the country.  A foundation formula will provide each school district with the same amount per student, weighted to account for the increased costs of educating certain students, such as English learners and students with disabilities. 
Effectively, while school district governing boards would likely still set a budget, the foundation formula would largely give the state control over the size of that budget, and how much the district spends on each type of student.
Full implementation of the new funding formula, however, will not occur for some time. If new school districts are adopted and specific studies completed, the foundation formula would go online July 1, 2028, and would be phased in over a five-year period.
Local districts could raise additional funds from local property taxpayers with voter approval. But that spending, termed supplemental spending, would start out capped at just 10%, though districts can spend less. That cap would be ratcheted down every year until the cap hits 5%. 
The first opportunity voters would have to weigh in on that supplemental spending would be in March 2028. 
Phase in
Under the law’s timeline, the commissioner of taxes would call the first meeting of the Education Fund Advisory Committee in July 2026 to assist in the “transformation” of Vermont’s education finance system. Recommendations on specifics related to the mechanics would then be due in December of that year.
The Legislature’s Joint Fiscal Office would have already found one or more contractors with “expertise in Vermont’s education funding system” to study a number of portions of the new formula and submit a report due in December 2026.
During this phase-in period, the Vermont Department of Taxes is tasked with leading a shift in the state’s mechanism for income-sensitive property tax relief, moving from one based on tax credits to a tax exemption.
The new framework allows Vermonters making $115,000 or less to exempt a portion of the value of their homestead, which is a dwelling occupied year round and up to two surrounding acres, from property taxes.

The exemption creates a sliding scale, with lower-income homeowners eligible for bigger exemptions. Up to $425,000 in home value is eligible for the discount. The law suggests there will be a mechanism for the income threshold and property value threshold to be increased in the future to account for inflation, requiring reports from the department on how to do it.
By Dec. 15, 2026, the tax department, in consultation with the Joint Fiscal Office, will submit a proposal to legislative committees in both chambers on how to design a homestead exemption structure that minimizes the property tax impacts for homestead property owners and avoids a sudden dropoff in eligibility often called “benefit cliffs.”
By the same time the following year, Dec. 15, 2027, the department, in consultation with the Joint Fiscal Office and the Agency of Education, will report to House and Senate lawmakers on an implementation plan “to ensure that education property tax rates do not increase as part of the transition.”
Separate rate for second homes
Perhaps the most uncertain portion of the law is a proposal to rework how second homes are taxed in the state.
The law creates two new categories of property for taxation purposes. One is called “non-homestead residential” property. Lawmakers hope to use this new classification to raise taxes on second homes, which would potentially cover the cost of the homestead exemptions or otherwise alleviate property tax pressure on Vermont resident homeowners. Another new category of “nonhomestead nonresidential” would apply to other properties.
The tax department is tasked with reporting by Dec. 15 of this year on how the new property tax classifications would be implemented. In 2027, the department would need to develop a form that allows property owners to report how their property fits into the classifications. 
However, the new classifications would also be repealed if the Legislature has not approved a new school district map by Jan. 1, 2027. Another deadline is July 1, 2028. By then, lawmakers need to have assigned different tax rate multipliers to the new categories of property or they also go away.

Ron DeSantis met on Tuesday, July 1, at the state's new deportation facility in the middle of the Everglades. (Via governor's X feed)President Donald Trump urged additional states to build immigrant detention centers following his tour Tuesday of the 3,000-capacity tent and trailer Everglades facility the DeSantis administration built in eight days.
The president took the opportunity to press Congress on his giant tax and spending cuts package, saying its passage is necessary to heightened federal immigration enforcement. The Senate passed the megabill with a tie-breaking vote from Vice President JD Vance during Trump’s appearance in the Everglades, and the Trump administration expects its final passage before Independence Day.
Continuing the DeSantis administration’s portrayal of the controversial detention center as inescapable, Trump applauded the location at the Miami-Dade Collier Training and Transition Airport.
“It’s known as Alligator Alcatraz, which is very appropriate because I looked outside, and that’s not a place I want to go hiking anytime soon but, very soon, this facility will house some of the most menacing migrants, some of the most vicious people on the planet,” Trump said. “We’re surrounded by miles of treacherous swamp land, and the only way out is really deportation.”
Another detention center to come
During a roundtable discussion at the facility, DeSantis described the detention center as a “one-stop shop” with a runway that will allow the federal government to carry out deportation flights. The governor used a state of emergency declaration he issued in January 2023 to take over and begin the speedy construction on the land Miami-Dade County owns.
A similar center with the capacity to house 2,000 immigrants is set to open in Camp Blanding in Northeast Florida, the primary training center for the Florida National Guard, after July 4, said Kevin Guthrie, director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management.
Photographs and videos of the Everglades detention center show metal mesh cages with bed bunks and toilets under a tent that Guthrie described as having an aluminium frame that can withstand winds of 110 miles an hour. Hurricane season opened on June 1.
“Why would you want to come through Alligator Alcatraz, if you can just go home on your own?” DeSantis said. “I think a lot of people are going to make that decision. So you’re going to have a lot of deportations that are going to be done by the administration, but I think you’re going to have a lot of voluntary, as well. So this is a force multiplier for the president’s efforts.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Protests and praise from Trump
So far in the Trump’s quest to enact mass deportations — a move DeSantis has sought for the state to take a lead on with partnerships between state and local law enforcement and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — 71.2% of immigrants detained have had no criminal record, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse out of Syracuse University.
In protest, the Miami-Dade Democratic Hispanic Caucus placed a truck billboard on the nearby Tamiami Trail calling Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and South Florida’s Latino Republicans in Congress traitors to immigrants.
“Trump and DeSantis are locking up immigrants under inhumane conditions without even granting them due process. A detention camp without due process is a concentration camp. We will not just accept a concentration camp in our backyard,” said Abel Delgado, president of the Miami-Dade Democratic Hispanic Caucus, in a press release. “We support all legal and political efforts to block this abhorrent violation of basic human rights. We will continue our efforts to protect immigrants and protect the American Dream.”
  Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier via Department of Legal Affairs
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier received nods and praise from Trump during the roundtable.
Uthmeier, whom DeSantis appointed as the state’s chief legal officer in February after serving as the governor’s chief of staff, publicly announced the plan for the Everglades detention center on Fox News on June 18.
“You do a very good job. I hear good things,” Trump said. “I hear good things about you from Ron, too. No, you really do. He’s even a good-looking guy. That guy’s got a future, huh?”
A federal judge out of the Southern District of Florida found Uthmeier in civil contempt on June 17 over his disobedience of an order blocking a new state immigration law.
Trump told Uthmeier he should consider the backlash against the detention center from environmental groups as an honor. Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity filed a suit Friday seeking to temporarily halt the opening of the detention center. However, the judge assigned to the case, Eduardo Sanchez, recused himself on Monday evening, delaying the proceedings.
In a filing opposing the halting of the detention center on Monday, Guthrie argued that the additional capacity is necessary because of overcrowding in ICE detention centers. Five people have died in ICE custody in Florida this year. Isidro Pérez, a 75-year-old from Cuba who had been in the United States for decades, was the latest person to die under detention at Krome Service Processing Center in Miami, on June 26, according to a press release from ICE.
Others with whom DeSantis has had an icy relationship in recent months also attended the president’s tour: Congressman Byron Donalds, running to succeed DeSantis; Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson; Florida House Speaker Daniel Perez; and Sarasota Republican Sen. Joe Gruters.
Kristi Noem, Department of Homeland Security secretary, and Stephen Miller, White House Deputy Chief of Staff, also attended.

Pueblo Action Alliance is one of fifteen plaintiffs appealing a civil lawsuit to the New Mexico Supreme Court alleging the state government failed to regulate oil and gas pollution, claiming it violates resident's constitutional rights. Indigenous and youth plaintiffs on Tuesday said they will ask New Mexico’s highest court to weigh in on a lawsuit alleging state officials failed to protect communities from oil and gas pollution and violated residents’ constitutional rights.
The suit was originally filed on behalf of environmental groups, youth activists and individuals from the Pueblos, the Permian Basin and Navajo Nation against Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, cabinet secretaries at the environment and energy departments, along with the Legislature and rule making bodies for the oil and gas industry.
On Tuesday, attorneys and plaintiffs announced the appeal of a June ruling by a panel of appellate judges, which overturned a lower court’s ruling that the case could partially proceed and ordered the case’s dismissal.
“From our position, the state has not yet addressed the harm that has been imposed on the plaintiff groups and we don’t agree with the court’s decision to dismiss our case,” said plaintiff Julia Bernal, the executive director of Pueblo Action Alliance in a virtual news conference Friday.
The complaint alleges the state government failed to adequately enforce pollution laws on oil and gas, harming nearby communities, Indigenous people and New Mexico youth, which plaintiffs argue is a violation of a 1971 amendment to the state Constitution called the Pollution Control Clause.
That section of the New Mexico Constitution states: “The protection of the state’s beautiful and healthful environment is hereby declared to be of fundamental importance to the public interest, health, safety and the general welfare. The legislature shall provide for control of pollution and control of despoilment of the air, water and other natural resources of this state, consistent with the use and development of these resources for the maximum benefit of the people.”
Plaintiffs want more consideration of the constitutional issue, said Feleecia Guillen, a plaintiff representing the nonprofit Youth United for Climate Crisis Action (YUCCA).
“This appeal is our demand that the courts do their job, to uphold the law and defend our rights,” Guillen said. “The Pollution Control Clause isn’t symbolic: It’s a promise, and it’s time that the state was held accountable to that promise.”
The state has a chance to respond to the new filing before the New Mexico Supreme Court and justices will determine if the case will move forward.
The governor’s office did not immediately respond to a Source NM request for comment on Tuesday afternoon.

Maria Cantwell led a successful push Tuesday to eliminate a proposal inside Republicans’ massive budget bill to dissuade states from regulating artificial intelligence.
The 99-1 vote against the AI provision was a rare bipartisan victory as Republicans steered the megabill across the finish line in the U.S. Senate. The overall legislation will still require House approval before it can be signed into law. In Washington state, existing laws prohibiting deepfakes in political campaigns and fabricated sexual images without consent could have been at risk if Congress moved forward with the restrictions on regulating artificial intelligence.
Other concerns range from replicating a musician’s voice without their permission to protections for children online.
The proposal evolved from a straightforward 10-year ban on state regulation of AI, to tying that ban to billions in federal funding for broadband internet access. States could’ve lost the money if they proceeded with artificial intelligence regulations. Washington stands to receive $1.2 billion from the broadband program, but new guidance from the Trump administration has also thrown state officials for a loop.
In the face of strident opposition from Republican and Democratic leaders at the state and federal levels, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and other Senate Republicans reduced the ban to five years and exempted some statutes in an effort to salvage some version of it. 
Cruz had said President Donald Trump backed the compromise. Proponents fear a patchwork of state and local laws, but Congress has done little to regulate the emerging technology.
In the wee hours Tuesday morning, Cantwell teamed with Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., to toss the provision in any form. Only Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., opposed their amendment. Cruz ended up supporting it.
“The Senate came together tonight to say that we can’t just run over good state consumer protection laws,” said Cantwell, a Democrat. “States can fight robocalls, deepfakes and provide safe autonomous vehicle laws. 
“This also allows us to work together nationally to provide a new federal framework on artificial intelligence,” she added.
Washington Attorney General Nick Brown was among the dozens of attorneys general urging the Senate not to pass the AI proposal. His office houses a state task force focused on artificial intelligence.
This year, the Washington state Legislature considered bills to require public employers to bargain with unions over the use of artificial intelligence, force generative AI developers to help users detect its use and punish people who digitally create or alter images to show minors engaged in sexual conduct.
Brown has sued a software company accused of using algorithms powered by AI to set rents for residential housing.
The first-term Democratic attorney general also requested the Legislature protect children from artificial intelligence-fed social media applications.
“We have so much opportunity at the state level to move forward and innovate and have new ways to protect our kids and all of our residents,” Brown said last month, “but we want to make sure that we have the ability to do that.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chat-gpt-artificial-intelligence.jpeg,,,2025-07-01 16:08:06.305527

Rocky De Witt, R-Lawton, who passed away in June, will take place Aug. 26.
De Witt, 66, died following a battle with pancreatic cancer on June 25. He was elected in 2022 to the Iowa Senate to represent Senate District 1, representing a section of Woodbury County including Sioux City and Lawton. He defeated the incumbent Democrat, Sen. Jackie Smith, D-Sioux City for the position. Prior to serving in the Legislature, he served on the Woodbury County Board of Supervisors.

The August special election to fill the seat will elect a person to serve out the remainder of De Witt’s term, until January 2027. The candidates in the race have not yet been chosen — before the election, the state Democratic and Republican parties will convene district nominating conventions and have delegates select party nominees for the seat.
This special election will be the fourth this year for Iowa legislative seats.
In January, Sen. Mike Zimmer, D-DeWitt, defeated Republican Katie Whittington in the race to replace Lt. Gov. Chris Cournoyer, who resigned from her position after becoming lieutenant governor in December 2024. Rep. Blaine Watkins, R-Donnellson, won in a March special election, filling a seat in House District 100 following the unexpected death of Rep. Martin Graber, R-Fort Madison. And in April, Rep. Angelina Ramirez, R-Cedar Rapids, won a special election filling the seat left by former Rep. Sami Scheetz after he resigned to serve on the Linn County Board of Supervisors.
While Republicans hold supermajorities in both chambers of the Legislature, Democrats have done better than expected in 2025 special elections. Zimmer’s victory was in an area formerly represented by a Republican, Cournoyer, who was elected in 2018 and reelected with 61% of the vote in 2023. While Watkins, a Republican, won in House District 100, he won with 51.5% against Democrat Nannette Griffins’ 48.2% — a much closer margin of victory than Graber’s 2024 election win of 67.9% against independent Nicolas Atwood.

(Courtesy of Burleigh Morton Detention Center)A Bismarck man who formerly ran for mayor of the city has been accused in state and federal court of defrauding public assistance programs of more than $1.8 million.
Isaac Osei Afoakwa, a 55-year-old businessman and pastor, has been charged with six counts of federal wire fraud, one count of aggravated identity theft, two counts of preparing and presenting false tax returns and three counts of making false statements relating to a health care benefit program. All 12 counts are felonies. Afoakwa has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
In a separate criminal case in Burleigh County District Court, Afoakwa faces a felony charge of first offense Medicaid fraud in excess of $50,000. His business, Bismarck Transportation Services, faces the same criminal charge.
A lawyer representing him in both the state and federal cases on Tuesday declined to comment.
According to a redacted federal indictment filed in early June, Afoakwa is accused of fraudulently applying for 34 Paycheck Protection Program loans and eight Economic Injury Disaster loans beginning in March 2020. Both were funded by federal coronavirus relief money set aside by Congress to help businesses struggling to stay afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The indictment, signed by Acting U.S. Attorney Jennifer Klemetsrud Puhl, claims Afoakwa used his identity as well as the identities of others for the fraudulent applications. He falsified tax forms, Secretary of State documents and bank records to make the paperwork look legitimate, according to court records.
While he applied for the money under the guise that they were real businesses, all of the relief money went into Afoakwa’s pocket, the records state. He wrongfully received more than $1.6 million from the two relief programs, according to the indictment. Afoakwa allegedly did not report the money he made from this scheme on his federal taxes.
Afoakwa also is accused in the federal case of stealing roughly $100,000 from North Dakota Medicaid. His transportation business has an agreement with the program to provide non-emergency medical transportation to Medicaid members. The federal indictment states that he wrongfully billed the program for rides that never took place and lied about the type of vehicle he used so he could charge more money, among other things. He also claimed to transport people who were incarcerated to and from appointments, so the services could not have taken place, court records say.
According to an affidavit filed in state court in June, the North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation received a report in March 2024 from Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota that Afoakwa appeared to be billing for medical transportation for a Medicaid recipient’s methadone treatment that had not taken place.
The affidavit, submitted by Bureau of Criminal Investigation Special Agent Brian Updike, alleges that Afoakwa received more than $200,000 in compensation from fraudulent North Dakota Medicaid claims between January 2022 and September 2024.
Afoakwa is scheduled to appear before South Central District Court Judge Jason Hammes for an arraignment at 9 a.m. July 14 in Burleigh County District Court.
A jury trial for the state case against Afoakwa is scheduled to start Oct. 7.
A jury trial for the federal case against him is scheduled to begin Nov. 4 before U.S. District Court Judge Daniel Traynor.
In a June video posted on the Facebook page for his church, Grace Action Chapel International, Afoakwa asked his congregation to stay calm with respect to the criminal cases against him.
“Let’s continue to pray, for we will surely prevail,” he said.
Afoakwa unsuccessfully ran for mayor of Bismarck in 2018. He received about 4.2% of the vote, losing to Steve Bakken.
According to a Monday announcement by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for North Dakota, the federal case against Afoakwa is part of a larger effort by the U.S. Department of Justice to combat health care fraud.

Nessel in a news release announced that she is looking into Twin Flames Universe, a new age spiritual organization with a large online following. The organization promises to match people with their soulmates, coined as “twin flames”, but has received criticism as being a self help and wellness cult. Documentaries on the group include “Desperately Seeking Soulmate: Escaping Twin Flames Universe” and “Escaping Twin Flames.”
The group operates out of Leelanau County and is run by Jeff and Shaleia Divine.
Nessel said she executed multiple search warrants on individuals at the top of the organization and its associated properties. The attorney general said a judge found probable cause that crimes may have been committed by the group and its leadership, leading to the search warrants.
Nessel asked anyone with information about potential criminal conduct regarding Twin Flames Universe or their members to contact her office.
Special Agents from the Department of Attorney General, along with the U.S. Department of Labor – Office of Inspector General, and law enforcement officers from Michigan State Police, the Leelanau County Sheriff’s Office and the Grand Traverse County Sheriff’s Office executed search warrants on Tuesday.

Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear has parted ways with his long-time communications director. 
Crystal Staley, the former spokesperson for the governor’s office, has been succeeded by Scottie Ellis, the governor’s office confirmed Tuesday. 
“Crystal Staley has been a crucial part of Team Kentucky for years, serving during my time as Attorney General and Governor,” Beshear said in a statement to the Kentucky Lantern. “Through unprecedented challenges and historic wins, Crystal was always there to ensure the people of Kentucky were updated and informed. I am grateful to her for her years of service, and wish her the best of luck in this next chapter.”
Staley was director of communications for the governor’s office since Beshear was inaugurated in 2019, according to her LinkedIn profile. Before that, she was director of communications for Beshear’s Attorney General office. 
Staley thanked Beshear “for the opportunity to serve the people of Kentucky,” according to a statement from her shared by the governor’s office. 
“I am grateful for the relationships I’ve built and the support I’ve received from so many people over the years,” Staley said.

Shelley Moore Capito and Jim Justice cast their votes in support of their party’s massive policy bill.
The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” narrowly passed 51 to 50 in the Senate Tuesday after an all-night session voting on amendments. Vice President JD Vance cast the legislation’s tie-breaking vote. 
At nearly 1,000 pages, the bill extends and expands a 2017 tax law to keep individual income tax rates at the same level, according to reporting by States Newsroom. It also makes permanent some tax breaks on business investments and research and development costs. 
To do so, the bill slashes funding to the Medicaid program and shifts significant costs of the Supplemental Food Nutrition Program to the states for the first time. 
In a statement Tuesday, Capito celebrated the passage, saying the legislation includes “significant wins” for the state.  
“The Republican Reconciliation bill is a clear reflection of our priorities: securing our borders, rebuilding our military, preventing the largest tax increase in U.S. history, and unleashing American energy,” Capito said. “I was proud to vote in favor of this commonsense legislation that not only delivers on the promises we’ve made to the American people, but will put West Virginia and our entire nation on a path to greater economic growth, national security, energy independence and opportunity.”
Justice said in a statement the bill provides lasting tax relief and establishes common sense reform to social programs.
“Throughout this process, I worked closely with both President Trump and my Senate colleagues to not only safeguard West Virginia’s interests, but bring prosperity to the state and provide opportunity to the working men and women of this country. West Virginia elected me to be their voice in Washington and deliver lasting positive results just as I did while governor — I am confident this bill is a strong step in the right direction and I will continue my work with President Trump to make life better for West Virginians.”
According to health care advocacy organization “Protect our Care,” the bill as it passed Tuesday would cut $1 trillion from Medicaid and take health care from more than 17 million Americans. It would increase health insurance premiums for more than 20 million people by eliminating tax credits that made health coverage affordable. 
The bill would raise the nation’s debt limit by $5 trillion. 
The legislation has been met with criticism and alarm by some in West Virginia, where more than 500,000 residents rely on Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program for their health coverage and one in six residents receives SNAP benefits. 
Six protestors were arrested for trespassing last week while attempting a sit-in in opposition to the bill at Capito’s Charleston office. 
Health care advocacy organization West Virginians for Affordable Health Care said in a statement Tuesday Capito and Justice “turned their back” on West Virginians, by supporting the bill. 
“Both Senators Shelley Moore Capito and Jim Justice said they went to Congress to help West Virginians; however, they both voted Monday on a bill that will make life more expensive, unmanageable and vulnerable for all but the wealthiest of us,” Executive Director Ellen Allen said. “Not only did they lay the groundwork to dismantle health care for hundreds of thousands of West Virginians, their vote will saddle and hamstring our sons, daughters and grandchildren with backbreaking debt that will make it all but impossible for us to reclaim these losses. This will have negative consequences for generations to come. “
Lynette Maselli, state director of Protect our Care, said  in a statement that Justice and Capito had the power to stop the bill. 
“Instead, they put billionaires over West Virginians and voted to kick seniors out of nursing homes, rip health care away from disabled children, close rural hospitals and strip 17 million Americans of their health care all so they and Donald Trump can give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations,” she said. 
The state Democratic Party suggested that Capito supported the bill in exchange for her son, former state Del. Moore Capito, being nominated to U.S. Attorney for the Southern District West Virginia. Capito announced the political appointment on the social media platform X. 
“One has to wonder why Sen. Capito would be such an enthusiastic cheerleader for a bill that is so devastating to West Virginia and its citizens,” Del. Mike Pushkin, chair of the Democratic Party, said in a statement. “One logical explanation is that she’s holding out for a deal… her vote in exchange for her son’s political advancement. If so, that’s not public service — that’s corruption.”
Pushkin said by supporting the bill, Capito and Justice failed to stand up for West Virginia residents. 
“This budget won’t make life better for West Virginians, it will rob them of their health insurance, take food off the table and kill good-paying jobs — all to line the pockets of the GOP’s billionaire donors,” he said. “This budget is nothing short of an attack on working families across West Virginia. Democrats in West Virginia are mobilizing to hold Republicans accountable everywhere because the stakes have never been higher.” 
The legislation now goes back to the House of Representatives to consider the changes the Senate made to the bill. Trump has said he wants the legislation on his desk by the July Fourth holiday Friday.

(Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)A federal judge gave Justice Department lawyers until noon Tuesday to confirm, in writing, the administration’s plans for implementing an executive order on birthright citizenship after the U.S. Supreme Court lifted nationwide injunctions on the order Friday.
Justice Department attorney Brad Rosenberg said at a hearing in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt on Monday that the Trump administration does not plan to begin acting on the order — which would deny citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. if neither parent was a citizen — for another four weeks. That’s the grace period set in the Supreme Court’s Friday ruling.
But U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman was looking for more than verbal assurances.
“I want to know if the government thinks that it can start removing children from the United States who are subject to the terms of the executive order, and who are not plaintiffs or members of the plaintiff’s organization,” Boardman said.
She ordered Rosenberg to submit in writing, by noon Tuesday, the government’s view of what it can do under the executive order. She also gave Rosenberg until next Monday to respond to the motion by immigrant parents and soon-to-be parents to turn the case into a class action lawsuit — the reason for Tuesday’s hearing.
The Supreme Court ruled Friday that Boardman and judges in two other districts in the U.S. could only block the executive order against plaintiffs that brought the respective cases, but said the district judges did not have the authority to impose nationwide injunctions.
Supreme Court limits injunctions, allows Trump to act on birthright citizenship ban

But the ruling, as well as a concurring and a dissenting opinion, all said “that courts may award injunctive relief beyond the named parties when the case is brought as a class action.”
So attorneys for pregnant immigrants were back in court Monday, seeking to turn the case into a class action for “all children who have been born or will be born in the United States on or after February 19, 2025, who are designated by Executive Order 14,160 to be ineligible for birthright citizenship, and their parents.”
That class involves thousands of babies who have been born since Feb. 19, the day President Donald Trump’s executive order was scheduled to take effect, and thousands more who will be born while the case is decided, as well as their parents, the motion said.
A recent study by the Migration Policy Institute estimated that eliminating birthright citizenship could affect up to 250,000 babies a year.
The attorneys also asked Boardman to grant a preliminary injunction against Trump’s order immediately, to prevent any harm to their clients while the requst for class certification proceeded.
“Removal is not the only irreparable harm that we’re concerned about,” said William Powell, an attorney for the plaintiffs, during Monday’s hearing. “We’re obviously also concerned about other potential ways in which the order could be enforced to deprive newborns of potential rights.”
Potential members of the class are also documenting stress and anxiety, Powell said. He shared an anecdote about a plaintiff who is experiencing a more stressful and difficult pregnancy because she fears what will happen once her child is born.
“It is confusing to them exactly what these things mean,” Powell said. “We can’t really assure them the order is fully blocked, because it’s not.”
President Donald Trump issued the order on Jan. 20, his first day back in office. It claimed that citizenship does not automatically extend to everyone born in the U.S., excluding mothers who are here illegally or on a temporary visas unless the father has citizenship or is here with permanent legal resident status.
Rosenberg argued against class certification, which he said would be “prejudicial” to the government, and noted that the plaintiffs could have moved for class certification before Friday.
The case filed by CASA and the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project includes 15 women — some under pseudonyms because of their legal status — in nine states, including Maryland, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Washington. Some are in the U.S. without documentation, some are here on visas, many have asylum or other immigration applications pending in various stages.

(Photo illustration by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)What a mess South Carolina lawmakers created when they tried, with little public debate, to raise their own pay by a whopping 80% this past legislative session.
The proposal came late in the legislative session out of nowhere, like a bad karaoke singer at a wedding. But soon a majority of legislators were crooning from the same page.
Lawmakers voted to include a $1,500 monthly raise — $18,000 annually — for themselves in the state budget.
Nice trick, eh? When, dear reader, was the last time you gave yourself an 80% pay raise?
Granted, lawmakers haven’t seen a pay rise since the 1990s, but a sudden, unexpected and excessive boost of 80% in one year is, if not obscene, at least unseemly.
It makes lawmakers appear greedy, self-serving and callously indifferent to the struggles many South Carolinians face in today’s chaotic economy.
At a time of so much cynicism about government and other public institutions, South Carolina lawmakers shouldn’t be promoting mistrust.
It’s obviously hypocritical for legislators, so many of whom call themselves “conservative,” to be so generous to themselves with the taxpayer’s dollar while being stingy with programs like the proposed Medicaid expansion for the struggling and vulnerable in South Carolina.
State lawmakers, considered part-time workers, also allow themselves health and life insurance benefits that are harder to access for many other part-time state workers.
Karma happens
But that’s just the beginning of the story. In the wake of the pay raise, along came karma in the form of the state Supreme Court. Smelling a rat, the court suspended the $1,500 monthly raise legislators gave themselves.
Worse for legislators, the court also halted the $1,000 lawmakers have been receiving each month since 1995 through so-called “in-district compensation,” as the SC Daily Gazette’s Skylar Laird recently reported.

The bottom line: Instead of a $18,000 annual pay raise, lawmakers could get a $12,000 annual pay cut.
The state Supreme Court’s actions were prompted by a request from state Sen. Wes Climer, a Rock Hill Republican who challenged the pay increase and must be rather unpopular at legislative parties right now.
That $12,000 reduction, however, may be only temporary, lasting a few months. What happens next depends on what the state Supreme Court decides.
Yes, it’s all a bit hard to keep up with, so let’s cut to the chase with two important points:
• A proposed pay raise for lawmakers should have gone through a committee process that would have allowed for public input and flagged constitutional issues, as Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey said in Laird’s article.
• In addition, a pay increase ideally should be incremental, growing by a few percentage points each year — in the same way lawmakers rightfully raise, for instance, teacher salaries.
That’s how most of the real world operates. If you work your butt off, maybe you get an annual raise of a few percentage points, maybe not.
A modest increase
Lawmakers do deserve modest pay increases over time, but not an 80% boost in one fell swoop. Also, lawmakers should not shut out the public on such important issues.
South Carolina might also follow the lead of 21 other states that appoint independent commissions to recommend salaries. The process should always be transparent.
Legislators, as part-time workers, generally spend about five months, three days a week, in session in Columbia.
For that, they receive an annual salary of $10,400 and stipends for food and lodging during the session, which are currently $240 per day.
Plus, lawmakers get $1,000 a month for “in-district expenses.” That money can be used for almost anything, so it seems fair to consider that as part of their total salary. That’s
the money that has been temporarily halted by the state Supreme Court — along with the $1,500 monthly raise.
By the way, for those who want to check my math, I arrived at the 80% figure simply by adding legislators’ two sources of wages — their salaries plus in-district expense money. I excluded per-diem funds, which can vary and are used directly for legislators’ expenses while in Columbia.
The $18,000 increase therefore would amount to slightly more than an 80% pay raise.
This is not the first time state leaders have supported outsized pay increases for state officials.
Last year, a state commission (dominated by legislators) approved huge pay increases (as high as $58,000) for seven agency heads. In 2022, that state commission doubled the salaries of the state attorney general and state education superintendent while handing out big raises to other statewide elected officials.
To be fair, a modest and incremental pay raise for legislators could have a beneficial effect, leading to a more diverse legislative body in Columbia. Right now, the General Assembly is dominated by male lawyers, male business owners and male retirees who, many would argue, create state policy beneficial to male lawyers, male business owners and male retirees.
Meanwhile, the concerns of mothers and women in general are marginalized in Columbia.
Reasonable wage increases over time could result in a richer policy conversation in Columbia and perhaps even nudge the South Carolina General Assembly toward the mainstream of American politics.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Statehouse-lightning-strike-1024x598.jpg,,,2025-07-01 15:09:12.202904

The measure heads to the U.S. House for consideration. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from U.S. Senate's YouTube channel)TOPEKA — U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran and Roger Marshall of Kansas voted with fellow Republicans to secure passage of the Senate’s controversial budget and tax bill featuring domestic policy priorities of President Donald Trump.
Vice President J.D. Vance capped lengthy debate by casting a tie-breaking vote to send the amended “big, beautiful bill” back to the U.S. House for reconsideration. The president urged federal lawmakers in the House and Senate to complete work on the package by July 4.
“The lefty fake news media has failed to tell the truth about this bill, that it will deliver a win for every single American,” Marshall said. “This is President Trump’s legacy and we are entering America’s golden era.”
Marshall said colleagues aligned with the president were obligated to vote for the Senate bill. “If you supported President Trump, you should support this bill,” he said.
In addition, Marshall said the legislation would spark such a massive expansion of the U.S. economy that it would “help shrink the debt.” The claim conflicted with a congressional budget estimate the bill would add at least $3.3 trillion to the nation’s debt over the next decade. The Senate bill would increase the federal debt limit by $5 trillion.
Moran said he voted for the Senate’s bill because it would extend federal income tax provisions Trump signed into law in 2017 and invest $320 billion in immigration enforcement and the military.
The bill also would slash federal safety net spending on food stamps. It would allow wind and solar tax credits if construction of those renewable energy projects began within a year of the law’s enactment or go into production before the end of 2027.
Moran said the Senate’s amended version of the bill would “bolster our economy and strengthen the safety of our nation.”
His post-vote statement focused on amendments to the bill designed to moderate damage to rural hospitals in wake of cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act.
“I was able to make changes to the legislation to make certain Kansas hospitals will not face any immediate cuts upon enactment of this legislation,” Moran said.
Moran lauded a $50 billion, five-year fund providing emergency assistance to rural hospitals at risk of closure.
Meanwhile, Moran touted $12.5 billion in appropriations to the Federal Aviation Administration to modernize air traffic control infrastructure. It included language giving farmers greater flexibility in acquiring credit and updated farm subsidy programs.
In May, the U.S. House delegation from Kansas split along party lines on the original version of the bill. Republican U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann, Derek Schmidt and Ron Estes voted for that package, but Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids dissented.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Moran-on-VA-2-1024x558.png,,,2025-07-01 15:09:12.202904

(AP) — A federal judge has ruled that recent mass layoffs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services were likely unlawful and ordered the Trump administration to halt plans to downsize and reorganize the nation’s health workforce.
U.S. District Judge Melissa DuBose granted the preliminary injunction sought by a coalition of attorneys general from 19 states and the District of Columbia in a lawsuit filed in early May. Connecticut Attorney General William Tong was part of the coalition that filed the lawsuit. 
DuBose said the states had shown “irreparable harm,” from the cuts and were likely to prevail in their claims that “HHS’s action was both arbitrary and capricious as well as contrary to law.”
“The executive branch does not have the authority to order, organize, or implement wholesale changes to the structure and function of the agencies created by Congress,” DuBose wrote in a 58-page order handed down in U.S. district court in Providence.
Her order blocks the Trump administration from finalizing layoffs announced in March or issuing any further firings. HHS is directed to file a status report by July 11.
The ruling applies to terminated employees in four different divisions of HHS: the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the Center for Tobacco Products within the Food and Drug Administration; the Office of Head Start within the Administration for Children and Families and employees of regional offices who work on Head Start matters; and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.
Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. eliminated more than 10,000 employees in late March and consolidated 28 agencies to 15. Since then, agencies including the CDC have repeatedly rescinded layoffs affecting hundreds of employees, including in branches that monitor HIV, hepatitis and other diseases.
The attorneys general argued that the massive restructuring was arbitrary and outside of the scope of the agency’s authority. The lawsuit also says the action decimated essential programs and pushed burdensome costs onto states.
“The intended effect … was the wholesale elimination of many HHS programs that are critical to public health and safety,” the lawsuit argued.
The cuts are part of a federal “Make America Healthy Again” directive to streamline costly agencies and reduce redundancies. Kennedy told senators at a May 14 hearing that there is “so much chaos and disorganization” at HHS.
But the restructuring had eliminated key teams that regulate food safety and drugs, as well as support a wide range of programs for tobacco, HIV prevention and maternal and infant health. Kennedy has since said that because of mistakes, 20% of people fired might be reinstated.
In a statement Tuesday, Attorney General Tong said, “Donald Trump and RFK Jr. are playing dangerous games with the health and safety of American families, and we just stopped them. 
“Today’s order means vital programs and services— including those supporting Head Start, disease monitoring at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, SNAP and Medicaid eligibility, and others—will remain accessible,” Tong said. “This is still the beginning of a long fight ahead, but we’re not going to let Trump and RFK Jr. dismantle our nation’s health systems to promote conspiracy theories and tax breaks for billionaires.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by David Stephenson)Kentucky health advocates are urging the U.S. House to reject Senate changes to a sweeping budget bill, warning the measure will leave many Kentuckians without access to medical care or food assistance. 
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed 51-50 thanks to a tiebreaking vote from Vice President JD Vance. It  would make deeper cuts to Medicaid than the House version while raising the debt limit by $5 trillion.
Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul was one of three Republicans voting against the bill because it would be “adding to our debt.” The measure now returns to the House where some Republicans are unhappy with the Senate changes to safety net and green energy programs.
Jason Bailey, executive director of the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy, said the proposal will “strip health care and food assistance from millions of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Kentuckians, while ensuring the wealthiest households benefit from a bounty of new tax cuts.”  
“As Kentucky’s U.S. House delegation prepares to consider the Senate version of this bill, we urge the members to prioritize the vast majority of Kentuckians and oppose cuts to vital health care, food assistance, and education programs that are crucial to Kentuckians’ health and well-being and critical for our state’s economy,” Bailey said. 
The measure squeaked through the House 215-214 on May 22 along mostly party lines. Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky split with the GOP to vote against the bill, saying it would increase federal deficits and debt.  
The four other Republicans in Kentucky’s delegation voted for the bill, including Rep. Hal Rogers, whose Eastern Kentucky district is heavily dependent on Medicaid. Among Rogers’ constituents, 44 % are covered by the federal-state program that pays for 1 in 3 Kentuckians’ health care.
Alexus Richardson, the director of communications for the Louisville-based Dare to Care food bank, said the federal government would be “kicking people while they’re already down” if Congress gives final approval to the proposals, which is “the wrong message.” 
“Many families are already struggling. People have not caught up from the pandemic. That’s why we’re seeing long lines as it is,” she said. 
Here’s how advocates and health experts say the budget bill would affect Kentucky, by sector. 
Food assistance

Both the House and Senate versions of the bill are “unacceptable,” Richardson with Dare to Care said. The Senate version proposes deeper cuts than the House’s, though. Among other proposals, the bill would shift costs of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as SNAP, to states. 
Food banks, Richardson told the Lantern, are “already stretched to meet current needs” and “cuts to SNAP and Medicaid not only deepen food insecurity and poverty across our community, they also increase demand on food banks.” 
About 753,410 Kentuckians are food insecure, according to a May report from Feeding America. In 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, that number was 644,540. Being food insecure means a person may not have enough to eat and may not know where their next meal will come from.

The bill heads back to the House for any revisions and another vote. 
“We urge our lawmakers to protect these critical programs, not cut them,” Richardson said. 
If these proposed cuts make it through, Dare to Care could have to turn people away or add new requirements to qualify for food aid. 
“We don’t want to do that. We really don’t want to have to place any kind of restrictions for what we know families need,” Richardson said. But, the organization needs resources to avoid that. “We’re here to fill in the gaps. We’re not here to replace federal programs like SNAP.” 
Kentucky hospitals
The Kentucky Hospital Association has not responded to a Lantern email seeking comment to Tuesday’s Senate vote. Nancy Galvagni, the organization’s president & CEO, signed onto a June 26 letter that warned the bill could hurt rural hospitals. 
“Rural hospitals, along with providers serving rural communities, face significant challenges and serve a large proportion of patients covered by Medicaid and Medicare, both of which reimburse hospitals and providers below the cost of care,” the letter, signed by 14 hospital associations, said. “Consequently, nearly half of rural hospitals operate with negative margins.” 
The letter warned that more than 750 rural hospitals are at risk of closing and 14 are at “immediate risk.” 
“We continue to remind our congressional delegations how all hospitals – rural, urban, and suburban – are key to the healthcare continuum and are facing headwinds that could destabilize health and healthcare in our states,” the hospital associations said. 
Family Health Centers

Dr. Bart Irwin, the CEO of Family Health Centers (FHC) in Louisville, said he’s “saddened and disappointed at the Senate’s passage of HR1.” 
FHC provides health care services on a sliding-fee scale to people who are uninsured or have other barriers to getting health care. More than half of FHC’s patients have Medicaid, Irwin said. 
“This bill is ugly for Kentuckians and community health centers, like Family Health Centers,” he said. “This is a double whammy for patients, who are hardworking, disabled, caring for family members, or are in school.” 
He warned the bill would cause people to lose their Medicaid and become uninsured. 
“Patients who lose their Medicaid don’t go away; they return to community health centers as uninsured patients,” Irwin said. “It is likely that they will lose their health care providers as well since community health centers, like Family Health Centers, depend upon Medicaid payments to sustain their operations. The loss of Medicaid revenue and greatly increased uninsured patients will make health center operations unsustainable.” 
Planned Parenthood

In a Tuesday news release, Planned Parenthood said more than a third of its patients are covered by Medicaid and “blocking access to Planned Parenthood Medicaid enrollees would overwhelm Kentucky’s already overstretched safety net.”  
While not mentioning Planned Parenthood by name, the bill bans Medicaid payments to  clinics and providers that offer abortions even for other health care, such as cancer screenings, and family planning services they provide. 
“If this bill becomes law, thousands of patients who get care at Planned Parenthood’s two health centers in Kentucky would lose Medicaid coverage at their preferred provider, and many will be left with no alternative provider,” Planned Parenthood said. The organization has clinics in Louisville and Lexington.
  Rebecca Gibron (Planned Parenthood photo)
Rebecca Gibron, the CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, which includes Kentucky, said the Senate vote “puts millions of lives at risk across the country, including here in Kentucky, meaning if this bill becomes law, the consequences will be catastrophic.” 
“Our health centers save Kentucky nearly $4.2 million each year by preventing unplanned pregnancies, catching cancers early, and controlling the spread of STIs,” Gibron said. “Stripping that care away, especially now—amid rural hospital closures, a maternal mortality crisis, and a deepening provider shortage—would push an already broken system past the brink.” 
Opioid Use Disorder 
In 2024, 142,312 Kentuckians received addiction services through Medicaid, according to the 2024 Drug Overdose Fatality Report.
Scottie Ellis, a spokesperson for Gov. Andy Beshear, said those services,“from medically-managed withdrawal to counseling and more” helped Kentucky’s overdose deaths decline three years in a row. 
“That progress is now at risk due to the ‘big, ugly bill’s’’ Medicaid cuts, which will cost lives and tear families apart,” Ellis said in a statement. “Gov. Andy Beshear has taken every opportunity to raise his voice about the risks and stand against these deadly cuts, including to state and federal leaders.” 




Politicians react
Kentucky’s Sen. Rand Paul posted on X, formerly Twitter, that he worked all night to stop Congress from adding to our debt” and in doing so “was fighting for the American people and against our out-of-control debt.” 
“I offered my vote for fiscal sanity,” Paul wrote. “Congress chose to sell out taxpayers instead. Only once the bill is released, we will know what the true price was.” 
Senator Mitch McConnell, on the other hand, praised the Senate’s work. 
“The American people sent President Trump and Republican majorities to Washington with a clear mandate: secure the border, restore peace through strength and American energy dominance, and give working families and small businesses relief from the Biden economy,” he said in a statement. “Our votes today are a step toward fulfilling that duty.” 
Kentucky Minority Floor Leader Rep. Pamela Stevenson, D-Louisville, posted on social media that the bill would  “devastate Kentucky.”  
“This bill is great for those rolling in money, but not good for every day Kentuckians — terminating healthcare is devastating for children, working families, the elderly, the disabled, and veterans,” Stevenson, who is running for McConnell’s seat as he isn’t seeking reelection, said in her X post. “This is NOT what the American people voted for. This is what DC politicians voted for.”  
In a video uploaded to Bluesky, Rep. Morgan McGarvey, a Louisville Democrat, called the bill “terrible” and said “I’ve landed in DC and I’m on my way to the House to do everything I can to try to stop it.” 
“This means having conversations with my Republican colleagues, asking them to stand up and do in public what they’re saying in private, that this bill is bad. It’s wrong and hurts people. It shouldn’t be hard.”

Mike DeWine discussing his budget vetoes. (Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)With his signature late Monday night, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has allowed a controversial funding plan for a new Cleveland Browns stadium to go forward. The state will tap its multi-billion-dollar pool of unclaimed funds — money which belongs to ordinary Ohioans — to pay for the Browns’ stadium and other sports and cultural facilities in the future.
Shortly before DeWine signed the budget, Attorney General Dave Yost urged him to veto the provision. Yost argued taking money from Ohioans to fund a privately owned stadium is “poor policy.” Two former Democratic lawmakers who threatened a class action lawsuit last week, said they’re going forward.

DeWine did, however, make one minor tweak to the funding mechanism. The initial program set a $500 million threshold. Projects beyond that amount were eligible for up to 25% of the cost in state funds, but those costing less were only eligible for 15% in state funds.
The governor argued that cost floor “would have the perverse incentive of encouraging projects to become unnecessarily more expensive simply to meet a threshold for state funding.” Instead, all projects will be capped at a 25% state share.
Can they do that? Ohio Senators propose novel, if questionable, Browns stadium funding plan

Why let it go forward?
Although the governor declined to veto the use of unclaimed funds, he didn’t completely embrace the approach.
“Well, as you know, that was not my first choice, I had another way of doing it,” DeWine told reporters Tuesday. The governor’s opening bid would’ve increased taxes on sports betting to fund new facilities. “But, you know, governors don’t get everything they want. Nobody gets everything they want.”
He explained that even if “we’re all invested in our own ideas,” he took a step back and focused on his priorities.
“To me, the biggest objectives were no taxpayers’ dollars used for this, in the sense of nothing coming out of general fund — nothing competing against education,” DeWine explained, “and it couldn’t just be about the Browns, it had to be universal.”
“When you get the two prime objectives,” DeWine added, “it seems to me it’s time to say, ‘Yeah, I’m achieving what I wanted to achieve.’”
The Haslams gave big donations to Ohio lawmakers, who are now deciding the fate of Browns stadium

In a social media post, Browns team owners Jimmy and Dee Haslam praised DeWine for approving the plan and promised to deliver a “transformative project” that will create a “generational impact.”
Still, DeWine’s own comments underscore how fine a line he’s walking. The new fund will be built exclusively on taxpayers’ dollars in the form of old deposits or reimbursements that state officials are holding until claimed. The governor stresses that “stadiums should not compete with mental health. Stadiums should not compete with education.” By sidestepping the general fund, the budget avoids those tradeoffs.
But it’s a distinction that might not make a difference to average Ohioans.
The National Association of State Treasurers — officials typically tasked with unclaimed funds oversight — is explicit in its stance that a state’s role is merely custodial, and citizens’ right to recover property should be maintained in perpetuity.
Ohio’s new budget gives claimants a 10-year grace period, but following that, all assets left in the unclaimed funds trust for more than 10 years will get transferred to the stadium and cultural facilities fund.


Tax relief for every Ohioan
No money for sports stadiums
Cut the waste and bureaucracy
— Rep. Ron Ferguson (@ronfergusonohio) June 5, 2025


The criticism
Ohio’s unclaimed funds trust is worth close to $5 billion, and much of that money has been parked there for well over a decade. But simply taking those dollars, particularly to benefit a billionaire professional team owner, didn’t sit well with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.
In his letter to DeWine, Yost acknowledged some states have instituted similar transfers, but he expressed discomfort unclaimed dollars becoming state dollars in just 10 years.
“This timeline makes Ohio an outlier nationally,” Yost wrote, “and risks inadvertently harming taxpayers unaware they have money in the state’s unclaimed funds.”
In a reference to the Ohio constitution’s eminent domain provisions, he argued “the statutory taking of public funds without clear public benefit is poor policy.” State Supreme Court precedent in cases like Norwood v. Horney holds that governments must demonstrate a public benefit to take private property.
“Billionaires should finance their own stadiums—full stop,” Yost added. “The $600 million handout for a single professional sports facility raises serious concerns about fiscal sustainability and fairness.”
Democratic former Ohio lawmakers threaten lawsuit over Cleveland Browns stadium funding plan

Ohio’s former Attorney General Marc Dann, and former state Rep. Jeff Crossman, both Democrats, visited the statehouse as lawmakers were getting ready to vote on the budget. They warned that if lawmakers went forward, they would file a class action lawsuit.
Tuesday morning, Crossman said, “If Governor DeWine and the legislative majority think they can betray Ohioans’ constitutional property rights without a fight — they’re dead wrong.”
“They’re getting the lawsuit they clearly invited,” he added, “and just like the case decided yesterday on (Pandemic Unemployment Assistance) benefits, we intend to win. Because when the state breaks the law, someone has to stand up for the people of Ohio”.
The governor himself appeared resigned to a fight in court. In bit of homespun storytelling, DeWine recalled being a young lawyer arguing with an older judge in Green County.
“He looked at me and said, Mister DeWine, that’s why God made the Court of Appeals,” DeWine said. “And so, you know, when don’t people don’t like things, they can go to court, and that’s what we have in our system.”

A 3-2 majority of the New Hampshire Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday, July 1, 2025, that the state’s adequacy formula, which provides a base amount of $4,266 per student to public schools, does not pay an “adequate education” and violates constitutional obligations. (Courtesy Litchfield School District)New Hampshire does not provide constitutionally adequate education funding for school districts, the state Supreme Court held Tuesday, in a major decision that could force sweeping legislative changes.
In a long-anticipated ruling, a 3-2 majority on the court found that New Hampshire’s adequacy formula, which currently provides a base amount of $4,266 per student to public schools, does not sufficiently pay an “adequate education” and violates the constitutional obligations set out in a pair of landmark decisions in the 1990s.
“In summary, the record supports the trial court’s conclusion that RSA 198:40-a does not support constitutional muster,” the majority opinion in the case, Contoocook Valley School District v. New Hampshire states. “…It is now incumbent upon the legislative and executive branches to remedy the constitutional deficiency that we have identified.” 
But the ruling was mixed: The court endorsed a Superior Court ruling from 2023 that found that the state should spend at least $7,356.01 per student in order to account for an adequate education. But it stopped short of ordering the state to immediately begin sending more money to schools, holding that doing so would violate the separation of powers doctrine.
School funding advocates and Democrats cheered the result and called on the Legislature to begin making plans to increase the amount sent to schools. Advocates have argued for decades that the state underfunds its share of school funding, forcing districts to rely on local property taxes and creating disparities between wealthier towns and poorer towns.
But Gov. Kelly Ayotte denounced the ruling, and said her office was “evaluating” it “to determine the appropriate next steps.”
“The court reached the wrong decision today. The fact is, New Hampshire is top 10 in the country when it comes to funding our children’s education,” Ayotte said in a statement, referring to the state’s average school spending when counting both local and state funding. 
The voting breakdown of the court’s decision was complicated. Two of the state’s usual five justices did not participate in the ruling. Chief Justice Gordon MacDonald recused himself because he was serving as attorney general when the lawsuit was first filed, and had helped the state defend against it. And Associate Justice Anna Barbara Hantz Marconi has been on administrative leave from the court since July 2024, pending a criminal case against her for allegedly interfering with the criminal investigation of her husband. 
Following the statutory substitution procedure, two retired superior court judges took their place: Judge Tina Nadeau, who served on the Supreme Court in 1996, and Judge Gillian Abramson. Those two judges were chosen at random from a pool of retired superior court judges, following state statute.
In the majority, 3-2 opinion, Associate Justice James Bassett wrote that the current allocation of state funding to schools is unconstitutionally low and must be fixed, and substitute judges Nadeau and Abramson joined him. Associate Justices Patrick Donovan and Melissa Countway dissented on that point.
But in a second ruling, Bassett held that the state does not need to immediately rectify the problem with an increase to state adequacy; on that point, Donovan and Countway agreed with Bassett while Nadeau and Abramson dissented.
Decision affirms Superior Court’s decision
The result is a majority opinion that the Legislature must act and must increase its per pupil school spending, with an acknowledgement that lawmakers and the governor, not the court, should decide how best to do that.
The opinion affirmed much of Rockingham Superior Court Judge David Ruoff’s November 2023 decision in which he ruled in favor of the school districts and set a minimum per-pupil number for adequate state spending that was based on his calculations of what it costs school districts to educate a child. 
Writing for the majority, Bassett praised Ruoff’s method of calculating the actual cost of providing an adequate education. That cost should include “facilities operation and maintenance, transportation, principals, administrative assistants, custodians, and nurses,” Bassett wrote. 
Bassett ruled that the state had not successfully rebutted the argument that those costs should be included in the calculation. And he continued that because the costs should be included, $4,266 in base adequacy cannot be seen as constitutionally adequate. 
“Accordingly, we affirm the trial court’s injunction to the extent it established “a conservative minimum threshold of $7,356.01 which base adequacy aid funding must exceed” as guidance for future legislative action,” Bassett wrote.
Hitting that minimum would cost the state more than $500 million per year, a near 50% increase of the state’s current spending. 
State, school districts spar at Supreme Court hearing over school funding

In their dissent, Countway and Donovan disagreed on several points. First, they asserted that the court should not limit its analysis to just the $4,266 in base adequacy per pupil, but should also include the additional provisions in which the state gives an additional $2,300 for every student whose family makes under 185% of the federal poverty level; $2,100 for every student who receives special education services; and $800 for every student who is an English language learner. Those additions brought the state’s allocations in line with the definition of adequacy, the two held. The Superior Court also inserted its own standards for proper student-teacher ratios to arrive at its $7,356.01 minimum, Countway and Donovan added, which inflated that amount.
Second, Countway and Donovan argued that regardless of state spending, New Hampshire children are receiving adequate educations when local education dollars are considered, noting that no school district in the 2021 to 2022 school year spent less than $14,000 per student when combining state and local spending. 
And third, Countway and Donovan contended that the separation of powers doctrine precludes the Supreme Court from issuing any mandates that the Legislature increase its spending.
“We believe that the trial court erred when it … established a conservative minimum threshold amount that base adequacy aid must exceed, thereby invading the legislature’s policy-making function,” the dissent wrote.
Legislative reaction mixed
It was not immediately clear how the Legislature might react to the decision. The ruling comes four days after Ayotte signed a two-year budget that did not raise the amount sent per pupil beyond increases for inflation. 
House Bill 2 of the budget also inserted a pronouncement by the Legislature ahead of the ruling:
“The legislature now deems it necessary to definitively proclaim that, as the sole branch of government constitutionally competent to establish state policy and to raise and appropriate public funds to carry out such policy, the legislature shall make the final determination of what the state’s educational policies shall be and of the funding needed to carry out such policies,” the Republican-passed bill states.
Lawmakers had sharply different reactions to the court’s ruling. Democrats embraced it.
“The Court’s decision unanimously affirms what Democrats have been saying for years — that the state inadequately funds public education and places too much burden on property taxpayers,” Rep. Dave Luneau, a Hopkinton Democrat, said in a statement Tuesday. “When the Legislature returns this fall, we must act immediately to fix our education funding inequities.” 
Senate President Sharon Carson and House Speaker Sherman Packard — both Republicans — objected to the ruling but did not outline specific actions.
“Since this latest case was filed, the Legislature has twice increased state education funding,” the Republican leaders wrote. “The current state budget going into effect today dedicates nearly $2.2 billion to local schools, yet the court continues to second guess legislative decisions to target aid to students and communities who need it most. The Court’s rampant judicial overreach is pushing New Hampshire towards a one-size-fits-all state-run school system.”
Carson and Packard made one promise: “The Legislature will continue to reform our schools while avoiding a broadbased sales or income tax.”

Mike DeWine used his veto power to nix a provision that would have prevented funds from going to youth homeless shelters that house transgender youth, a program that would have created an non-chartered education savings account, and blocked compliance to a new higher education law from being tied to state funding.
DeWine signed the budget late Monday night and it will go into effect on Oct. 1. He issued 67 vetoes, the most during his time as governor. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
He vetoed a provision that would have prohibited giving funds to youth homeless shelters that house transgender youth, even if they also serve youth who are not transgender. 
“We want homeless shelters to be open and for everyone,” he said. 
No Ohio youth should be turned away from a homeless shelter that receives state funds, DeWine wrote in his veto message. 
“The reality is that a homeless child has been through a horrible experience and likely needs to be met where that child is at emotionally,” he wrote. “If a shelter has to call a homeless youth a pronoun that is incongruent with that youth’s gender to get that person into a shelter so the child won’t freeze to death, it needs to be done without fear of getting funding clawed back.”
Non-chartered Educational Savings Account Program
DeWine vetoed the non-chartered Educational Savings Account Program, which would have allowed students going to noncharted nonpublic schools to get state funding for tuition through an educational savings account. 
These schools do not receive state or federal funds since they are not charted by the state. 
“There’s no accountability,” DeWine said. “There’s no tax dollars.” 
In his veto message, DeWine mentioned Bishop Sycamore, a former non-charted nonpublic school that pretended to have a football program in Columbus, but was ultimately discovered to be a scam in 2021. 
“There is a lack of oversight and compliance mechanisms for NCNP schools in Ohio law and rule,” he wrote. “Without proper accountability, this item would risk taxpayer dollars on programs that may have compromised educational quality or that could risk student safety.” 
The Ohio House added the provision to the budget, only to be taken out by the Senate, but it was brought back during conference committee.  
Higher education 
DeWine vetoed a provision that would have tied a portion of the State Share of Instruction to compliance with Ohio Senate Bill 1, a new higher education law banning diversity efforts, creates post-tenure reviews and an American civic literacy course, among other things. 
Under the provision the Senate added to the budget, each university would have been required to submit a report showing compliance to the House and Senate higher education committees by March 1. 
“This violates the separation of powers that is embedded in the framework of the Ohio Constitution that define the substance and scope of powers granted to the three branches of state government and intrudes upon the constitutional authority of the executive branch to distribute funds that have been appropriated through this budget bill,” DeWine wrote in his veto message. 
The Ohio Department of Higher Education is able to determine compliance with the new law, DeWine wrote. 
Drivers training 
The budget raises the age that Ohio drivers must complete drivers training in order to get their license, from 18 to 21. 
The law currently says only those under 18 years old must complete the driver’s education course and complete 50 hours of practice driving with a licensed driver. The Ohio House added that provision to the budget, only to be taken out by the Senate, but it was brought back during conference committee.  
“We know that young people who go through driver’s training become safer drivers, safer for themselves and safer for everyone else on the road,” DeWine said. 
The most dangerous group of drivers are 18-25 year olds, DeWine said. 
“We have so many young people turning 18 never taking driver’s training,” he said. “In this budget, we’re protecting all Ohioans on the road. … We know that somebody who’s had driver’s training is statistically a better driver, and we know they’re less likely to kill somebody or kill themselves.”
Eye program 
The budget creates the OhioSEE program, which will give school-aged kids comprehensive eye exams.
DeWine originally put this in his version of the budget and it was added back in during conference committee after the Senate took it out. 
“Too many Ohio students fail a vision screening at their school, but then they never receive follow up eye care at all,” DeWine said. “Improving children’s vision will improve their success at school, which is a win for students, families and schools.”

(Photo courtesy of Washington governor’s office)Slow revenue growth continues to pinch state budgets across the country, leading governors to propose spending cuts, hiring freezes and some tax increases.
In its spring survey of states, the National Association of State Budget Officers found that general fund spending will hold steady in fiscal 2026 as states expect limited revenue growth but increased costs.
Though most states are meeting or exceeding 2025 revenue projections, a growing number are downgrading their revenue expectations for the next fiscal year, Shelby Kerns, executive director of the national association, said in a news release.
“In a number of states, we’re seeing expenditure projections outpacing revenue growth, forcing policymakers to make hard choices in order to balance their budgets,” Kerns said.
Cutting services or raising taxes: State lawmakers weigh how to fill big budget gaps

States typically wrap up budget work by the end of June, with the next fiscal year beginning July 1. Kerns said the organization anticipates states may need to make mid-year budget adjustments depending on upcoming federal changes in tax policy and spending.
In recent years, many states have been flush with an influx of federal pandemic aid and strong tax revenues from a booming national economy. But with the end of pandemic aid, an uncertain economic future and deep cuts to state taxes, many lawmakers this year confronted major budget challenges in statehouses.
Just weeks after signing a budget that required deep spending cuts and increased taxes, Washington Democratic state Gov. Bob Ferguson told state agencies to prepare for even more belt tightening.
“We will very likely continue to face a challenging state budget environment in the coming year and anticipate increasing caseloads and ongoing uncertainty in the economy and federal funding,” said a June 4 memo from the governor’s budget director to agency leaders, according to the Washington State Standard.
Still, many states continue to tout major levels of reserve funds.
The National Association of State Budget Officers found at least 30 states expect to maintain a rainy-day fund balance exceeding 10% of their general fund expenditures. This year, 29 states grew their reserve funds, with the majority of states expected to continue to grow their savings next fiscal year.
In Tennessee, general fund revenue growth is slowing, but state leaders were able to rely on $1.5 billion in unspent state funds and $700 million in interest earnings from federal pandemic funds, the Tennessee Lookout reported.
“Despite tighter fiscal conditions, states overall remain in a solid fiscal position with rainy day funds at near all-time highs, low debt levels, and strong credit ratings,” David Thurman, Tennessee’s budget director and current association president, said in the group’s news release.

Metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease, or MASLD, which can develop unnoticed over several years, affects more than 40% of Hispanic patients and costs the U.S. health care system more than $100 billion annually. The most frustrating part is that this serious and sometimes lethal illness can be reversed with early identification and treatment.
MASLD is directly linked to obesity and represents an urgent yet overlooked health crisis —especially in Hispanic communities. By the time patients reach me, some are severely ill, and some will die without a liver transplant. Physicians know how to prevent MASLD: by treating obesity. Yet many patients lack access to the treatment and care that could be a lifesaver.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
I recently treated a patient with significant fatty liver disease on course to develop liver cirrhosis. She had struggled with her weight for years, and despite her best efforts, she could not make any progress. I worked with her to introduce a lifestyle intervention program that focused on meal replacements and behavior change. She quickly learned that portion control was her biggest challenge, especially when eating out or celebrating holidays. Using what she’s learned from the program, she finally achieved sustainable weight loss and has been able to stop seven prescription medications. Her liver tests are now normal, and she has maintained this progress for four years. She is now a role model for her family and influences them to make healthier choices. Her progress is nothing short of inspiring.
In Colorado, the Hispanic community is the fastest-growing demographic and is diagnosed with obesity at rates higher than the general population. Certain genetic factors also increase the susceptibility of Hispanic patients to MASLD. But unless we address underlying obesity, we will continue to waste billions of dollars and lose countless lives needlessly.
In 2013, the American Medical Association declared obesity a disease due to its complex nature, shaped by genetics, environment and biology. This declaration was also intended to reduce the stigma associated with obesity so that patients would be more likely to seek help. However, the most effective treatments, such as nutritional counseling and new FDA-approved medications, are not covered by Colorado’s Medicaid program, making them inaccessible for those in greatest need.
At a time when Medicaid funding is in jeopardy, Colorado policymakers have an opportunity to reduce the cost of health care by covering less-costly nutritional counseling and behavioral therapy. Investing in coverage of FDA-approved obesity medications has the potential to reduce long-term costs even further, with better health outcomes.
Physicians and policymakers must come together to recognize the connection between obesity and liver disease and develop lasting solutions to ensure patients receive the treatment they deserve. The liver is the body’s natural detox system, and we cannot live without it. However, it can’t protect us if we don’t protect it.

Wharton,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/01/hr-1-cuts-protect-graduate-education-in-connecticut/,"Let’s be clear: this bill's changes would not reduce costs; they would simply shift the burden to students and institutions, such as SCSU.","Higher education has been a critical part of Connecticut’s notoriety for the public good, despite state and now proposed federal cuts. Graduate education – in particular – has been a worthwhile investment and is hardly a luxury in Connecticut.
At Southern Connecticut State University (SCSU), we educate the professionals who staff our schools, clinics, hospitals, labs, and public agencies. Many of our graduate students are first-generation college graduates and working adults striving to uplift themselves, their families, and their communities. That’s why the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (H.R.1), recently passed by the U.S. House of Representatives and today by the Senate, is so deeply troubling.
The Council of Graduate Schools (CGS), which represents more than 400 institutions nationally, including many in New England, recently sent a letter to Senate leadership warning of the severe consequences of this bill for graduate education. The bill, as written, would:

Terminate the Graduate PLUS Loan Program by 2026, which thousands of graduate and professional students rely on to bridge the gap between tuition and federal unsubsidized loan limits; 
Impose strict caps on student borrowing $100,000 for graduate students, $150,000 for professional students, and a $200,000 lifetime cap; ignoring the reality of advanced, high-cost programs; 
Require institutions to repay the federal government for student loan balances deemed “unrecoverable,” disproportionately impacting regional public universities; 
Cap financial aid based on the national median cost of programs, regardless of actual expenses; 
And dramatically increase taxes on university endowments, reducing scholarships, fellowships, and research funding. 

Let’s be clear: these changes would not reduce costs; they would simply shift the burden to students and institutions, such as Southern that are already operating with limited resources.
The Connecticut impact
In Connecticut, approximately 17,000 students are enrolled in graduate or professional programs across public and private institutions. Many of them come from working- and middle-class backgrounds, and nearly 30% identify as students of color, reflecting our state’s commitment to equitable access to education. 
According to the Connecticut Department of Labor, over 40% of jobs are projected to grow fastest through 2030, including in health care, education, and mental health services, require a graduate degree or specialized post-baccalaureate training.
Moreover, median student debt nationally among borrowers who pursue graduate education often exceeds $60,000. The Grad PLUS Loan program, targeted for elimination in the bill, provides essential financing to help these students enter critical fields without being forced into predatory private loans that carry interest rates up to 16%.
Connecticut’s regional public universities such as Southern Connecticut State University play a unique and vital role in training the state’s workforce. But the institutional “risk-sharing” measures in H.R.1 would penalize these institutions for serving non-traditional and first-generation students who are statistically more likely to face financial hardship after graduation, regardless of their ultimate success.
At SCSU, nearly 50% of our graduate students identify as students of color, and over 40% are first-generation college students. These students are not only succeeding academically, they are preparing to become Connecticut’s next generation of school counselors, nurses, educators, nonprofit leaders, and scientists. Most importantly, over 80% of our students remain in Connecticut after they graduate, contributing their skills and knowledge directly to our local communities.
These proposed federal changes would cut off their most reliable access to affordable financing, forcing them to turn to private loans with high interest rates. Meanwhile, capping loans based on median national cost will underfund programs that are more expensive to deliver, such as our STEM education, communication disorders, nursing, and counseling that require intensive clinical placements.
The consequences wouldn’t only be limited to students but would ripple through every sector in Connecticut. Our state, like nationwide trends, is already struggling with shortages in teaching, mental health, nursing, and health professions. Federal changes that make graduate education less affordable and accessible will further deepen these shortages, undermining efforts to recruit and retain talented and qualified professionals.
Future considerations will be lessened by the federal government while more interest and support must be considered by the state government. Connecticut officials, especially lawmakers, need to revisit the impact of federal cuts and reforms affecting graduate education and funding in the near future.  As federal support declines, more interest and investment will be needed to protect opportunities for our residents and maintain a strong, competitive workforce.
Our state has long been a national leader in public education. Let’s not undermine that progress. Our region should be an exemplary model for higher education and Connecticut must lead the way.  The future of our workforce, and the strength of our communities, depend on graduate education. Public universities like SCSU are mission-driven to serve local communities and advance social mobility. If these federal provisions pass as proposed, they will force institutions to make difficult choices about which programs can survive and more devastatingly–whom they can afford to serve. This threatens to widen inequities deprive universities of their flexibility in meet Connecticut’s ability to meet its workforce development goals.
Higher education should not become a field where working adults and aspiring professionals are collateral damage. We need policy solutions that expand opportunities, not limit them. We also need funding models that recognize the long-term value of investing in a graduate-educated workforce, especially in a state like ours where economic competitiveness depends on it and preventing a problematic brain drain.
Connecticut cannot afford to let shortsighted federal policy undermine the pipeline of skilled professionals we need. Graduate education is the backbone of a thriving, inclusive, and innovative workforce in Connecticut.  Everyone who cares about our economy, our schools, our healthcare systems, and our communities should pay attention to what’s at stake. We must stay informed and ready to speak up for accessible, equitable, and affordable graduate education for all.

(Photo Courtesy of the Navajo Nation Police Department)Hundreds of residents in several communities on the Navajo Nation are under evacuation orders as the Oak Ridge Fire, which has zero containment near Window Rock, continues to spread.
As of Tuesday, just three days after the fire began, more than 350 people had been evacuated.
The fire, eight miles southwest of Window Rock, had burned 9,847 acres, according to the Southwest Area Incident Management Team 2, a national emergency management organization.
The incident team reported on Tuesday morning that the fire was pushed six miles to the west in just a few hours on Monday night, and “200-foot flames were reported as the fire covered the length of two football fields in a matter of minutes.”
Due to the intense shift in the fire on Monday night, firefighters were pulled back and did not reengage the fire until conditions improved, according to the incident team’s update on Tuesday morning.
Fire crews on the northeast section of the fire are monitoring the firelines that have been established over the last few days to ensure they will continue to hold.
The east section of the blaze is being monitored by structure protection groups, who are continuing their work to secure structures with the intention of allowing people to return to their homes.
At the south end of the fire, the incident team reported that it is not expected to spread, but it will continue to burn any available fuel within the area.
For the west portion of the fire, “crews are utilizing and strengthening roads and natural fire breaks to contain potential fire spread.”
Airtankers will continue to be used to support the ground operations, according to the incident team.
Monday night town hall
The Oak Ridge Fire was initially reported on June 28 by a Navajo Nation police officer, according to the Office of the Navajo Nation President.
Two wood haulers were cutting fresh oak in the area when a small fire started, according to officials. The fire quickly spread due to the wind.
The cause of the fire is still under investigation by the BIA; but it is driven by wind and fueled by grass, undergrowth and timber.
Because of the severity of the fire, the Bureau of Indian Affairs Complex Incident Management Team and Southwest Area Incident Management Team 2 have assumed operational control from the Navajo Nation’s initial incident command team, and they are now managing the response efforts for the fire.
“Your folks did a great job with the initial attack when it started,” said Rocky Gilbert, a chief for the Southwest Area Incident Management Team.
“We’ve been using airtankers all day,” he said, adding that they have been battling the wind.
Most of the fire containment efforts are focused on the western section of the fire, near the Transwestern Pipeline, County Road and Indian Route 201.
Gilbert said crews were set up behind the El Paso Gas Substation, Hunters Point, and the Saint Michaels area surrounding Indian Route 201, with dedicated crews in the area to protect structures.
“There are 350 firefighters out on the fire line fighting the fire,” Morse said, and officials have asked for 10 more crews and engines.
John Truett, incident commander for the incident management team, said that they have only been in the area for a day, but they feel welcomed by the community.
He added that officials are working on a plan to address the fire that will work for everyone.
“We know that this is very sacred ground, so we don’t want to go out and destroy anything,” Truett said.
“Our fire line is not going to affect any of the sensitive areas out there,” he added.
Navajo Nation Police Lt. Tyler Lynch, serving as the incident commander for the Navajo Nation Department of Emergency Management, provided an update to the community during the town hall meeting Monday night.
Lynch wanted to remind the community that they are operating under the “Ready, Set, Go!” system, a nationwide preparation program.
“Ready” means being prepared and aware of the hazards threatening the area. “Set” means to remain alert and recognize that there is significant danger nearby. “Go” means it is time to evacuate, and the danger in the area is imminent and life-threatening.
“Having a plan is important,” Lynch said, and he shared an updated map with the community that showed which areas surrounding the Oak Ridge Fire were in “Ready, Set, Go!” stages.
As of Monday night, two areas were under “Go” evacuation orders, four areas were under “Set,” and one was under “Ready.” Several communities lie within the boundaries of these evacuation zones, including Hunters Point, Saint Michael’s, Oak Springs, Pine Spring, Klagatoh and Cross Canyon.
“We have evacuated 100 families,” Lynch said. There are community health representatives and police officers actively checking on families in the area.
Resources available for those impacted 
The Navajo Nation Council is urging residents to be vigilant and follow all emergency protocols and evacuation alerts as emergency personnel continue to fight the Oak Ridge Fire.
“The Oak Ridge Fire is an emergency that is threatening our rangelands, public and residential structures, and livestock,” Navajo Nation Council Speaker Crystalyne Curley said in a press release.
Curley said the Navajo Nation Council is receiving reports that residents in the affected areas are choosing to stay in their homes, despite evacuation alerts intensifying.
“We ask all community members to not act in haste and to prioritize their safety given the growing fire,” she said.
An evacuation shelter has been established at the Bee Hółdzil Fighting Scouts Events Center in Fort Defiance and donations of things like new towels and bedding, shade structure, nonperishable food and baby supplies are being accepted there.
Monday night, the Navajo Nation Department announced that the Ganado Fieldhouse will be open as shelter for residents in and around the Klagetoh pump station area. The area is under “Go” evacuation status after the fire shifted due to strong winds.
“It’s a shock for many of our people being asked to evacuate,” Curley said. “They’re in shock, but we have to do what we can to provide these resources.”
During the town hall meeting, Curley said multiple resources are available at the Bee Hółdzil Fighting Scouts Events Center, including shelter, food, water, and counseling or mental health services.
Families who have animals are being directed to the Navajo Nation Department of Agriculture for livestock evacuation assistance. For smaller animals, they are directed to the Navajo Nation Department of Education.
Navajo Nation officials are urging the public not to park or travel near the fire, as they continue to encounter people trying to take pictures and videos of the fire.
“You can get in the way of our fire team,” BIA Navajo Regional Director Deborah Shirley said during the town hall meeting.
She said that they will have a team in the area to ensure no one interferes with firefighting efforts.
People coming into the area to shoot video and photos are creating unnecessary traffic, Curley said.
“Safety is number one,” she said, adding that people need to stay clear of the area around the fire. “Only our first responders and direct family members should be in that area.”
Curley also advised Navajo people to depend on official sources for information about the wildfire.
She said that those looking for updates should get them from the official social media pages of the Navajo departments in charge, because misinformation is being spread on social media.
“We need to stay calm and alert,” she said.
The Navajo Nation does not have an official GoFundMe page set up and is not accepting monetary donations, Curley said.
“Be aware of scams,” she added.
Navajo Nation declares state of emergency
Due to the severity of the Oak Ridge Fire, the Navajo Nation Commission on Emergency Management declared a state of emergency on June 28, requesting additional resources to address the wildfire impacts.
The declaration enables the immediate allocation of critical resources and operational support, CEM Chair Marcarlo Roanhorse said in a press release.
“We express deep appreciation to the firefighters, law enforcement, emergency personnel, and volunteers working on the front lines,” Roanhorse said. “As a Commission, we stand ready to support our Nation through this challenging time with diligence, compassion, and an unwavering commitment to public safety.”
Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren signed an executive order enacting more robust Stage 2 fire restrictions due to the heightened wildfire risk.
Some of those restrictions are a prohibition on all open flames, including campfires and charcoal use, even in designated recreation areas, as well as operating chainsaws or other internal combustion engines.
As part of the emergency declaration, the Navajo Nation will activate available resources, including funding for personnel, equipment, and other support, to restore and maintain critical community infrastructure.
The declaration states that all Navajo Nation divisions, departments, programs, and chapters must coordinate emergency responses, allocate resources, and carry out response actions in partnership with federal, state, and tribal entities to address the needs of affected communities.
Donation drives for families impacted
Navajo woman Janell Brown and her daughter, Rayleigh Billy, saw the massive amount of smoke in the area while driving through Window Rock on June 28.
Brown, 32, said that her daughter pointed out the smoke in the distance. They were concerned about it, later learning that it was the Oak Ridge Fire.
“It’s so close to home,” Brown said. Her family lives in Navajo, New Mexico, which is about 25 minutes north of Window Rock. “It makes us sad with how many people had to up and leave and they couldn’t take anything.”
With the fire being so close, Brown said her daughter wanted to do something for the community.
“It’s really sad to me that they have to leave everything,” Billy said, adding that the experience of leaving their home will affect them.
“I’m sorry,” she said. “I’ll keep praying for them to get home.”
Billy, 11, is the 2024-2025 Miss Navajo Elementary. As a way to help the community, Billy and her mother hosted a donation drive at the Navajo Pine Market in Navajo on Monday.
“She’s representing her community,” Brown said. “We’re just trying to make a little impact and I know it will make a big difference for them.”
Brown and Billy collected monetary donations, cases of water, baby wipes, tissue, toothpaste and toothbrushes during their donation drive. They plan on hosting another one July 2.
Brown said that they plan to use the monetary donations to purchase necessities that have been requested for donation.
The mother-daughter team will be taking the donations to the Navajo Nation’s designated donation spot at the Bee Hółdzil Fighting Scouts Events Center, where they have been volunteering.
Multiple efforts are underway to collect donations for the families affected by the Oak Ridge Fire, including several in the Valley.
The Phoenix Indian Center is accepting donations through July 3 and plans to make its first delivery on July 2. Donations can be dropped off at 4041 N. Central Ave. in Phoenix.
Native Health Phoenix locations are accepting donations at three sites. There are two Phoenix locations: 4041 N Central Ave. and 8800 N. 22nd Ave., and one Mesa location: 777 W. Southern Ave.
The donated items will be delivered to the St. Michaels Chapter starting July 2, according to Native Health’s Facebook page, with additional deliveries on July 3 and July 4.
“Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of the Oak Ridge Fire,” they stated in their post. “We send our gratitude to those that are fighting the fire and those working behind the scenes to assist the community.”

A group of 33 parents, teachers and faith leaders on Tuesday asked the state’s highest court to block the controversial new standards, which will dictate what topics public schools must teach in social studies classes starting in the 2025-26 academic year. They requested Oklahoma’s previous social studies standards, enacted in 2019, be reinstated until a new version is validly approved.
The plaintiffs contend the pro-Bible standards are unenforceable because they would unconstitutionally impose Christian beliefs on public-school students. The lawsuit also claims the Oklahoma State Board of Education failed to uphold state law when approving the standards on Feb. 27. Half of the board’s sitting members said they were unaware at the time of the vote that the standards contained significant changes from an earlier draft shared with the public.
Another lawsuit, which a judge dismissed in Oklahoma County District Court, made a similar argument that the state Board of Education didn’t follow proper procedures when it approved the standards. Former Attorney General Mike Hunter filed the case on behalf of a different group of Oklahoma parents, grandparents and teachers, and he said he intends to appeal his case to the state Supreme Court.
The plaintiffs who filed the latest lawsuit on Tuesday are represented by attorneys from the national organization Americans United for Separation of Church and State and a local advocacy group, the Oklahoma Appleseed Center for Law and Justice.
“Our lawsuit defends educational integrity and the public’s right to open, accountable government, and it defends the family as the source of the child’s religious upbringing,” Oklahoma Appleseed legal director Brent Rowland said in a statement.
The Oklahoma State Department of Education did not immediately return a request for comment.
With the start of the next school year approaching in August, the plaintiffs asked the state Supreme Court to temporarily prevent the new standards from taking effect while the case is pending.

Some of the plaintiffs, along with Americans United attorneys, sued last year to block a mandate from state Superintendent Ryan Walters that all public schools teach from the Bible and keep a copy in every classroom. That case is still pending before the state Supreme Court. 
Walters has since used state funds to purchase over 500 copies of the Bible to distribute to schools.
The new social studies standards, which Walters’ administration developed at the state Department of Education, would require elementary students to learn Bible stories and Jesus’ teachings “that influenced the American colonists, founders and culture.” 
In fifth and eighth grades, students would have to learn the Judeo-Christian values that influenced America’s founders.
Walters has said biblical instruction is essential to ensure students understand more context of American history.
But, the plaintiffs contend this infringes on their religious freedom and their legal right to direct their children’s moral and religious upbringing. Most of the plaintiffs are not raising their children in a particular religion, or they have different Christian and Jewish beliefs from what the new standards include, according to their lawsuit.
The lead plaintiff is a Baptist minister, the Rev. Mitch Randall, of Norman.
“To reduce the Bible to a history book – rather than treating it as a theological text – does a disservice to public school students, their families, their teachers and those who consider the Bible to be a book of faith,” Randall said in a statement.
Randall and the plaintiffs also objected to parts of the standards that present disputed claims about the 2020 presidential election and COVID-19.

The standards suggest there were “discrepancies” in the results of the 2020 election, including “sudden halting of ballot-counting in select cities in key battleground states, sudden batch dumps, an unforeseen record number of voters and the unprecedented contradiction of ‘bellwether county’ trends.”
This language, along with Walters’ public statements that Trump “should have won” the 2020 race, “make clear that the 2025 standards are intended to promote the view that Donald Trump was the true winner of the 2020 presidential election,” the lawsuit contends.
Walters has said the standards weren’t written to support a specific viewpoint on the election, but rather to encourage students to make their own conclusions.
The case also points to a statement in the standards that the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic was a Chinese laboratory, which the plaintiffs say lacks scientific consensus.
“As a Christian, I object to Oklahoma’s new social studies standards that require teachers to deceive students by presenting inaccurate information as fact,” Randall said.

Ken Paxton, Attorney General of Texas.” (Photo by Luke Johnson for The Texas Tribune)Texas’ law requiring Pornhub and other adult websites to verify users’ ages is constitutional and can remain in effect, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Friday.
The case stems from a 2023 law, HB 1181, that required websites to verify that a user is over the age of 18 if more than one-third of their content is considered harmful to minors. A group of adult entertainment websites sued, arguing this violated free speech and privacy protections.
Texas countered that the state had a right to protect children with what Solicitor General Aaron Nielson framed as “simple, safe and common” restrictions.
A similar case was brought in Florida in December just weeks before the law was set to go into effect on Jan. 1.
The Florida case was brought by the Free Speech Coalition and challenges the law requiring websites with “material harmful to minors” to verify the age of its users. The coalition argued that it is a content-based restriction, violating the First Amendment, among other concerns.
In January, U.S. District Judge Mark Walker paused the case, waiting for the U.S. Supreme Court to make a decision on the Texas case. No updates on the case have been issued by the district court.
While the Supreme Court justices seemed divided on the free speech issues in the Texas case, a 6-3 majority of the Court ultimately sided with Texas, finding that requiring age verification “is within a State’s authority to prevent children from accessing sexually explicit content.”
The 2023 law “is an exercise of Texas’s traditional power to prevent minors from accessing speech that is obscene from their perspective,” Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in the majority’s opinion. “To the extent that it burdens adults’ rights to access such speech, it has ‘only an incidental effect on protected speech,’ making it subject to intermediate scrutiny.”
The Court’s three liberal justices dissented, arguing that the law should have been held to the higher standard of strict scrutiny, the most stringent level of legal review used in cases related to fundamental rights, such as freedom of speech. The dissenting judges also argued that while states have a “compelling interest” in protecting children from obscene speech, doing so sometimes impeded the right of adults to access that speech.
In her dissent, which was joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Kentanji Brown Jackson, Justice Elena Kagan said that Texas’ law might well have passed strict scrutiny and used the least restrictive means to achieve its goals.
“But what if Texas could do better — what if Texas could achieve its interest without so interfering with adults’ constitutionally protected rights in viewing the speech HB 1181 covers?” Kagan wrote. “The State should be foreclosed from restricting adults’ access to protected speech if that is not in fact necessary.”
Age verification 
Texas’ law requires people visiting websites “more than one-third of which is sexual material harmful to minors” to show they are over 18 by submitting digital identification, uploading government-issued identification or by using a “commercially reasonable method,” such as their banking information. Neither the website nor the party performing the verification can retain identifying information. Sites that violate the law face fines of up to $10,000 a day.
The law was passed amid a broader push in Texas and other states to prevent children from being exposed to sexual materials, which continued this legislative session. Friday’s ruling could have implications for more than a dozen states that have passed similar laws.
It was not the first time that these Texas bills have tested the boundaries of free speech protections: In two cases, the Supreme Court has ruled that laws aimed to prevent the distribution of obscene materials to minors unconstitutionally restricted free speech.
Attorney General Ken Paxton celebrated the ruling Friday, calling it a “major victory for children, parents and the ability of states to protect minors from the damaging effects of online pornography.”
“Companies have no right to expose children to pornography and must institute reasonable age verification measures,” Paxton said. “I will continue to enforce the law against any organization that refuses to take the necessary steps to protect minors from explicit materials.”
Civil liberties groups decried the decision as a rollback of free speech protections.
“Today’s ruling limits American adults’ access to only that speech which is fit for children — unless they show their papers first,” Bob Corn-Revere, chief counsel of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, said in a statement. “Data breaches are inevitable. How many will it take before we understand the threat today’s ruling presents? Americans will live to regret the day we let the government condition access to protected speech on proof of our identity.”
The Free Speech Coalition, a legal advocacy group representing the adult film industry, responded to Friday’s ruling by arguing pornography is the “canary in the coal mine of free expression.”
“The government should not have the right to demand that we sacrifice our privacy and security to use the internet,” Executive Director Alison Boden wrote in a statement. “This law has failed to keep minors away from sexual content yet continues to have a massive chilling effect on adults. The outcome is disastrous for Texans and for anyone who cares about freedom of speech and privacy online.”
Critics of Texas’ law raised privacy concerns and said it could make it dangerous for adults to access legal content. Critics also argued HB 1181 was overly broad and could apply to websites providing resources on reproductive health, sex education and LGBTQ+ issues.
“The legislature claims to be protecting children from sexually explicit materials, but the law will do little to block their access, and instead deters adults from viewing vast amounts of First Amendment-protected content,” wrote Cecillia Wang, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented the Free Speech Coalition in court.
The day before the law was set to go into effect in 2023, a U.S. district judge put it on hold, granting a request for a temporary injunction filed by the Free Speech Coalition.
‘Most intimate and personal aspects’
Federal District Judge David Alan Ezra, a Ronald Reagan appointee, said in granting the injunction that the law would allow the government “to peer into the most intimate and personal aspects of people’s lives,” imposing a chilling effect on constitutionally protected speech.
The state appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which allowed the law to take effect. In March 2024, the appeals court upheld most of the law, but struck down a requirement that these websites post a “health warning,” saying that pornography is addictive and weakens brain function.
The Supreme Court agreed to take up the case in July 2024 and heard arguments earlier this year on whether the appeals court applied proper legal reasoning in upholding age-verification.
The pornography websites’ claims attracted support from a wide cross-section of advocacy groups, from librarians to libertarians, who cited concerns about the ripple effects of Texas’ law. The Biden administration also submitted an amicus brief in support of overturning the law.
Meanwhile, some websites, including Pornhub, have suspended services in Texas, saying they are unable to comply with the law. In a statement that greets users who try to access the website in Texas, Pornhub says that “providing identification every time you want to visit an adult platform is not an effective solution for protecting users online, and in fact, will put minors and your privacy at risk.”
“As we’ve seen in other states, such bills have failed to protect minors, by driving users from those few websites which comply, to the hundreds of thousands of websites with far fewer safety measures in place, which do not comply,” the statement says.

North Carolina’s latest high-profile energy legislation, Senate Bill 266, will cost $23 billion.
The misleadingly named “Power Bill Reduction Act,” has passed both the state House and Senate, and now awaits action from Governor Stein. In it, lawmakers overhauled state law in multiple ways to benefit North Carolina’s largest corporations while increasing utility bills for households across our state. A more accurate moniker would be the “Bill for Higher Energy Bills,” if you’re talking about utility bills for people like you and me.
New analysis posted June 30th by researchers at NC State University finds that the bill’s signature provision — removing the state’s 2030 carbon emissions reduction target — is projected to lead to a $23 billion increase in fuel costs through 2050. Based on modeling by the Utilities Commission Public Staff, the research team found that eliminating the interim target would increase natural gas generation by nearly 40 percent between 2030 and 2050. Researchers conclude maintaining the interim goal helps limit exposure to volatile fuel markets and protects ratepayers from sharp increases in electricity bills. 
SB 266 has multiple provisions that work together to maximize profit, shift financial risk to customers, and leave North Carolina households holding the bag. 
On a path to high fuel costs 
In 2021, House Bill 951 became North Carolina law with bipartisan support, mandating a goal of 70% carbon emissions reduction by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050. SB 266 would undermine that bipartisan effort by eliminating the interim 2030 carbon reduction target. 
The NCSU professors confirmed that eliminating the interim carbon target will nearly double the amount of natural gas on the Duke Energy electricity grid. Natural gas is already raising our electricity bills. An analysis of Duke Energy’s filings with the NC Utilities Commision shows that in the Duke Energy Carolinas (DEC) service territory, fuel costs account for roughly 67% of the increase in residential retail rates since 2017, making the portion of the rate increases attributable to fuel costs more than double the amount from all other rate comments.
Forcing customers to prepay for power plants
Next, the bill weakens consumer protections by requiring North Carolina customers to pay up front for the interest on the construction of large natural gas power plants before they are built or operational. The financial risk for these large construction projects would be shifted from the utility shareholders onto North Carolina families and businesses. 
If the construction project goes exactly as planned, paying construction costs before the project is complete spreads the costs over a longer time, lowering the rate of increase in month-to-month bills. But if the construction project goes over budget or is never completed, which they often do, ratepayers would be stuck paying all of the expenses for the project without receiving any benefit in return, while the utility shareholders still profit. This is a lesson we learned from South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, where ratepayers are now burdened with paying for power plants that were never finished or went billions over budget.
Not surprisingly, when asked in a recent poll conducted by Conservatives for Clean Energy, 85% of North Carolinians said they oppose this type of upfront customer financing model.
Shifting the cost burden from business customers onto residential customers
Not only will SB 266 lead to greater natural gas usage, but the legislation will force North Carolina households to pay a greater portion of those natural gas costs by changing the way fuel costs are allocated between the rate classes (residential, commercial, and industrial customers). This is true when looking back at 2024 data and when considering future trends. 
The Public Staff referenced past fuel costs and estimated that under similar conditions, SB 266 would shift, at a minimum, $24.8 million a year of fuel costs from large commercial customers onto North Carolina households and families.
But the cost shifted onto residential customers will likely be even greater than that bare minimum. For Duke Energy Carolinas, purchased power costs nearly doubled over a three-year period, from $282 million in 2023, to $400 million in 2024, to $575 million in 2025. 
Incorporating the trend of increasing power purchase costs into the model, analysts at the firm EQ Research found the cost shift from industry to households would total a projected $78 million a year.  This means that each North Carolina household will pay higher bills so that a handful of large commercial customers can pay substantially less.
Deceptive messaging and the rushed legislative process
In legislative committee hearings, when asked about the impacts of the bill on utility rates, supporters of the bill deliberately misled their colleagues, saying it would reduce energy costs and help poor people struggling to pay their energy bills. Importantly, legislators were asked to vote on the bill before comprehensive analysis of the cost impacts could be reviewed or considered. Now that the NC State University analysis is available, everyone can see what a raw deal this legislation is for the people of North Carolina. 
Residential customers, especially North Carolinians with low incomes, are the people who can least afford to absorb these energy cost increases. They are also the constituency least likely to have professional lobbyists watching out for their interests on Jones Street. 
With the data in, we see that SB 266, the “Power Bill Reduction Act” raises bills, risks our future, and helps no one but Duke Energy and its business customers.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Electric-meter-Getty-Stock.jpg,,,2025-07-01 14:11:17.536988

(Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A federal judge sided with state officials and allowed a Kansas law to go into effect that bans “foreign nationals” from contributing financially to campaigns for or against state constitutional amendments.
A Kansas advocacy group, backed by a Washington, D.C., law firm, challenged state officials in May and attempted to stop the law from going into effect July 1. U.S. District Judge Daniel Crabtree denied the group’s request to block the law Monday in a 37-page decision.
He said the group, Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, “is unlikely to succeed on the merits of its claim.”
Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, which has accepted such funds directly and indirectly in the past, plans to advocate against a planned constitutional amendment that will ask voters in August 2026 if they want to change the way Kansas Supreme Court justices are selected. The group has already secured funding to do just that.
The law, House Bill 2106, was passed in April. It changes the Kansas Campaign Finance Act to prohibit accepting foreign funds, which includes money from donors who accept foreign funds, and using that money in activities that promote or oppose a constitutional amendment in Kansas. The group argued that the law was broad, vague and infringed upon constitutionally protected political speech.
Crabtree agreed with the state that ballot issues, particularly constitutional amendments, “shape the state’s most foundational document,” he wrote in the decision. But he also acknowledged the potential for HB 2106 to be “an unnecessary and paternalistic limit on which ideas get to compete in the marketplace of ideas.”
“Perhaps,” Crabtree wrote, “it’d be better, as KCF suggests, to allow Kansas voters to hear different perspectives — from many diverse sources — and trust the voters to make a choice for themselves.”
However, “whether wise or unwise policy,” the government has a genuine interest in limiting foreign influence in democratic self-government, he said.
The lawsuit named nine members of the Kansas Governmental Ethics Commission; the commission’s executive director, Wade Wiebe; and Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, who can bring criminal charges under HB 2106 against anyone who violates its provisions. The ethics commission, which is set to be renamed as the Kansas Public Disclosure Commission under a new law that takes effect in July, is able to bring civil action against those who violate HB 2106.
Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, which played a major role in the 2022 campaign against an amendment that would have allowed lawmakers to ban abortion, interpreted the law as a pointed hindrance to its ability to play such a role in the future. The group spent $11 million in its opposition to the 2022 abortion amendment, and it said in its initial lawsuit filing that members had already secured funding to oppose the August 2026 constitutional amendment. 
State officials, on the other hand, argued in a court filing that HB 2106 is in the public interest.
“The interest is as compelling as it is utterly foundational: the sovereignty of the people of Kansas and the legitimacy of the democratic processes ensuring that sovereignty,” the filing said.
Other courts have dealt with the same question of foreign financial influence, arriving at similar conclusions to Crabtree.
Any person involved in campaigning for or against an amendment is required under existing law to submit a series of campaign finance reports. From July 1 on, organizations and individuals planning to engage in advocacy for or against a constitutional amendment must certify they haven’t received more than $100,000 from foreign nationals in the preceding four years. Any person or group who has received such funds is barred from participating in constitutional advocacy for up to four years.
The state’s definition of foreign national excludes people in the U.S. with permanent legal status and U.S. entities, unless they are wholly or majority-owned by a foreign national.
At a June hearing, attorneys for state officials clarified that any money Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, or other groups, accepted before the law’s effective date would not fall under the purview of the new law.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Topeka-federal-court-house-4--1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-01 14:11:17.536988

(LinkedIN and Federalist Society)After a five-month search, President Donald Trump nominated two Hoosiers to serve as U.S. Attorneys for Indiana’s Northern and Southern Districts, the White House confirmed. 
Trump tapped Adam Mildred, a longtime deputy prosecutor from Allen County, to serve as the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Indiana. Mildred has led more than 200 prosecutions since taking office in 2000. 
For the Southern District, Trump selected Thomas Wheeler II, who currently serves as Acting General Counsel at the Department of Education. His prior positions include Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights at the Department of Justice, Senior Advisor to the White House School Safety Commission, and Counsel to the Secretary of Education. He also was a partner at Bose McKinney & Evans LLP, an Indianapolis law firm. 
Both terms last four years, and they must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.
Alongside the nominations, Trump named Scott Proctor as Acting United States Attorney for the Northern District of Indiana. Previously, he worked as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Northern District of Oklahoma. 
U.S. attorneys represent the federal government in litigation and serve as the chief federal law enforcement officers in their districts.
Indiana U.S. Sen. Jim Banks praised the president’s nominees in a statement released Monday. 
“President Trump nominated two strong candidates to be the U.S. Attorneys for Indiana. Adam Mildred and Tom Wheeler have decades of experience and are deeply committed to upholding law and order. They both will bring integrity to the job and I look forward to voting for their confirmation soon. I’m also grateful for Acting U.S. Attorney Scott Proctor’s service to Indiana during this time,” Banks said. 
U.S. Sen. Todd Young added his thoughts on Tuesday — “Adam Mildred’s and Thomas Wheeler’s experience and expertise would make them assets to the Northern and Southern Districts of Indiana. I look forward to supporting both individuals through their confirmation process.”
Traditionally, U.S. Attorneys resign at the start of a new administration. Former U.S. Attorney’s Clifford Johnson and Zachary Myers stepped down before Trump took office Jan. 20. Acting Attorneys John Childress and Tina Nommay have filled the roles since then.

He said his first trip there was in 2022 with a delegation aiming to establish a government-to-government connection between the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma and the Seminole Tribe of Florida, to demonstrate that despite the separate land bases, the spirits of the Seminole people remain as strong as they were in 1832.After learning about the proposed migrant detention center, often referred to as “Alligator Alcatraz,” Jake Tiger recognized that history is repeating itself. Tiger, a cultural specialist for the Seminole Nation, noted similarities between escalating immigrant detentions and the Holocaust concentration camps, as well as the U.S. Indian Removal Act of 1830.
“All of us historians understand we’re starting to draw these parallels where they’re coming in and wanting to take brown people, and they call them ‘illegals,’” Tiger said. “You know, no one can be illegal on stolen land. And so when we see that, that’s just a clear case of colonial oppression. …And for them to take our sacred lands and just dispose of it and put these monuments of white supremacy, I do not stand for that.”
Tiger’s tribal nation, the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, is joining forces with the two federally recognized tribes in Florida in the fight against Ron DeSantis and Florida’s rapid efforts to build a migrant detention center set to house 5,000 beds. The center is currently under construction in the Big Cypress region of Florida, near the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport.
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier shared a video on X, proposing the immigration crackdown project and the attractive features of this specific location.
“This 30-square-foot mile area is completely surrounded by the Everglades. It presents an efficient, low-cost opportunity to build a temporary detention facility because you don’t need to invest that much in the perimeter,” Uthmeier said in the video. “If people get out, there’s not much waiting for them other than alligators and pythons.”
The Miccosukee Tribe’s Chairman highlighted what Uthmeier’s message is missing: the lands are much more than an appealing site for an immigrant holding center; the lands hold American Indian history and are adjacent to 19 traditional Miccosukee and Seminole villages.
“Rather than Miccosukee homelands being an uninhabited wasteland for alligators and pythons, as some have suggested, the Big Cypress is the Tribe’s traditional homelands,” Miccosukee Tribal Chairman Talbert Cypress said in a statement. “The landscape has protected the Miccosukee and Seminole people for generations.”
Tiger said the Seminole people come from various groups— the Miccosukee, Muskogean and Hitchiti, among others— and had traditional homelands in Alabama, Georgia and Florida. He explained that his ancestors knew no borders, migrating between the different areas due to weather conditions, such as hurricanes and frigid winters.
Yet, because of the U.S. government’s removal policies toward American Indians, many Seminoles living in the southeast were violently forced to relocate to Oklahoma. Now, they make up the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma. Those who were able to resist the forced removal by living in Florida’s swamps still live in Florida and are known today as the Seminole Tribe of Florida.
“There were a lot of Seminole people who utilized the Florida Everglades as a home ground, to take shelter and evade removal and war because it was hard for a lot of the Army, Marines and Navy to traverse through the Florida Everglades,” Tiger said. “But we already knew how to get in around there.”
Seminole Nation of Oklahoma Chief Lewis Johnson also emphasized the importance of the area for its historical significance, symbolism and the ecosystems dependent on the health of the land.
“These lands are not empty stretches of wilderness, nor are they merely backdrops to policy decisions—they are living, breathing homelands, deeply tied to the cultural, spiritual and historical identity of Miccosukee and Florida and Seminole people,” Johnson said in a statement.
In 2022, Tiger visited Florida for the first time and struggled to describe his experience of seeing the Everglades, largely due to the landscape’s breathtaking beauty. He could tell that the wildlife was being cared for, but he worried about its future.
“We’re seeing this massive push of the total lack of respect for these lands that have always been here,” Tiger said. “We call ourselves the free world. To us, that’s just a clear case of colonialism that’s still being oppressed upon the first American people here in North America. …What I’m trying to explain to people is when the whole forest has been cut down and our waters have been polluted, we will then understand you cannot eat a dollar or drink oil.”

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Michigan Republicans cheered the U.S. Senate’s passage of the new congressional spending bill on Tuesday, which includes tax breaks and spending cuts that Michigan Democrats have warned would mean disaster for the state budget and a whole host of social programs.
The U.S. Senate on Tuesday in a narrow 51-50 vote – one that needed Vice President JD Vance to break the tie – passed President Donald Trump’s signature spending plan and kicked it back to the U.S. House of Representatives where it hopes to reach final passage before Friday, July 4.
U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township) posted on X to sing the bill’s praises, including Republican beliefs that the “One Big Beautiful Bill” would stop tipped workers from being taxed on their tips and that it would expand the Child Tax Credit.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“When President Trump first introduced the Child Tax Credit, it was a game changer for working families,” James said on X. “Now, we have the opportunity to lock in and boost the doubled Child Tax Credit for more than 40 million families with the One Big Beautiful Bill!”
U.S. Rep. Lisa McClain (R-Bruce Township), chair of the U.S. House GOP Caucus, posted on X that Republicans were ready to get the bill to Trump’s desk, warning that further Republican dissension in the House – which stalled passage initially in both chambers – would break “the promise made to the American people” by the GOP and Trump.
“The time is now,” she wrote. “Failure is not an option.”
Meanwhile, Michigan Democrats in Washington unilaterally slammed the bill.
U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield) said in a statement that the bill would add more than $3 trillion to the national deficit, increase skyrocketing national debt and take away health care and food assistance from millions of Americans – including hundreds of thousands of Michiganders – in order to give tax cuts to billionaires.
“The bill that Republicans just passed will rip health care away from hundreds of thousands of Michiganders, make it harder for families across the country to afford food and pay their energy bills, and balloon our deficit by trillions of dollars,” Peters said. “Democrats did everything in our power to stop this legislation, but President Trump and Republicans in Congress are dead set on selling out hardworking Michiganders so they can pay for a massive tax cut for billionaires. This bill is reckless, irresponsible, and an unconscionable betrayal of American families.”
Peters noted that he voted against the bill.
U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) said that after more than 25 hours on the Senate floor, she also voted no.
“No matter which way you slice it – health care, energy, housing – the President just rammed through a bill that will make Michiganders pay in every part of their lives. All so the wealthiest among us can get a tax break,” Slotkin said in a statement. “Today’s massive bill will go through only with a tie breaker. Senate Democrats importantly delayed the process enough to allow the world to see this bill and to lay bare the fighting and divisions on the other side.”
Slotkin added that she believed history would not be kind to the bill, nor Republicans who voted for it. She also said it was important to remember that the deal is not quite done, as it needs to be passed again by the U.S. House. But with Republicans in control of all levels of the federal government, the bill is likely to pass despite some dissent from staunch Republican budget Hawks in the lower chamber.
Still, Slotkin called for constituents to call their representatives and make their opposition to the bill heard.
“Keep pushing,” Slotkin said.
The Michigan Democratic Party in a statement said the federal budget, if passed, would abandon Michigan workers.
“Millions of Michiganders will see their costs go up thanks to Republicans in DC choosing to help billionaires over working families,” said Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtus Hertel Jr. in a statement. “Republicans are trying to gut Medicaid and SNAP programs and put thousands of jobs, and even more lives, at risk as hospitals are forced to close and families lose coverage.”
Hertel added that the budget bill was not only “cruel,” but was “stupid and a financial disaster for our state and the whole country.”
“This bill is a betrayal of the American Dream that has been promised to generations as Republicans crush working families to benefit the ultra wealthy,” Hertel said.
Groups like the Michigan League of Conservation Voters also decried passage of the bill, calling it a “dangerous, shameful giveaway to fossil fuel companies and corporate polluters that sacrifices Michigan families, our economy and our environment.”
“This bill is a scorched-earth assault on the health, wallets and future of every Michigander,” said Bentley Johnson, the federal government affairs director for Michigan LCV. “At a time when families are battling rising costs, dangerous air pollution and the escalating impacts of climate change, Senate Republicans chose to side with billionaire polluters over the people they were elected to serve. This is legislative malpractice of the highest order.”
Monique Stanton, president and CEO of the Michigan League for Public Policy, called it “staggering” that Senate Republicans had passed a budget bill that would strip health care and food away from millions of Americans, including hundreds of thousands of Michiganders, in order to provide tax benefits for the wealthiest U.S. households and corporations.
“For Michigan, that means the state will have to come up with $8.5 billion in Medicaid expansion costs and up to $304 million in SNAP costs that the bill strips away from our state budget. It means 123,000 Michiganders are at risk of losing food assistance, and over 700,000 are at risk of losing health care. These are our friends, our neighbors and our families,” Stanton said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2222293549-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-01 14:11:17.536988

Gov. JB Pritzker announced Tuesday that former Deputy Gov. Christian Mitchell will be his running mate for the 2026 campaign.

Pritzker’s selection, made just days after announcing a third campaign for governor, comes from a close circle of trust in Pritzker’s administration. Mitchell previously served in the governor’s office as one of four deputy governors overseeing key projects in Pritzker’s first term.

“Christian Mitchell is a proven leader with deep experience, steady judgment, and an unshakable commitment to the working families of Illinois,” Pritzker said in a statement. “Whether it’s transforming our clean energy future, rebuilding our infrastructure, or keeping our communities safe, Christian has been a force behind so much of our progress. I couldn’t ask for a better partner to continue delivering results for the people of Illinois.”

Mitchell, 38, will replace Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton on the ticket as she seeks the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate.

Mitchell comes in with hefty experience in state government and public policy. A resident of Chicago’s Hyde Park neighborhood, Mitchell served three terms in the Illinois House beginning in 2013 and was executive director of the Democratic Party of Illinois in 2018 before joining the governor’s office in 2019.

Lieutenant governor role

Mitchell left Pritzker’s administration in early 2023 to become vice president for civic engagement at the University of Chicago where he oversees government relations. Mitchell was appointed by Pritzker last year to an unpaid seat on the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority board, which oversees Navy Pier and McCormick Place. He is also a first lieutenant in the Illinois Air National Guard.

“The governor has led with courage and compassion, and together we’ve built a foundation that’s moving Illinois forward,” Mitchell said in a statement. “I’m ready to build on that progress — lowering costs, expanding opportunity, and making sure every community has the resources and opportunities they deserve. This is about delivering real results for the people of Illinois, and I’m excited to get to work.”

Though the lieutenant governor has few constitutional responsibilities in Illinois, Pritzker has leveraged the position to task Stratton with leading key legislative initiatives and overseeing the implementation of some of his administration’s top priorities at state agencies.

If Pritzker is elected to another term, the role will hold greater importance as Pritzker considers running for president in 2028. Pritzker’s election to the presidency would require Mitchell to serve the final two years of his term.

While keeping Mitchell's selection under wraps, Pritzker told reporters in recent days he was looking for a running mate who was ready to immediately step into the governorship if required.

“The number one qualification is, ‘can you do the job of being governor because if you’re lieutenant governor, that may come to you,’” Pritzker said Monday.

“The second thing I think about is person who I might choose for lieutenant governor somebody who has a heart for all the people of Illinois, not just some or some specific segment of the population because we have a big, diverse state,” he said.

Deputy governor role

Deputy governors in Pritzker's administration have a chief of staff-like role, overseeing specific policy areas and state agencies. Mitchell was in charge of environmental policy, infrastructure and public safety.

In 2020 and 2021, Mitchell oversaw the negotiations of Pritzker’s marquee climate policy — the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. It massively reformed the utility and energy industry and requires all fossil fuel power plants to close by 2045.

Mitchell was responsible for representing the governor in negotiations around the bill and was the face of the Pritzker administration as it went through the legislature.

That law, passed in the wake of a bribery scandal with Chicago’s electric utility that forced former House Speaker Michael Madigan to resign, cemented Pritzker’s reputation as a progressive on climate issues.

In the years since, energy experts and some lawmakers involved in passing the law have raised concerns that the state is at risk of missing the clean energy targets that Mitchell helped codify.

Mitchell also oversaw the implementation of the 2019 Rebuild Illinois capital plan – a $45 billion construction project to rebuild roads, bridges and other infrastructure across the state.

Recreational cannabis regulation was also Mitchell’s responsibility. Pritzker signed legislation in his first year legalizing cannabis for recreational use and setting up a series of regulations for dispensaries and new social equity requirements.

Other experience

As a state lawmaker, Mitchell was chair of the House Economic Opportunity Committee.

Mitchell also brings heavy political experience to the ticket. Democrats swept races for statewide offices in 2018 and won supermajorities in the Statehouse with Mitchell serving in a top leadership role under former party Chair Mike Madigan. He took over for Tim Mapes, Madigan’s former chief of staff who was accused of sexual harassment and is now serving time in prison for a perjury conviction.

He has also worked as an advisor on several political campaigns in Illinois, including leading Midwest polling for former President Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign.

Idaho officials sued over new law that blocks unauthorized immigrants from public services

U.S. District Judge Amanda Brailsford on Monday issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare from requiring citizenship status reviews for a federally funded HIV treatment program. 
The decision blocks the law’s application to this program until a court hearing in two weeks about whether the court should block the law for longer. 
The new law, House Bill 135, took effect Tuesday. It cuts the few publicly funded services that unauthorized immigrants can receive in the state. 
The judge’s ruling came days after ACLU of Idaho sued over the new law, alleging the law is unconstitutional by violating equal protection, conflicts with federal laws and even denies federal funds to people eligible under federal law.

ABILENE, Texas — Bolstered by $3.2 million from a former Midland oilman, this West Texas city of 130,000 people is helping the Lone Star State lead a national nuclear energy resurgence.
Doug Robison’s 2021 donation to Abilene Christian University helped the institution win federal approval to house an advanced small modular nuclear reactor, which might be finished as soon as next year. Small modular reactors are designed to be built in factories and then moved to a site, and require less upfront capital investment than traditional large reactors.
Only two small modular reactors are in operation, one in China and another in Russia. Natura Resources is one of two companies with federal permits to build one in the U.S. After that initial $3.2 million donation, Robison formed Natura Resources and committed to investing another $30.5 million in the project.

“Nuclear is happening,” said Robison, who retired from the oil business and moved to Abilene to launch the company. “It has to happen.”
Robison’s words are being echoed across the country with new state laws that aim to accelerate the spread of projects that embrace advanced nuclear technology — decades after the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl calamities soured many Americans on nuclear power.
In the past two years, half the states have taken action to promote nuclear power, from creating nuclear task forces to integrating nuclear into long-term energy plans, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, which advocates for the industry.

“I’ve been tracking legislation for 18 years, and when I first started tracking, there were maybe five or 10 bills that said the word ‘nuclear,’” said Christine Csizmadia, who directs state government affairs at the institute. “This legislative session, we’re tracking over 300 bills all across the country.”
The push is bipartisan. In New York, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul last month directed the New York Power Authority to build a zero-emission advanced nuclear power plant somewhere upstate — her state’s first new nuclear plant in a generation. In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis in April signed legislation redefining nuclear energy, which doesn’t emit a significant amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases, as a “clean energy resource.” The law will allow future plants to receive state grants reserved for other carbon-free energy sources.
But no state is more gung-ho than Texas, where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott last month signed legislation creating the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office and investing $350 million in nuclear expansion.
“Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this legislation will position Texas at the forefront of America’s nuclear renaissance,” Abbott wrote in a statement.
In addition to legislative action, the Texas A&M University System has invited four nuclear manufacturers to build small modular reactors at the school’s 2,400-acre RELLIS campus in the city of Bryan.
In Texas and other fast-growing states, rising electricity demands are fueling the push. Tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon that require a tremendous amount of electricity to power vast data centers are teaming with nuclear developers to provide it.
Last October, Google signed an agreement with nuclear energy producer Kairos Power to deploy multiple small modular reactors capable of generating a total of up to 500 megawatts by 2035. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced in December that it is also looking to reach a similar deal. Some of the largest data centers require more than 100 megawatts of power capacity, enough to power around 100,000 U.S. households.
Constellation Energy announced last September that it would reopen Three Mile Island, shuttered since 2019, as part of a deal with Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI data centers. One of the two reactors at the plant, which is located south of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, partially melted down in 1979. But the remaining reactor reliably produced electricity for the next four decades.
“Folks shouldn’t sleep on nuclear,” Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said as welcomed back workers to the plant last month. “They should be aware of the important clean role it plays in our energy portfolio.”
But opponents say the renewed interest in nuclear energy is misguided.

In Colorado, a coalition of two dozen environmental groups, including the state chapter of the Sierra Club, urged Polis to veto the bill.
“The idea that nuclear power is a clean energy source could not be further from the truth,” the groups wrote in a letter to the governor. “Nuclear power is the only energy resource that generates dangerous waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years.”
Some critics say small modular reactors are actually more expensive than traditional reactors, when they are judged per kilowatt of the energy they produce. And one 2022 study, conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the University of British Columbia, concluded that small modular reactors will produce more radioactive waste than traditional reactors.
“There’s a pretty healthy skepticism about advanced nuclear projects,” said Adrian Shelley, who heads the Texas office of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. Shelley said many environmental groups “are just deeply concerned about Texas’ ability to responsibly manage nuclear storage and especially nuclear waste in the long term.”

Ramping up

The United States currently has 94 nuclear reactors at 54 plants in 28 states. The oldest began operating at Nine Mile Point in New York in 1969; the newest reactors, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Burke County, Georgia, began operating in 2023 and 2024.
Scott Burnell, a spokesperson for the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said that between the mid-1990s and 2005, there were “no applications at all” for new reactors. In 2007, there was a surge of a dozen applications when the federal government began offering tax incentives. But interest in new reactors plunged again when the fracking boom boosted fossil fuels as an economical power source.
Over the past several years, activity has ramped up again. “There are a number of factors that we are seeing drive this increased interest,” Burnell said. “Probably the biggest one is the growth in data centers.”
The commission has approved three new nuclear projects in the past three years, including the one at Abilene Christian University. It is reviewing three other applications and is discussing potential projects with a dozen other nuclear developers, Burnell said.
Texas currently has two nuclear plants — Comanche Peak near Glen Rose in North Central Texas and the South Texas Project in Matagorda County on the Gulf Coast. The two plants, each of which has two reactors, provide about 10% of the state’s electric power, according to the Texas comptroller. The new small modular reactors would face the same safety standards as these plants.











We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars.


– Matt Loszak, CEO of Aalo Atomics



The project at Abilene Christian began when Robison’s Natura Resources established a research alliance with that school, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at Austin. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the project in 2024.
The reactor will be constructed at a laboratory at a different site, but its home already awaits in a trench at the bottom of a cavernous room at Abilene Christian’s Dillard Science and Engineering Research Center. The trench is 25 feet deep, 80 feet long and 15 feet wide, with a radiation shield made of concrete 4 feet thick. When the 40-ton reactor is finished, possibly by the end of next year, it will be transported to its home on a flatbed truck.
“The future is uncertain, but we’re ahead of the pack and moving at an amazing clip,” said Rusty Towell, an Abilene Christian engineering and physics professor who is working on the project. “So I think that there’s a great reason for optimism.”
Towell asserted that the project will produce only “small amounts of low-level waste” and that storing it safely will not be a significant challenge.

‘What Henry Ford did for cars’

John Sharp, the chancellor of Texas A&M University, said he invited nuclear companies to build small modular reactors at the school to help meet the country’s desperate need for more power. He said it made sense to give developers access to the faculty and students at the university’s nuclear engineering department.
Sharp said his pitch was simple: “Hey, we got some land. We got it next to some really smart people. Would you like to come and build a plant?
“And four folks said, ‘You betcha.’”
Matt Loszak, the 34-year-old CEO of Austin-based Aalo Atomics, one of the companies that answered Sharp’s call, said he had two employees 18 months ago. Now he has more than 50.
“We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars,” Loszak said, “which is really make them mass manufacturable and make it economical to deploy around the world.”
Robison said he’s been speaking at town halls in Abilene, a conservative community that is home to Dyess Air Force Base, for about five years. He claims the residents are “overwhelmingly excited” about having the small modular reactors at Abilene Christian, he said.
“Texas is an energy state,” he said. “We understand energy and what happens when you don’t have it.”

Seven states have enacted bans on lab-grown meat. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Texas is the fifth state this year and seventh overall to ban lab-grown meat after Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed legislation temporarily prohibiting the sale of cell-cultured protein.
Selling lab-grown meat, which is produced by growing cells acquired from living animals in a controlled environment, will be subject to civil and criminal penalties under the new law. It is set to go into effect in September and expires in two years.
“This ban is a massive win for Texas ranchers, producers, and consumers,” Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said in a statement following the bill’s passage. “Texans have a God-given right to know what’s on their plate, and for millions of Texans, it better come from a pasture, not a lab. It’s plain cowboy logic that we must safeguard our real, authentic meat industry from synthetic alternatives.”
Consumers interested in sustainable foods that avoid the slaughter of animals are driving the growing cultured meat industry.
The Texas beef industry supported the bill. The state leads the nation in cattle, contributing almost 15% of U.S. beef production, according to the Texas Department of Agriculture.
Texas joins Indiana, Mississippi, Montana and Nebraska in enacting new laws this year; Alabama and Florida did so last year. In March, the Oklahoma House approved a similar bill that did not advance out of the Senate this session.
Texas followed Indiana’s lead in making its ban last for two years, which Indiana legislators said would allow more time for research. The time limit also may mean the law is less likely to draw legal challenges.
Upside Foods, one of the companies federally approved to sell cultivated meat, sued Florida shortly after the state passed the country’s first lab-grown meat ban. That lawsuit is pending.
In 2023, the U.S. Department of Agriculture gave permission to two California-based companies to begin selling lab-produced chicken across the country. Their lab-grown chicken was briefly featured on the menu at two restaurants that same year.
Although cultivated meat isn’t sold in stores yet, some research suggests it could be better for the environment compared with traditional meat production.
But other research suggests lab-grown meat’s environmental impact could be higher than retail beef based on current production methods.

(Suzanne King/The Beacon)As federal funding for HIV prevention and treatment programs becomes less certain, the number of people newly diagnosed with the virus in the Kansas City region is trending up.
Provisional data from the Kansas City Health Department show that an 11-county region in Missouri and Kansas saw 227 new cases in 2024, up from 206 the previous year.
Sean Ryan, who oversees the department’s HIV programs, said this is the second year the number of new cases in the region has climbed.

The upward trend, which holds true nationally, can be traced in part to the COVID pandemic, when HIV testing and prevention programs went temporarily dormant, he said. Fewer people were screened, and since HIV symptoms can take years to show up, more people likely spread the virus unknowingly.
“We are seeing a bit of catch-up from those years and the (prevention) efforts that we lost,” Ryan said.
The gap in testing during the pandemic and the subsequent rise in new cases is an example of what could happen if federal funding wanes and HIV suppression work subsides.
The Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a massive budget bill now making its way through Congress, could reduce existing HIV funding. And cuts to Medicaid and the elimination of tax credits for supporting the Affordable Care Act marketplace could leave 16 million people uninsured, another blow to maintaining HIV treatment and prevention efforts.
“It stresses the importance of having continued services without a gap,” Ryan said, “because the second you step back from these services, people are going to miss critical testing, they’re not going to know their status and they’re going to be out in the community continuing to spread the disease.”
 Reduction in HIV funding

The first Trump administration, building on work started during the Obama administration, emphasized reducing new HIV infections, launching the Ending the HIV Epidemic Initiative (EHE) in 2019. The initiative’s stated goal was a 75% reduction in new infections in five years, and a 90% reduction in 10 years.
In 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 37,981 HIV diagnoses in the United States. In 2023, the number reached 39,201. Men, Black people and people living in the South were most affected.
Congress allocated $267 million to multiple federal agencies for the EHE initiative in the 2019 fiscal year. That went up to $573.3 million in 2024. With the additional funds, total HIV prevention spending allocated just to the CDC climbed from $788.7 million in the 2019 fiscal year to $1 billion last year.
Designated “priority jurisdictions,” including Missouri, which had a substantial number of cases, received the bulk of the added federal funding.
The current Trump administration has not committed to continuing the effort. It has already delayed or terminated existing grants, closed government offices focused on HIV and moved to end research. And it appears poised to reduce future spending on key HIV programs.
The Kansas City Health Department has used federal grant funding it has received for outreach education and testing in nonclinical settings, like at bars or festivals. The health department administered 70 HIV tests at a recent Juneteenth celebration, for example.

And on June 27 — National HIV Testing Day — the health department will provide free testing at the Walgreens at 3845 Broadway Blvd. Other Walgreens locations will also offer testing that day.
Some people don’t feel comfortable going to a traditional health care setting for testing, or they don’t have access, Ryan said. That’s why taking the health department’s mobile clinic into the community to meet people where they already are is important.
At its recent “Health on the Block” event at Central High School, the health department administered 32 tests for HIV, gonorrhea, syphilis and chlamydia, all sexually transmitted infections. The result was four positive results.
“That’s a huge return on investment,” Ryan said.
 Grant already delayed, causing uncertainty

Federal funds also help pay for some of the 750,000 condoms the health department distributes annually; for other harm reduction materials; and for support services to help HIV patients find out where to obtain Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), a medication that people can take to prevent an HIV infection.
“PrEP navigators,” the health department staff who connect people to PrEP, also help patients understand whether they have health insurance to cover the cost of the treatment and other options for paying for it if they don’t.
Currently, the health department refers patients to other health clinics for PrEP prescriptions. But the department hopes to provide the service directly to patients by the end of the year. The city is funding that effort through general funds, Ryan said.
Other important work that the health department does that relies at least partially on federal funds involves HIV surveillance — encouraging HIV-positive patients to get treatment and stay in treatment. And surveillance work involves notifying people who might have been exposed to the virus.
Last year, Missouri’s Department of Health and Senior Services received $5.66 million through a CDC grant program known as the High-Impact HIV Prevention and Surveillance Programs for Health Departments. That was just one of the federal grants the state relies on.
Second-year funding of the grant, which was expected in June, had not come through midway through the month. So on June 17 the state agency told health departments, including Kansas City’s, and health clinics, including KC Care Clinic, to pause work. Funds from the grant they had been counting on would not be available, the state said, so reimbursements from the state would not be possible. That changed June 26, Ryan said, when the state notified the health department that funding had finally come through.
Without federal support, Ryan said, the work his division of the health department has been doing to try to slow the increase in new HIV cases would be impaired.
“We as the city and the health department will have to determine what services we want to continue” if funding is reduced, he said.

In the end, both Republicans and Democrats helped doom a  10-year moratorium on state artificial intelligence laws that had previously cleared the House. 



The U.S. Senate voted not to interfere with state artificial intelligence regulations, defeating a 10-year moratorium on such laws that had earlier cleared the House and alarmed California officials.
The 99-1 vote to strip the moratorium from the president’s “big, beautiful” budget bill followed opposition from a handful of Republicans. Dissenting from GOP colleagues, they argued the measure would allow the proliferation of highly realistic, AI-enabled “deepfake” impersonation videos, endanger jobs, and infringe on the rights of state governments.
The small rebellion was enough to seal the moratorium’s fate, given Republicans’ slim majority in the Senate and united opposition from Democrats
“Federalism is preserved and humans are safe for now,” one of the Republican dissenters, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, wrote following the vote.
In California, the moratorium would have threatened 20 AI laws on the books and 30 more proposals that are before the Legislature. State officials, including Attorney General Rob Bonta and the executive director of the California Privacy Protection Agency, came out against the measure.
Key to the moratorium’s defeat was pressure from a wide range of advocacy groups, said Ben Winters of the Consumer Federation of America. Organizations ranging from the Teamsters to the NAACP to the National Association of Evangelicals opposed the measure.
“The tech lobby attempted to manipulate the legislative process, but they were soundly defeated,” Winters wrote. “This outcome sends a clear signal that special interest groups cannot simply override public concerns with backroom deals, and that everyday people can successfully challenge corporate overreach.”
Prior to its defeat, the moratorium had already been watered down in the Senate, reduced in duration to five years and in scope to states that wanted access to $500 million in new federal funding for AI infrastructure and broadband deployment.
The battle over the measure underlined the bipartisan nature of concern around AI.

(Photo by Evan Houk/ Maine Morning Star)After raising concerns about the financial impact of net energy billing, the Office of Public Advocate is praising the governor for signing a bill that could save money for Maine electricity customers.
Gov. Janet Mills signed LD 1777 into law Friday to reform the state’s net energy billing program, after it received bipartisan support in the Maine Senate and House of Representatives. While the cost of net energy billing is expected to exceed $234 million this year alone, the new law is projected to save Maine electricity customers more than $1.2 billion over the next 16 years, according to a news release from the Public Advocate’s office Tuesday.
“This new law will deliver real relief to Maine ratepayers while maintaining our state’s commitment to clean energy,” said Public Advocate Heather Sanborn.
Front-of-the meter projects, typically involving larger-scale projects such as community solar, are no longer eligible for net energy billing under the new law. Instead, the legislation directs the Governor’s Energy Office to develop an alternative program for these projects, and those in the state’s current tariff rate program, which is used by nonresidential customers. 
The Public Utilities Commission would need to approve the plan, but only if the benefits to ratepayers outweigh the costs. 
The new law also includes consumer protections to safeguard against solar oversubscription and ends the link between solar compensation and future utility rate increases, which the release said is a major driver of inflated costs. 
Net energy billing is a policy program designed to encourage customers to install or participate in small-scale renewable energy projects like solar panels by offering credits to offset their electricity bills. It was expanded in 2019 so customers can use renewable energy generators located outside of their property but within the same utility service territory, such as a community solar project. 
However, now “Maine’s community solar program needs reform precisely because it has been so successful,” Sanborn explained. The state set out to build 750 megawatts of solar, but went beyond that with more than 1,600 megawatts. 
Given that, “we need to make sure that solar power is delivered affordably to Mainers going forward,” Sanborn said.

Phil Murphy signed on June 30, 2025. (Photo by New Jersey Monitor)Legislation signed by Gov. Phil Murphy Monday evening ended the state’s decades-long practice of requiring publication of public notices in newspapers. 
The measure comes after the Star-Ledger, the state’s largest daily newspaper, announced it would cease printing in February, along with other smaller papers the company owns. That left several municipalities and counties without an official newspaper to publish notices of town meetings, planning board applications, foreclosures, and bid solicitations, as mandated under the state’s Open Public Meetings Act. 
Now, under the new law, public entities will be required to publish or advertise legal notices on their official website beginning March 1, 2026, with digital publication of such notices optional until that date. The law requires that the websites be free and accessible, with a direct hyperlink to legal notices placed “conspicuously” on the homepage. The secretary of state also would help set up a website to include notices from public entities statewide. 
Public agencies will be required to display notices on the website for at least one week and store them in an online archive for at least one year afterward. Local governments will not be required to maintain an archive until July 1, 2026, according to the measure.
Local governments could still publish legal notices in online news sites. Beginning Jan. 1, 2026, public entities will have to publish an advertisement twice a month in online news outlets, and the ads must include links to their legal notices webpage. 
The measure goes into effect immediately. It caps off several stopgap measures the  Legislature advanced as lawmakers attempted to address the waning newspaper presence in the Garden State. Lawmakers first began exploring changes to the law back in November and tried to act quickly — towns have to designate their official newspaper by January and could face fines for failure to provide notice.
The changes have plenty of critics.
Assemblyman Brian Rumpf (R-Somerset) said the new law is a disservice to people who rely on physical publications to get their community news. Legislators should have compromised by including weekly and monthly papers, many of which are free at town grocery stores or libraries, he added.
“There are other methods by which this could be … without cutting all print notices out in one fell swoop,” said Rumpf, one of two Assembly members to vote against the bill.
Brett Ainsworth, president of the New Jersey Press Association, slammed the bill last week, saying it “diminishes transparency and erodes trust in government.”
Assemblyman Michael Inganamort (R-Sussex), a supporter, said the new law is a modern solution to a changing media environment. It allows residents to avoid paying for subscriptions to news outlets and securing physical newspapers, and instead access online information “from the comfort of their own home or their local library,” he said.
It also will save money for towns that were doling out public funds to pay for these notices, he added.
“We’re not in the ’70s anymore, and New Jerseyans, and frankly all Americans, are getting their information on primarily digital platforms,” he said.
The legislation was introduced last week by Sen. Nicholas Scutari (D-Union), the Senate president. It advanced out of the upper chamber unanimously. In the Assembly, the legislation was voted out 69-2 with two abstentions.

After 11th-hour negotiations to secure support from holdouts, Senate Republicans narrowly passed sweeping legislation that would affect everything from taxes to energy to immigration and pare back some social services to pay for it. 
The Senate vote was split 50-50, with Vice President JD Vance breaking the tie and casting the deciding vote. All Democrats voted against the bill and were joined by three Republicans. Senate leadership urged the House to support the amended bill this week.
“It’s been a long road to get to today,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said after passage, noting that GOP members and staff worked on the foundation for the bill even before their victories in the November elections. “Since we took office in January, Republicans have been laser-focused on achieving the bill before us today. And now we’re here, passing legislation that will permanently extend tax relief for hard-working Americans.”
U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said Monday he didn’t know if Republicans had the votes to pass their bill. And early Tuesday, Senate GOP leadership wasn’t sure if they had consolidated the support needed. But that ended up coming together later in the morning. Republicans could only afford to lose a few votes and are trying to wrap up the entire process by Friday so Trump can sign it into law.
But Murphy noted even some Republicans are raising concerns about the effects of the bill,  as evidenced by GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina saying he’ll vote no and deciding to retire amid Trump’s threat to back a primary challenger against him. Tillis pointed to the deep cuts to Medicaid that could hit his home state.
“It’s a deeply unpopular bill. The Republican Senate offices are being lit up with phone calls and emails pleading that they don’t vote for this,” Murphy told reporters Monday. “So you’re seeing senators make some pretty stunning announcements as they figure out how terrible this bill will be for their state.”
As the Senate made its way through a procedural vote and debate over the weekend, the bill entered the final stretch on Monday. Senators spent nearly 24 hours voting on amendments and motions during a marathon session referred to as a “vote-a-rama.” It went late into the night and finished early Tuesday as Senate leadership worked on wrangling more votes in behind-the-scenes negotiations.
Both of Connecticut’s senators introduced amendments, but they were rejected. Murphy offered one that took out reductions to taxes on health care providers, which allow states to help fund Medicaid through federal funding, and replace it with a corporate tax increase. Blumenthal’s sought to block national security funds to be used on a Qatari jet given to Trump to use as Air Force One.
One GOP amendment scrapped a notable part of the bill that would have placed a moratorium on states imposing regulations of artificial intelligence and could have had implications on Connecticut bills regarding AI.
The Senate bill initially reduced the ban on state AI regulations from 10 years to five years. But after the compromise fell apart, senators almost unanimously voted to take it out of the bill completely.
Murphy and Blumenthal took issue with the ban, saying it would have impeded on state legislation, like a bill from state Sen. James Maroney, D-Milford. During the Connecticut General Assembly session, Senate Bill 2 passed the Senate in May, but faced a possible veto from Gov. Ned Lamont who worried it could discourage innovation.
Maroney called the now-defunct federal provision “a significant overreach into states’ rights.” His bill would have placed greater transparency on the use of AI and curbed the dissemination of deep-fake porn. Blumenthal has also been working on the issue at the federal level.
When that vote series concluded overnight, the Senate moved to final passage early Tuesday. The House will now need to take it up again later this week to approve the amended version or make its own changes. Republicans are trying to stick to their self-imposed deadline to get it to Trump by July 4.
“We are in effect mortgaging our country so that our children are going to have to pay more for tax breaks now going to the wealthy and right now the pain caused by this measure and the hurt and harm to everyday people in Connecticut is simply gargantuan,” Blumenthal said Monday.
The bill is likely to have a significant impact on states and their own budgets as the federal government seeks to shift more costs over to them. If enacted, Connecticut could be on the hook for the first time ever in helping to cover the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps.
That has Connecticut preparing for what’s to come, with the possibility of wide-ranging cuts to federal funding as well as new cost-sharing plans in the tax bill.
“People won’t see it for days or weeks, but eventually it will hit all of us, and it will hit our economy, because Connecticut will have to compensate for some of the loss of those hundreds of dollars that will no longer be coming from the federal government,” Blumenthal said.
While passage through a full Congress is still not assured, Republicans are in the driver’s seat since they are using a fast-track process known as budget reconciliation. This allows them to bypass filibusters in the Senate and pass certain kinds of bills without relying on votes from Democrats.
As the vehicle for much of Trump’s second-term agenda, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” seeks to extend the tax breaks in the 2017 tax law that passed during Trump’s first term and will expire at the end of the year. It would also steer billions of dollars in immigration funding, including money for a border wall and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. And it would phase out clean energy tax credits passed during the Biden administration related to electric vehicles and consumer tax credits.
Democrats, including Connecticut’s congressional delegation, are opposed and didn’t have a role in crafting the bill. They argue it will disproportionately benefit wealthier Americans and big corporations, balloon the national debt and cut critical services.
The legislation looks different in various ways than the House version of the “big beautiful bill.” 
The legislation would make many of the tax breaks permanent from 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including lower income tax rates. A number of tax provisions were amended or narrowed in the Senate bill.
The House bill raised the $10,000 threshold on deductions for state and local taxes, or SALT, to $40,000, which would get phased out for those who make over $500,000. Both caps would increase by 1% through 2033. But the Senate version only raises the cap through 2029 and would have it return to the current threshold after that.
If the cap increases, it will be especially beneficial for higher cost-of-living states like Connecticut. In 2022, state taxpayers had the highest average SALT deduction, around $9,100, just under the current $10,000 cap, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. That year, 11% of the state’s returns claimed SALT, one of the highest rates in the U.S.
Workers would be able to deduct overtime pay or tips from their federal income tax, but unlike the House bill, the Senate imposed caps on those deductions. And people could deduct up to $10,000 of interest on their auto loans as long as the vehicle was assembled in the U.S., but the Senate added into its bill that the car must be new. All three tax breaks would last through 2028.
Families would get to claim a slightly higher child tax credit. The House bill would have increased the rebate to $2,500 through 2028 and then go back down to $2,000 and indexed for inflation. It also required parents who filed taxes jointly to have Social Security numbers. The Senate changed it so that the tax credit is permanently at $2,200 starting in 2026, and only one parent needs to have a Social Security number.
Under the House bill, seniors who are 65 and older with low to middle incomes will be able to make an additional $4,000 deduction. The Senate bill increases it to $6,000.
To pay for these tax provisions, the bill includes steep spending cuts, which would have a direct impact on some safety net programs and state finances.
To qualify for Medicaid as an adult under 65, a recipient would need to work or participate in training, education or community service at least 80 hours a month. Exemptions are made for certain groups including those who are pregnant or postpartum, Medicare recipients, veterans, caregivers and people with disabilities. States would be required to check on eligibility more often.
The Senate’s bill instead imposes work requirements on adults with children who are 14 years and older. It also adds a provision that blocks Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood for one year. Federal law already prohibits funding going toward abortions with a few exceptions, but it could threaten other services those clinics provide like cancer screenings, birth control and other types of routine care.
The Senate bill would also lower the cap on provider taxes, which is a mechanism that enables states to increase the amount of Medicaid funding they receive from the federal government.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes and scores federal legislation, estimated that about 138,000 people could lose Medicaid coverage in Connecticut, with the higher end of enrollment loss up to 172,000. That estimate is based off of the House version of the bill.
Others in the state could also face major changes to their health insurance due to revisions to enrollment in the Affordable Care Act marketplace as well as new paperwork requirements that could delay tax credits to help pay for premiums for some enrollees.
On SNAP benefits, more older Americans would need to work or train at least 80 hours a month. The bill raises the age limit for able-bodied adults without dependents from 54 to 64. But the Senate version has less stringent work requirements than the House bill. It would instead apply to able-bodied adults who have children 14 and older.
States like Connecticut would need to pay a portion of SNAP benefits for the first time in the program’s history. That has raised concerns about potential benefit cuts if states cannot fill in the gap. But the Senate version is also less strict on cost sharing with states, though they would still pay a portion of the benefits based on error rate payments.
House leadership will be doing another temperature check on whether their members can support what the Senate did — or if skeptical members will push for additional changes. The House will take up the legislation Wednesday at the earliest.
“We’re going to fight this bill until the end,” Murphy said, noting ongoing concerns from Republicans in the House over changes made by the Senate.
“They still have a long way to go. We were able to kill their attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act back in 2017,” he added. “Both Dick [Blumenthal] and I were part of that effort, and we’re not going to rest until this bill is on the president’s desk.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25176010765513-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-01 13:11:00.411207

Mike DeWine included the veto of a measure that would force public libraries to move materials deemed “inappropriate” out of sight of minors.
The provision, which was inserted by the Ohio House in its budget draft, would require a public library to hide “material related to sexual orientation or gender identity or expression in a portion of the library that is not primarily open to the view of minors.”
The veto was delivered in the middle of the night, after DeWine signed the state operating budget late Monday, just before the deadline of midnight. In the message accompanying the vetoes, DeWine said the line-item “would place vague restrictions on public libraries in an effort to regulate placement of certain material within a public general circulation library.”
“In Ohio, we have strong laws on obscenity and material harmful to juveniles, and the DeWine-Tressel Administration expects those laws to be enforced,” the veto message stated.
At a press conference on Tuesday, DeWine said he thought the language was “not workable.”
“I think as parents or grandparents, no one wants their child to have a book or something that is inappropriate, something that is obscene, but I just felt that the language just does not work,” DeWine said.
The General Assembly still has the chance to override the veto with a three-fifths vote, but it would do so after libraries and advocates across the state stood staunchly against the measure.
The Columbus Metropolitan Library posted a statement to their social media applauding DeWine’s veto, calling it “a significant win for intellectual freedom and the right of every Ohioan to freely access information at their library.”

The Ohio Library Council also praised the decision, noting the laws on obscenity and harmful materials DeWine mentioned in his veto, along with protocols already in place in Ohio’s libraries.
“Ohio’s public libraries already have policies in place to protect children,” said Michelle Francis, executive director of the council. “No one cares more about the safety, education and well-being of children than libraries. For generations, libraries have provided trusted, welcoming spaces, and we will continue to do so with professionalism and integrity.”
While LGBTQ+ advocacy group Equality Ohio was disappointed by other provisions it considers to be anti-LGBTQ+, the organization gave DeWine credit for the veto.
“While we remain deeply concerned about the presence of harmful ideology in our state’s budget, we appreciate that Governor DeWine used his line-item veto to block three of the six anti-LGBTQ+ amendments in the budget,” Equality Ohio said in a Tuesday morning statement.
Along with the public library provision, the organization also praised DeWine’s vetoes of a measure blocking funding to youth homeless shelters “that promote or affirm social gender transition,” and a provision that would limit the types of flags allowed to be displayed at state agencies, including, Equality Ohio said, the pride flag.
“Social issues don’t belong in public dollars,” said Dwayne Steward, executive director of Equality Ohio. “Stadiums shouldn’t be funded while our infrastructure and schools remain in disrepair. And taxpayer dollars should never be weaponized to erase, censor or shame our communities.
The pride flag was not mentioned in DeWine’s veto message, but he said the governor “should have the authority to approve additional flags not included in this section to ensure state-owned properties can properly pay respect to the armed forces and other worthy public causes as deemed necessary by the governor.”
In DeWine’s veto of the youth homeless shelter provision, he said “if a shelter has to call a homeless youth a pronoun that is incongruent with that youth’s gender to get that person into a shelter so the child won’t freeze to death, it needs to be done without fear of getting funding clawed back.”

(Courtesy of South Dakota State University)Hundreds of samples tested in recent years to determine if “forever chemicals” are tainting South Dakota water had to be shipped overnight to out-of-state labs for analysis.
That’s about to change.
Demand for laboratories to test samples for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is growing nationwide, as concerns about the chemicals in drinking water grow. PFAS have been used in industry and consumer products since the 1940s, including in modern products such as nonstick cookware and water-resistant clothing, and don’t break down easily in the environment or in the human body. Research indicates PFAS exposure may be linked to negative developmental and reproductive effects, and an increased risk of some cancers.
South Dakota State University in Brookings plans to become an Environmental Protection Agency-certified laboratory to test environmental samples. The state Department of Health plans to start its own testing program and become certified in drinking water testing.

The Brookings-based East Dakota Water Development District pledged to contribute $53,134 to get the plan started. The district partnered last year with South Dakota Mines, hundreds of miles away in Rapid City, to test for PFAS along the Big Sioux River watershed in the eastern part of the state. 
“Driving 15 blocks across town is a lot cheaper and quicker of a delivery system,” said Jay Gilbertson, manager at the district.
Chris Schmidt, director of the Water and Environmental Engineering Research Center at SDSU, said the university already has the instrument needed to test for PFAS compounds: a liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The machine is used by the chemistry department to test pharmaceuticals and identify other compounds in materials. South Dakota State tested for PFAS compounds previously in Teflon coating on pots and pans, Schmidt said.
The lab will start testing surface water from interested water districts and then use the same method to test bio solids, plant material and animal tissue, Schmidt said.
“Right now, the science is focused on detecting PFAS in the water and how it got there,” Schmidt said. “But we have to expand that to understand how it functions in the environment, how it moves through groundwater and through the food chain.”
SD tests for ‘forever chemicals’ in rivers to identify, address potential contamination

Testing could expand to brain tissue for possible connections to diseases, SDSU assistant professor and coordinator of the Campus Core Mass Spectrometry Facility M. Nurul Islam told the district board members at their June meeting. 
Testing drinking water, Schmidt said, involves different certification. Schmidt said he isn’t currently pursuing that certification, since the state is planning to fill that need.
The Health Department is partnering with the state Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources to develop a testing laboratory, according to a department spokesperson. The laboratory will start receiving testing samples this year.

A for-profit company takes over Tuesday.,"Public Consulting Group's Indiana subsidiary will operate on a five-region model, doing away with county prosecutors' 17 physical hubs. (Screenshot of Family and Social Services Administration document)For 40 years, a smattering of county prosecutorial offices have held the contract for the protection of endangered Hoosier adults. A for-profit company — Public Consulting Group’s Indiana subsidiary — took over Tuesday.
“The State of Indiana has committed to ensuring uninterrupted access to (Adult Protective Services) during the transition,” a Family and Social Services Administration document reads.
“Steps are being taken to minimize disruptions to active investigations and to preserve continuity of care,” the agency added. “Efforts are underway to retain experienced investigators and recruit qualified personnel, as well as to sustain collaboration with law enforcement, healthcare providers, and community-based services.”
That response was among a dozen answers to “frequently asked questions” about the switch.
PCG-Indiana will replace the 17 county-based hubs with five regions — Northwest, Northeast, Central, Southwest, and Southeast — and coordinated under a statewide model, according to a separate document with “key information” for “stakeholders.”
“This structure enhances local responsiveness while maintaining consistent practices and centralized oversight across the state,” it continued.
The reorganization is similar to what is happening at the Indiana Department of Child Services.
APS investigators will use “standardized” tools, like a statewide risk tool to screen reports. Cases representing “immediate risk of serious harm” will get a response within 24 hours, while a “serious risk” will merit a response within four days. All others will have a 20-day timeline, according to the FAQ document.
The documents emphasize that Indiana “remains a mandatory reporting state.”
Indiana Code defines an endangered adult as one who can’t care for themselves or their belongings and that is neglected, abused or exploited. Qualifying conditions include dementia, intellectual disability, mental illness or similar impairments; lawmakers removed alcohol and drug misuse from the definition this year.
FSSA’s APS webpage doesn’t reflect the program or definition changes.

(Photo: Greg Childress)WASHINGTON, D.C. — Anna Oliva, the executive director of the National Alliance to End Homelessness (NAEH), has never seen advocates for people experiencing homelessness as concerned about the future as they’ve been the last six months.
The 30-year veteran in the fight to end homelessness told NC Newsline that advocates and others are worried about the current political landscape that has left federal funding for programs for the unhoused fraught with uncertainty.
“Primarily, I would say folks are scared,” Oliva said Monday. “They’re scared — when I say folks, I mean service providers, our leadership, our homeless services leadership, people who are in the system — they don’t know what’s going to happen.”
Oliva made her comments during an interview with NC Newsline shortly after the NAEH kicked off its annual convention in Washington. More than 2,000 advocates, service providers, nonprofit leaders and people with lived experienced have gathered in the nation’s capital to discuss policies and strategies to end homelessness.
“All of this uncertainty is making what are really hard jobs even harder,” Oliva said. “And it’s making the lives of people who are tenants in these programs uncertain in a way that I think is pretty damaging.”

Hard times for get harder
The uncertainty couldn’t have come at a worse time. Homelessness in America increased by 18% in 2024, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) 2024 Annual Homelessness Assessment Report (AHAR). The report found 770,000 Americans — an 18% increase over the previous year — experiencing homelessness on a January night in 2024. It was the largest number recorded since HUD began conducting the counts in 2005.
According to HUD, the number of people experiencing homelessness increased in every category — except for veterans — measured during the department’s annual Point-in-Time (PIT) Count. The count is a snapshot of the number of individuals in shelters, temporary housing and unsheltered on a single night.
“I would say that right now folks are, they’re nervous about the direction that the country is going and how they might try and figure out how to make up a [funding] gap, right?” Oliva said. “If there is a gap, if there is a cut that’s made from the federal government, if the federal government no longer funds the Continuum of Care (CoC) program, what does that mean for them?”
The CoC to which Oliva referred is a community-based planning process and system aimed at ending homeless by coordinating efforts among various stakeholders to provide housing and services to families and individuals experiencing homelessness. The system is largely funded by HUD.
The NAEH has lobbied against budget cut it believes would negatively impact programs to prevent and end homelessness. It has urged Congress to reject cuts to Homeless Assistance Grants and other safety net resources. The Alliance estimates that cuts to the program would eliminate funding for more than 166,000 units of Permanent Supportive Housing, which is a critical intervention for individuals experiencing chronic homelessness.
President Trump’s FY 2026 budget proposal calls for $532 million in cuts to the federal government’s Homeless Assistance Grants account, the NAEH said in a recent statement.

Mega-bill debate looms, spreads fear
The conference in Washington is taking place against the backdrop of a Senate debate over President Donald Trump’s so-called “one big, beautiful bill.” The bill stirred controversy in North Carolina over the weekend when U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) voted against it, arguing that it would cause more than 660,000 North Carolinians to lose health care.
Trump threatened to run a candidate against Tillis in next year’s GOP primary and Tillis abruptly announced that he would not seek reelection.
“What do I tell 663,000 people in two years or three years, when President Trump breaks his promise by pushing them off of Medicaid because the funding’s not there anymore, guys?” Tillis said in a floor speech.

Nationally, estimates from the Congressional Budget Office show that the legislation being debated in the Senate would leave nearly 12 million people without health care coverage by 2034. The bill slashes $1.1 trillion from Medicaid, Medicare and Obamacare over that period. More than $1 trillion of those cuts coming from Medicaid.
Oliva said if the budget legislation passes, the advocates and service providers for people experiencing homelessness will have a new set of problems with which to contend.
“We’re very concerned about how many people are one medical bill away from losing their housing, how many people need those services in order to maintain their housing over time, how many people will be priced out of the rental market if they have to pay medical bills above their rent,” Oliva said “There’s all sorts of questions that we have about what the impact of that would be in communities.”
Oliva said the impact of Medicaid cuts would be widespread.
“All of these social services and policies are connected, and could have a pretty significant impact on the number of people experiencing homelessness in communities nationwide, red communities and blue communities alike, rural communities, suburban communities,” Oliva said. “Rural and suburban communities rely much more heavily on federal dollars than urban communities do, and they’re going to be deeply impacted by these potential changes should they pass.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Image-1024x768.png,,,2025-07-01 12:19:33.126941

The Supreme Court has ruled on a previous case in favor of upholding the California law, which opponents argue puts an unfair burden on pork producers by impacting their ability to sell to the state.
The IPPA lawsuit argued Proposition 12, which voters approved in 2018, imposed excessive burdens on interstate commerce and discriminated against out-of-state farmers.
The case was heard in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which ruled in June 2024, in favor of California. IPPA filed a petition asking the Supreme Court to review the decision, which is the petition the court denied Monday.
Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird led more than 20 attorneys general from other ag-producing states on an amici curiae in support of the IPPA appeal to the Supreme Court.
Bird said in a statement Monday she was disappointed by the Supreme Court’s decision.
“Laws like this hurt Iowa’s rural communities and make it more difficult for Americans to enjoy the world-class pork products they have come to love and expect out of our state,” Bird said.
Bird said she would continue to fight against similar laws, including a Massachusetts law against which the attorney general also led an amici curiae with other states, urging for an appeal.
“States like California and Massachusetts should not dictate Iowa farming practices,” Bird said.
The California law, which went into effect in 2024, stipulates that regardless of where an animal was raised, it must comply with the state regulation on animal confinement in order to be sold in California. The law stipulates sow enclosures must have at least 24 square feet of room. The law, which passed as a state referendum, was supported by animal rights organizations that say this spacing would give the animals enough space to turn around freely.
The west-coast state is a major pork consumer, meaning its laws have a big impact on pork production across the country and in states like Iowa, which produces the most pork in the nation.
Pork producers said the law would disrupt the pork supply chain and raise costs at the consumer level, as producers retrofit their facilities to comply with the law.
Eldon McAfee, counsel for IPPA, said the organization was “disappointed, obviously” by the decision and that many pork producers “don’t understand” how a California law “can be enforced here in Iowa.”
McAfee said producers believe this should be a marketplace decision driven by consumer and producer choice, not an enforcement.
“We do not believe it can be mandated by law, we believe it is unconstitutional,” McAfee said. “But the court disagreed in the NPPC case and declined to accept this case.”
McAfee referenced a Supreme Court decision against the National Pork Producers Council’s petition of the California law.
He said while the court did not issue an explanation of the decision, the docket entries show justices discussed the case seven times before eventually declining the petition, with Justice Brett Kavanaugh dissenting.
McAfee said the next step forward is legislative action.
“The courts have stated the basic premise that it is the federal government, Congress, that regulates interstate commerce,” McAfee said. “We believe the best option is federal legislation … to prevent this type of law.”
U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, a Republican from Iowa, has also been a vocal opponent of Proposition 12, working with other Republicans in Iowa and other states to advance legislation the past several years that would supersede the state law.
“This mandate on Iowa hog farmers increases pork prices for families, makes hog farming needlessly more expensive, harms our rural communities, and threatens our food security,” Feenstra said in a statement Monday. “I remain committed to getting a new, five-year Farm Bill signed into law that repeals Prop 12 and delivers certainty and clarity for our hog farmers.”

Construction employs more immigrant laborers, many likely living here illegally, than any other industry, and the industry is starting to draw more attention — even in conservative states — as the Trump administration pushes for more deportations (Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix).As President Donald Trump sends mixed messages about immigration enforcement, ordering new raids on farms and hotels just days after saying he wouldn’t target those industries, he has hardly mentioned the industry that employs the most immigrant laborers: construction.
Nevertheless, the Trump administration is going after construction workers without legal status to meet its mass deportation goals — even as the country has a housing shortage and needs new homes built. A shortage of workers has delayed or prevented construction, causing billions of dollars in economic damage, according to a June report from the Home Builders Institute.
Almost a quarter of all immigrants without a college degree work in construction, a total of 2.2 million workers as of last month, before work site raids began in earnest. That’s more than the next three industries combined: restaurants (1.1 million), janitorial and other cleaning services (526,000) and landscaping (454,000), according to a Stateline analysis of federal Current Population Survey data provided by ipums.org at the University of Minnesota.
Within the construction industry, immigrant workers are now a majority of painters and roofers (both 53%) and comprise more than two-thirds of plasterers and stucco masons. U.S. citizens in construction are more likely to work as managers and as skilled workers, such as carpenters.
Many immigrant workers are likely living here illegally, although there are some working legally as refugees or parolees, and others are asylum-seekers waiting for court dates. There’s also a small number of legal visas for temporary farmworkers, construction workers and others.
The pool of immigrant workers Stateline analyzed were employed noncitizens ages 18-65 without a college degree, screening out temporary workers with high-skill visas.
About half of the immigrant laborers in construction are working in Southern states, including conservative-leaning Florida, North Carolina and Texas, where there is more building going on, according to the Stateline analysis. Another 584,000, or one-quarter, are in Western states, including Arizona, California and Nevada.
In recent months, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE, has conducted construction worksite raids in Florida in Tallahassee and near Ocala, and in South Texas and New Orleans, as well as more immigrant-friendly California and Pennsylvania.
Roofers may have been the first targeted by new workplace raids because of their visibility, said Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance, a California-based advocacy group with chapters in five other states.
“That’s the first place we heard about it. Roofers are right out there where you can see them,” Barajas said. He added that all segments of construction work have been targeted for ICE raids, and that even some legal workers are not showing up for work out of fear.
“Six or eight weeks ago, I would have said we weren’t affected at all. Now we are. There’s a substantial reduction in the number of workers who are showing up, so crews are 30%, 40% smaller than they used to be,” Barajas said.
In residential construction, a system of contractors and subcontractors opens the door to abuses, said Enrique Lopezlira, director of the Low-Wage Work Program at the University of California, Berkeley Labor Center. Lopezlira said contractors hire workers, often immigrant laborers, for low-wage jobs and pay them in cash, to save money on benefits and make the lowest possible bid for projects.
“It becomes a blame game. The developers can say, ‘I hired this contractor and I thought he was above board and paying people a decent wage.’ And the contractors can say, ‘I rely on subcontractors,’” said Lopezlira. “It becomes a race to the bottom.”
In many places, residential construction draws more immigrant labor because of looser state and local regulations and lower pay. But in some states with weaker unions and rules that are less strict, such as Texas, the commercial construction industry also employs many immigrants who are here illegally.
Commercial construction labor costs are 40% lower in Texas than they are in large Northeastern cities where unions are more powerful, said David Kelly, a lecturer in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan.
“The large difference [in cost] suggests workers and their employers in some regions are not paying for income taxes, overtime, Social Security or unemployment insurance,” Kelly said in an email. “Since undocumented workers have limited employment options they may be more willing than others to accept these conditions.”
Despite political claims that Democratic policies result in immigrants taking jobs others need, noncitizen immigrant laborers were about 7% of jobholders nationally as of May — about the same as 2015, according to the Stateline analysis.
That share has hardly budged over the past 10 years, including in 2019 under the first Trump administration, dipping to 6% only in 2020 and 2021.
In construction, however, the share of jobs held by immigrant laborers has increased from 19% in 2015 to 22% in 2024, according to the analysis. Immigrant laborers have gotten more than a third of the 1.5 million jobs added between 2015 and 2024, as home construction reached historic levels.

Attorneys for Teresa Youngblut have asked a judge to extend a deadline to present evidence to prosecutors as they weigh whether to bring capital crimes in the case.

Attorneys for Teresa Youngblut want more time to present information as they try to convince federal prosecutors not to file charges that carry the death penalty against their client in connection with the fatal shooting of a U.S. border patrol agent earlier this year in Vermont.
“This Court should step in to ensure Ms. Youngblut receives a meaningful opportunity to persuade the government not to pursue the death penalty,” Steven Barth and Julie Stelzig, lawyers for Youngblut, wrote in a Monday night filing in federal court in Burlington. 
The attorneys wrote in the 21-page filing that the current deadline, later this month, to submit mitigating evidence against seeking the death penalty eligible charges in the case should be extended to “at least” Jan. 30, 2026.
The lawyers also asked for a hearing on the request. Judge Christina Reiss, who is presiding in the case, has not yet issued a ruling.
Youngblut, 21, of Washington state, is currently facing firearms and assault charges in connection with the Jan. 20 shootout on Interstate 91 in Coventry that killed David Maland, a U.S. border patrol agent who conducted a traffic stop that afternoon on a vehicle Youngblut had been driving. 
At some point during that traffic stop, according to charging documents, Youngblut got out of the vehicle and began shooting. An exchange of gunfire occurred with law enforcement on the scene. Maland was killed in the shootout as was Felix Bauckholt, a German national who was a passenger in the vehicle Youngblut was driving. 
Youngblut has not been charged directly with firing the shot that killed Maland. The FBI, which is leading the investigation into his fatal shooting, has refused to confirm who fired that fatal shot. 
Youngblut, who was also hurt in the shootout, has been held in custody since receiving treatment for injuries in a hospital.
Barth, one of Youngblut’s attorneys, said at a hearing in the case last week that he expected federal prosecutors to file charges against his client in “short order” that carry the possibility of the death penalty. 
He declined further comment to reporters following the hearing. 
However, in the filing Monday night, Youngblut’s legal team provided more information about what has been taking place outside of the public eye in the case.
On June 2, federal prosecutors informed Youngblut’s defense team that “they should be prepared to meet with the U.S Attorney General’s Capital Case Review Committee” on July 28, the lawyers wrote in the filing.
That committee screens cases for the U.S. Attorney General’s Office and determines whether to seek charges that carry the death penalty. 
Attorneys referenced an internal guidebook for the department, which says a meeting with the committee is intended to let the defense present evidence that the government would consider when deciding whether to seek the death penalty against someone charged with “potentially capital crimes.”
The lawyers wrote that the July 28 deadline does not provide Youngblut’s defense team with enough time.
Attorney said the “unprecedentedly tight timeline is even more untenable” because Youngblut’s defense team only recently secured an attorney who specializes in cases that could involve the death penalty.
“And,” the lawyers added, “irregularities aside, the government’s schedule promises to turn Ms. Youngblut’s submission into a near-pointless formality.”
Youngblut and Bauckholt allegedly had ties to a loosely linked group of people known as the “Zizians.” Members of the group, an offshoot of the so-called Rationalist movement in the San Francisco Bay Area, have been tied to several other homicides across the country, including in California and Pennsylvania.
Neither Barth nor the U.S Attorney’s Office for Vermont, which is prosecuting Youngblut’s case, could be reached Tuesday for comment.

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Black Hills Energy customers may see their bills increase by nearly 9%, or about $5.96 per month for average residential use, if regulators approve a settlement agreement presented Monday.
That’s a better scenario than first proposed by Black Hills Energy, which supplies natural gas to 120,200 customers throughout Kansas, primarily in the southwest and south-central part of the state.
The Kansas Corporation Commission, which oversees Kansas utilities, questioned staff and parties involved in reaching a unanimous settlement agreement that dropped the initial Black Hill request from $12.8 million of new revenue to $10.8 million.
That would have raised customer bills by about $11 per month, or 17.6%, KCC filings showed.
The settlement agreement rolls the company’s current Gas System Reliability Surcharge of $4.4 million, which is already being collected on customer bills, into the new rates, resulting in a total rate increase of $15.2 million.
Parties to the settlement agreement are KCC staff, Black Hills Energy, Citizens’ Utility Ratepayer Board, WoodRiver Energy, Kansas Municipal Energy Agency, Symmetry Energy, Freedom Pipeline and Seaboard Energy Kansas.
The GSRS is a rider that shows up separately on customer bills and includes costs for improving the gas distribution system, integrity management programs and cybersecurity projects to maintain safe and reliable service, according to Black Hills breakdown of the average bill.
Robert Daniel, Black Hills director of regulatory affairs for Kansas and Arkansas, testified the company had one new revenue increase in the past decade. He said a 2014 rate case resulted in about $800,000 in new revenue and a 2021 rate case brought no new revenue.
“What that tells me is that we, as a Black Hills Kansas entity, have run our business very well in terms of controlling costs over a decade,” he said.
KCC commissioner Andrew French pushed Daniel on whether there were other costs besides acceleration of costs included in the new requested rates, such as capital investment. 
“It really is just the baked-in costs have gone up,” Daniel said. “The company has not accelerated our Kansas capital investments and has done our absolute best to manage expenses throughout this time.”
The cost of maintenance and operational expenses were relatively flat from the 2014 to the 2021 rate case, he said.
“That was not the case for the last three or four years, really given the price of everything has gone up,” Daniel said. “I know customers feel that in many different ways, and so do we. It’s really just a general, overall increase in the cost of doing business.”
Daniel also said customer usage has gone down because of warmer weather.
“The simple fact is that the last 10 years have been warmer for whatever reason,” he said. “Customers are using less gas on a use-per-customer basis.”
More than 200 people submitted comments on the requested rate increase, most in opposition. Many said investors should have to absorb more costs rather than ratepayers.
“The 17.6% rate request is outrageous,” said Kerry Altenbernd, of Lawrence, in a written comment. “This is over seven times the current inflation rate. Black Hills needs to be more efficient in its use of ratepayers money, and make its investors shoulder the brunt of upgrades to their system, all of which expenses are tax deductible as business expenses. The KCC needs to protect Kansans from this kind of corporate excess.”
Black Hills asked for a return on equity for investors of 10.5%. The proposed settlement agreement is an ROE in the range of 9.45% to 10.05%, depending on factors such as cost of debt and capital structure. 
Customers also will see a refund of $2.95 million between November 2025 and April 2026 that is associated with the Tax Adjustment Rider. The rider shows up on customer bills as a credit or charge, based on the percentage of actual monthly base billings.
French said a commission order on the settlement agreement is due by Aug. 29, but he noted that Black Hills asked that an order be issued by Aug. 1, as the company would like the new rates to go into effect on that date.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Black-Hills-Robert-Daniel-20250630_103737-1-1024x586.jpg,,,2025-07-01 12:19:33.126941

Barrett, a former Army helicopter pilot, flipped the 7th District in 2024 into the Republican column after it had been held by Democrat Elissa Slotkin before she won election to the U.S. Senate that same year. Maasdam’s campaign website notes he is being advised by Emma Grundhauser, a former campaign aide to Slotkin. 
The central Michigan district, which includes  Lansing, is viewed by Democrats as one they must win back to try and reclaim a congressional majority in the 2026 midterms.

Ford/Maryland Matters)A federal judge gave Justice Department lawyers until noon Tuesday to confirm, in writing, the administration’s plans for implementing an executive order on birthright citizenship after the U.S. Supreme Court lifted nationwide injunctions on the order Friday.
Justice Department attorney Brad Rosenberg said at a hearing in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt on Monday that the Trump administration does not plan to begin acting on the order — which would deny citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. if neither parent was a citizen — for another four weeks. That’s the grace period set in the Supreme Court’s Friday ruling.
But U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman was looking for more than verbal assurances.
“I want to know if the government thinks that it can start removing children from the United States who are subject to the terms of the executive order, and who are not plaintiffs or members of the plaintiff’s organization,” Boardman said.
She ordered Rosenberg to submit in writing, by noon Tuesday, the government’s view of what it can do under the executive order. She also gave Rosenberg until next Monday to respond to the motion by immigrant parents and soon-to-be parents to turn the case into a class action lawsuit — the reason for Tuesday’s hearing.
The Supreme Court ruled Friday that Boardman and judges in two other districts in the U.S. could only block the executive order against plaintiffs that brought the respective cases, but said the district judges did not have the authority to impose nationwide injunctions.
 

But the ruling, as well as a concurring and a dissenting opinion, all said “that courts may award injunctive relief beyond the named parties when the case is brought as a class action.”
So attorneys for pregnant immigrants were back in court Monday, seeking to turn the case into a class action for “all children who have been born or will be born in the United States on or after February 19, 2025, who are designated by Executive Order 14,160 to be ineligible for birthright citizenship, and their parents.”
That class involves thousands of babies who have been born since Feb. 19, the day President Donald Trump’s executive order was scheduled to take effect, and thousands more who will be born while the case is decided, as well as their parents, the motion said.
A recent study by the Migration Policy Institute estimated that eliminating birthright citizenship could affect up to 250,000 babies a year.
The attorneys also asked Boardman to grant a preliminary injunction against Trump’s order immediately, to prevent any harm to their clients while the requst for class certification proceeded.
“Removal is not the only irreparable harm that we’re concerned about,” said William Powell, an attorney for the plaintiffs, during Monday’s hearing. “We’re obviously also concerned about other potential ways in which the order could be enforced to deprive newborns of potential rights.”
Potential members of the class are also documenting stress and anxiety, Powell said. He shared an anecdote about a plaintiff who is experiencing a more stressful and difficult pregnancy because she fears what will happen once her child is born.
“It is confusing to them exactly what these things mean,” Powell said. “We can’t really assure them the order is fully blocked, because it’s not.”
President Donald Trump issued the order on Jan. 20, his first day back in office. It claimed that citizenship does not automatically extend to everyone born in the U.S., excluding mothers who are here illegally or on a temporary visas unless the father has citizenship or is here with permanent legal resident status.
Rosenberg argued against class certification, which he said would be “prejudicial” to the government, and noted that the plaintiffs could have moved for class certification before Friday.
The case filed by CASA and the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project includes 15 women — some under pseudonyms because of their legal status — in nine states, including Maryland, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Washington. Some are in the U.S. without documentation, some are here on visas, many have asylum or other immigration applications pending in various stages.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)President Donald Trump’s energy emergency declaration, enacted through a Jan. 20 executive order, has drawn frequent criticism from environmentalists who argue the order serves as a front to expand the use of fossil fuels over clean energy resources. Now 15 states are suing the Trump administration, arguing the emergency order could bring them serious harm.
The states, each represented by Democratic attorneys general, brought action on behalf of their residents and natural resources, arguing the federal government’s use of emergency permitting procedures bypass critical ecological, historical and cultural resource reviews.
“The Executive Order is unlawful, and its commands that federal agencies disregard the law and in many cases their own regulations to fast-track extensive categories of activities will result in damage to waters, wetlands, critical habitat, historic and cultural resources, endangered species, and the people and wildlife that rely on these precious resources,” the lawsuit reads.
In response to a request for comment from Michigan Advance, White House Assistant Press Secretary Taylor Rogers reiterated the administration’s position.
“In the best interest of our economic and national security, President Trump declared a National Energy Emergency to save America’s energy industry stifled by Joe Biden’s radical climate agenda. Democrat State Officials can cry about our energy dominance while the rest of the country celebrates the lowest gas prices since 2021,” Rogers said.
While the suit acknowledges the need for infrastructure to support a reliable and affordable energy supply for the states and the nation, it argues the president’s powers are reserved for actual emergencies, noting earlier in the complaint that energy production in the U.S. is at an all time high and growing.

The shortcuts inherent in these powers undermine the rights of the states, the complaint argues, noting the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer’s regulations only authorize “emergency procedures” when normal procedures would result in unacceptable hazard to human life, significant loss of property, or immediate, unforeseen, and significant economic hardship. Federal agencies to date have limited emergency procedures to necessary projects during, or in the aftermath of natural or human-made disasters, according to the complaint.

To prevent any potential harm, the plaintiff states asked the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington to declare the executive order unlawful and bar federal agencies from pursuing emergency permitting on non-emergency projects.
In Michigan, Tribal Nations and environmental activists have spoken out as the Corps moves forward with emergency processing procedures for Enbridge’s Line 5 tunnel project, which would replace dual oil and natural gas pipelines running through the lakebed where Lake Michigan and Huron meet, with a new segment housed inside a concrete-lined tunnel buried beneath the bedrock.
While the tunnel project came as part of any agreement with the state to minimize the risk of an oil spill, opponents of the project argue construction would harm nearby wetlands, while still carrying risk for an oil spill.
The project’s public comment window came to an end on Monday.
The states other than Michigan filing the lawsuit include Arizona, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.

(Courtesy photo)Nearly a dozen food banks serving portions of Indiana teamed up to launch an advertising campaign this week, urging Hoosiers to protect nutrition funding — including food benefits like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP — from congressional cuts.
Feeding Indiana’s Hungry targeted Indianapolis, Terre Haute and Evansville for digital advertising campaigns, as well as an outdoor advertisement in the 4th Congressional District, which includes parts of northwestern Indiana anchored by Lafayette.
The ads direct Hoosiers to contact their U.S. Senators and Representatives and ask them to vote against such “harmful” cuts.


Members of Feeding Indiana’s Hungry include:

Food Bank of Northwest Indiana, Merrillville
Food Bank of Northern Indiana, South Bend
Food Finders Food Bank, Inc., Lafayette
Community Harvest Food Bank of Northeast Indiana, Fort Wayne
Second Harvest Food Bank of East Central Indiana, Inc., Muncie
Terre Haute Catholic Charities Foodbank
Gleaners Food Bank of Indiana, Indianapolis
Hoosier Hills Food Bank, Bloomington
Tri-State Food Bank, Inc., Evansville
Dare to Care Food Bank, Louisville, KY
Freestore Foodbank, Cincinnati, OH



“Hoosiers will continue to struggle feeding their families with the drastic cuts Congress is currently considering,” said Emily Bryant, the executive director of Feeding Indiana’s Hungry. “The nonprofit sector is already scrambling to meet the need — the lines at food pantries are getting longer by the day. We call on Congress to act now to save lives.”
Nutritional funding and other social services programs are at risk for congressional cuts in Washington D.C. this week as Congress grapples with President Donald Trumps “big, beautiful bill.” Under the proposal, states with higher error rates will pick up a portion of the tab, potentially billions of dollars for some large states.
The national association for SNAP retailers — largely convenience and grocery stores — shared an estimated cost for Indiana following changes in the U.S. Senate, putting that number at $261 million — an improvement over the previous version of the bill.
Congressional cuts would shift funding to an already strapped state budget, under which agencies saw 5% cuts earlier this year. A $2 billion predicted revenue drop over the next two years played a roll in ending a supplemental summertime meal program for children enrolled on nutritional programs like SNAP.
The current bill in Congress is projected to add $3.25 trillion to deficits during the next decade, according to the latest calculation from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, largely due to tax cuts. Republicans trimmed that number by curbing federal commitments for programs like Medicaid and SNAP.
A Monday night vote to strip SNAP language from the bill was narrowly defeated on a 49-51 vote after two Republican senators, both from Alaska, voted with Democrats. Both of Indiana’s senators voted to keep the cuts for SNAP.

Lucas Roff met his then-girlfriend when he was going to college at Lake Superior State University in Sault Ste. Marie. After he graduated with a degree in biology, they got engaged.
“I decided I need to find a job up here,” he said.
Several months ago, he landed at the Inter-Tribal Council of Michigan as an environmental technician through the MI Healthy Climate Corps. His work includes helping tribes tackle grants to reduce pollution and data about greenhouse gas emissions.
For example, he said, “if we’re assisting a tribe on their solid waste here, we would set up a plan to help them make their trash pickup more efficient.”
The Climate Corps aimed to help Michigan reach its goal of economy-wide carbon neutrality by 2050. Until recently, it fell under the umbrella of AmeriCorps, a federal program that offers paid community service jobs. It came to a halt when the Trump administration cut nearly $400 million in grant funding to AmeriCorps in April.
AmeriCorps programs range from veteran support to education to disaster response. The MI Healthy Climate Corps focused on work such as local energy plans, agriculture, and community outreach.
Members received stop work orders at the end of April. In the interim, some organizations tried to find other ways to continue the work of their corps members.
Then, in early June, Michigan said it would pay out stipends to the members who wanted to complete their terms, which last through mid-October. It tapped into the state General Fund and repurposed American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funding, according to Jeff Johnston, a spokesperson for Michigan’s Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy.
“The good news is that the work that this team had been doing around the state — in nearly 30 communities and organizations throughout the state — is continuing,” Johnston said.
Members received stipends between $30,000 and $35,000 during the program’s first eight-month term.
Johnston said the work includes energy audits, helping to increase “vehicle fleet electrification,” creating environmental education guides and community sustainability plans — “a variety of projects that various communities and organizations statewide wouldn’t otherwise have the resources to tackle, but which provide real, tangible benefits for their people.”
Mallory Meston, a climate readiness fellow with the Michigan Office of Rural Prosperity, said she works with township supervisors and clerks to figure out their plans for state funding for communities adopting renewable energy.
“I help them kind of brainstorm different projects or ideas that would most fit their community and that their community has interest in,” she said, such as townships renovating their parks, township halls or fire departments. She also works on climate and energy efforts through the Rural Readiness Network.
The stop work order brought all that to a halt.
“No one really knew what was going to happen, and it was kind of just a lot of question marks,” she said. “But I’m really glad to be back now. My teammates at ORP have been great and were able to kind of pick up my projects, and so I’m just finally getting back into everything.”
The nonprofit Community Economic Development Association of Michigan, or CEDAM, manages the Climate Corps program. It had started recruiting hosts for the third cohort of climate corps members in April. But due to the uncertainty of AmeriCorps funding, it says it has paused recruiting for now.
Michigan was among a coalition of states that sued over the AmeriCorps cuts at the end of April. A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore funding to those states’ AmeriCorps programs while denying their request to reinstate AmeriCorps staff placed on administrative leave.
In an email to IPR, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said that AmeriCorps had failed eight consecutive audits and identified more than $45 million in improper payments last year, and that states “can and should fund programs that benefit their local communities.”
AmeriCorps didn’t respond to a request for comment.
With the state’s funding push, Meston and almost all of the other corps members are staying on as fellows. (Since the program is no longer affiliated with AmeriCorps, the state changed its name to the MI Healthy Climate Fellows program.)
Roff, with the Inter-Tribal Council, was hoping to keep working in a different role if the program was cut. So the decision to continue as a climate fellow was easy.
“I really enjoy my job here, and I really enjoy the people that I work with,” he said. “To have this program started again, to have another opportunity to keep working here, I jumped at it.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-01-070712-1024x768.png,,,2025-07-01 11:18:34.004577

In court, Dr. Nancy Harper comes across as professional and authoritative. Often she begins her testimony by explaining her subspeciality: child abuse pediatrics, which focuses on the diagnosis and documentation of signs of child abuse. Her role, she often reminds judges and juries, is solely medical. Whether or not to remove a child from their home, terminate the parent’s rights or, in the most serious cases, charge a caregiver criminally is not up to her.
According to Harper’s testimony, she and her team at the Otto Bremer Trust Center for Safe and Healthy Children in Minneapolis handle about 700 cases of suspected abuse each year. She has testified that 10% to 20% of those wind up confirmed for physical abuse, although it is difficult to determine if these figures are accurate since child protection cases are not public.
When Harper, the center’s director, and her team diagnose abuse, parents and caregivers often struggle to challenge those opinions. By Harper’s own estimation, she’s never been wrong.
“I don’t think I’ve ever had a case where I thought it was abusive head trauma and the other specialist didn’t,” Harper testified in 2023, in the case of a day care provider charged with the death of a child in her care.
The defense attorney in the case pressed her: “Have you ever incorrectly diagnosed a child with abusive head trauma?”
“Not currently to my recollection,” she answered.
But in a handful of cases, judges and juries have found day care providers and parents not guilty of crimes after Harper has testified that abuse occurred, though a verdict cannot necessarily be interpreted as a repudiation of Harper or any other expert witness’ determinations or credibility.
Additionally, two federal lawsuits filed recently accuse Harper of ignoring or even concealing alternative explanations for children’s injuries. And, more broadly, medical and legal experts are increasingly questioning a leading child abuse diagnosis, shaken baby syndrome, which is also known as abusive head trauma.
Harper did not respond to requests for comment. She has yet to respond to either lawsuit. In past court testimony, Harper has said that both shaken baby syndrome and abusive head trauma are considered scientifically valid diagnoses by the mainstream medical community. Any controversy, she has said, exists primarily in the legal world rather than the medical one.
Kathleen Pakes, a former prosecutor who now specializes in the forensics of child abuse cases for the Office of the Wisconsin State Public Defender, said Harper’s claim of never making an incorrect diagnosis strains credulity.
“There is no other specialty in medicine that has zero error rate. None,” she said.
Below are four cases in which Harper concluded there was abuse but courts or juries determined otherwise.
On July 12, 2017, an 11-month-old boy named Gabriel Cooper collapsed in his high chair at the day care that Sylwia Pawlak-Reynolds operated in South Minneapolis. Paramedics took him to Hennepin County Medical Center, where he was declared brain dead a day later.
Harper reviewed Cooper’s medical records and wrote that “in the absence of a well-documented consistent severe accidental injury, non-accidental trauma or abusive head trauma remains the primary diagnostic consideration.” The child, she wrote, was essentially shaken to death. Before any criminal charges were filed, Pawlak-Reynolds boarded a plane for her native Poland to care for her ailing father, according to her attorney. In February 2018, prosecutors charged Pawlak-Reynolds with two counts of second-degree murder, citing Harper’s diagnosis.
According to her husband, Will Reynolds, they did not realize Pawlak-Reynolds was pregnant when she boarded her flight to Poland. She remained there to give birth to their third child, who is now 6, while Reynolds remained in Minnesota with their two older children, who are now 13 and 16. Reynolds said he and his wife have no confidence that she will get a fair trial, and that she fears she will lose custody of their youngest child if she reenters the country. The family has now been separated for eight years.

Early in the case, Pawlak-Reynolds’ attorneys obtained the same copy of Cooper’s hospital records that had been provided to Minneapolis police, which included the paramedics’ report. The document had been printed out at a significantly reduced scale, shrinking the text to the point that some fields were illegible. Two years later, they obtained a second copy, printed at normal size, which revealed a possible alternate explanation for the injuries: “Mom recalls [patient] did fall 2 days ago, striking the back of his head.”
“That was the sort of proverbial silver-bullet evidence that we’re always looking for in every case and usually never find,” said Brock Hunter, Pawlak-Reynolds’ lawyer.
Polish courts, including an appeals court, have denied extradition requests from the U.S. three times, and the country’s minister of justice has affirmed the rulings. The denials are particularly critical of Harper’s assessment. Polish forensic experts evaluated the case records and took note of a finding by a neurology expert hired by Pawlak-Reynolds, who wrote that Cooper carried a gene tied to a blood clotting disorder.
The ambulance report, the Polish judges wrote, “was concealed from the defense.”
“Then, after the fact was made public, it did not affect the actions of the American authorities in any way,” a Polish district court judge wrote in 2022.
The Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office certified Cooper’s manner of death as “undetermined” and the date and place of injury “unknown,” a tacit disagreement with Harper’s opinion that Cooper would have collapsed “shortly after infliction of the trauma.”
The Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office declined to comment.
Then in 2023, Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty wrote to Pawlak-Reynolds’ attorneys after meeting with them: “We agree that to resolve the current impasse regarding Ms. Pawlak-Reynolds, the best course for all involved is to dismiss the pending charges without prejudice, and for her to return to the United States.”
But months later, Moriarty changed her mind.
In a statement to ProPublica, a spokesperson for the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office wrote that the office is completing a “final, thorough review” of the case that will include an evaluation of “concerns regarding the medical conclusions and the overall strength of the case.”
Gabriel’s parents, Joseph and Samantha Cooper, did not respond to requests for comment. In a television interview in June, they denied that Cooper struck the back of his head two days before his collapse. They said that they want justice for their son.
Pawlak-Reynolds declined to comment through her attorney. In late February, her husband filed a federal lawsuit against Harper that claims she “knowingly and intentionally falsified, modified and erased exculpatory information” from her evaluation of Cooper, and she diagnosed abusive head trauma to “promote her own personal, academic, reputational and financial needs.”
Harper has yet to respond to the lawsuit. A spokesperson for Hennepin Healthcare, which operates Hennepin County Medical Center, declined to comment on the case or the lawsuit.
“There is no oversight,” Reynolds said. “It’s the thing they’re most resistant against and the thing that is most necessary to stop this legacy of brutality, that results in kids being taken away from innocent caregivers and innocent caregivers going to prison.”

In August 2017, Kathryn Campbell called 911 after a 4-month-old girl at her day care seemed lethargic and was “breathing wrong.” First responders did not take the baby to the hospital, but her mother eventually did. At the hospital, MRI scans showed fluid in the baby’s brain and doctors noted small bruises.
Dr. Barbara Knox, a child abuse pediatrician then with the University of Wisconsin, told police it was “obvious child abuse.” The Dane County district attorney charged Campbell with physical abuse of a child. Campbell pleaded not guilty.
But before the 2021 trial, Knox left the University of Wisconsin after she was placed on leave for “unprofessional acts that may constitute retaliation” and intimidation of her own staff. A Wisconsin Watch investigation cast doubt on Knox’s judgment in several cases of alleged abuse.
Knox did not respond to the Wisconsin Watch series or to ProPublica’s requests for comment. After two families in Alaska sued her in 2022, alleging she had wrongly concluded their children had been abused, Knox wrote in an affidavit that she has no control over whether police and child protection services workers take children away from parents, that she did not “conspire” with police or anyone else on custody issues, and that she did not personally evaluate one of the children. The lawsuit was dismissed in 2024 after the families agreed to drop the matter.
Knox moved on to a job at the University of Florida. According to a spokesperson for the university, Knox resigned as a pediatrician with the Child Protective Team in late June, effective Aug. 15. He declined to comment on the circumstances.
At Campbell’s trial, Knox’s name was never mentioned. Instead, Harper stepped in as an expert witness. When Campbell heard Knox had been replaced, she was initially hopeful.
“I’m like, oh, great, new eyes,” Campbell said. “They’re going to look at it and go, ‘This is nuts, I don’t agree with this.’ And I definitely was wrong.”
Harper’s assessment affirmed Knox’s diagnosis of abuse. She told the jury that the bruises were likely caused by squeezing by an adult’s hand. A medical expert hired by Campbell’s defense argued that the child’s bleeding could not be precisely dated and that a preexisting medical condition could have caused it.
After just two hours of deliberation, the jury returned a not guilty verdict. Campbell said she is grateful to have the case concluded, though she said she is still haunted by the accusations against her.
“That was the hardest thing too, going home after this case was done, and being like, ‘Am I allowed to be alone with my children now?’” she said. “It’s all because of the quote-unquote experts not doing their due diligence and looking further into underlying issues that these kids could have.”
In a statement to ProPublica, Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne expressed confidence in both Harper and Knox, saying “their testimony had been consistent with many different medical professionals and experts in their own areas of practice.”
“It is important to note that a not guilty verdict by lay jurors hardly invalidates the widespread acceptance of abusive head trauma as a diagnosis in the medical community nor would it cause us to have concerns about Dr. Harper’s qualifications or knowledge in the field,” he added. “Jurors are not bound to accept any expert testimony as accurate.”
In the winter of 2022, a 4-month-old boy began breathing abnormally at his day care in Mineral Point, Wisconsin. His parents took him to a hospital, where he died days later. A police investigation determined that his day care provider, Joanna Ford, left him and several other children alone in her home for over an hour while she went to a tattoo and piercing parlor.
Prosecutors used Harper as an expert witness in the case. After evaluating the child’s medical records, she concluded that his injuries were “clinically diagnostic of abusive head trauma,” or, put another way, Ford shook the baby violently. She was charged with first-degree reckless homicide. Ford pleaded not guilty.
Ford’s defense lawyers successfully petitioned the judge in the case for a hearing to determine whether Harper’s expert witness testimony would be scientifically valid and admissible at trial. In response to questions, Harper explained why the child’s symptoms — brain swelling, blood under his skull, damage to his eyes — pointed to abuse, and why, despite the controversy surrounding it, the diagnosis of abusive head trauma was scientifically sound. She also explained that, because the baby was not walking or crawling, the fact that none of his caregivers could explain his injuries indicated abuse.
“People should know what happened,” she testified.
On cross examination by Ford’s lawyers, Harper said she couldn’t say for certain what time the abuse would have occurred, exactly how Ford had injured the baby and that there are no “great biomechanical models” for shaken baby syndrome.
A little over a month later, Judge Lisa McDougal delivered a highly critical ruling that barred Harper from telling the jury that the child died as the result of “abusive head trauma, non-accidental injury, child abuse or murder.” She also took issue with the idea that a lack of explanation for injuries is indicative of abuse, calling it a “leap in logic.”
“Offering a conclusive opinion as to how an injury may have occurred crosses a line and does not fit within the dictionary definition of what diagnosis is,” McDougal said. The judge also said that Harper views herself as an advocate, and that that casts doubt on her “fidelity to the scientific validation of abusive head trauma diagnoses, especially when it is a close call.”
The murder charge was dismissed. For leaving the children alone, Ford pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of neglect of a child where the consequence is death. She is serving a 10-year prison sentence. Ford, through her attorney, declined a request for an interview. The Iowa County district attorney also declined to comment.
On Feb. 4, 2022, Paul and Sarah Marshall hosted a dinner for her parents and a family friend at their home in Hudson, Wisconsin. Afterward, their 7-week-old son, Fox, became fussy. Paul Marshall carried him into the mother-in-law unit on the lower level of the house, which was cool and dark, to try to calm him. He emerged minutes later in a panic, yelling that the baby spit up and stopped breathing.
Paramedics rushed Fox to Children’s Minnesota, a hospital about 25 minutes across the state border in St. Paul. Doctors ran tests, and a scan showed Fox had a skull fracture with fluid pooling on both sides of his brain. He died days later.
Harper examined Fox, as well as his twin sister, Liana, and found “skull fractures, likely rib fractures, metaphyseal fractures.”
“This constellation of findings in a nonambulatory infant is clinically diagnostic of inflicted injury or child physical abuse likely occurring on more than one occasion,” she wrote.
But the Marshalls said that wasn’t true. They told Harper that Sarah Marshall had experienced a difficult pregnancy with gestational diabetes and severe anemia, and that Liana had a vacuum-assisted delivery. Both twins had been to their regular pediatrician over health concerns. While Liana’s health improved, Fox’s had not.
A spokesperson for Children’s Minnesota declined to comment on the case.
Because he was the last person alone with Fox before he stopped breathing, Paul Marshall was charged with first-degree reckless homicide. He was also charged with physical abuse of a child for hurting Liana. Sarah Marshall said there was no evidence that her soft-spoken husband had hurt their children.
“The state wanted to cast me as a naive idiot,” she said. “I chose not to believe it because of the logic and facts in my face. I had no reason to believe the accusation.”
At Paul Marshall’s 2023 trial, his defense lawyer, Aaron Nelson, cross-examined the other doctors who treated or evaluated Fox and Liana, and was able to highlight points of medical disagreement. A doctor who tested Liana for genetic disorders said she could not rule out rickets as a possible cause of her bone fractures. A neuropathologist did not agree with Harper that Fox had a trauma-induced blood clotting disorder. By Harper’s own admission on cross-examination, determining the age of the skull fractures in children Fox and Liana’s age was difficult. Nelson called six of his own medical experts to suggest that the difficult birth or a vitamin deficiency could explain the twins’ injuries.
“How many people have to be wrong for Dr. Harper to be right?” Nelson said in closing arguments.
After an 11-day trial, the jury found Marshall not guilty.
In a statement to ProPublica, St. Croix County District Attorney Karl Anderson pointed out that Harper was not the only treating physician who was concerned that Fox and Liana had been abused.
“A not guilty verdict does not mean that the jury concluded that the children were not abused,” Anderson said. “Rather, it means that they did not conclude that the State proved that Paul Marshall caused the death, beyond a reasonable doubt.”

Six weeks after the trial, the family moved three hours away into a century-old farmhouse that is far from the community that they felt wrongfully villainized by.
One of the cruelest impacts of the abuse diagnosis, they said, came after it was clear that Fox would die and the hospital staff began making preparations for his organs to be donated. Sarah Marshall said she had hoped to someday hear her son’s heart beating in another child’s chest. Instead, a court order put a halt to the procedure.
“They were already treating him as evidence,” she said.
The experience of going from a grieving parent to an accused murderer, her husband said, has given the couple post-traumatic stress. Paul Marshall said he is grateful to be with his wife and children, but what he calls a “broken system” has left them unsure whether or not to have another baby or even be left alone with one of their daughters.
“You get pregnant. You go to all of your appointments. You voice all of your concerns. You do everything you’re supposed to do as a parent and your child still dies. And the state tells you it’s your fault,” Sarah Marshall said. “I don’t understand why I live in a world like that.”

Jim Pillen, center, greets State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair. June 2, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen has officially approved emergency rules and regulations for a regulatory commission to begin licensing medical cannabis establishments no later than Oct. 1.
The regulations had to go into effect Tuesday, based on deadlines overwhelmingly imposed by voters last November when Nebraskans legalized medical cannabis up to 5 ounces with any health care practitioner’s recommendation. Voters also approved a new Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission to have the “exclusive” power to regulate the new medicine.
After reviewing the emergency regulations, Pillen signed them Sunday. That means the commission narrowly meets its July 1 deadline to impose criteria to accept or deny licensing applications. Licensing must begin by Oct. 1, under state law.
  Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers holds up an amendment to Legislative Bill 677 that seeks to help implement medical cannabis regulations in the state.

Pillen on Tuesday pointed to a legal agreement the Medical Cannabis Commission also entered into Thursday with the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services and Pillen’s Policy Research Office, the governor’s lobbying arm. At least some advocates have voiced concern about the involvement of DHHS for broad “legal services,” including general rulemaking.
Pillen’s office said the agencies “will ensure Nebraska’s new cannabis industry is properly regulated as outlined in the ballot initiatives passed by voters and signed by him into law.”
The emergency guidelines go into effect for up to 90 days, through Sept. 28, and can be extended, if needed, for one more 90-day period. However, Pillen and members of the Medical Cannabis Commission plan to move forward with formal regulations by Oct. 1.
The commission is soliciting public feedback on the emergency regulations by July 15 at lcc.frontdesk@nebraska.gov.
Dr. Monica Oldenburg, an anesthesiologist who chairs the Medical Cannabis Commission, sent a letter to Pillen relaying the emergency regulations and stating that the “failure” to adopt them by the July 1 deadline “would force Nebraskans to seek medical cannabis or similar products from unregulated and potentially harmful sources.”
Justification for emergency regulations under state law can include “imminent peril” to public health, safety or welfare.
Application requirements
Under the emergency guidelines, anyone could apply for a cultivator, product manufacturer, dispensary or transporter license. An individual or business could be awarded only one license type, which would each also have strict record-keeping requirements.

Licenses could be granted for two years with a chance for renewal and would be non-transferable. Licenses may be denied for “good cause.”
Applicants would need to meet the following criteria for all license types:

Ownership: At least 51% of the ownership of an application must be Nebraska residents and U.S. citizens for at least the past four years.
Finger printing: At least two sets of fingerprints for anyone included in the application must be sent to the FBI through the Nebraska State Patrol for a national criminal history record information check. A fee must be paid to the State Patrol.
Location: Licensed establishments could not be within 1,000 feet of any existing school, daycare, church or hospital.
Prohibited persons: No one who has been convicted of any felony or any controlled substance-related offense within the past 10 years is eligible for the application. No state or local government can apply for the, nor can any health care practitioner who has issued one or more written recommendations for medical cannabis in the past five years. Only adults can apply for a license.

There is no deadline for applications to be submitted, and there is also no clear destination for them to be submitted to.
Dispensary and product restrictions
There could be no more than one dispensary in each of the state’s 12 District Court Judicial Districts, which lawmakers and advocates have said might be too few. 
That would mean one dispensary each in Douglas County (584,526 residents), Lancaster County (322,608 residents), Sarpy/Cass Counties (217,202 residents) and Buffalo/Hall Counties (112,979 residents), according to 2020 census data for Nebraska.
Those restrictions would allow no more than five dispensaries to cover more than half of the state’s 93 counties west of Grand Island (Hall County) or Kearney (Buffalo County).

The regulations would allow dispensaries to sell: 

Oral tablets, capsules or tinctures.
Non-sugarcoated gelatinous cubes, gelatinous rectangular cuboids or lozenges in a cube or rectangular cuboid shape.
Gels, oils, creams or other topical preparations
Suppositories.
Transdermal patches.
Liquids or oils for administration using a nebulizer or inhaler.

Dispensaries could not sell raw plant or flower, food or drinks with cannabis infused into it (edibles), any products containing artificial or natural flavoring or coloring and any products administered by smoking, combustion or vaping.
A dispensary could only obtain cannabis products from licensed Nebraska cultivators, transporters or manufacturers.
Packaging would need to be able to show whether it had been tampered with and be child-resistant, resealable and protected from contamination.
Similar to 2024 restrictions on vaping products, cannabis products could not depict cartoon-like fictional characters or mimic characters primarily aimed at entertaining minors, trademarks or trade dress or products that imitate or mimic products primarily marketed to minors, symbols primarily used to market products to minors or the images and likenesses of celebrities.
Until establishments are licensed, medical cannabis products can’t be legally purchased in Nebraska. Many advocates have turned to surrounding states for products as well as health care recommendations, as some Nebraska providers refuse to recommend cannabis. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services hasn’t issued any guidance.
The emergency regulations would require that a health care practitioner’s recommendation specify the product being recommended, the recommended dosage and potency, the number of doses, the directions for use and the name of the patient.
State lawmakers rejected multiple efforts in May to shield health care practitioners from civil, criminal or professional penalties solely for recommending medical cannabis.
What comes next?
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, who tried to enact additional legislative guardrails around the commission this spring, with the support of advocates, said the “proof” will be “in the pudding” based on what formal regulations look like, not the emergency regulations.
Hansen has also repeatedly voiced concerns about the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office having threatened to sue the Medical Cannabis Commission as soon as it begins issuing licenses. Hansen questioned how much those lawsuits and others might cost taxpayers.

While Pillen has not outright joined Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers in his legal challenges of marijuana, both have questioned the validity of the medical cannabis laws in part because the federal government designates marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance.
Thirty-nine other states allow cannabis for medical use, and 24 of those states have also legalized recreational marijuana use. Washington, D.C., has legalized both. Advocates have pointed to the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution as uplifting the rights of states, and of Nebraska voters, to make their voices heard on marijuana policies.
When formal regulations are released this summer, regardless of how similar they are to the emergency rules, there will be a public comment period and an in-person hearing. Formal guidelines would go to Hilgers and his office for legal review and then to Pillen.
“The input that the public provides on these emergency regulations will help us immediately begin drafting the regular regulations,” Commissioner Lorelle Mueting of Gretna, an addiction prevention specialist through Heartland Family Service, said last week.
Crista Eggers, executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, the campaign that ushered the laws through the 2024 election, said Tuesday that the commission has “failed on day one” by prohibiting the sale of whole-plant cannabis and limiting permissible methods of using cannabis under the regulations. Eggers said the ballot measures were clear on what Nebraskans and that “any attempt to dilute access or restrict parts of the plant is both unacceptable and unlawful.”
“We, the patients, families, caregivers, voters and citizens, will not be silent while this Commission defies its clear mandate. It is not their role to rewrite or reinterpret what the people have already decided. This Commission was created by and for the people of Nebraska, and it must answer to them,” Eggers said in a statement. “Let me be clear: This blatant disregard of their duty and the law will not be tolerated.”
The next Medical Cannabis Commission meeting is currently set for Aug. 4.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement used the pretense of a national emergency to justify a secret, no-bid contract with CoreCivic that would pay the company $4.2 million per month to house detained immigrants at its vacant Leavenworth prison.
CoreCivic revealed in court filings the amount of money it stands to lose if the city of Leavenworth prevails in legal proceedings aimed at blocking the company from reopening its prison. But the details of the contract remain undisclosed.
ICE filed internal paperwork that outlines the agency’s “justification” for giving contracts to private companies without going through the normal bidding process or revealing the cost, citing President Donald Trump’s declaration of a “national emergency at the southern border.” The agency said the situation “poses significant public safety risks.”
The secrecy, cost and justification of the contract outraged immigration advocates who oppose CoreCivic’s plans to reopen the Leavenworth facility — because of the company’s track record of abuse and neglect of prisoners and the nationwide crackdown by masked ICE agents who show little regard for civil rights or the status of people they detain.
“We just want to say we can overpay billionaires to house human beings on civil law violations,” said Michael Sharma-Crawford, a Kansas City-based immigration attorney. “I just don’t even know where we go from here. I just don’t. I mean, everything is geared to making billionaires more billions and continuing to crush any dissidents and human rights along the way.”
Sharma-Crawford said residents deserve to know how their tax dollars are being spent.
“This isn’t a national emergency. You are entering into a contract for the housing of civil detainees,” he said. “There’s nothing secret about that. There’s no scientific knowledge. There is no tactical knowledge. There is nothing that is secret about what you’re paying to house people.”
 
The justification
ICE published its “justification” document April 7 under the category of “unusual and compelling urgency.” The document references a five-year commitment to pay unnamed companies to operate nine facilities that combined would have 10,312 beds, including 1,000 in Kansas. The cost of the secret contracts is redacted.
The document notes that “many jurisdictions” have refused to work with ICE in recent years, making the agency increasingly reliant on private companies. An open competition for bids would take a year to complete, the document said.
“ICE does not have the time for the competitive process to be completed to procure more beds,” the document said. “Increased detention capacity is needed immediately to avoid the release by ICE of a significant numbers of aliens into United States.”
CoreCivic operated a federal pretrial prison in Leavenworth for more than two decades. U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson in 2021 described the facility, with its routine violence and lengthy lockdowns, as “an absolute hell hole.” The facility closed on Jan. 1, 2022, when President Joe Biden’s administration ended contracts with private prisons.
The city of Leavenworth filed a lawsuit to block CoreCivic from reopening the facility as an immigration detention center. The city argues that company should seek a permit, which could require the company maintain certain standards at the facility. A state district court judge issued a temporary injunction blocking CoreCivic from reopening the facility while the matter is being litigated.
The company asked the judge in a June 13 court filing to reconsider the temporary injunction.
“CoreCivic has a Contract with ICE under which it stands to lose approximately $4.2 million in monthly revenue if the Court maintains the temporary injunction,” the court filing said.
Ryan Gustin, a spokesman for CoreCivic, said the company is “pursuing all avenues to find a successful conclusion to this matter.”
“CoreCivic has been actively marketing our Leavenworth facility for years,” he said. “We stay in regular contact with ICE and all our government partners to understand their changing needs, and we work within their established procurement processes. Any questions about our contractual relationship with ICE should be directed to ICE Public Affairs.”
ICE Public Affairs didn’t respond to a Kansas Reflector inquiry.
 
Profit from pain
Micah Kubic, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas, said the deal between ICE and CoreCivic “reflects a broader pattern of collusion between private corporations and their enablers in this presidential administration.”
“By circumventing its own requirements for contract bidding, ICE has essentially ensured that its favorites get hefty, federal contracts fueled by taxpayer dollars to fill their prisons, and we’ve seen how this money grab translates into reckless, at times horrifying conduct by masked, anonymous agents in our neighborhoods.”
Sharma-Crawford, the immigration attorney, said he has clients who were detained by ICE after they entered the country on a visa or immediately filed for asylum and were here lawfully. He said ICE agents were “grasping at straws to make numbers.”
Ashley Hernandez, organizing and policy coordinator for the Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth’s Office of Justice, Peace, and Integrity of Creation, said the supposed national emergency is only “in people’s heads.”
“We’ve seen a lot of propaganda and a lot of hate speech that kind of drives that,” Hernandez said. “I think the national emergency, if we want to say there is one, is that there are people coming to our country seeking help, seeking a better life, and they’re fleeing the true national emergencies that are in their countries. They’re fleeing death. They’re fleeing sickness. They’re fleeing pain.”
She said it was “just insanity” to allow any company “to profit off of human pain.”
“As Catholics, as people of faith, we are called to treat everyone with dignity,” Hernandez said. “We are called to help the poor, help the sick, walk with the marginalized and be their voices. So our faith really calls us to make sure that this detention center doesn’t happen.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5200573-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-01 11:18:34.004577

(Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer) Members of the nation’s largest private-sector doctors union voted to authorize a strike if its negotiating team can’t reach a contract agreement with Allina Health. 
There is no timeline for a strike, according to a press release from Doctors Council Service Employees International Union. If the negotiating unit decides to call a strike, they must give Allina a 10-day notice. 
The doctors’ vote comes on the heels of nurses recently voting to authorize strikes. Some groups of nurses opted to call a strike just days after the authorization. 
Doctors Council SEIU includes doctors, nurse practitioners and physicians’ assistants at 60 Allina primary and urgent care clinics in Minnesota plus one in Wisconsin. 
The workers picketed outside Allina Clinics last month — the first time in Minnesota history that doctors have picketed their employer. Physicians have not historically seen themselves as workers in need of a union. The consolidation of health care and productivity demands set by faraway bosses, however, has made many feel more like workers pushed to churn through patients on an assembly line rather than masters of their own practices.
The strike authorization was approved by 90% of the providers who voted. 
“We voted so strongly to authorize a strike because we are frustrated that we aren’t seeing movement on issues that matter most to our membership including sick time, vacation time, and time away to deal with the demanding job we do,” said Cora Walsh, family medicine provider at Allina West St. Paul and member of the Doctors Council bargaining team. 
In a statement, Allina Health said it has made “substantial progress” on contract negotiations with the union.

Republish photo only with original story.)Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has signed the state’s massive operating budget, including dozens of vetoes — axing provisions that would restrict books in libraries, take money away from public school savings, and make significant expansions to the private school voucher system.
At 11:15 p.m. Monday, DeWine announced he approved the $60-billion Republican spending bill. At 2:15 a.m., he sent out his 67 line-item vetoes.
These are some of the major items he cut. This list is not exhaustive, but you can find the full veto list here.
Education
The governor has vetoed several major items under the education portion of the budget.
He cut a provision that would have required public libraries to place books referencing “sexual orientation or gender” in an area away from the public. This means that even books that reference a female character in the title could be blocked, according to a Northeast Ohio librarian.
This kind of proposal has been brought up in previous years as a way to categorize LGBTQ+ content as “harmful” to minors.
DeWine also cut a provision that would have taken away some of the school districts’ savings, capping the carryover revenue at 40% and requiring anything above that mark be refunded to taxpayers. This could have bankrupted districts and multiple schools, the Ohio Education Association told us.
DeWine vetoed a provision that would have allowed county budget commissions to unilaterally take money away from passed school levies if they find it “reasonably necessary.”
He removed a provision that would have required that emergency and substitute tax levies, incremental growth levies, conversion levies, and the property tax portion of combined income tax and property tax levies be included in the 20-mill floor calculation for school funding purposes.
He cut restrictions on the ability to put emergency levies on the ballot or request an increase to a current levy.
He vetoed what would have been a win for “school choice” proponents. The budget would have provided about $2.5 billion over the biennium for the state’s voucher system, providing taxpayer dollars for students to attend nonchartered nonpublic schools — ones that already don’t receive state or federal funding.
This includes a new education savings account program, or ESAs, which is a way for families to get state money to purchase “educational goods and services,” including tuition at nonchartered, nonpublic schools. He rejected this.
He removed an item that would have restricted the amount of money the state could award to the Ohio Higher Education Research Public Policy Consortium, which analyzes policy challenges and researches the state’s priorities.
He vetoed an item that would have allowed the legislature to choose where school funding goes based on compliance with the Ohio Senate Bill 1 higher education overhaul law.
He cut a provision that would have required partisan labels on school board candidates.
Children
He vetoed an item that would have restricted funding from youth homeless shelters if they supported transgender or nonbinary identities.
Also, a cut to a provision requiring teenagers under the age of 18 who have been tried and convicted as adults to be committed to a Department of Youth Services facility instead of a Department of Rehabilitation and Correction facility.
Health
He vetoed a provision that would have restricted Medicaid for babies ages 0-3. This would have repealed the requirement for Medicaid to allow parents of children under the age of four to stay enrolled in Medicaid through a federal waiver.
He removed a provision that requires Medicaid to randomly assign a managed care plan for all individuals who do not choose a specific managed care plan.
He cut an item that puts reporting requirements on entities participating in the federal 340B Drug Pricing Program.
He cut an item that would have stopped SNAP for “sugar-sweetened beverages.”
Due to a drafting error, he cut a provision that was intended to regulate the practice of pharmacy benefit managers in Ohio and the requirements for fair and transparent reimbursement for Ohio pharmacies.
He vetoed an item that would prevent the Ohio Department of Health from requiring soil evaluators or soil scientists to assess soil type and slope for Household Treatment Sewage Systems.
He cut a provision requiring a hospital with a maternity unit that accepts Medicaid to enter into a transfer agreement with any freestanding birthing center located within a 30-mile radius that requests one.
Land and energy
He vetoed a provision that would have put restrictions on what H2Ohio, DeWine’s clean water program, can do. It would have stopped their ability to use funds to purchase land or conservation easements.
He stopped an item that would have prevented state and local governments from using eminent domain to obtain property for the construction of recreational trails.
He cut an item that could have delayed the amount of time a lessee has to actually produce on a well and generate royalty payments for the state.
He removed a provision creating the Oil and Gas Resolution and Remediation Fund for the purposes of plugging orphaned oil and gas wells in the state.
He vetoed an item that prohibits the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, when contracting with a third party, from requiring dredge operators to hold any licenses, registrations, or certifications when dredging in waters of the state.
He cut a provision that makes certain electric transmission costs avoidable by customers who shop for their electric energy provider.
He removed an item that would have prohibited the Tax Credit Authority from entering into new computer data center sales and use tax exemption agreements.
Administrative
He vetoed a provision that would have required state employees to work in the office full time.
He cut an item that would have created the Election Integrity Unit within the Secretary of State’s Office and directed the Unit to investigate alleged violations of elections law.
He removed a provision limiting the types of flags permitted to be displayed on state-owned buildings and property to include only the Ohio flag, U.S. flag, POW/MIA flag, and flags of official state agencies as approved by the governor.
He cut an item that would prohibit local school boards from entering into supplemental benefit arrangements to pay employee contributions to the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio (STRS) on behalf of superintendents and principals.
Taxes
He vetoed a provision changing the tax structure surrounding marijuana sales. Currently, it is taxed through an excise tax; however, this item would have applied a sales tax to the excise tax.
He cut an item requiring Ashtabula County to repeal a 2% special lodging tax used to fund the costs of a convention center.
He vetoed a provision that would sunset the film and theater production tax credit program by prohibiting the award of the tax credit.
What is next?
The governor is holding a press conference to explain his decisions at 10 a.m. Tuesday.
Lawmakers have the opportunity to do line-item veto overrides, but that would require them to come back from break. Three-fifths of each chamber would be required to do so.

Health groups are warning that the revived proposal for a wood-burning plant in Springfield could roll back years of progress in fighting the high rates of asthma in the city.  
The post Health advocates warn proposed wood-burning plant in Springfield will worsen asthma rates appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","A PROPOSAL TO build a wood-burning power plant in Springfield is back in play after recent court rulings, but health advocates warn it could worsen the city’s already high asthma rates. 
Palmer Renewable Energy first proposed the project in 2008. The company received permits from the city and state to build a biomass power plant, but since then, advocates, residents, public health experts, local officials, and legislators have fought against the project. In spring 2021, Massachusetts’s Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) revoked its permit. Springfield officials argue the permits granted by the city have expired. However, a Superior Court judge ruled in January that the state-issued air permit is still valid, and the state Appeals Court ruled in May that the local building permits issued by the city are also valid. 
The rulings allow the company to move forward with the biomass power plant which would burn wood and other organic material for energy.  
The company can leverage a provision in the 2021 climate law that permits wood-burning power plants to sell renewable energy credits to municipal light plants beginning in 2026. While the state mandates that electric utilities source a certain percentage of their electricity from renewable energy, biomass power plants are not considered eligible under those rules. However, the 2021 law established a separate requirement for municipality-owned utilities, specifically including biomass as a qualifying clean energy source. 
The attorneys who represented Palmer Renewable Energy did not respond to a request for comment on the company’s court victories. 
Health advocates argued at a virtual event last week – organized by the Public Health Institute of Western Massachusetts, the Pioneer Valley Asthma Coalition, and the Healthy Air Network – that adding a biomass plant would roll back the progress that the city has made in reducing its asthma rates. 
Opponents of the project – represented by the Conservation Law Foundation – are appealing the decision to the Supreme Judicial Court. They are also advocating for a legislative change proposed by Sen. Adam Gomez of Springfield that would remove wood-burning plants from the state’s definition of non-carbon-emitting sources for municipal plants.  
Springfield was designated the “asthma capital” of the country in 2019 and had the fourth highest asthma rate in the nation in 2024, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.  
Gomez, who has opposed the project since he was a Springfield city councilor, called the inclusion of biomass in the 2021 law as a source of clean energy for municipal light plants a “loophole.” Emissions from a biomass plant are up to 2.8 times higher than emissions from sources like oil or coal. These types of power plants release harmful air pollutants like particulate matter and dioxins.  
Wood-burning plants have been pitched as a carbon-neutral energy source, based on the idea that any carbon released will be recaptured by new trees. However, scientists question whether this process is truly carbon neutral, since it can take decades for trees to grow enough to offset the carbon emissions. 
“If we don’t close the loophole, this polluting facility may finally have the financial lifeline it needs to become a reality, and we need to stop it now,” Gomez said at the event last week. “The bill is not just about words on a page; it’s about shutting off the flow of public dollars and clean energy subsidies to a facility that has no business being called green.” 
Gomez’s proposal is included in the larger energy affordability bill that Gov. Maura Healey proposed in May to lower energy costs across the state.  
Sarita Hudson, a senior director at the Public Health Institute of Western Massachusetts, said at the virtual event that Springfield has improved its air quality and asthma rates over the last 10 years, but that there are many reasons why Springfield tends to have bad air quality. The city has two major highways, industrial facilities, and hosted a fossil fuel-burning power plant up until 2022. And, because Springfield sits in a valley, air pollution gets trapped there. 
Springfield residents have been fighting the biomass plant ever since the project was proposed, according to Michael Fenton, Springfield’s city council president. “Our opposition has really been throughout all the decades,” he said.  
Gomez called the proposed facility a “zombie plant.” He said, “No matter how many times it’s defeated, it keeps coming back to life.”  
Springfield residents and advocates mobilized against the project as soon as the City Council first issued the special permit to Palmer in 2008. The council initially approved the permit because the power plant would bring 50 full-time jobs and up to $1 million in tax revenue for the city. The company also promised to provide other benefits to the city, such as $667,000 in infrastructure improvements and $25,000 for a “green energy education” program in public schools. 
After opposition to the power plant mounted, the city council in 2011 revoked the special permit for the biomass project, but the city’s building commissioner issued separate building permits that Palmer said were adequate for the project to move forward. In 2018, Palmer announced its intentions to break ground on the project, but the city, backed by the Zoning Board of Appeals, argued the permits had expired.  
This year, both the air and the building permits have been revived through the state’s Superior Court and Appeals Court decisions.  
“To be honest, I thought this issue was long gone,” said Gomez. “We’ve written letters, we’ve organized meetings, we’ve marched, we’ve testified, we’ve rallied, we’ve sued. … But now we find ourselves here once again facing the revived threat of the Palmer Renewable Energy Biomass Plant.”

(Photo by Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent/States Newsroom.)It seems little will change about the budget when it comes to child care, after Gov. Mike DeWine’s 67 total vetoes didn’t include changes specifically related to child care provisions.
The budget sent to DeWine by an Ohio General Assembly joint conference committee last week and signed at 11:15 p.m. on Monday brought back a cost-sharing model for child care, funded a subsidy program through federal dollars, and created a child care recruitment and mentorship grant program.
But it also held state-funded child care at current levels and changed the way in which child care providers are paid, in a way that advocates say will negatively impact the sector.
Early childhood advocacy group Groundwork Ohio said the budget secured “modest wins” but ultimately “fails to meet the moment for Ohio’s youngest.”
Lynanne Gutierrez, president and CEO of Groundwork said the organization is “hopeful that – even in a challenging fiscal and political environment – the final budget keeps Ohio moving with intention toward the goals set forth by Governor DeWine to improve outcomes for young children and families.”
But “the path forward is uncertain,” the group said in a statement.
“Without new action, Ohio will face a $600 million shortfall in child care funding next biennium as one-time federal dollars dry up,” the statement read.
Child care organizations across the state urged the governor over the last week to veto certain parts of the budget that they said would create even more challenges in a struggling child care sector.
“The governor has long styled himself as a man who defends children,” said Policy Matters Executive Director Hannah Halbert in a statement. “This bill harms them.”
Ohio House Republicans said the final budget draft would help more Ohioans cover the cost of child care services, and with increases in child development programs like Help Me Grow, would invest in “a system of supports for pregnant women, caregivers with new babies and families with young children with developmental delays and disabilities.”

Ohio House Democrats sent a letter to the governor on Friday discrediting the budget provisions related to child care, among other things.
“Instead of funding our public schools or helping parents afford child care or health care, or pay for groceries, diapers, rent, and any other costs, this budget prioritizes tax cuts for the wealthiest few and Medicaid cuts for babies and the elderly,” the letter stated.
Dr. John Stanford, state director for the Children’s Defense Fund, urged DeWine to use his vetoes to support children in several ways, including preserving Medicaid coverage for infants, safeguarding access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and rejecting Medicaid changes.
He said the budget as passed by the joint committee “sends a clear message to Ohio’s children and families: you are not the priority.”
DeWine did veto the legislature’s provision repealing continuous Medicaid coverage for children under the age of four, saying the the coverage “is consistent with the DeWine-Tressel Administration’s longstanding pro-life and pro-family agenda and is critical to making Ohio the best place in the nation to raise a family.”
“At a time when families are struggling to access child care, health coverage, poverty relief and safe housing, lawmakers have chosen to deliver tax breaks to the wealthy and handouts to stadium developers,” Stanford said in a statement. “This budget robs children of their chance to grow up with dignity, hope and joy.”
  What’s in the budget: Child care edition
Legislators left the Publicly Funded Child Care eligibility at 145% of the federal poverty level, something that had been high on advocates’ list of items to change.
Groundwork Ohio and other organizations had hoped to see that level increased to at least 160%, if not 200% of the poverty line, to allow Ohio to increase access to child care.
Keeping the eligibility at its current level leaves the state at one of the lowest eligibility levels in the country, according to experts and the leader of the Ohio Department of Children and Youth.
The Child Care Cred Program, a new provision that was originally a GOP-sponsored set of bills introduced in the last General Assembly and the current one, was included in the final draft of the budget.
The move in conference committee brought the program back, with a $10 million appropriation, after it had been removed by the Senate.
The program was presented as a way to begin the process of improving the child care system in Ohio by allowing costs to be shared among employers, employees and the state in a 40%-40%-20% split respectively.
Child care policy analysts in Ohio said the program had “lackluster” results in other states where it’s been attempted.
Also included in the budget was the DeWine-supported Child Care Choice Voucher Program, which originally was funded through just general revenue funds, but will now receive $50 million each over the next two years in federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant funds.
A grant program to support child care recruitment and mentorship will receive $1 million in 2026 and $1.85 million in 2027. But that’s a cut from the total of $3.2 million set aside in the House budget draft. The Senate had offered $2.75 million total in their version.
Two new provisions related to child care worker pay caused several advocates to plead for vetoes from the governor.
The conference committee inserted provisions in the Ohio Department of Children and Youth budget, which change the payment categories and time increments for Publicly Funded Child Care.
Under the budget bill, the categories would start with an “hourly” category of less than 10 hours a week of child care, a “part-time” category for between 10 and 33 hours per week, and a “full-time” category for providers giving more than 33 hours per week of child care.
Currently, hourly payments are made for child care of less than seven hours, part-time is considered between seven and 25 hours, and full-time is 25 to 60 hours per week.
“There would likely be a reduction in payments for those children served in modified categories,” the budget documents stated.
Advocates including Tamara Lunan, director of the Care Economy Organizing Project, which focuses its advocacy work on child care and early education, said not only will there be a reduction in payments, but the line item “will negatively impact an entire industry.”
“Small businesses live and die on cash flow,” Lunan said in a letter to DeWine asking for vetoes of the provisions. “…Indeed, it’s not hard to see why changing the hour categories in such a way may ultimately turn away children or cause other capacity issues simply due to the shift in value based on seemingly random threshold shifts.”
The second line-item revised family child care home rate payments, “aligning” licensed child care providers who serve seven to 12 children in their homes (Type A centers) with those who serve one to six children (Type B centers).
The changes from the two provisions “would force more providers out of business,” according to Policy Matters’ Halbert, and would “effectively eliminate the thousands of dollars that they put into their business expansions to be a larger provider,” Lunan said of Type A centers.
“We need more providers to expand – not contract – but this language disincentivizes home providers who have worked diligently to grow their businesses,” Lunan said.

Free.,US Senate after overnight debate unable to gain enough votes yet to pass GOP megabill,"Jennifer Shutt, Ashley Murray",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-after-overnight-debate-unable-gain-enough-votes-yet-pass-gop-megabill,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Republicans were in a holding pattern Tuesday morning, as party leaders struggled to find the votes needed to pass their “big, beautiful bill” following more than 24 hours of continuous debate.Whether the tax break and spending cuts package can move forward in its current form will likely come down to Maine Sen. Susan Collins and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, neither of whom has said publicly how they’ll vote.Kentucky’s Rand Paul and North Carolina’s Thom Tillis have already said they won’t approve the legislation, and with a narrow 53-seat majority, GOP leaders cannot afford both Collins and Murkowski to oppose the bill.

Murkowski and Majority Whip John Barrasso, of Wyoming, left the chamber to catch an elevator together just after 9:30 a.m. Eastern.Asked if the bill was in the hands of the parliamentarian, Murkowski quipped, ""I think it's in the hands of the people that operate the coffee machine.""Barrasso said ""Yes” when asked if it would pass this morning.Vice President JD Vance, who arrived at the Capitol building shortly after sunrise, can, if needed, break a 50-50 tie in favor of sending the measure to the House for final approval. If all four Republican senators vote no, leadership would have to go back to the drawing board on various policy changes in the bill. But any alterations directed at getting their votes could alienate other Republican senators, potentially further changing the whip count.Failing to pass the package sometime Tuesday or even Wednesday would likely lead to Republicans missing their self-imposed Fourth of July deadline for having the legislation to President Donald Trump for his signature.Trump weighs inTrump told reporters on Tuesday morning before leaving for a Florida visit to the “Alligator Alcatraz” immigrant detention site that “it's very complicated stuff” when asked about Senate Republicans’ debate over spending cuts.“We're going to have to see the final version. I don't want to go too crazy with cuts. I don't like cuts. There are certain things that have been cut, which is good. I think we're doing well,” Trump said. “We're going to have to see, it’s some very complicated stuff. Great enthusiasm as you know. And I think in the end we're going to have it.”The heart of the nearly 1,000-page legislation extends and expands the 2017 tax law to keep individual income tax rates at the same level and makes permanent some tax breaks on business investments and research and development costs.The bill would also put in motion some of Trump's campaign promises, including no tax on qualifying tips, overtime or car loan interest, but only for a few years.And it slashes spending on the Medicaid program for low-income people and some people with disabilities as well as shifting significant costs of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to states for the first time.Once the Senate passes the measure, it will have to go back to the House for a final vote, and even if that happens, approval is far from guaranteed.Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., can only lose four Republicans if all lawmakers in that chamber attend the vote. Several GOP members have voiced frustration with how the Senate has reworked the legislation, signaling an uphill climb for the bill.House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith said as he left the Senate cloakroom just after 9:20 a.m. Eastern that lawmakers are “getting closer to a bill signing on July Fourth.”“If you followed this journey over the last six months, over and over, people said that we could not accomplish a budget (reconciliation bill). We did. They said we would never pass it out of the House. We did. The Senate is going to pass it. The House is going to pass it, and the president's going to sign it into law,” the Missouri Republican said.Three amendments succeedThe Senate had adopted three amendments to the bill following an all-night amendment voting session, known as a vote-a-rama.Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn was able to remove language from the package that would have blocked state and local governments from regulating artificial intelligence for five years if they wanted access to a $500 million fund. That vote was 99-1 with only North Carolina’s Tillis voting to keep the language in the package.Blackburn said the change was necessary because lawmakers in Congress have “proven that they cannot legislate on emerging technology.”Senators approved an amendment from Iowa GOP Sen. Joni Ernst by voice vote that would disqualify “anyone making a million dollars or more from being eligible for unemployment income support.”Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy was able to get an amendment adopted by a voice vote that would move up the date when Medicaid administrators must begin checking the Social Security Administration’s death master file to determine if a new enrollee is alive before adding them to the health program. It was set to begin on Jan. 1, 2028, but will now begin one year earlier.Senators rejected dozens of amendments offered by both Democrats and Republicans, some of which deadlocked on 50-50 votes. Maine’s Collins and Alaska’s Murkowski broke with their party several times to vote with Democrats.National private school voucher programHawaii Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono tried to eliminate a sweeping private school voucher program that’s baked into the reconciliation package, but that vote failed 50-50. Collins, Nebraska Republican Sen. Deb Fischer and Murkowski voted in support.The original proposal called for $4 billion a year in tax credits beginning in 2027 for people donating to organizations that provide private and religious school scholarships.But the parliamentarian last week deemed the program to not comply with the “Byrd Bath,” a Senate process named for the late Sen. Robert Byrd, forcing senators to rework the program.Details on the finalized version of the program remain unknown as the final bill text has not been released.  Safety funding for Virginia airport across from DCVirginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner tried to add language to the bill that would have increased safety funding for airports near Washington, D.C., and established a memorial for the victims who died in a crash this January. The vote failed on a tied 50-50 vote, with Collins, Kansas GOP Sen. Jerry Moran and Murkowski voting with Democrats in support.“Colleagues, we all know that on January 29 of this year, 67 individuals lost their lives when a military helicopter and a passenger jet collided near Reagan National Airport. This tragedy underscores the need for more safety improvements at National Airport,” Warner said. “The reconciliation bill increases, actually doubles, the amount of rent that National and Dulles pay the government but doesn’t use any of that money to make those airports and the people who use them any safer.”He argued there was “no good rationale for increasing those rents and not using them for aviation safety.”Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz spoke against Warner’s amendment, saying the rents for the two airports in Virginia near the nation’s capital haven’t been updated in decades.“The federal government originally calculated the rent in 1987 at $7.5 million dollars, massively below market rates,” Cruz said. “This bill increases that to $15 million, still dramatically below market rates.”Cruz — chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation — said the legislation includes $12.5 billion for the Federal Aviation Administration to “transform the air traffic control system” and said his panel is looking into the collision in order to prevent something similar from happening again. Trump budget director’s office targetedMaryland Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen also got within one vote of having an amendment adopted when he tried to remove a section from the bill that would increase funding for the White House budget office by $100 million.“This is at a time when (Federal Emergency Management Agency) grants to many of our states have been canceled, grants for law enforcement have been frozen, grants for victims of crimes are on hold,” Van Hollen said. “That is not efficiency. That is creating chaos and uncertainty. And I ask my colleagues, why in the world would we want to send another $100 million to OMB?”Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson opposed the efforts, saying “the Office of Management and Budget needs to identify budgeting and accounting efficiencies in the executive branch. They need the resources to do it.”The amendment was not added to the bill following another tied 50-50 vote with Collins, Murkowski and Paul voting with Democrats in favor.Had GOP leadership wanted either of those proposals added to the package, they could have had Vance break the tie, but they did not.Collins loses vote on rural hospital fundMaine’s Collins tried to get an amendment added to the legislation that would have increased “funding for the rural health care provider fund to $50 billion dollars and expand the list of eligible providers to include not only rural hospitals but also community health centers, nursing homes, ambulance services, skilled nursing facilities and others.”Collins said the additional $25 billion in funding for the fund would be paid for by “a modest increase in the top marginal tax rate, equal to the pre-2017 rate for individuals with income above $25 million and married couples with income above $50 million.”Collins’ amendment was subject to a Senate procedural limit known as a budget point of order. She was unable to get the votes needed to waive that on a 22-78 vote.Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden spoke against Collins’ proposal, calling it “flawed,” and introduced the budget point of order against her amendment.“The danger Senate Republicans are causing for rural hospitals is so great, Republicans have had to create a rural hospital relief fund so they can look like they are fixing the problem they are causing,” Wyden said. “It is a Band-Aid on an amputation. It provides just a tiny fraction of the nearly $1 trillion in cuts the bill makes to Medicaid. It would be much more logical to simply not cut $1 trillion from Medicaid in the first place.”Collins received a mix of support from Republicans, including West Virginia Shelley Moore Capito, Louisiana’s Bill Cassidy, Utah’s John Curtis, Nebraska’s Fischer, South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham, Missouri’s Josh Hawley, Ohio’s Jon Husted and Bernie Moreno, Mississippi’s Cindy Hyde-Smith and Roger Wicker, Louisiana’s Kennedy, Kansans Roger Marshall and Moran, Kentucky’s Mitch McConnell, Alaskans Dan Sullivan and Murkowski and Indiana’s Todd Young.Also voting to waive the point of order and move forward with the amendment were Georgia’s Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock and Virginia’s Warner, all Democrats, and independent Maine Sen.

That is creating chaos and uncertainty. And I ask my colleagues, why in the world would we want to send another $100 million to OMB?”Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson opposed the efforts, saying “the Office of Management and Budget needs to identify budgeting and accounting efficiencies in the executive branch. They need the resources to do it.”The amendment was not added to the bill following another tied 50-50 vote with Collins, Murkowski and Paul voting with Democrats in favor.Had GOP leadership wanted either of those proposals added to the package, they could have had Vance break the tie, but they did not.Collins loses vote on rural hospital fundMaine’s Collins tried to get an amendment added to the legislation that would have increased “funding for the rural health care provider fund to $50 billion dollars and expand the list of eligible providers to include not only rural hospitals but also community health centers, nursing homes, ambulance services, skilled nursing facilities and others.”Collins said the additional $25 billion in funding for the fund would be paid for by “a modest increase in the top marginal tax rate, equal to the pre-2017 rate for individuals with income above $25 million and married couples with income above $50 million.”Collins’ amendment was subject to a Senate procedural limit known as a budget point of order. She was unable to get the votes needed to waive that on a 22-78 vote.Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden spoke against Collins’ proposal, calling it “flawed,” and introduced the budget point of order against her amendment.“The danger Senate Republicans are causing for rural hospitals is so great, Republicans have had to create a rural hospital relief fund so they can look like they are fixing the problem they are causing,” Wyden said. “It is a Band-Aid on an amputation. It provides just a tiny fraction of the nearly $1 trillion in cuts the bill makes to Medicaid. It would be much more logical to simply not cut $1 trillion from Medicaid in the first place.”Collins received a mix of support from Republicans, including West Virginia Shelley Moore Capito, Louisiana’s Bill Cassidy, Utah’s John Curtis, Nebraska’s Deb Fischer, South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham, Missouri’s Josh Hawley, Ohio’s Jon Husted and Bernie Moreno, Mississippi’s Cindy Hyde-Smith and Roger Wicker, Louisiana’s Kennedy, Kansans Roger Marshall and Moran, Kentucky’s Mitch McConnell, Alaskans Dan Sullivan and Murkowski and Indiana’s Todd Young.Also voting to waive the point of order and move forward with the amendment were Georgia’s Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock and Virginia’s Warner, all Democrats, and independent Maine Sen.

Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images. As you stare at Minnesota’s new state constellation, Ursa Minor, i.e., the Little Dipper, and consider the vast universe, you’ll also have to ponder this: The tax on your weed is going up. 
The constellation and cannabis tax hike are two of the new laws taking effect July 1. 
Most were passed during the marathon 2025 special session, which resulted in a $66 billion two-year budget, effective Tuesday, the first of the new fiscal year. It’s an 8% decrease from the previous two years, which were boosted by federal pandemic aid. 
Funding to schools will increase by 4.8% over the next two years, though the budget makes cuts to special education and other programs. 
The education budget allocates a one-time total of $55 million for state aid linked to low-income students and nearly $23 million for “Grow Your Own” programs that recruit local community members to increase teacher diversity. 
In anticipation of the projected 2028-2029 budget deficit, the Legislature decreased state reimbursement for special education student transportation. Federal law will require districts to make up the difference. 
After a years-long legislative battle, optometrists will now be able to perform some procedures previously reserved for ophthalmologists. 
The cannabis tax rate is increasing from 10% to 15%, nearly a month after Minnesota’s first cannabis license lottery, which is another step in the seemingly interminable process of non-tribal cannabis stores opening. 
Several new provisions will go into effect to address fraud, which has beset state government programs in recent years. A state agency can now withhold payments for up to 60 days if there is sufficient evidence of fraud; lawmakers expanded whistleblower protections for state employees; and staff who work in grants management will need new training. 
In lieu of more substantive regulations on homeowners’ associations — which have been repeatedly accused of slapping homeowners with giant, surprise bills — legislators created a community ombudsperson to mediate conflicts between HOAs and tenants. Good luck, though: The ombudsperson will not have the power to enforce any agreements.
Attention influencers! A new law will regulate when minors can appear in online content and how they get paid. It requires creators who post money-earning content with minors to compensate them using a trust account. Children under 14 are prohibited from appearing in more than 30% of a content creator’s videos. 
Some consumer products and other substances will now be exempt from regulations that prohibit PFAS. 
PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, were banned in most products because of the chemicals’ serious health impacts. The newly exempt items include internal components of products, children’s recreational vehicles such as electric bicycles, and firefighting foam in airport hangars. 
The state’s ban on lead was modified to exclude keys with lead that are sold before July 1, 2028 or have 1.5% or less lead by weight. The lead ban had set off a panic among small businesses, which said they couldn’t acquire keys under the old rules. 
New laws increase the penalties for assaulting a firefighter; extend the statute of limitations on arson; and add streetlights, among other items, to the crime of destruction of public utilities, in a bid to combat theft of copper wiring. 
Check your mirrors: Motorcycles can now drive between vehicles, including through traffic jams. 
Finally, about that new state constellation, Ursa Minor, also known as the Little Dipper. The North Star is located at the tip of the Little Dipper, making the constellation an apt choice for the “North Star State.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/weed-1.jpeg,,,2025-07-01 10:02:55.671349

Seven states have enacted bans on lab-grown meat. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Texas is the fifth state this year and seventh overall to ban lab-grown meat after Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed legislation temporarily prohibiting the sale of cell-cultured protein.
Selling lab-grown meat, which is produced by growing cells acquired from living animals in a controlled environment, will be subject to civil and criminal penalties under the new law.
It is set to go into effect in September and expires in two years.
“This ban is a massive win for Texas ranchers, producers, and consumers,” Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said in a statement following the bill’s passage. “Texans have a God-given right to know what’s on their plate, and for millions of Texans, it better come from a pasture, not a lab. It’s plain cowboy logic that we must safeguard our real, authentic meat industry from synthetic alternatives.”
Bill requiring lab-grown food to be clearly labeled advances in SC

Consumers interested in sustainable foods that avoid the slaughter of animals are driving the growing cultured meat industry.
The Texas beef industry supported the bill. The state leads the nation in cattle, contributing almost 15% of U.S. beef production, according to the Texas Department of Agriculture.
Texas joins Indiana, Mississippi, Montana and Nebraska in enacting new laws this year prohibiting the sale of lab-grown meat; Alabama and Florida did so last year. In March, the Oklahoma House approved a similar bill that later died in the Senate.
Rather than ban sales, South Carolina law requires clear labeling of any “artificial or cell-cultivated food product.” Gov. Henry McMaster signed the mandate into law in May after the legislation passed both chambers unanimously.
Supported by South Carolina farmers, the legislation expanded on existing state law that says cell-cultivated food can’t be labeled as “meat” or “clean meat.”
“At some point a chicken walks and clucks and does the things that chickens do,” state Sen. Everett Stubbs, R-Rock Hill, told his colleagues as the bill advanced in January. “Quite frankly, I have a problem with this product being labeled chicken.”
South Carolina law makes mislabeling the products punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 or up to a year in prison. Each package not clearly labeled is a separate offense.
Texas followed Indiana’s lead in making its ban last for two years, which Indiana legislators said would allow more time for research. The time limit also may mean the law is less likely to draw legal challenges.
Upside Foods, one of the companies federally approved to sell cultivated meat, sued Florida shortly after the state passed the country’s first lab-grown meat ban. That lawsuit is pending.
In 2023, the U.S. Department of Agriculture gave permission to two California-based companies to begin selling lab-produced chicken across the country. Their lab-grown chicken was briefly featured on the menu at two restaurants that same year.
Although cultivated meat isn’t sold in stores yet, some research suggests it could be better for the environment compared with traditional meat production.
But other research suggests lab-grown meat’s environmental impact could be higher than retail beef based on current production methods.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)President Donald Trump’s energy emergency declaration, enacted through a Jan. 20 executive order, has drawn frequent criticism from environmentalists who argue the order serves as a front to expand the use of fossil fuels over clean energy resources. Now 15 states, including Maine, are suing the Trump administration, arguing the emergency order could bring them serious harm.
The states, each represented by Democratic attorneys general, brought action on behalf of their residents and natural resources, arguing the federal government’s use of emergency permitting procedures bypass critical ecological, historical and cultural resource reviews.
“The Executive Order is unlawful, and its commands that federal agencies disregard the law and in many cases their own regulations to fast-track extensive categories of activities will result in damage to waters, wetlands, critical habitat, historic and cultural resources, endangered species, and the people and wildlife that rely on these precious resources,” the lawsuit reads.
In response to a request for comment from Michigan Advance, White House Assistant Press Secretary Taylor Rogers reiterated the administration’s position.
“In the best interest of our economic and national security, President Trump declared a National Energy Emergency to save America’s energy industry stifled by Joe Biden’s radical climate agenda. Democrat State Officials can cry about our energy dominance while the rest of the country celebrates the lowest gas prices since 2021,” Rogers said.
While the suit acknowledges the need for infrastructure to support a reliable and affordable energy supply for the states and the nation, it argues the president’s powers are reserved for actual emergencies, noting earlier in the complaint that energy production in the U.S. is at an all time high and growing.

The shortcuts inherent in these powers undermine the rights of the states, the complaint argues, noting the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer’s regulations only authorize “emergency procedures” when normal procedures would result in unacceptable hazard to human life, significant loss of property, or immediate, unforeseen, and significant economic hardship. Federal agencies to date have limited emergency procedures to necessary projects during, or in the aftermath of natural or human-made disasters, according to the complaint.
To prevent any potential harm, the plaintiff states asked the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington to declare the executive order unlawful and bar federal agencies from pursuing emergency permitting on non-emergency projects.
The states other than Maine filing the lawsuit include Arizona, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.

(Photo: U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Assistance)Seventeen statewide anti-domestic and sexual violence coalitions have asked a Rhode Island federal judge to halt the Trump administration’s new restrictions for grants administered by an office within the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) under the Violence Against Women Act.
The request comes as part of a lawsuit led by the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence challenging the legality of the DOJ’s efforts to withhold funding awarded through its Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) in order to advance the administration’s priorities on gender ideology, DEI and immigration.
The lawsuit was filed on June 16 by lawyers representing the ACLU of Rhode Island and the Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, as well as Democracy Forward, Jacobson Lawyers Group, and the National Women’s Law Center. The case was assigned to Senior District Judge William E. Smith in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island.
The Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence is made up of 10 agencies and has received grants from OVW for over two decades. Brianna Henries, spokesperson for the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence deferred comment to Democracy Forward.
“By forcing providers to choose between certifying compliance with unlawful conditions or giving up federal funding needed to help keep their communities safe, the Trump administration is holding funding hostage in an effort to force service providers to bend to the administration’s anti-DEI, anti-immigrant, and anti-trans goals,” Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, said in a statement. “This is unlawful and threatens important programs preventing domestic violence and sexual assault and supporting survivors.”
The lawsuit comes as the Trump administration has proposed a 29% cut to the OVW program’s funding in its fiscal year 2026 budget request.
Under new DOJ guidelines, organizations cannot use federal funds for research projects, promoting or facilitating violations of federal immigration law, programs that discourage cooperation with law enforcement, or initiatives that promote gender ideology.
Organizations are also prohibited from engaging in “activities that frame domestic violence or sexual assault as systemic social justice issues rather than criminal offenses.”
According to the lawsuit, the DOJ has started demanding that grant recipients certify they are complying with the conditions and could be subject to substantial penalties under the federal False Claims Act if they do not comply. Penalties include the potential withholding of funds, contract termination with the federal government and criminal prosecution.
Attorneys for the ACLU and the coalition claim such demands by the administration violate the Administrative Procedure Act, which prohibits “arbitrary and capricious” federal agency actions. They also argue the alleged quid-pro-quo for funding violates the First Amendment by “seeking to silence disfavored speech.”
“The new funding conditions are unconstitutional several times over,” the 49-page memo for the preliminary injunction states.
The grants were created under the Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 and the Violence Against Women Act to help organizations that support victims through legal services, housing assistance and crisis counseling.
According to the lawsuit, added funding conditions force organizations into an “impossible” choice: give up crucial support or comply with rules that contradict their values and legal responsibilities.



North Carolina impact
The complaint states that the Durham-based North Carolina Coalition Against Domestic Violence has been receiving grant funding of the kind endangered by the new Trump administration rules for a quarter-century. According to the lawsuit:
“The North Carolina Coalition has received a Coalition Grant each year since at least 2001 and is currently operating under the FY24 Coalition Grant, which provides a total of $113,574 through September 30, 2025.”
The suit notes further that the North Carolina group has also received (and intends to apply going forward) for the Department of Justice’s Office on Violence Against Women’s Disability Grant and Rural Program Grant — both of which are subject to the new administration grant conditions.

$1 million in grants awarded to Rhode Island annually
The Rhode Island Coalition has an annual budget of roughly $5.3 million, of which approximately $3.4 million is passed through to member agencies. Roughly $1 million of that comes from Office on Violence Against Women grants, the coalition’s executive director, Lucy Rios, stated in an affidavit.
Federal grants and contracts accounted for 79% of the coalition’s revenue, according to its annual report.
The coalition has received grant funding in various program categories every year since at least 2001. It has sought training and technical assistance grants and other competitive discretionary grants, including $114,533 awarded for the period Oct. 1, 2024, through Sept. 30, 2025. The lawsuit was filed ahead of a June 25 deadline to apply for a fiscal 2025 training and technical assistance grant that was anticipated in the amount of $113,574.
Rhode Island received $550,000 from the OVW in 2022 to create a safe visitation and exchange program for domestic violence survivors and their children — along with LGBTQ-related advocacy. The coalition also received a $350,000 grant to educate young men — particularly youth of color and immigrant communities — on the crimes of domestic and dating violence.
The coalition sought to continue the programs with additional grant funding, along with $900,000 to be used toward identifying potential high-risk cases for supervision and monitoring, according to the affidavit.
“Without access to this funding, vital programs that keep Rhode Islanders safe and keep our state at the forefront of addressing domestic violence are at risk, including RI’s first Safe Exchange and Supervised Visitation Center for families experiencing domestic violence,” Rios said in a June 16 statement. “We strive to be as courageous and resilient as the survivors in our communities as we stand up to protect the safety net for victims and infrastructure for prevention that we have been collectively building for nearly 50 years.”
A spokesperson for the DOJ’s Office on Violence Against Women did not immediately respond to request for comment.
The group of state domestic violence and sexual assault coalitions includes the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence; California Partnership to End Domestic Violence; Colorado Coalition Against Sexual Assault; DC Coalition Against Domestic Violence; End Domestic Abuse Wisconsin: The Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence; Idaho Coalition Against Sexual and Domestic Violence; Iowa Coalition Against Domestic Violence; Jane Doe Inc.

The group’s $238,700 contract to conduct an economic-impact study will help the state determine “whether or when the state will be required to issue additional cannabis facility licenses and, if so, how many, where, and of what type,” according to a March press release from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.
Currently, Missouri allows only the minimum number of cannabis licenses required by the constitutional amendments that legalized medical and, subsequently, recreational marijuana for adults.
As a result, the department has issued nearly 400 licenses for cultivation, manufacturing facilities and dispensaries. There are, for example, 24 dispensary licenses of each type in each of the state’s eight congressional districts. Some operators have medical and adult-use licenses for the same location.
The state will also eventually have 144 microbusiness licenses, which are limited in size and scope and meant to benefit disadvantaged business owners. 
In 2024, Missouri recorded $1.46 billion in total marijuana sales in the state’s second year of adult-use marijuana, outperforming states with a longer history of marijuana legalization like Arizona, Colorado and Nevada.
“As it relates to cannabis markets, Missouri is pretty famously the model to follow,” Mackenzie Slade, the group’s CEO and owner, told The Independent in April. “So I’m very interested in doing a super deep dive.”
  Mackenzie Slade is owner of New York-based Cannabis Public Policy Consulting LLC, which Missouri contracted to study the state’s marijuana industry. (Screenshot of a Maryland cannabis report Slade authored.)
Three companies were vying for the contract this spring. One applicant, Oregon-based Whitney Economics, conducts cannabis studies globally but failed to meet one of the requirements regarding managers, according to the state’s bid evaluation. 
The other was St. Louis-based Capital Consulting Services, a certified Missouri minority-owned business enterprise, that has helped governments with economic feasibility studies for 15 years on a state and federal level.  The group submitted a higher bid of $360,000 than Slade’s company and didn’t have as much experience studying cannabis markets.
Founded in 2019, Cannabis Public Policy Consulting is a “100% woman-owned collective of researchers, data scientists, public health professionals, and policy experts working together toward a unified goal: to bring much-needed data, innovation, and nuance to cannabis research and policymaking,” the contract states.
Before becoming an independent LLC, the group worked together as a consulting team incubated by Advocates for Human Potential, Inc. and have produced similar market reports for about 12 cannabis regulatory agencies over the last six years, the contract states. That includes the states of Maine, Maryland, Virginia, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Michigan and Utah.
“For a dozen government contracts, CPPC has performed the exact same scope of services as outlined in the RFP; supply and demand assessments and predictive modeling,” it states. 
Slade’s company administers a national survey on cannabis use, which essentially measures and quantifies demand behavior for consumers. One of the things that they use it for, she said, at a national level is to try to understand how states are performing based on their policies. 
“And Missouri continuously outperforms other states, relative to their date of sale,” she told The Independent. “…because they were able to stand up a market so quickly.”
That was in part, she said, because Missouri limited the number of licenses to get operational within just a few months. For the study, Slade proposed to use the state’s track and trace data to identify the efficiencies of the licenses. 
“That’s a prime example of where we would uncover some extremely important considerations for policy,” she said. “And I do believe that the intent of the study is to identify areas of policy that need to be updated.”
Experts generally agree that Missouri’s decision to only issue the minimum licenses allowed under the constitution has been the key to the industry’s boom. However, critics have long argued that the decision created a monopoly that’s kept out opportunities for people who were most impacted by the War on Drugs. While the microbusiness license program was included in the 2022 constitutional amendment to address inequities, the limitations on what these businesses can do make it difficult to turn a profit. 
If the department does issue additional licenses, at least half of those licenses must be awarded to owners of cannabis microbusiness facilities that have been operational for at least a year.
The study will also provide information regarding the overall economic stability of the regulated market, including strengths and risks, with a special emphasis on the market’s impact on economically distressed areas of the state, according to the state’s press release.  
The Constitution requires the department to develop a plan to “promote and encourage ownership and employment in the marijuana industry by people from political subdivisions and districts that are economically distressed.” 
“The study will provide information,” the release states, “relevant to creating and implementing such a plan.”

Jason Morgan (D-Ann Arbor) speaks during a community roundtable discussion on transgender issues at First Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Ann Arbor on June 30, 2025 | Photo by Anna Liz Nichols/Michigan AdvanceWhile the current political ecosystem has created a lot of fear and feelings of hopelessness in the transgender community, now is not the time to recoil or stay quiet, Michigan lawmakers and members of the LGBTQ+ community said during a community roundtable event in Ann Arbor Monday.
Lyra Opalikhin, 21, of Lansing said it’s important that lawmakers in Michigan take the time to look members of the transgender community in the eye and share what they’re doing to combat legislation and policies that threaten the community’s ability to exist in public life.
Opalikhin spoke after the roundtable event at First Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Ann Arbor.
In the first months of his administration, President Donald Trump issued executive orders mandating the federal government define “sex’ as solely “biologically male” and “biologically female”, banning service members who are transgender from the military, threatening federal funding for organizations that provide gender affirming care, as well as organizations that allow women and girls who are transgender on female sports teams.
Michigan has several bills that have been introduced this term that aim to ban gender affirming care for kids, not allow transgender students to use the bathrooms aligned with their identity at school and bar girls who are transgender from competing on girls sports teams.
Trump’s executive orders, and the ant-trans bills going through Michigan’s state legislature, are presented as issues of safety, to protect people, but that’s not their true goal, Opalikhin said.
“These policies are not being passed to protect individuals or to serve other individuals. They are being passed just to further restrict the trans community from public life and to restrict them from being able to live their lives to the extent that other people do,” Opalikhin said.

During the discussions with state lawmakers, Opalikhin said the inability for transgender individuals to exist in public spaces was a consistent one, where it’s clear that each policy limiting life for the transgender community is an attempt to erase the community.
But one of the best ways to rail against erasure is to provide the transgender community time and space to share their stories, Bree Taylor, founder of the Trans Unity Coalition said following the discussions.
“Let me talk about myself, let me talk about how I am transgender, but I’m also the other things. I am a self trained mechanic. I have a very loving boyfriend, and I have a dog and a cat,” Taylor said. “Let people talk to you about what being trans means. Let them talk about their story of who they are.”

Attacks on the transgender community have become a lightning rod issue, where some Democrats either remain silent or abandon their transgender constituents all together as defending transgender rights isn’t always popular, Rep. Jason Morgan (D-Ann Arbor) said.
In March, eight Democrats in Michigan’s state House joined Republicans in supporting a resolution to implore the Michigan High School Athletic Association to comply with Trump’s executive order mandating a ban on male athletes from competing on female sports teams. The Democrats voting yes were Alabas Farhat (D-Dearborn), Peter Herzberg (D-Westland), Tullio Liberati (D-Allen Park), Denise Mentzer (D-Mount Clemens), Reggie Miller (D-Van Buren Township), Will Snyder (D-Muskegon), Angela Witwer (D-Delta Township) and Mai Xiong (D-Warren).

Michigan’s transgender community is under attack now more than ever, Morgan said at the roundtable event Monday, and as lawmakers, there’s a need to do a lot more listening to the community.
“They want to demoralize us. They want to tear us apart… and divide us, and we have to make sure that we do not let them divide us to the point that we aren’t fighting together for the causes of basic human dignity and human rights for the trans community and others,” Morgan said.
One of the topics for conversation Monday was how members of the transgender community can balance the value of telling their stories with the necessity for personal safety, and Rep. Morgan Foreman (D-Pittsfield Twp.) took a moment to acknowledge how helpless and scared some people in the room might be feeling.
Rest is important, love is important, Foreman said, and understanding that members of the community and allies might need to take breaks in the fight to protect transgender rights, serves as a reminder that people are stronger together.
“I think that is the most important thing to share right now, is hope, that there are people that are fighting, there are people who are working, there are people who are trying to make sure that the right things are done. So we don’t repeat history. I see the patterns are there, and it’s scary,” Foreman said. “There were so many times where people felt like the world was ending in the generations that are in this room. And the world did end, but it also changed. It transformed.”
In Michigan, where the state Senate is currently controlled by Democrats and Governor Gretchen Whitmer is a Democrat and vocal proponent for transgender rights, legislators can overlook the need to inform constituents of the legislative threats to transgender residents, Rep. Jimmie Wilson Jr. (D-Ypsilanti) said.
“We get so caught up in our Lansing bubble that we’re not always keeping the folks informed of what’s moving, what’s been introduced,” Wilson said. “And even though we have a lot of stop gaps in place to not pass bad legislation, folks still need to know what is being introduced and what is passing at least one chamber, just so they know what’s on the horizon and what could happen, not necessarily as a scare tactic, but we need to know where we need to be advocating and where we need to be fighting and why elections matter moving forward.”

Not talking about bills that pose threats to transgender residents because of the idea that they won’t pass and they don’t really matter, is counterintuitive to what it means to be an ally, Opalikhin said, and the idea that all Democrats will stand up for transgender rights has been proven wrong by some Democrats in Michigan’s Legislature.
It is a scary time right now for transgender Michiganders, Opalikhin said, but there is hope to be found in community and working across identities, with intersectionality, to uplift members of diverse groups of people in the state. 
“Trans people are suffering right now, but so are immigrants, so are Black individuals. There are so many different groups under attack right now, and it’s important for us to also be able to work together across identities and to try to solve these problems as a united front,” Opalikhin said. “If we are just splintered and fractured, focusing on our own individual issues without paying attention to other issues that are going on, it’s going to be harder to get things done.”

(Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)As many Alaska school districts grapple with steep budget deficits, and in the wake of Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s partial veto of an increase to per-student funding, the Alaska State Legislature has launched a joint bipartisan task force to focus on education funding.
The Legislature approved a $700 increase per student to the funding formula, but earlier this month the governor vetoed more than $50 million in education-related funding from the state’s budget, including a portion of the per-student increase, pushing it down to $500 per student.
Some lawmakers and education officials have expressed outrage and disappointment at the governor’s budget cuts, with leadership of both the House and Senate promising to hold a vote to override the budget veto to partially restore funding to schools, in the first five days of the January 2026 session. The Legislature previously overrode Dunleavy’s veto of a separate bill that enshrined the $700 increase as policy in state law; it required funding in the budget bill to put the increase into practice.
In the meantime, the task force, created by House Bill 57, will look at a wide range of financial challenges and school policies. It’s charged with making recommendations before the 35th Alaska State Legislature convenes in January 2027.
“This is a ‘yes, and’ moment,” said task force co-chair Rep. Rebecca Himschoot, I-Sitka, in a phone interview.  “Is there a way by looking more globally at issues, that we can help contain some of those rising costs that districts have? But the fact remains that we haven’t given a significant increase to education in over 10 years.”

Education funding has been at the heart of Alaska’s ongoing political and financial debates among Dunleavy and the Legislature — as well as school officials, families and local municipalities — around state funding, policy changes, and how to improve students’ performance and learning outcomes. In a short video released the day of the line-item budget veto, Dunleavy cited declining state revenues and repeated his conviction that increasing education funding will not necessarily improve outcomes without policy changes. 
The joint task force is set to start work in August, Himschoot said, and will not only look at how the state funds school districts, but also how it can address rising costs of transportation, energy, health insurance and school maintenance. 
“We’re seeing double-digit increases in insurance costs, we’re seeing double-digit increases in energy costs. Is there something we can do to either arrest those increases, or a separate funding stream we should use?” she said.
“There’s been a lot of interest in trying to create some sort of an insurance pool to help with those costs,” she said, adding of the task force’s goals: “In general, examine the big picture to try to get down to that, so to speak, smaller picture of the annual funding cycle.”
Himschoot said solutions will vary as widely as Alaska’s 54 school districts, and the task force can take time on issues not afforded during the fast-paced legislative session. 
“We can tweak individual levers of funding during the session. We can look at how we’re funding career and technical education and say, ‘We want to fund it more. We want to fund it less. We want to use this other mechanism or this other fund source,’” she said. “So by doing this work during the interim over the next two years, it gives us time to ask questions, which often lead to more questions, and during the session, it can be very difficult, on a very tight timeline, and bring in all the different perspectives that need to be heard.”
The task force is planning to meet monthly and meetings will be open to the public, Himschoot said. “It’s super important that this is a process that anyone and everyone can participate in,” she said. “That’s the only way that it has any real value.”
Republican member Sen. Mike Cronk, a former teacher and representative for the large Interior District R that includes nine school districts, said he sees participation from school officials as mandatory. “I’ve already talked to numerous superintendents in my district, and I am going to require some of their input on certain things, because they’re the experts,” he said, in a phone interview. “I believe that’s the buy-in. I don’t believe ‘legislators’ singular, should be making these decisions. We need buy-in from everybody.”

Cronk said he wants the task force to create an ongoing, stable fiscal plan for funding schools. 
“We’re spinning our wheels. We just continue to not actually solve anything as a Legislature. We just prolong it to the next year, and the next year,” he said, after five years in the Legislature. “So that’s my desire, is to make sure that we have a fiscal plan in place where, if education needs more funding, we have the ability to get that. Or if roads need more attention, we have the ability to get more funding for that versus this. Just, ‘hey, oil prices are great, we could fund everything.’ Or ‘oil prices aren’t so good. Oh boy, we’re in a crisis situation.’ We shouldn’t be there. We should be working together, you know, for the betterment of Alaska.” 
Cronk said he understands the governor’s concerns but disagreed with his partial veto of the school funding increase. “I respect the governor: He’s a separate office than the Legislature, so he has the ability to make decisions what he feels best, you know, and I feel the more we respect that, the better off we’ll all be working together,” he said. “But again, the override vote of the initial bill, I think, was pretty strong and showed that for the most part, most of us supported the increase.”
The task force will also examine student performance and accountability measures, including absenteeism, as well as policy changes sought by the governor throughout the session, like open enrollment, easing the application process for charter schools, and reading incentive grants. 
Cronk said he’s open to looking at all policy changes to improve outcomes. “It’s not just straight up, how do we fund better? It’s, ‘How do we make our education system better for all students?’ So that’s what I hope to focus on,” he said. 
Task force member Rep. Justin Ruffridge, R-Soldotna, said he’s interested in looking at the school funding formula. “So from some of the issues in the formula itself, like school size factor and district cost factor, which some of those haven’t been updated in decades, as well as some of the issues from the federal government, things like the disparity test,” he said, referring to the state failing a federal test and now proposing capping local municipalities’ contributions to their schools.

“A task force is well suited to come out with some recommendations,” he said. “I think that we also need to discuss accountability measures, so things like testing, how we test, how we talk about testing … open enrollment, how does that affect Alaska schools? How does it affect military bases? There’s a lot that we have to look at.”
Ruffridge said he’s also focused on teacher recruitment and retention, and incentives for local residents to become certified teachers. “So developing an apprenticeship track to be engaged with teachers, and really growing some of our teachers in their homes and in their communities, I think, is a really good idea,” he said. 
He and Cronk both said they hope the task force will be less of a political and more of an advisory body, “where … you take the time to understand these deeper, complex funding elements or other policy measures and bring forward a draft recommendation of ways that we could make things better — and then that would need to go through the political process,” Ruffridge said. “So, trying to be a little more apolitical.”
The task force also includes co-chair Sen. Löki Tobin, D-Anchorage; Sen. Jesse Kiehl, D-Juneau; and Rep. Andi Story, D-Juneau.
Many school districts are facing millions in budget shortfalls, and with Dunleavy’s budget veto, school boards are going back into budget meetings this summer to make further cuts to programs and staff.
Himschoot addressed criticism of the Legislature not calling an emergency special session this summer to override the line-item veto, saying some legislators are out of the country and unavailable and there is more of a possibility of having the votes to override in January. 
“So the problem is, can we get everyone together? And if we do, will their votes hold? We know for sure we can get everyone together in January. We don’t know that we’ll have the votes, not now and not in January,” she said. “And so we are working on it.”
The task force will present recommendations in a report on the first day of the January 2027 session, the same month the task force sunsets.

Last week Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a state budget deal with the caveat that the Legislature would also advance trailer bills intended to speed up housing development in California. The governor signed those measures Monday (more on that later), signaling a major change in the state’s 54-year-old environmental law. 
The California Environmental Quality Act, or CEQA, requires government agencies to review and disclose the environmental impact of any public project, including new housing developments. The new changes to the landmark law would affect the state in two key ways:

Urban housing: For years pro-development advocates and the building industry argued that neighborhood groups and environmentalists wielded CEQA to delay or halt new development. Now, a large portion of urban “infill” housing developments — housing built in and around existing development — will no longer be subject to the law. That means developers won’t have to research or mitigate the ways new construction could impact local traffic, pollution, noise levels and other environmental factors. Though some housing experts say removing delays that would have previously existed under CEQA is significant, it’s too soon to guarantee that development in California will accelerate. Other factors, such as rising labor costs, tariffs and permitting processes can also slow down construction. Read more from CalMatters’ Ben Christopher.


High-tech facilities: Critics of the CEQA changes are also slamming exemptions for high-tech manufacturing sites, which they say would make it easier for companies to build industrial projects in low-income communities already struggling with pollution. Democratic Sen. María Elena Durazo of Los Angeles, for example, cited the extensive cleanup efforts of lead-contaminated soil stemming from a battery recycling facility in Vernon. But Sen. Scott Wiener, a proponent of the CEQA changes, said the exemptions would help attract more companies, such as computer chip makers. Said the San Francisco Democrat: “These are jobs of the future … and I want them to be in California.” Read more from CalMatters’ Alejandro Lazo and Rachel Becker.

CA budget deal wraps up

From CalMatters Capitol reporter Alexei Koseff:
Newsom, ‘Yes In My Backyard’ lawmakers and the carpenters union took a victory lap Monday evening as Newsom signed a pair of bills that will streamline environmental reviews for many housing and infrastructure projects in California. The governor demanded that the state’s entire $321 billion budget — which he signed on Friday — could not take effect without the proposals. 
They received his approval just hours before the start of the new fiscal year on July 1, at a signing conference where Newsom touted the changes as necessary to get California building again or risk losing the trust of the public: “We needed to go bold and big on this Holy Grail reform,” he said.
More budget news: As part of labor deal negotiations with some public employee unions this year, Newsom’s office is pausing state spending toward health care benefits these workers receive in retirement, reports CalMatters’ Adam Ashton.
With the price tag of $85 billion, retirement health care benefits serve as one of the state’s largest long-term debts. By pausing pre-funding payments for two years for current workers, the state would save more than $700 million in the new budget year, according to Newsom’s office.
Since workers in these unions also won’t have to contribute toward their retirement health care for that time period, the move would also boost their take home pay by as much as 4.5%.

Protecting and paying young athletes 🏈

Some changes could be on the way for California sports:

Youth football helmets: A year after Newsom vetoed a bill that would have banned kids younger than 12 from playing tackle football, the Legislature is considering a bill to prohibit youth tackle football leagues from banning “soft-shelled add-ons on football helmets” that are intended to prevent concussions. According to the bill’s author, Assemblymember Avelino Valencia, an Anaheim Democrat and former college football player, the proposal tries “to make the game as safe as possible, while also providing the opportunity for parents and young people to play this game if they so choose.” Read more from CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow.


Paying college athletes: As part of a class-action lawsuit that takes effect today, California’s top universities can begin paying their athletes directly. Previously, student athletes were paid by third parties, such as a company, for their “name, image and likeness.” But in an unprecedented shift that further blurs the line between amateur and professional players, a school would be able to pay a total of $20.5 million this year to any or all of its athletes. Some student athletes at UC Berkeley, for example, could make more than $200,000 a year. Read more from CalMatters’ Adam Echelman.

Don Bacon confirmed Monday he would not seek reelection in 2026. (Courtesy of Harding campaign) LINCOLN — Republican Omaha City Council Vice President Brinker Harding jumped into Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District race Tuesday to be the GOP nominee. 
“I’m running for Congress to make America more like its heartland,” Harding said. “I want to take those good things we do in Omaha, like balancing the budget, [having] record low crime, [and] a strong economy and take that to Washington and be successful.”

He is the first Republican to announce a bid on the GOP side after U.S. Rep. Don Bacon confirmed Monday he would not seek reelection in 2026 — with more expected in the coming weeks. 
Harding has been a part of the Omaha City Council since 2017 after serving as chief of staff and director of economic development for former Omaha Mayor Hal Daub, highlighting city projects like the Dodge Expressway and Riverfront Parks. The councilman touted having cut the property tax levy three times.
Harding’s campaign set four pillars: Restore America, Grow America, Secure America and Renew America. His campaign says he wants to “stop reckless spending that fuels inflation and threatens Social Security & Medicare.” It also says he wants to “cut taxes for working families and small businesses,” “finish the wall and enforce immigration laws” and “reignite faith in the American Dream for the next generation.” 
He said he built his platform to broadly appeal to Republicans, Democrats and nonpartisans. 
“Who wouldn’t be for those good-paying jobs or growing the economy?” Harding asked. 
But Harding said his first focus is on winning the GOP primary and securing the nomination. Harding said he would probably be like Bacon in “many ways,” but they have differences of opinion on many issues, saying he persuaded a Democrat to back him for a leadership role on the council.
“I appeal to a broad spectrum and factions of the party,” Harding told the Examiner. “But at the same time, I don’t sell out my values to gain that support.”
His campaign rolled out a launch video Tuesday that nods to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogans, including making sure the next 250 years of America is a “new golden age.” The video also mentions the recent Los Angeles protests over U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in the city and the recent winner of the New York Democratic mayoral primary — self-described democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani.
“What do we want  our next 250 years to look like?” Harding asked. “Do we want to be California or New York … or do we want to be more like America’s heartland?” 
Nebraska U.S Rep. Don Bacon announces he won’t run again in NE-02

Harding’s announcement touted high-profile endorsements from U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, a close friend of Bacon’s, former Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman, a fellow former Daub staffer, and State Sen. Kathleen Kauth, a Millard-area conservative who might be in line to run for speaker of the Legislature. He also has the endorsement of Daub, who represented the 2nd District in the 1980s. 
Harding emphasized his long roots in NE-02, which includes all of Douglas and Saunders Counties and parts of suburban Sarpy County.
The district is the state’s most politically diverse and competitive — and could prove one of Congress’ most expensive races in the 2026 midterms. 
Other Republicans considering bids include former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom, Bacon’s 2024 GOP primary challenger, Dan Frei and former chairman of the Nebraska Federation of Young Republicans, Chris Chappelear. 
A group of Democrats is already jockeying for the nomination. Omaha political action committee co-founder and business owner Denise Powell and State Sen. John Cavanaugh have announced bids. Democrats Mark Johnston and Evangelos Argyrakis also are running. Another potential Democratic candidate, Douglas County District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades, has said she is considering a House bid.
Harding expressed confidence in his ability to win the primary, partly because he has spent weeks assembling an experienced team that includes political and campaign veterans who have worked with Bacon and Fischer. 
“We will be the hardest working, the most organized, and we will win, not only the primary, but we will win the general election come next November,” Harding said.

Lawmakers left it out of the state budget they passed Monday.","In summary
California’s excise tax on legal weed is increasing, despite efforts to keep it lower to help the struggling industry. Lawmakers left it out of the state budget they passed Monday.


A substantial tax hike for California’s faltering legal cannabis market is set to take effect today, despite an aggressive industry campaign to suspend the increase that won the support of Gov. Gavin Newsom and other political leaders.
The excise tax for weed is 19% as of July 1, up from 15% — the result of a political deal three years ago that was intended to buy more time for the legal market to stabilize but which cannabis business operators now warn could chase away customers and push them over the edge.
“I’ve never experienced collective malaise like this,” said Genine Coleman, founder of the Origins Council, which represents small farmers in the historic Northern California growing region known as the Emerald Triangle. “People are so concerned with their survival and so deflated. It’s a dangerous space.”
An excise tax is a levy imposed on a good by the state before sales taxes are applied. While a push to freeze the cannabis excise tax through the state budget failed last month, a bill that would lower the rate back to 15% for the next six years is still moving through the Legislature. Newsom has pledged to sign a proposal halting the tax increase if it reaches his desk.
“I’m intimately familiar with the conversations around that and have great confidence that we’ll achieve our stated goals,” Newsom said during a press conference Monday.
Cannabis growers, dispensary owners and consumer advocates rallied for months at the state Capitol to avert the tax increase, which they argue could deal a fatal blow to businesses already operating with slim margins.
The price of weed has plummeted since voters legalized recreational cannabis through Proposition 64 in 2016, the result of a rush to overproduction even as most cities and counties in the state remain closed off to retail sales. Meanwhile, California is struggling to bring its market out of the shadows; the state Department of Cannabis Control estimates that legal sales still comprise less than 40% of weed consumption in California, which the industry attributes to state and local excise and sales taxes that can increase prices for consumers by a third.
Taxable cannabis sales in California dropped to $1.09 billion for the first quarter of 2025, down 30% from their peak in early 2021 and the lowest quarterly sales in five years.
Tax was intended to offset cannabis harms
It’s a crisis for the industry — communities that traditionally relied on cannabis production have collapsed economically — but also a problem for the state’s finances. Tax revenues from weed sales provide guaranteed funding for child care slots, environmental cleanup, substance abuse education and impaired driving prevention efforts as California faces a growing budget deficit.
“This was a poor time to say, ‘let’s starve the state even more,’” said Tom Wheeler, the executive director of the Humboldt County-based Environmental Protection Information Center, which joined a coalition of child care, environmental and tribal advocacy groups to lobby against a tax freeze.
He said it was important to uphold the promise of Proposition 64, which includes using cannabis tax revenue for programs that offset the harms caused by the cannabis industry, and expressed skepticism that the tax increase would hurt sales.
“I think the average consumer would not notice that,” Wheeler said. “At what point do we stop cutting taxes to benefit the industry?”
The 2022 agreement offered relief to growers by eliminating a cultivation tax, but it allowed state regulators, after a three-year pause, to raise the excise tax to make up for the lost revenue.
During budget negotiations last month, Newsom — who also wants to begin using cannabis tax revenue for enforcement against illegal cultivation — and Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, a Democrat from Salinas, supported extending the pause on the excise tax. They could not reach a compromise with Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire, a Healdsburg Democrat who notably represents the Emerald Triangle.
In a statement, McGuire said “taxes on California’s overregulated cannabis industry have been a train wreck for years,” but he raised concerns about the fiscal implications of freezing the tax. State analysts estimate that increasing it to 19% could yield about $180 million per year for the state.
“It’s important to acknowledge that any freeze will create a budget shortfall which would impact critical community programs funded by cannabis tax dollars,” he said.
California could ‘forfeit a huge opportunity’
Industry representatives warn that further raising taxes will push price-sensitive customers back into the illicit market, hurting businesses teetering on the edge and actually lowering cannabis tax revenue in the long run.
“The math isn’t there,” said Amy O’Gorman Jenkins, executive director and lobbyist for the California Cannabis Operators Association. “We have no objections to how cannabis tax revenues are being spent. All we’re maintaining is that you can’t squeeze blood from a stone.”
They haven’t given up, though repealing the tax increase now that it’s taken effect will be even more challenging.
Assembly Bill 564, which would set the cannabis excise tax at 15% through the end of June 2031, passed the Assembly unanimously in May and now awaits consideration in the Senate.
Assemblymember Matt Haney, the San Francisco Democrat who introduced the measure, said he will keep fighting to get it to the governor. But he was furious that the Senate allowed the tax hike to take effect, which he said sent a message to legal cannabis operators that there is no incentive to follow the rules.

Why taxpayers may foot some of the bill,Adam Echelman,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/07/college-athletes-california/,"A watershed legal settlement takes effect today, allowing universities to pay college athletes directly.","In summary
A watershed legal settlement takes effect today, allowing universities to pay college athletes directly.


Starting today, California’s top universities can pay their athletes directly — a dramatic shift in college sports that blurs the line between amateur and professional play. Schools have yet to say how much individual students will actually make or when checks might arrive, though a CalMatters estimate suggests some student-athletes at UC Berkeley could make roughly $200,000 a year. 
In some ways, these payments are unprecedented. As part of a settlement to a class-action lawsuit, which goes into effect today, a school will be able to dole out up to a combined $20.5 million this year in payments to any or all of its athletes. Almost all of the money will go to football players and to a lesser extent, men’s basketball players. 
At public universities, such as UC Berkeley or UCLA, schools could use taxpayer dollars to make these payments. State or institutional funds already support roughly 30% of UC Berkeley’s athletic budget, according to one analysis by Syracuse University and the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics. 
Student athletes are already compensated, albeit indirectly. Many college athletes receive full scholarships. They’ve also been able to earn additional money since 2021, when the state passed a first-in-the-nation law allowing athletes to make brand deals or receive gifts. 
Up until now, those deals, known as “name, image and likeness” compensation, were only allowed if they came from a third party, such as a company or a group of private donors, and the payments had to be in exchange for services. CalMatters found that some top athletes have made nearly $300,000 in a single deal by posting company advertisements on social media, though most students, especially women, make very little. 
The settlement allows universities to pay students directly, and it comes with a number of restrictions on students’ compensation and colleges’ athletic programs. Students in top athletic programs will now need approval to receive compensation from brands or donor groups. Colleges will also be able to give out more athletic scholarships, but in exchange, schools are required to further limit the numbers of players on each team who are eligible for tuition aid.
UCLA, UC Berkeley, Stanford and the University of Southern California are required to participate in the settlement, since they’re defendants in the lawsuit. Other colleges and universities in California can opt in.
UC Berkeley currently has about 900 athletes but will eventually need to cut roughly 100 players to meet the requirements of the settlement, Chancellor Rich Lyons said in a statement on June 11. 
Using a mix of current revenue and new fundraising, he said the university hopes to pay $12 million to its football players, $3 million to men’s basketball players and $1 million to women’s basketball players. If UC Berkeley were to divide it evenly — which is unlikely — that means this year, each men’s basketball player would receive roughly $200,000, each football player would receive roughly $100,000 and each women’s basketball player would receive around $60,000. Lyons did not mention paying any other athletes, though they could still receive a scholarship and, if approved, certain brand deals or donations. 
UC Berkeley declined to respond to CalMatters’ questions seeking further clarification. Stanford has yet to comment publicly on the settlement and did not respond to CalMatters’ request for comment.
UCLA is not saying how much it will allocate to each of its athletic teams but Athletic Director Martin Jarmond has said that the school will distribute a total of $20.5 million, the maximum yearly amount allowed. USC said it will do the same, said Cody Worsham, the university’s senior associate athletic director. He said USC “will increase investment in all 23 (athletic) programs,” which could include additional scholarships as well as direct payments. 
‘The settlement doesn’t advance California athletes’ rights at all’
This new payment system may not last for long, as at least two groups have already filed legal challenges. 
In addition to allowing schools to pay students directly, the settlement also includes a provision requiring the National Collegiate Athletic Association to divide up roughly $2.8 billion and give it to former student athletes who never had the opportunity to get paid because of the previous NCAA rules. Most of that money, 75%, is supposed to go to former football players. Former basketball players are set to receive 15% of the total payout, women’s basketball players will receive 5% and the remaining 5% will go to all other athletes. 
Female athletes from across the country have appealed that payout plan, putting any payments on hold. The women claim that the settlement payouts violate the federal non-discrimination law, known as Title IX. 
“The settlement doesn’t advance California athletes’ rights at all,” said Ramogi Huma, the executive director of the NCAA, which advocates for the rights of college athletes. “It just stifles it.”
Huma sponsored the California bill that first allowed athletes to profit off their name, image and likeness in 2021. That bill expressly prohibits schools and athletic associations, such as the NCAA, from preventing compensation for college athletes, but “this settlement would do just that,” said Huma. Under the settlement, combined compensation to all athletes cannot exceed $20.5 million, and students may not be able to receive compensation from certain donor groups, known as booster clubs or collectives. 
By participating in the settlement, Huma said California’s colleges and universities may be violating state law. 
Where will the money to pay college athletes come from?
Often known as “revenue-sharing,” these new direct payments are no different from any other kind of expenditure. “Schools can use any dollars that they have to pay their athletes,” said Mit Winter, an attorney specializing in college athletics — it doesn’t matter whether the athletic programs earn any revenue at all. 
Some of the money for sports at California’s public universities comes from TV deals, ticket sales and parking fees, but some also comes from the college’s general fund, which is taxpayer-supported, and from fees that all students pay to their university. In some cases, such as at Fresno State, the portion of athletic revenue that comes from taxpayer dollars or student fees has increased over the past 15 years, according to analyses by the school’s student newspaper. 
“The school itself may say we’ll use this money over here, that comes from ticket sales or donations from donors, but the money is fungible,” said Daniel Rascher, a professor of sports finance at the University of San Francisco. Student-athletes could receive payments based on the revenue of ticket sales, for example, but the office staff who administer those payments may rely on general fund dollars for their salaries. 
While paying athletes directly may seem like a change for the university and the taxpayers who may foot the bill, Rascher said it isn’t really a new expenditure at all. “They were already spending this money on getting students to show up — expensive coaches, high quality training facilities.” 
He said athletic programs benefit all students by helping to market the university. “One way we know it’s a net positive is that schools are continuing to join the Division 1,” said Rascher. Division 1, which includes more than 350 schools across the country, is the most elite and costly arena for college sports. 
Colleges get three weeks to figure million-dollar payment system
Although universities will be allowed to distribute up to $20.5 million to its athletes, many won’t be able to dole out that much. At Cal State Bakersfield, Athletic Director Kyle Conder said the school will also participate in the settlement, though it doesn’t have “any revenue to share” at the moment.
UC San Diego joined the NCAA Division 1 last year and Associate Athletic Director Jeff Tourial said it already plans to join the settlement and pay its athletes. He said the school won’t be able to pay out the maximum and that the university is “still working out the specifics,” such as how much money it will spend or who it will go to.
“Everybody in our world is hesitant to commit to anything because there could still be appeals,” Tourial said. “There’s still so much uncertainty. It’s hard to pin down a number in a relatively short period of time.”
California District Judge Claudia Wilken finalized the settlement on June 6, giving schools just over three weeks to decide how they would officially respond. “There are many people in our department who are thinking about this all day, every day,” said Tourial. “The college athletics landscape is shifting very rapidly. Seemingly every day it’s something else.”
For Karson Gordon, an incoming sophomore at UCLA and a member of the football and track and field teams, today’s settlement is hardly on his mind.
Along with a full scholarship, Gordon also made over $20,000 over the last academic year by signing trading cards and through deals with a sunglasses company, a beverage company and various nonprofit organizations. Those deals will now be subject to approval under the new settlement. Gordon said he doesn’t know yet if he will be paid directly by UCLA or how much he will make, but he’s not concerned.
“It’ll all iron itself out,” he said. “I’m honestly blessed just to get compensation for myself and my athletic abilities.” His focus, he said, is on the field.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/112325_UCLA-Football_REUTERS_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-01 08:59:54.286737

Three former football players in the Legislature think parents and children should have the option of wearing them.,"In summary
Some California youth football leagues ban Guardian Caps. Three former football players in the Legislature think parents and children should have the option of wearing them.


Assemblymember Avelino Valencia, a former tight end for San Jose State, had mixed feelings last year when he voted to support a short-lived proposal that would have banned tackle football for preteens. 
While he credited football for enriching his life, Valencia, a Democrat representing the Anaheim area, said he believes the game is too dangerous for young players’ developing brains. Gov. Gavin Newsom ended up taking the rare step of intervening in the Legislature to quickly spike the proposal. 
This year, Valencia has a new measure that he thinks could help protect young players’ heads, short of a ban on tackling. His Assembly Bill 708 aims to prevent youth football leagues from prohibiting players from wearing the mushroom-shaped padded helmet add-ons that are sometimes worn by concussion-wary NFL players during games.
In an interview with CalMatters, Valencia said the “evidence is substantially clear” that tackle football puts young players at risk of concussions and the long-term problems that come with repeated blows to the head. With the prospect of a ban on tackle football off the table while Newsom is in office, he thinks his measure allowing the equipment sold under the Guardian Cap brand is the next best thing.

“I think this is the direction that I feel most comfortable in, which is trying to make the game as safe as possible, while also providing the opportunity for parents and young people to play this game if they so choose,” Valencia said.
The bill is in response to some youth leagues forbidding the equipment’s use, citing concerns that the add-ons could negate helmet safety certifications. Helmet manufacturers and the organization that certifies them as safe for players reportedly have concerns the padding could alter how their equipment is designed to perform, making youth leagues vulnerable to lawsuits if players get hurt.
The National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment announced in November that attaching products to a certified helmet voids its safety certification unless the add-on has been tested and separately certified.
Two other former college players weigh in
Valencia has support from two other former college football players in the Assembly, Democratic Assemblymember Steve Bennett, a former linebacker and team captain at Brown University, and Republican Assemblymember David Tangipa, a former tight end and special teams player at Valencia’s college rival, Fresno State.
Bennett said helmet technology has improved dramatically from when he was a player in the ’60s and ’70s. When he was in high school, Bennett fractured his skull under his helmet while playing, he said.

Bennett supports the steps leagues are taking to make football safer, and he said he believes Valencia’s bill could help. He didn’t have a chance to vote on the proposed tackle football ban before Newsom killed it, but he said he would have had reservations about a ban.
“Some people say, ‘Hey, you know, we shouldn’t have a sport at all,’ etc.,” he said. “And I would just say that the benefits of the sport have for so many youth … outweighed those risks. So you have to try to minimize those risks.”
Tangipa disagreed with Valencia last year with his stance on the proposed ban. Tangipa hadn’t yet been elected to the Assembly, but he showed up at a rally urging lawmakers to kill it, he said.
But on Valencia’s bill, he agrees that parents and players should have the option of using the add-ons. He hopes the technology helps “bring back hard-hitting football again.” The NFL and other football leagues have changed their tackling rules to try to limit helmet-to-helmet collisions to reduce concussions. Some complain it’s made the game less exciting.

“Look, we went from leather helmets to hard-shell helmets,” he said. “There probably was, you know, grumbling that happened for that, and now we’re going to be adding an additional layer. I don’t think anybody should be bothered by that, especially if it protects our kids.”
There’s been no formal opposition to Valencia’s measure, which sailed through the Assembly and appears likely to do the same in the Senate. 
Medical groups support measure
The bill has support from the California Medical Association, the California Academy of Family Physicians, the California Neurological Society and the California Orthopaedic Association, which support taking steps to reduce concussions in young players.
But whether the helmet pads work as advertised is less clear.
The Guardian Cap manufacturer as well as the NFL say the caps have helped reduce concussions, matching lab studies showing the helmet pads reduce impacts. But other studies, including from Stanford and Wisconsin universities, found they had no effect on the rate of concussions or other head trauma.
Citing the lack of evidence, the Concussion Legacy Foundation reluctantly supported the measure but said it would prefer to see youth tackle football banned outright.
The group also noted “there is limited evidence that soft-shelled helmets have reduced the number of diagnosed concussions or will reduce the risk of football players developing CTE,” the acronym for the debilitating brain condition caused by repeated blows to the head.
“However, if the state is going to allow children to play, we agree that they should have the option to wear soft-shelled helmets,” their letter reads.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/092012-Pop-Warner-Football-REUTERS-CM-01-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-01 08:59:54.286737

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Over 50,000 people added Utah as their home address from 2023 to 2024, taking the state population to 3.5 million. Over 70% of them were along the Wasatch Front, composed of Salt Lake, Utah, Davis and Weber counties.
Housing units in those counties, the most populous in the state, also grew. But, the pace of those additions didn’t match peak numbers witnessed in 2022, according to a Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute report on Wasatch Front communities.
Municipalities along the Wasatch Front added 17,970 new housing units between 2023 and 2024. That’s down from a high of 28,068 in 2022, the Gardner Institute wrote after reviewing building permit data.

“The Wasatch Front added 36,730 new residents between 2023 and 2024, declining slightly from population growth of 42,348 between 2022 and 2023,” Eric Albers, lead author of the report, said in a statement. 
Between 2011 and 2024, the population growth along the Wasatch Front has ranged from a low of 30,208 people, which was measured between 2012 and 2013, and a high of 45,716, seen between 2016 and 2017, Albers added.
However, the institute doesn’t have housing unit increase estimates for Wasatch Front counties prior to 2020. 
“Over this period, housing unit growth peaked between 2021 and 2022 at 28,068,” Albers said, “and has fallen to 17,970 between 2023 and 2024.”
According to the study released Monday, Salt Lake City is for the third consecutive year leading the population growth, with 4,450 more people in 2024, the report authors wrote. The state capital also accounted for almost 54% of new housing, adding almost 3,700 units.

With these updated numbers the analysts determined that 1 in 5 new housing units are in Salt Lake City.
In the housing growth ranking, Saratoga Springs was in the top two with 1,026 more units, followed by Herriman, which added 1,017 units.
The fastest growing municipality in the area was Magna, which saw an 8% population increase in 2024. However, 8 of the 10 fastest-growing cities on the Wasatch Front were in Utah County, led by Saratoga Springs with 7.9% and Highland with 7.8%, the authors wrote. 
Despite most communities’ growth, there were still some other patterns in different cities on the Wasatch Front. Three of them didn’t add any residents during the 2023-2024 period and 29 lost population.
In Salt Lake County, four cities had population declines of more than 200 people — Sandy, which lost 710 residents, Taylorsville with a decline of 357, Midvale with 289 and Kearns with 207.
While there was growth in five cities in Davis County, 11 of them lost population as well, led by North Salt Lake with a 132-person decline. 
Six communities in Weber County saw growth of more than 100 residents. But, six municipalities also experienced modest population decreases, with Roy losing the most residents, 133 people.

But when it comes to noticeable change, supporters say: Be patient. 
Alabama schools for decades have gotten money based on headcount. SB 305, sponsored by Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, created the Renewing Alabama’s Investment in Student Excellence (RAISE) fund, which allocates additional funds to public schools based on weights. 
Schools will receive an additional 2.25% of their base funding for students in poverty; 2%, 10% and 75% for three tiers of students in special education; 7% for English language learners (ELL); 2% for charter school students; and 4.5% for gifted students. According to the law, if a school’s percentage of ELL students is greater than 9% of its average daily membership (ADM), the weight for those students increases to 10%.

“The money is supposed to follow the child, and by that I mean into their school,” Orr, the chair of the Senate Finance and Taxation Education Committee, which oversees the Education Trust Fund budget, said in a recent interview.
According to a breakdown of funding created by the Alabama State Department of Education, Mobile County and Jefferson County schools will receive the most money from the RAISE Act in the 2026 fiscal year, which starts on Oct. 1. Mobile County Public School System (MCPSS), which has 91 schools, will get $11.4 million. Jefferson County, which has 58 schools, will receive $8.7 million. 
Both systems will get the most money from the poverty weight of the RAISE Act, but Jefferson County will get the most in the state for ELL students. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 16.3% of Mobile County lives in poverty, and 16% of Jefferson County lives in poverty. Messages seeking comment from both systems were left last week and Tuesday.
Although Jefferson and Mobile counties have a large population of students living in poverty, 33.6% of Bullock County lives in poverty. The Bullock County School System in the Black Belt, which has four schools, will get $193,000 for students in poverty, 44% of its total additional funding.
 State Superintendent Eric Mackey said in an interview earlier this month that it could take at least ten years to see an improvement in test scores, and that systemic changes like the RAISE Act will not happen overnight.
“It’s going to take a long time to get the amount of money involved that would be needed to really show great student return,” Mackey said.
Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, the chair of the House Ways and Mean Education Committee, carried the legislation in the House. He said in a recent interview that he would “expect something like five years to see the needle move in a positive direction in all these areas.”  
Although schools will get additional funding, there are accountability measures in place if the system does not improve. 
“If they don’t move the needle for that school, if the school’s not improving, if the test scores aren’t improving, with these additional dollars coming their way, then they will risk that money being reduced or outright forfeited,” Orr said. 
The fund will take years to reach capacity, according to Orr, and therefore see lasting changes. The Legislature appropriated $375 million for three years from the Education Opportunities Fund, a state savings account for budget surpluses intended for educational initiatives: $100 million for FY25, $125 million for FY27 and $150 million for FY28. An additional $58 million was appropriated from the Education Trust Fund (ETF) for FY26, according to Orr. 
“We’re gonna try to keep two or three years in advance in that fund,” Orr said. “So if the economy ever goes right down, we are not going to have to walk it back on our schools.”
Orr said that in order to see significant changes, the RAISE fund will have to include $8 to $9 billion over time.
“It’s going to take some years to get,” he said. “We’re not going to hold them accountable if we just gave them an extra million dollars, and say you’ve got to make a miracle here.”
Each school district has some discretion on where the money goes, but Mackey said schools can only move 10% before approval from the state superintendent is required.
“The legislature gave me the authority to do that, and I felt like 10% was a good break,” Mackey said at the State Board of Education’s June work session.
Orr said money movement has to be justified.
“If you’ve got a school, let’s say an elementary school with a high EL composition on one side of town, and the school district gets this extra money because of these EL students, but then they decide they want to go spend it on the high school on the other side of town for the football field,” Orr said. “That’s a no, no. You can’t do that.”
While the larger school systems are getting the most additional funding, smaller systems are getting funding that Orr said would be more impactful. DeKalb County Schools in northeastern Alabama is getting $1.4 million for ELL students, which is 45% of its total additional funding. The system has 12 schools, but 85% of its Crossville High School is Hispanic. A message seeking comment from the school system was left last week and Tuesday.
Albertville City Schools in northeastern Alabama, which has seven schools, is getting $1.6 million for ELL students, 61% of its total additional funding. Russellville City Schools in northwestern Alabama, which has five schools, is getting $701,000 for ELL students, 61% of its total additional funding. Cullman County Schools in central Alabama, which has 26 schools, is getting $834,000 for students in poverty, 45.5% of its total additional funding.
“It just takes a long time. We were one of six states that were not doing this,” Orr said. “And I’m glad we finally got going.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Danny-Garrett-Arthur-Orr-May-8-2024-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-01 08:04:38.177986

In 2024, Missouri was ranked 38th nationwide when it came to prevalence of mental illness and overall access to treatment. So the state made multimillion-dollar investments to improve responses when Missourians are in moments of crisis.
For decades, calling 911 or going to the emergency room was the norm if a person was experiencing a mental health crisis.
Now, with the rollout of a statewide network in tandem with the national crisis hotline, 988, Missouri’s behavioral health providers dispatch teams of social workers or other specialists to be there for someone experiencing a crisis, at no cost to them.
“Not everything requires a level 10 response,” said Jamie Manning, the vice president of access and urgent care services at Compass Health Network. “Outside of calling 911, there’s now this free, accessible service, and you don’t have to wait until it’s that bad. You don’t have to go to the hospital when you’re at your wits’ end. We can help you before it gets to that point.”
Missouri currently has 20 behavioral health centers in the mobile crisis response network statewide. If a person dials 988 in the midst of a crisis and they need more support than is available through a phone call, the providers in the network will send out a team of two behavioral health workers to help them through their crisis.
“For many, many years, there weren’t other options,” Manning said. “Thank goodness we have new resources so there’s now that in between.”
 How mobile crisis came online as part of Missouri’s mental health response

Many behavioral health providers, especially those serving rural patients, had some form of a mobile crisis response in place even before the state launched its network in tandem with 988.
As a caseworker early in her career, Manning remembers the toll that mobile response calls could have on staff. Workers were on call outside of their typical working hours, which meant more work and management for caseworkers outside of their day-to-day responsibilities.
But with the launch of 988 and an investment in the statewide mobile crisis network, behavioral health providers were able to hire full-time staff and create separate mobile teams whose purpose is to go out into the community and respond to the calls.
For fiscal years 2025 and 2026, Missouri set aside about $15 million annually that trickles down to behavioral health providers to staff and fund their mobile crisis teams. And the investment is changing the way the state responds to mental health crises.
“They are trained behavioral health professionals that will respond to a situation without law enforcement,” said KC Rafferty, the director of community engagement at the Missouri Behavioral Health Council.
The goal is to get to the root cause of someone’s crisis moment and get them connected to care that better fits their needs.
“If we’ve seen this person over and over and over again, how can we maybe think differently, think outside the box, to engage with them and ensure that they are getting the appropriate care for what they need?” Rafferty said.
In 2024, the 988 hotline in Missouri answered nearly 85,000 calls, 20,500 texts and nearly 8,800 chats. Of those contacts, about 3,000 — or just over 2.7% — resulted in a mobile crisis team being dispatched.
So far in 2025, 3.08% of contacts result in a mobile team heading out into the state, data provided by the Department of Mental Health shows.
Providers go to a patient’s home or meet them at a more public location, like a library or parking lot. After responding to a call and deescalating the situation, providers offer the opportunity to check back in with patients in the days following a crisis. They offer them options for short- or long-term care and treatment, or other assistance, such as helping them fill out Medicaid applications or making a doctor’s appointment.
But each case is different, and challenges remain when treating behavioral health conditions, especially in rural areas.
“Whenever we’re talking about rural mobile response, it’s the culture,” said Natasha Corkins, the director of crisis services for Burrell Behavioral Health’s southwest region, which covers Springfield and six surrounding counties. “There are people who call and want to speak, and we offer a mobile response and they’re hesitant because they don’t want to invite someone to their home or their location.”
“Consent is very important to us, because a crisis is a very individual and intimate situation,” Corkins said. “We don’t want to show up and possibly escalate a crisis by our presence. We want them to invite us in.”
Another challenge posed in rural communities is access to the internet when people are ready to seek out resources, Rafferty said.
“That can pose its own threat if they don’t have the ability to get where they need help, or to call someone to get assistance, if there is poor coverage in their area,” Rafferty said.
In all behavioral health responses, patience and understanding are key to better outcomes for patients, said Laurie Cox, the director of crisis services at Swope Health in Kansas City.
“If you keep getting in crisis, the only way to stop that is to get the services that you need,” Cox said. “But we also know that it is really hard for people to do. So it takes patience, it takes determination, it takes knowing how hard to push.”
 Shifting from 911 and emergency rooms to living rooms and libraries 

Emergency responders and behavioral health workers agree that an emergency room or a jail cell isn’t the best place for someone who is experiencing a crisis. But for many years, it was the only option.
Now, if it is safe, emergency medical services and law enforcement don’t need to be on-site at many of the 988 mobile dispatches, because there are mobile responders across the state trained in deescalation.
And they say the number of behavioral health calls they are needed for has dropped as the option becomes better known.
“If we go back and look at repeat patients, a lot of those have significantly decreased because they are getting the follow-up they need,” said Chris Bogguss, the director of EMS in Macon County. “They were given the appropriate resources.”
And for situations where emergency responders are needed at a behavioral crisis call, Missouri is incentivizing them to receive crisis intervention training in how to assess and deescalate crisis calls.
“It’s the education that we’ve received outside of our traditional EMS training that’s really helped us … better understand the patient’s needs,” Bogguss said.
Burrell Behavioral Health’s southwest coverage area has a crisis hotline specialist embedded in the Springfield-Greene County 911 dispatch center.
“We can work on diverting crisis callers from 911 to our crisis team, and hopefully stop the dispatching before it happens,” Corkins said.
Ultimately, providers want Missourians to know they can reach out for help and get connected to support or services through the 988 network.
“The goal is not to provide the Band-Aid in the moment, although that has its benefits,” Manning said. “How can we ensure that this has some lasting impact? It’s not a one and done. We’re here for you in whatever capacity you’re open to.”

Majority of New Mexico’s annual spending passes governor’s veto test


 



Not everything happens July 1
Laws without specified start dates take effect 90 days from the end of the Legislative session or June 20 this year.
Some laws passed in the 2025 Legislative session contain staggered start dates, including the medical psilocybin program, slated to start in 2027; along with requirements to put defibrillators into every school and reforms to the state’s wildlife agency, which both take effect in 2026.
Other bills with emergency clauses went into effect immediately after signing, including a provision to allow New Mexico graduates to wear tribal regalia and bills allowing local governments more ways to access money to aid in disaster recovery and emergency response.



Criminal Justice
Lawmakers spent the first 30 days of the 2025 legislative session focused on a package of criminal-legal reforms crammed into House Bill 8, including: overhauling criminal competency; enhanced penalties for fentanyl trafficking; increased fourth-degree felony charges for making a shooting threat; criminalization for possession of a weapon conversion device; increased penalties for vehicle thefts; and legislation to make it easier for police to conduct blood tests in DWI cases.
Tuesday also marks the first day for a new police agency under the state’s insurance regulator to enforce state cannabis laws.

Health care
Lawmakers will begin seeding the Medicaid trust fund with $300 million on Tuesday to generate enough in interest to pay more for low-income residents’ health care services. Lawmakers remain concerned that proposed federal cuts could further impact the state, which has the highest U.S. per-capita reliance on the program.
Education
Lawmakers increased minimum teacher salaries by an additional $5,000 dollars across the state, and ensured the inclusion of vocational teachers of subjects such as auto-shop, culinary and other trade skills. Lawmakers also raised minimum annual salaries for staff such as cafeteria workers and custodians, to $30,000 and enacted a 4% raise for all staff.
The state also raised oil and gas royalty rates for the first time in 50 years, which is expected to produce between $50 and $75 million to New Mexico’s public schools, universities and specialty schools.
Environment
While many of New Mexico’s big changes to water policy and pollution already went into effect, several changes to energy policy start July 1.
For instance, the state will allow larger electric utilities to incorporate advanced grid technology projects into their plans to modernize electric grids, and incorporate those plans into the ratemaking process before the Public Regulation Commission.
Child welfare
Child welfare presented a throughline of tension between the executive, and legislative branches this session. Members of the New Mexico Department of Justice will begin standing up the Office of the Child Advocate, tasked with independent oversight of the state’s child welfare agency.

The state also approved a minimum of $500 million in additional funding for the Early Childhood Education and Care Department.
And just a few more:
Also going into effect Tuesday:

A $7 million state grant fund for animal shelter projects for communities.
A law allowing cyclists to pass through a red light at an intersection after stopping — without waiting for a green light —  or to proceed through an intersection past a stop sign with no cross-street traffic.




From years past:
Several laws passed in 2023 fully take effect Tuesday.
One allows the state to automatically register eligible voters during driver’s license purchases at the Motor Vehicle Division. Any change of address will be automatically updated with the Secretary of State’s Office. Another law reduces fees for administrative costs withheld from local governments by the New Mexico Department of Taxation and Revenue, which will be eliminated by fiscal year 2029. A third law in effect updates the license and certification requirements for elevator construction and repair.

,California,2025-07-01 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,"Newsom uses political stunts to garner attention. As Jerry Brown learned, it can backfire",Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/07/newsom-stunts-political-career-backfire/,"Gavin Newsom has shifted his image-building efforts into higher gear, bolstering assumptions that he will run for president. But as Jerry Brown learned during his tenure as governor, past political stunts can haunt a presidential bid.","During his first governorship a half-century ago, Jerry Brown acquired a reputation for making abrupt changes of position, sometimes contradicting himself.
The starkest example occurred in 1978 when Proposition 13, a landmark tax limit measure, was on the ballot. Brown denounced the measure as a “ripoff” before the election, but soon after its overwhelming approval, declared himself a “born-again tax cutter” and sponsored a state income tax cut.
Brown’s chameleon-like tendencies drew much criticism, of course. But he rationalized them by citing what he called a “canoe theory” of politics.
“The way you have to approach the political process is something like piloting a canoe,” Brown once said. “If you stand up on one side you’ll fall in. If you stand up on the other side you’ll fall in. But if you paddle a little bit on the left side, then paddle a little bit on the right side, you keep going right down the middle.”
Despite his rationale, Brown’s frequent repositioning fed suspicions that he was less interested in governing California than in planning a presidential campaign. In fact, he ran for president twice during his eight-year governorship, basing his second bid in 1980 on cutting taxes and balancing the federal budget.
Ultimately, Brown’s evident lack of interest in his day job and his dipsy-doodles of positioning backfired. His 1982 run for the U.S. Senate failed miserably. When he returned to the governorship in 2011, having learned his lesson, he was a model of consistency and engaged governance.
That bit of political history is relevant to what Gavin Newsom is doing as his governorship winds down and he increasingly evinces hopes to succeed where his quasi-uncle — the Brown and Newsom families have been intertwined for decades — failed.
Ever since he won a second term in 2022, Newsom has been very obviously building a national image for himself with headline-grabbing political maneuvers and cultivating attention from national political media — all the while insisting that he had “sub-zero interest” in seeking the White House.
After Donald Trump trounced Kamala Harris last fall, Newsom shifted his image-building into higher gear, positioning himself as a leader of the resistance to Trump’s many changes of policy while, inexplicably, endorsing some Trumpian positions, most notably opposition to allowing transgender females to compete in girls’ sports.
The Trump administration’s sweeping roundups of undocumented immigrants in Southern California, including the use of National Guard troops and Marines — aimed, at last partially, at depicting California as a rogue sanctuary state — have given Newsom a new platform to claim the title of resister-in-chief.
Last week, he generated even more media attention by suing Fox news for defamation, claiming that Fox News anchor Jesse Watters edited out key information from a clip of Trump talking about calling Newsom about the immigration crackdown, then used the edited video to assert that Newsom had lied about them speaking.
The recent events have bolstered assumptions that Newsom is running for president. A few weeks ago, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, he said “I’m not thinking about running, but it’s a path that I could see unfold.”
Political oddsmakers took it as a quasi-declaration of candidacy and early polling has put Newsom in the upper tier of potential 2028 Democratic candidates, albeit with scarcely double-digit support.
As Newsom’s time in office declines, we’ll likely see a steady escalation of statements and actions drawing national attention to himself, just as Jerry Brown did during his first governorship.
However, as Brown learned the hard way, if Newsom’s stunts become too blatant, he risks becoming a laughingstock who won’t be taken seriously.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/112124-Gavin-Fresno-City-Presser-LV_CM_04.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-01 08:04:38.177986

Akerman, the nation's first attorney general, made protection of Black voting rights his top priority.","JULY 1, 1870

Congress created the Department of Justice to handle the flood of post-Civil War litigation. President Ulysses S. Grant appointed Amos T. Akerman, whose priority became the protection of Black voting rights from attacks by the Ku Klux Klan and similar groups. 
Congress aided that fight by passing additional laws that gave the department powerful tools to fight these violent white supremacist groups. These new laws enabled Akerman to obtain hundreds of convictions across the South. On one day in November 1871, 250 men in a South Carolina county confessed membership in the Klan. 
Historian William McFeely wrote of Akerman, “Perhaps no attorney general since his tenure … has been more vigorous in the prosecution of cases designed to protect the lives and rights of Black Americans.” 
But instead of rewarding Akerman, Grant dismissed him, and the battle to preserve these voting rights became less of a priority.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/06102347/July1-usaoseal.jpg,,,2025-07-01 08:59:54.286737
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-01 12:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,What’s next for birthright citizenship after the Supreme Court’s ruling,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/01/birthright-citizenship-after-the-supreme-courts-ruling/,The legal battle over Trump’s move to end birthright citizenship is far from over despite Republicans' win limiting nationwide injunctions.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The legal battle over President Donald Trump’s move to end birthright citizenship is far from over despite the Republican administration’s major victory Friday limiting nationwide injunctions.
Immigrant advocates are vowing to fight to ensure birthright citizenship remains the law as the Republican president tries to do away with more than a century of precedent.
The high court’s ruling sends cases challenging the president’s birthright citizenship executive order back to the lower courts. But the ultimate fate of the president’s policy remains uncertain.
Here’s what to know about birthright citizenship, the Supreme Court’s ruling and what happens next.
What does birthright citizenship mean?
Birthright citizenship makes anyone born in the United States an American citizen, including children born to mothers in the country illegally.
The practice goes back to soon after the Civil War, when Congress ratified the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, in part to ensure that Black people, including former slaves, had citizenship.
“All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States,” the amendment states.
Thirty years later, Wong Kim Ark, a man born in the U.S. to Chinese parents, was refused re-entry into the U.S. after traveling overseas. His suit led to the Supreme Court explicitly ruling that the amendment gives citizenship to anyone born in the U.S., no matter their parents’ legal status.
It has been seen since then as an intrinsic part of U.S. law, with only a handful of exceptions, such as for children born in the U.S. to foreign diplomats.
Trump has long said he wants to do away with birthright citizenship
Trump’s executive order, signed in January, seeks to deny citizenship to children who are born to people who are living in the U.S. illegally or temporarily. It’s part of the hardline immigration agenda of the president, who has called birthright citizenship a “magnet for illegal immigration.”
Trump and his supporters focus on one phrase in the amendment — “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” – saying it means the U.S. can deny citizenship to babies born to women in the country illegally.
A series of federal judges have said that’s not true, and issued nationwide injunctions stopping his order from taking effect.
“I’ve been on the bench for over four decades. I can’t remember another case where the question presented was as clear as this one is. This is a blatantly unconstitutional order,” U.S. District Judge John Coughenour said at a hearing earlier this year in his Seattle courtroom.
In Greenbelt, Maryland, a Washington suburb, U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman wrote that “the Supreme Court has resoundingly rejected and no court in the country has ever endorsed” Trump’s interpretation of birthright citizenship.
Is Trump’s order constitutional? The justices didn’t say
The high court’s ruling was a major victory for the Trump administration in that it limited an individual judge’s authority in granting nationwide injunctions. The administration hailed the ruling as a monumental check on the powers of individual district court judges, whom Trump supporters have argued want to usurp the president’s authority with rulings blocking his priorities around immigration and other matters.
But the Supreme Court did not address the merits of Trump’s bid to enforce his birthright citizenship executive order.
“The Trump administration made a strategic decision, which I think quite clearly paid off, that they were going to challenge not the judges’ decisions on the merits, but on the scope of relief,” said Jessica Levinson, a Loyola Law School professor.
Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters at the White House that the administration is “very confident” that the high court will ultimately side with the administration on the merits of the case.
Questions and uncertainty swirl around next steps
The justices kicked the cases challenging the birthright citizenship policy back down to the lower courts, where judges will have to decide how to tailor their orders to comply with the new ruling. The executive order remains blocked for at least 30 days, giving lower courts and the parties time to sort out the next steps.
The Supreme Court’s ruling leaves open the possibility that groups challenging the policy could still get nationwide relief through class-action lawsuits and seek certification as a nationwide class. Within hours after the ruling, two class-action suits had been filed in Maryland and New Hampshire seeking to block Trump’s order.
But obtaining nationwide relief through a class action is difficult as courts have put up hurdles to doing so over the years, said Suzette Malveaux, a Washington and Lee University law school professor.
“It’s not the case that a class action is a sort of easy, breezy way of getting around this problem of not having nationwide relief,” said Malveaux, who had urged the high court not to eliminate the nationwide injunctions.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who penned the court’s dissenting opinion, urged the lower courts to “act swiftly on such requests for relief and to adjudicate the cases as quickly as they can so as to enable this Court’s prompt review” in cases “challenging policies as blatantly unlawful and harmful as the Citizenship Order.”
Opponents of Trump’s order warned there would be a patchwork of polices across the states, leading to chaos and confusion without nationwide relief.
“Birthright citizenship has been settled constitutional law for more than a century,” said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Global Refuge, a nonprofit that supports refugees and migrants. “By denying lower courts the ability to enforce that right uniformly, the Court has invited chaos, inequality, and fear.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25181747725853-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-01 15:09:12.202904

Horhn is the 54th mayor of Jackson. His inauguration marks a shift in leadership from a young progressive visionary to a seasoned moderate who promises to restore basic services, tackle blight and bring back economic development. 
Horhn, 70, will take the oath of office at 11 a.m. at the downtown Jackson Convention Complex following a prayer service led by eight religious leaders of different denominations. Council members, including the newly elected Kevin Parkinson of Ward 7 and Lashia Brown-Thomas of Ward 6, will also be sworn into office. 
The day concludes with a gala at 7 p.m. featuring performances from blues musicians Willie Clayton and Bobby Rush. 
A longtime state senator representing parts of northwest Jackson and southern Madison County, Horhn has pledged to reorganize a dysfunctional City Hall, create a comprehensive plan, and work with developers to bring more business to Jackson. 
The challenges are great: Jackson is the fastest shrinking capital city in the country, and many residents have lost faith in the city’s leadership to respond when they call with problems, much less fix systemic issues such as blight, economic divestment or Jackson’s relationship to the state government. 
But Horhn will have the support of a coalition of city leaders representing real estate, restaurants, unions, city contractors and nonprofits. With their support, Horhn rode to election, winning 3 to 1 in the Democratic primary runoff over outgoing Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba and facing no serious opposition in the general election.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)A state representative who led efforts to change Alabama’s ethics laws said last week he’s not sure if he will revive the effort in the 2026 legislative session.
Rep. Matt Simpson, R-Daphne, has sponsored legislation that made changes to sanctions for ethics law violations, increasing penalties in some areas and lowering them in others. His first attempt in 2024 stalled in the Alabama Senate on the final day.
“We will see what the appetite is for the body, if they want to take it up in 2026 or if they want to take it up in the beginning of 2027, at the beginning of a new quadrennium,” Simpson said in an interview. “You want to evaluate the bill itself on the merits and not the political aspect of, ‘How is this going to be played in the press for the vote.’”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
After the bill died in 2024, the Legislature approved a Simpson-sponsored resolution to have the Legislative Services Agency hire a consultant to help research ethics laws throughout the country and provide a report on the findings. The report was finalized in February.
“A lot of good legislation stalled in this 2025 session,” Simpson said. “As we were looking at the calendar, as we were looking at the time, from the time we got the report from the attorney, then put something into writing that we could get into a bill format, starting to look at the calendar, it was ‘Hey, this may not have the timing to get through.’”
He added that, “If I trusted the press to give the right article, it would be great, but I have seen how that works. Until I get the correct messaging, and until we get the right buy in, it is going to be difficult to go through.”
HB 227, the bill Simpson introduced in 2024, would have enhanced penalties for some violations while reducing others. It would have made it a Class B felony, punishable by up to 20 years in prison, for public officials to give anything of value to a public servant, either elected or employed. It would have also made it a Class B felony if a public servant solicits or accepts a bribe from themselves or another person.
That same violation is currently a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, and only applies to the public servant regardless of relation to other people.
The legislation would also have separated the crime of bribery from those of economic gain, along with creating the crime of using a public officer for economic benefit, which is also a Class B felony if the value of benefit exceeds $10,000. If the value of the economic benefit is between $2,500 and $10,000, the punishment would be a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
It would be a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in prison and a $6,000 fine if the economic value of the benefit was less than $2,500.
The legislation was modified to require the Alabama Attorney General’s Office to approve an attorney hired by the Alabama Ethics Commission and include the Alabama Secretary of State and the director of the Securities Commission to approve members to the ethics commission.
“I think our laws are vague,” said Simpson, who has served as chair of the House Ethics and Campaign Finance Committee since 2022. “There is a lot left up to interpretation and discretion of the prosecutor, and that is scary to me as a prosecutor. You don’t want to get into a role where some things can be interpreted in some way. You may have something interpreted one way in Jefferson County and another thing interpreted another way in Mobile County or Madison County. You want to make sure it is black and white so people are aware of what you can and can’t do.”
Critics, including the Alabama Attorney General’s Office and the Alabama Ethics Commission, argued the changes would weaken the state’s ethics laws and force the Alabama Ethics Commission to relinquish some of its authority and oversight powers for investigating violations by public officials.
“A lot of people opposed that bill, not just us, and it is because the changes that were suggested would have significantly weakened the (Alabama) Ethics Act,” said Thomas Albritton, director of the Alabama Ethics Commission.
Simpson convened a series of meetings in the summer and the fall of 2023 to review the state’s ethics laws in depth, provide greater context for the issue by having ethics experts offer testimony and allow the public to weigh in with their thoughts.
“What I wanted to do, starting in 2023, was let the public be aware of the discussions, let the media be aware of what the discussions were, get all the attorneys, all the legal minds, anybody that has any input on the application of the laws, talk to as many people as I possibly could, and do it in an open and transparent setting so that people could see what we were doing, why we were doing it, and be aware of the problems with the law.”
Delaney Marsco, director of ethics for the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit and nonpartisan government watchdog organization, was critical of the bill.
“It would impact how the gift laws apply and make it such that the gift law doesn’t have any teeth and impact the disclosure requirement,” Marsco said in an interview last week. “It would change a lot of things in terms of the ethics laws, and it would weaken them.”
The Campaign Legal Center included the legislation as part of a report that provided a trend of how officials in some states are trying to reform ethics laws to weaken ethics commissions throughout the country.

Assembly Bill 475, which was signed into law by Gov. Joe Lombardo last month, allocated $23 million for eviction diversion and rental assistance programs. Clark County will receive $15 million, the City of Reno will receive $5.2 million to cover the Washoe area, and the Rural Housing Authority will receive $750,000.
While the funding will aid existing programs helping to keep people housed, the demand for people needing help with unpaid rent “exceeds this allocation,” said Jamie Sorenson, the director of social services for Clark County.
Clark County, in conjunction with the Las Vegas Justice Court, launched an eviction diversion program in 2023. Reno launched a Housing Court, which includes an eviction diversion pilot program, last August to help tenants at risk of losing their housing.
“Housing Court cannot function without having rental assistance,” said Reno Judge Kendra Bertschy, adding that diversion programs “have to have that payment option” to provide assistance in order to be successful.
The court, she said, sees people who are often dealing with “economical challenges or medical emergencies or other unforeseen life circumstances that have led them towards this eviction.” Once they lose housing, they are likely to become homelessness and rely on other social services that “all costs taxpayers more money than if we had just provided them with some rental assistance and worked on keeping them stable.”
Eviction Lab, which is run out of Princeton University and collects data on eviction trends around the country, has consistently ranked the Las Vegas metropolitan area as having among the highest number of eviction filings in recent years.
Data showed the number of evictions filed in Las Vegas in April and May were higher than previous months this year, with 3,428 evictions filed in April and 3,779 filed in May.The number doesn’t indicate how many evictions were granted. 
Monthly eviction filings are 45% higher than they were prior to the pandemic, according to Eviction Lab’s analysis.
Reno-specific data is not provided by the organization. 
Nevada’s unique and complicated summary eviction law, which requires the tenant file with the court first after receiving a pay-or-quit notice, also makes the figures likely an undercount.
Lombardo’s vetoes once again thwart tenant-friendly housing reforms

Democratic lawmakers advanced several bills aimed at reforming the eviction system. Lombardo vetoed them all but approved legislation that allocated additional funds for eviction diversion.
Nevada’s pandemic-related eviction protections, which included legislation that temporarily paused an eviction while counties processed rental applications, ended in 2023. That same year, state lawmakers allocated $15 million to rental assistance with $12 million going to Clark County and $3 million to Reno.
The need for eviction assistance never went away.
“When I became a judge in Reno Justice Court in 2023, one of the things that we noticed was that there were a lot of filings for evictions for just non-payment of rent,” Bertschy said. 
Both Washoe and Clark counties had to adapt over the last few years with the number of people following behind on rent. 
The City of Reno at the time was handling applications for rental assistance for eligible tenants at risk of eviction. Bertschy said many landlords wanted to work with tenants as they worked to get assistance, but there was no guarantee how quickly the process would take. 
In order to streamline the process to ensure tenants would receive assistance prior to an eviction, a housing court was created to ensure those at risk of losing housing had applications expedited. 
A hearing date within housing court is scheduled 30 days after the landlord files a response with the court to allow for assistance to be processed.
During that period, tenants are given a case manager to help them determine if they are eligible for other resources like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).
From August when the court launched through June, the has provided 105 households, or 265 people, rental assistance to stave off an eviction, according to city data.
Nearly a fourth of applicants were below 30% area median income with the remaining at or below 60% of area median income.
Data on eviction diversion in Clark County was unavailable at the time of publication. 
Most of the applicants coming through the program, Sorenson said, are likely people on the verge of homelessness.
“These are individuals who have been living paycheck to paycheck,” he said. “The one time that they fall back on rent, that really spirals and leads them. If they face that eviction, it goes on their record, it makes it more difficult for them to regain other housing.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/eviction-blurred.jpg,,,2025-07-01 08:04:38.177986

I went in at 18 on a relatively minor charge with an expected release in two years. Instead, I emerged at 62 years of age.
Over all those decades, I dreamed of freedom but when my moment finally came, the challenge to stay free was nothing I ever could have imagined. I was homeless for close to a year, shivering on park benches on frigid nights, not allowing myself to lay down for fear of attracting the attention of police. And when I finally came up on a waitlist for public housing, I was so happy, but I was denied based on my history. I sobbed when I read the letter, and figured it was hopeless.
I watched guys I’d known on the inside also trying to make it, usually giving in to selling drugs just so they could eat, with most getting caught and going back in. Society would say they hadn’t learned their lesson, but is that what’s really going on here?
In my case, through the grace of God, I came to the attention of some good people, who guided me, and supported me. I still have a long way to go, but I’ve been luckier than most.
Survival after prison shouldn’t be a matter of luck.
Most people come out with high hopes of making it on the outside, but the obstacles they face are almost insurmountable. When someone leaves prison, they are handed a bus ticket, a few dollars, and a near impossible task: rebuild a life with a felony stamped across their name. They’re told to “start over,” but society ensures they can’t. Employers shut doors, housing applications are denied, and even programs meant to help them reintegrate are overwhelmed, underfunded or non-existent.
For thousands of formerly incarcerated people, freedom is just another trap – one that pushes them back into the cycle of poverty and the crime we claim to abhor. If we truly want to reduce recidivism, we must confront the systemic discrimination that sabotages second chances.
Various programs offered inside prisons claim to “rehabilitate” but what value does it have if it all ends at the prison gates? Take the man who serves 10 years for a non-violent drug offense. Inside, he earns his GED, learns carpentry and vows to stay clean. Upon release, he applies to 20 jobs. One of them calls him back. But after a background check the answer is: “We don’t hire felons.” That man isn’t alone. 60% of formerly incarcerated individuals remain unemployed a year after release. Without income, housing or hope, many return to “survival crimes.” Is this failure theirs – or ours?
The stigma of a felony is a life sentence. Even in states with “Ban the Box” laws that prohibit initial questions about criminal backgrounds on job applications, employers will often reject the applicant post-background check. Licensing boards may deny people with records from trades like barbering or plumbing — skills that many learn in prison. Food stamps and housing vouchers are frequently withheld for those with drug convictions.  Meanwhile, reentry programs – job training, counseling, addiction support — are plagued by waitlists. In some cities, waiting periods for housing exceed six months, leaving many to sleep on the streets, an invitation to arrest if they are sleeping in a public space, which is all but inevitable if you are homeless.
When society denies people the tools to rebuild, recidivism becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
According to Bureau of Justice statistics, nearly 44% of released prisoners are reincarcerated within their first year out. But this isn’t only about “personal failure.”  Studies show that stable employment reduces recidivism yet many employers refuse to hire the formerly incarcerated. They are often denied education — colleges frequently reject applicants with records. Even federal student aid packages carry restrictions for those with a record. Despite having paid their dues, for the formerly incarcerated, every door leading to admittance back into society is invariably slammed in their face. And then we act surprised when they struggle.
Change isn’t hypothetical. Nonprofits like The Last Mile — train, educate and connect the incarcerated with outside companies. The recidivism rate for those who go through their program is less than 5%. Countries like Norway, with their focus on rehabilitation, also have dramatically lower recidivism rates. 
Most of the formerly incarcerated people I’ve encountered want to be productive members of society. They just need help getting there. Here’s how we start:
1) Invest in reentry programs: fund job training, mental health services, and housing subsidies specifically for the formerly incarcerated.
2) Incentivize employers: offer tax breaks to companies that hire people with records.
3) Reform licensing laws and eliminate blanket bans on occupational licenses.
4) Expunge records: automatically clear old convictions after a crime-free period.
5) Humanize, don’t stigmatize: share stories of successful reentry to combat stereotypes.
Punishment shouldn’t last forever. Every person released from prison faces a choice: reintegrate or recidivate. By denying the formerly incarcerated the housing, jobs, and dignity they need to succeed, we make that choice for them. If we want safer communities, we must stop treating the formerly incarcerated as perpetual criminals — they served their time.

Vermont property taxes are high. Period.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Mickey Nowak: Second-home owners are not getting any special treatment.","Dear Editor,
I am writing this letter about the commentary by Kate Hughes, “It is time to tax second-home owners more.”
Ms. Hughes states that legislators and Gov. Phil Scott should “make it a priority to tax second-home owners more.” Her reasoning is that the education portion of her tax bill is higher as a homestead property owner than a similarly valued house for a non-homestead property owner.
What she fails to mention is that, while it is true that in 74 towns in Vermont the non-homestead property owner pays a lower rate, in 186 towns the non-homestead property owner pays a higher rate. That is because of Vermont’s somewhat complicated formula for the education tax portion of one’s property tax bill.

Ms. Hughes also states that because of second-home owners it “means there’s a shrinking number of primary residents left to shoulder the cost of essential services.” The municipal tax portion of your property tax bill (that covers essential services) is set by the municipal legislative body and is levied against the municipal grand list at a rate needed to pay for municipal expenses. Both homestead and non homestead property owners pay the same rate.
It is also worth noting that non-homestead-property-buyers pay a significantly higher property transfer tax than homestead-buyers.
Vermont property taxes are high. Period. Second-home owners are not getting any special treatment.

Private schools are not the enemy of public education. It’s about meeting the needs of students.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Brian Carroll: Making an argument for small private schools.","This commentary is by Brian Carroll of West Glover. He spent 26 years as a student services director for several districts in the Northeast Kingdom, and is currently semi-retired, providing consultation to school districts regarding special education and Title IX procedures. He also teaches English composition at Community College of Vermont.


If it hasn’t occurred already, it appears that H.454 will become law with the governor’s signature. It will be one of the most transformational education laws in decades with its focus on school governance, finance and the constitutional right to an equitable public education system.
The many iterations of the bill created significant division among educational stakeholders. Some think our educational system is inefficient and an unnecessary burden on taxpayers. Some believe the quality of instruction in our schools needs attention, thus more resources, particularly in the many rural districts in our state.
Then there is the division among those who believe independent schools should not receive public funding and those who believe it an inappropriate use of public funding. This particular issue appears to have the most divisiveness. Here’s my take on this issue.

READ MORE

Having spent the past 30 years of my career as a teacher and special ed administrator in Vermont and Virginia public schools. I’ve been an advocate of public education and believe in the teachings of the influential Vermont educator, John Dewey, who professed that public schools are necessary to sustain a democratic society.
I totally embraced the concept of public education’s requirement to be open to all learners, creating true diversity in the classrooms. As a special education advocate, I spent most of my career supporting the requirements of special ed law (IDEA, 1975) and believed that an IEP can make a difference to a special needs learner.
That being said, I now find myself in a position that may appear to counter these beliefs in public education. I have come to realize that students who learn differently don’t necessarily benefit from individualized instruction based on a special need (or disability).
I also realize that, given the many cultural challenges of the 21st century, our general student population appears to respond differently to larger secondary schools. By “differently,” I mean not achieving their potential due to the many factors involving technology, post-pandemic issues, and an increasingly divided society.
Several years ago, I was asked by a colleague to consider serving on the board of a very small, independent school. I had some reservations but I eventually realized that students do benefit from a small secondary school environment, so I agreed.
I have now served as chair of a micro-secondary school, East Burke School, for the past three years. With an enrollment of 7-12 students, it is truly a small school; however, it serves its students with a stellar, intentional and a tight curriculum that adheres to high standards, yet, can pace students along a reasonable achievement path towards a high school diploma.
This describes the type of opportunities that are sometimes challenging for some larger secondary schools in our public school systems, despite the many social, therapeutic and academic supports available.
Some vehemently oppose public funding for private, independent schools. I get it. One could easily argue that financial resources need to be totally directed toward our public schools. However, I would argue that private schools are not the enemy of public education. It’s about meeting the needs of students.
East Burke School happens to serve students in a district that has no secondary school. The students in this district have school choice. Ironically, the majority of secondary students split their attendance between two independent schools, both of which are considered relatively large by Vermont standards.
One could argue that school choice is a good thing for families of secondary students. Why is having a micro-school, as part of this choice, a problem?
There are those who argue that small schools are inefficient and costly due to low enrollment. On a spreadsheet, that argument may be valid, however, the tuition comparisons to the regional secondary schools do not support that argument.
I hope that schools like East Burke School will continue to thrive and can look toward a sustainable future without the current adversity and divisiveness that appears to be emanating from this law.

His life looks a bit different these days.

The former governor has been busy writing not one, but two books. He has signed up to be a professional public speaker next year. And he’s been taking lots of meetings in the man cave in the back of his barn.
“Civility is a big part of it. It’s just stressing practices and policies that work and maybe share some lessons of what didn’t work that I thought would’ve,” Holcomb said.
Six months after leaving state government, he has been sticking close to home. After all, he did a lot of international traveling during his tenure. Instead, he is getting used to life after being governor. Sometimes he doesn’t know the latest policy or political news unless friends and former administration folks send it to him.
Holcomb has already finished one book — a photographic review of his time as governor — which should come out later this year. But those pictures and remembrances sparked an idea for a second book on lessons learned. There isn’t an exact timetable on that book.
“It reminds you of big moments where you learned something, hopefully leading through it, but lessons that you learned,” he said.
COVID-19 will be a major subject as well as economic development deals and international partnerships.
Holcomb served as governor from early 2017 to early 2025. Before that he was lieutenant governor for less than a year. He cut his teeth in politics running then-Gov. Mitch Daniels’ campaigns and offices. He’s also a U.S. Navy man and ran the Indiana Republican Party for two years.
What’s next
Like some predecessors, he has formed a nonprofit 501(c)(4) called “A Better Way Policy Institute.”
“It’s kind of a carry on of my interest in how good policy can better communities, better lives, better economies. Leave it better than you found it,” Holcomb said. “And so, it’ll provide me an opportunity to work with other like-minded folks around the state, around the country, around the world.”
He said many people reach out to him and this provides him a vehicle to stay engaged.

Holcomb has only done a few speaking engagements since leaving office in January, including one recently with Daniels and former Governor and Vice President Mike Pence in Carmel. But he has signed an exclusive speaking deal with a company and written a few speeches. That will likely ramp up early next year.
In terms of policy areas, Holcomb wants to work more in energy, life sciences, defense, economic development and national security.
In the meantime, Holcomb is on the hunt for a tractor and handles mundane tasks like scheduling septic cleaning. Former First Lady Janet Holcomb has been impressed that her husband has been able to fully decompress.
“We rise with the sun daily … and we’re able to enjoy long days together and that’s very different,” he said. “I have a lot of time and duties to make up.”

(Photo courtesy of Alan Archambault)The U.S. Army is looking to shutter more than two dozen military museums, including Washington’s “gem” at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Pierce County. 
Lewis Army Museum is one of 29 facilities that the U.S. Army Center of Military History announced earlier this month will be closed or consolidated to direct more resources toward “readiness and lethality.”
“I’m really upset. I don’t think anybody is very keen on it,” said Tom Morgan, 88, a retired lieutenant colonel and vice president of the Friends of the Lewis Army Museum. “It is going to take a lot of political pressure to change this.”
Landing on the closure list was a surprise, said Megan Nishikawa, a volunteer who had a paid fellowship with Friends of the Lewis Army Museum.
“We didn’t think our museum would be on the chopping block,” she said. “Our museum is very special. It tells the story of Washington Army units and Washington soldiers. The things we have are treasures.”
As museum supporters spread word of the possible closure, the chair of a state legislative panel raised the issue Monday with the head of Joint Base Lewis-McChord.
“We have a gem in the Lewis Museum. It’s been around for 50 years, serving the public nobly and I’m concerned about the closure,” said state Rep. Mari Leavitt, D-University Place, in a meeting of the Joint Committee on Veterans’ and Military Affairs. 
Col. Kent Park, the outgoing Joint Base Lewis-McChord garrison commander, said he learned of the closure plan from news stories. “Unfortunately, we were not necessarily consulted,” he told members of the bipartisan and bicameral committee.
From what he’s since learned, it appears the Lewis Army Museum won’t be affected before 2027.
“One key thing that we are trying to communicate back is that the Lewis Museum is not just a museum, it’s actually a training facility. We have soldiers training in that building. So one way or the other, we do see that building staying open,” he said.
Because of that, conversations are starting on the possibility of partnering with another local museum or volunteers to keep it going, he said.

“Of course, that would require the exhibits and everything else to stay. We do not know if they intend to move any of those exhibits and other things that are there out of the museum,” he said. “We are pushing really hard to obviously leave that here. That’s the direction that we’re trying to push right now.”
A historic place
The building housing the Lewis Army Museum was originally built during World War I by the Salvation Army as a guest house, known as the Red Shield Inn, to accommodate soldiers and their families.
It was “sold” to the Army in 1921 for $1 and continued to be used as such until 1973, when it became the museum. In 1979, the building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Outside the building, visitors can wander through the vehicle park where one will find a Stryker combat vehicle, Army tanks, missiles and more. Inside are displays of uniforms, weapons, military art and memorabilia associated with the U.S. Army.
In addition, the museum’s archives have documents, diaries, maps and other items related to the installation and the soldiers who trained there. A number of the items actually belonged to local veterans, and were donated in honor of their service, said Alan Archambault, who served as museum director from 1987 to 2007.
“Army Museums are the institutional memory of the Army as well as the installations and units they represent,” he said. “If the museum is closed, so much of value will be lost to posterity.”
Archambault acknowledged in an email that the primary mission of the Army is not to run museums.
“However, museums provide a very important service to the Army, providing training to today’s soldiers, honoring our veterans, and providing information to the American public about ‘their Army’,” he wrote. “I view the closure as an insult and breach of public trust to all those people who have donated memorabilia, money and volunteer hours to the museum.”
The plan
The Army Museum Enterprise will shrink from 41 museums at 29 locations to 12 field museums and four training support facilities at 12 locations, according to the Army’s June 4 announcement.
It is not due to the Department of Government Efficiency. Stars and Stripes reported that the move has been in the works for a while and the announcement said a “substantial maintenance backlog and insufficient staffing prevent our museums from reaching their fullest potential as educational and historical resources.”
“The consolidation plan ensures the widest possible access to the highest quality museums within available Army resources,” it reads.
If a museum closes, its collections, artifacts and equipment could be transferred to another museum or into storage at the museum support center at Anniston Army Depot in Alabama, which can house vehicles and aircraft, or at Fort Belvoir, in Virginia, which stores smaller items.
A closure list obtained by Task and Purpose, which reports on military-related issues, shows that in addition to the Lewis Army Museum, other museums targeted for closure include those at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico; Fort Stewart, Georgia; Fort Leavenworth, Kansas; Fort Carson, Colorado; Fort Leavenworth, Kansas; Fort Knox, Kentucky; Camp Humphreys in South Korea and the 2nd Cavalry Regiment Museum in Vilseck, Germany.
Archambault said the senior chain of command had suggested at least twice before closing Army museums or contracting them out. He noted the Army would face costs for inventorying, shipping and storing collections from the facilities if they are shuttered.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/army-museum-jblm-1024x569.jpg,,,2025-07-01 08:04:38.177986

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Hunters, hikers and outdoors lovers of all stripes mounted a campaign this month against a Republican proposal to sell off millions of acres of federal public land.
The public outcry was so forceful that the measure’s sponsor pledged to scale back the proposal. Then on Saturday, before an initial U.S. Senate vote on Republicans’ tax and spending cuts package, he withdrew it altogether.
But even though the land sales proposal was defeated, experts say federal lands face a slew of other threats from President Donald Trump’s administration. Agency leaders have proposed rolling back the “Roadless Rule” that protects 58 million acres from logging and other uses. Trump’s Justice Department has issued a legal opinion that the president is allowed to abolish national monuments. Regulators have moved to slash environmental rules to ramp up logging and oil and gas production. And Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce have gutted the ranks of the agencies that manage federal lands.
“This is not over even if the sell-off proposal doesn’t make it,” said John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration. “The whole thing about leasing or selling timber or throwing them open to mining claims, that’s a form of partial privatization. It’s pretty much a giveaway.”
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum has repeatedly described public lands as America’s “balance sheet.” He has argued that some lands could be used to provide housing, while calling for an expansion of mining and oil and gas drilling to increase their economic output.
“President Trump’s energy dominance vision will end those wars abroad, will make life more affordable for every family in America by driving down inflation,” Burgum said before his confirmation hearing.
Public lands advocates are bracing for ongoing battles for the rest of Trump’s term in office. They expect Republicans to add last-minute public lands amendments to other bills moving through Congress, and for land management agencies to attempt to strip protections from other federal lands. Given the vocal backlash to the initial sell-off plan, advocates expect future attempts to be shaped behind closed doors and advanced with little time for opponents to mount a defense.
Meanwhile, they expect states to play a key role in shaping those battles. In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, many leaders from both parties view public lands as special places open to all Americans and critical for clean water, wildlife and tourism. But some conservatives resent the fact that large portions of their states are managed by officials in Washington, D.C., limiting development and private enterprise.
Officials in some states, including Idaho, Utah and Wyoming, have pushed lawsuits or resolutions seeking to force the feds to hand over huge amounts of land. Public land experts say the lawmakers behind those efforts will likely press harder now that Trump is in the White House. Such state-level takeover attempts could shape the proposals that emerge from Trump’s allies in Washington.
 Sell-off proposal

The firestorm over federal lands exploded when U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, introduced legislation that would force the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 3.3 million acres of land. The measure also would direct the agencies to make more than 250 million additional acres eligible for sale.

“We’ve never seen a threat on this magnitude ever,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “There’s been an overwhelming amount of opposition. We’ve seen record-breaking engagement on this issue.”
Lee, a longtime federal lands opponent, claimed the lands were needed for housing and argued the government has been a poor manager of its land.
“Washington has proven time and again it can’t manage this land,” Lee said earlier this month when announcing the proposal. “This bill puts it in better hands.”
But a wide-ranging coalition of opponents argued that the proposal had no protections to ensure the lands would be used for affordable housing, and that many of the parcels eligible for sale had little housing potential. A furious social media campaign highlighted cherished hiking trails, fishing lakes and ski slopes that were in danger of being sold, urging people to call their lawmakers to oppose the measure.
In recent days, Montana Republican U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, as well as Idaho Republican U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch, came out in opposition to the land sale proposal. That put into question whether Lee’s legislation could earn even a simple majority.
Then the Senate parliamentarian ruled the sell-off could not be included in the reconciliation bill without a 60-vote majority. That ruling came a day after Lee posted on social media that he would be making changes to the bill in response to concerns from Hunter Nation, a nonprofit whose board includes Donald Trump Jr.
Lee released a scaled-back measure last week that would exempt national forest lands but would direct the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 1.2 million acres. It would require land for sale to be within five miles of a population center and developed to provide housing.
Public land advocates say Lee’s changes did little to assuage their concerns. They argue that federal land sales or transfers should happen through the current, long-standing process, which requires local stakeholder input and directs the proceeds from land sales to be reinvested into conservation and public access on other parcels.
“It’s the overwhelming belief of hunters and anglers that the budget reconciliation process is not the appropriate vehicle for public land sales,” said O’Dea, with the hunting and fishing group.
On Saturday evening, Lee announced that he was withdrawing the proposal, saying that Senate rules did not allow him to include protections that land would not be sold to foreign interests. But he pledged to continue the battle over federal land ownership, working with Trump to “put underutilized federal land to work for American families.”
 States’ role

While the sell-off proposal aligned with some state officials’ goal of taking over federal lands, some lands experts say private developers would have been the real winner.

“If the lands are transferred to the states without money, the states lose,” said Leshy, the former Interior Department official. “It’s a hit on their budget, which means they’re gonna have to sell them off. If states got a significant amount of public lands, a lot of that would end up in private hands.”
In Utah, where leaders have made the most aggressive push to take over federal lands, lawmakers argue that they could raise lease prices for oil and gas operations, bringing in enough revenue to cover the state’s management costs.
“The policy of the state is to keep these lands open and available to the public,” Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican, told Stateline last month.
O’Dea pointed to an economic analysis of what it would cost Montana to take over federal lands. The report found it would cost the state $8 billion over 20 years to take on wildfire management, deferred maintenance and mine reclamation. He noted that many Western states have sold off a majority of the “trust lands” they were granted at statehood, undermining claims that a state takeover would leave lands in the public domain.
 Other proposals

While Lee’s land sales proposal has gotten the biggest headlines, public land advocates are fighting a multifront battle against the Trump administration’s moves to roll back the protected status of certain lands, slash environmental rules, and expand logging, mining and drilling operations.
“The approach is to throw as much as you can at the wall and see what sticks,” O’Dea said. “There’s only so much you can mobilize opposition to. There’s a huge risk that some of these things could fly under the radar.”
Some conservative states and industry groups say Trump is allowing federal lands to be used to their full economic potential. Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, a Republican, said his constituents are “keenly aware of how the federal government’s ownership of 60 percent of Alaska’s lands can inhibit economic development and cause challenges for our communities.”
Leshy noted that public lands have proven to be a popular cause, but Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce could undermine public confidence that the federal government is capable of managing the land.
“if you make it terrible for long enough, maybe people say, ‘The feds shouldn’t be managing this, they do such a bad job,’” he said.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)NJ Transit users will pay more to use the agency’s trains and buses starting Tuesday when a 3% fare increase its board of directors approved last year goes into effect.
The hike is expected to allow NJ Transit to collect nearly $1 billion in farebox revenue, and it comes after last year’s double-digit fare increase. Critics have called the back-to-back fare hikes unfair to NJ Transit riders.
“Fares are best increased in small increments over long periods of time. So to have a 15% and then a 3% right after that is too much, especially when wages are not increasing at the same rates,” Alex Ambrose, policy analyst at progressive think tank New Jersey Policy Perspective, told the New Jersey Monitor.
NJ Transit spokesman Jim Smith in a statement defended the fare hikes, saying smaller, predictable increases allow the agency to better keep pace with annual cost increases.
“This allows us to continue to operate full service while making necessary improvements to the customer experience and maintaining the ability to respond to evolving needs,” Smith said.
Smith noted that in the last two years, multiple private bus companies abandoned dozens of routes with little notice that NJ Transit was able to absorb.
NJ Transit has faced fiscal challenges in recent years, with state lawmakers last year approving a new business surtax aimed at generating revenue for the agency. This year’s 3% fare hike was approved last year as part of a plan to increase fares annually.
Critics have said even with that revenue stream, the state has not funded NJ Transit at adequate levels, leading to worse service that discourages riders from using it.
“Lawmakers have not prioritized transit and have left it underfunded, which has led to fewer people taking it, which has led to less fare revenue, etcetera, etcetera,” Ambrose said.
Talia Crawford with advocacy group Tri-State Transportation Campaign told the New Jersey Monitor that the state needs a new funding source for transportation.
“Working-class families who are dependent on New Jersey Transit can’t afford a 3% increase every single year,” Crawford said. “It’s a lot of money, especially with rising costs of living, including my child care, housing, health care — everything is increasing.”
NJ Transit has proposed a $3.2 billion operating budget for the fiscal year that begins Tuesday.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida lawmakers spent much of the 2025 legislative session at odds with each other, causing several education bills to be delayed until the last scheduled day of session and jammed into two major packages. 
These resulting laws are set to go into effect on Tuesday, July 1:
SB 1070: Electrocardiograms for student athletes
The bill unanimously passed both chambers following emotional committee testimony from parents of children who died from heart conditions. 
SB 1070 requires student athletes to complete an electrocardiogram, a screening used to detect heart conditions. Students with abnormal results would need clearance from a medical practitioner to participate in sports. Under the law, electrocardiograms are not mandated if schools cannot offer them to families for less than $50 per student, and districts are encouraged to seek out partnerships to provide the services for families that can’t afford them. The bill does not begin the requirement until the 2026-2027 school year, but implementation starts this summer.
Martha Lopez-Anderson lost her son when he was 10 years old to a heart condition.
“Like so many parents, I had no idea that an undetected heart condition could silently take a child’s life with no warning,” Lopez-Anderson, director of Parent Heart Watch, said, calling the bill a “bold step in shifting from reaction to prevention.”
Hearings for the bill were heavily attended by parents whose children died from heart conditions. House staff passed around tissues to the audience during their testimony, for example, in the House Education & Employment committee.
Maruchi Mendez, mother of Ramiro Mendez, a Florida International University baseball pitcher who died from cardiomyopathy in 2000, shared her story with committee members.
“What is the price of a student athlete’s life?” Mendez said. “This month, here in the walls of the Capitol of our beautiful state of Florida and from all of your hearts, we shall know the answer.”
HB 1607: CPR 
This builds on existing graduation requirements, requiring schools to provide CPR and first aid training in middle school and high school. By July 1, 2027, all public schools must have one automated external defibrillator (AED) on their grounds. The bill requires schools to develop emergency staff training for cardiac arrest. 
Schools are already mandated to teach CPR in grades 9 and 11 and encouraged to do so in middle school. Schools that participate in Florida High School Athletic Association sports are already required to have an AED.
SB 1514: Anaphylaxis
The bill requires “an adequate number” of charter and traditional public school personnel to be trained to respond to allergic reactions, including administering epinephrine, a medication that treats allergic reactions. 
SB 1470: School safety
SB 1470 changes previous school safety legislation that Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd called “clunky and difficult to understand and easy to violate it even without the intent to violate it.” The bill creates exceptions for classes like welding that need ample ventilation from door-locking laws and allows temporary locks, among other things.
SB 248: School sports
This bill allows home school students to participate in sports at any public school in the district they live in and allows private school students to play sports at public schools if their school does not offer the sport.
SB 296: School start times
The bill essentially rescinds 2023 legislative action. The 2025 Legislature chose to not require districts to conform to previously enacted law that is set to go into effect in 2026 that would make schools start their days later. Districts pushed back against the old law, saying it would be too costly to implement. Now, if schools submit reasoning for not being able to start later, they do not have to comply.
SB 1374: Employee reporting 
School boards may temporarily remove personnel from the classroom within 24 hours after learning that an employee has been arrested on a felony or misdemeanor charge. It requires school employees and administrators to self-report within 48 hours any felony or misdemeanor arrest.
SB 356: Holocaust Remembrance
SB 356 requires the governor to declare Jan. 27 of each year as Holocaust Remembrance Day. Schools may observe the day by teaching students about the effects of the Holocaust and positive contributions by the Jewish community. The state has required instruction on the Holocaust since 1994.
HB 447: Disability History and Awareness
Florida law already designates the first two weeks of October as Disability History and Awareness Weeks, when schools may teach about the history of disability and the disability rights movement.
If schools teach disability history and awareness, they are now required to teach about bullying and physical disabilities from grades K-3, autism spectrum disorder from 4-6, hearing impairments from 7-9, and learning and intellectual disabilities from 10-12 under this law. Schools are not required to provide instruction on disability awareness, however.
The bill is named the Evin B. Hartsell Act, after a Floridian diagnosed with muscular dystrophy who died in 2018. The Department of Education may consult with the Evin B. Hartsell Foundation to develop learning materials.
HB 549 and 575: Gulf of America
These two bills address a change made through an executive order from President Donald Trump. They require state agencies and schools to buy new materials saying “Gulf of America” instead of “Gulf of Mexico.” HB 575 changes all statutes with references to the “Gulf of Mexico” to “Gulf of America.”
HB 809: Social workers
The bill exempts school social workers from general knowledge mastery otherwise required in educator certification. The exemption, according to the bill analysis, is justified because social workers already are required to hold master’s degrees.
HB 85: Walking conditions
The bill expands the criteria for what constitutes a hazardous condition for students walking to school, creating more transportation options for those who otherwise would be walking next to busy roadways. 
HB 1145: Workforce development
The bill provides charter schools with Workforce Development Capitalization Incentive Grant Program money. The money is used to create or expand programs that lead to industry certifications by buying equipment, hiring personnel, and more. It has an indeterminate fiscal impact, according to the bill analysis.

As previously covered by the Phoenix, the waning days of the scheduled session produced two larger education packages with several components each:
HB 1255
The 83-page bill includes provisions addressing opioid antagonist administration at school, requires high schoolers to learn about the cost of college before they graduate, and renames Hillsborough Community College as Hillsborough College.
The bill requires parents to approve school administration of corporal punishment of their children.
Some lawmakers said they were not aware corporal punishment still existed in Florida, but, during the 2023-2024 school year, 17 school districts reported 516 instances of corporal punishment, according to Department of Education data. Principals are responsible for developing corporal punishment policy and state law requires that more than one adult be present when corporal punishment is being inflicted. 
HB 1105
The bill, among other things, implements a high school bell-to-bell phone ban pilot study in six counties and outright bans phone use for elementary and middle school students during the school day statewide. It allows law enforcement to arrest someone for trespassing on a school bus. 
HB 1105 eliminates certificates of completion, which had been granted for students who earn the credits to graduate but too low a grade point average or failure in required math and reading assessments. Lawmakers approved removing the certificate, saying it provided no real benefit in securing a student a job and repeal might incentivize some students to achieve a high school diploma, instead.
Students with autism could have a better chance of securing employment under this bill, which creates a workforce credential for students with autism to prove to employers they are proficient in certain skills, particularly workplace safety. 
This bill allows students who participate in two years of marching band to count that toward the one-credit physical education requirement. Existing law allows two full seasons of varsity or junior varsity sports to count toward the physical education requirement.
In the final packages were provisions lowering the threshold needed to turn a low-performing traditional public school into a “job-engine” charter school — one meant to attract jobs to a community — and another that includes charter schools as recipients of local government infrastructure surtaxes.
Existing law requires more than 50% of teachers and parents both to vote to convert a traditional public school into a job-engine charter school. The Legislature voted, over Democrats’ protests, to eliminate the need teacher approval and rely on parent approval instead.

At Easterseals Midwest, we support people with disabilities to live independently, find meaningful employment, get support in their everyday lives, and more.
The families we support are doing everything right—showing up for work, caring for loved ones, and making sure their children get the support they need. For many of them, Medicaid is the foundation that makes it all possible.
That foundation is now under threat.
Last week, Senate Republicans introduced a reconciliation bill that proposes deep and dangerous cuts to Medicaid –  a vital lifeline for Missourians with disabilities and the people who take care of them. Rather than improving on the already harmful House version of the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” the Senate proposal goes even further, jeopardizing services that help people live independently and access critical care.
If passed, this legislation would devastate Missouri’s ability to deliver home and community-based services. It would increase waitlists, reduce access to care, and leave thousands of individuals and families without the support they need. Any federal funding cut would force Missouri to reduce its Medicaid investment, placing even more strain on an already overburdened system.
At Easterseals, we support more than 20,000 people and families across the Midwest every year. We see the power of consistent care and know how fragile the progress becomes when families face bureaucratic red tape and unaffordable costs.
Let’s be clear: Medicaid is essential. It supports more than just people with disabilities. It is a lifeline for parents, caregivers, therapists, educators, and direct care workers. In rural areas and regions with limited healthcare options, Medicaid is often the only access point for critical services. When it becomes harder to access, the consequences ripple across entire communities.
The proposed federal changes would cut off care for millions. It’s projected that 576,000 children and 110,000 people with disabilities could lose coverage. That doesn’t include caregivers, undiagnosed individuals, and others who depend on the system. And while some lawmakers argue for “work requirements,” the reality is most Medicaid recipients who can work already do. These proposals add red tape that causes people to lose care. Ironically, the Medicaid work requirement could cost the economy up to 449,000 jobs.
Beyond individual lives, Medicaid supports the broader health and stability of our communities. It helps prevent costly emergency room visits, reduces hospitalizations, and supports a vital workforce of healthcare professionals and caregivers.
Missouri’s senators Josh Hawley and Eric Schmitt now face a critical decision that will directly affect the health, safety, and dignity of people with disabilities and the strength of Missouri families.
Instead of making Medicaid harder to access, Congress should invest in the systems that keep families healthy, employed, and hopeful.
Medicaid is one of the most effective tools we have to strengthen families and communities. It helps children grow and learn, allows caregivers to stay employed, and gives older adults and people with disabilities the chance to live independently. Weakening that system threatens the progress we’ve made toward opportunity for all.
Missouri deserves better. Our families deserve better. Senators Hawley and Schmitt must vote NO on any legislation that cuts Medicaid.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/medicaidhealthinsuranceform-1024x608.jpg,,,2025-07-01 07:00:42.685367

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)President Donald Trump’s energy emergency declaration, enacted through a Jan. 20 executive order, has drawn frequent criticism from environmentalists who argue the order serves as a front to expand the use of fossil fuels over clean energy resources. Now 15 states, including Michigan, are suing the Trump administration, arguing the emergency order could bring them serious harm. 
The states, each represented by Democratic attorneys general, brought action on behalf of their residents and natural resources, arguing the federal government’s use of emergency permitting procedures bypass critical ecological, historical and cultural resource reviews.
“The Executive Order is unlawful, and its commands that federal agencies disregard the law and in many cases their own regulations to fast-track extensive categories of activities will result in damage to waters, wetlands, critical habitat, historic and cultural resources, endangered species, and the people and wildlife that rely on these precious resources,” the lawsuit reads. 
In response to a request for comment from Michigan Advance, White House Assistant Press Secretary Taylor Rogers reiterated the administration’s position.
“In the best interest of our economic and national security, President Trump declared a National Energy Emergency to save America’s energy industry stifled by Joe Biden’s radical climate agenda. Democrat State Officials can cry about our energy dominance while the rest of the country celebrates the lowest gas prices since 2021,” Rogers said.
While the suit acknowledges the need for infrastructure to support a reliable and affordable energy supply for the states and the nation, it argues the president’s powers are reserved for actual emergencies, noting earlier in the complaint that energy production in the U.S. is at an all time high and growing.

The shortcuts inherent in these powers undermine the rights of the states, the complaint argues, noting the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer’s regulations only authorize “emergency procedures” when normal procedures would result in unacceptable hazard to human life, significant loss of property, or immediate, unforeseen, and significant economic hardship. Federal agencies to date have limited emergency procedures to necessary projects during, or in the aftermath of natural or human-made disasters, according to the complaint. 
To prevent any potential harm, the plaintiff states asked the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington to declare the executive order unlawful and bar federal agencies from pursuing emergency permitting on non-emergency projects. 
In Michigan, Tribal Nations and environmental activists have spoken out as the Corps moves forward with emergency processing procedures for Enbridge’s Line 5 tunnel project, which would replace dual oil and natural gas pipelines running through the lakebed where Lake Michigan and Huron meet, with a new segment housed inside a concrete-lined tunnel buried beneath the bedrock. 
While the tunnel project came as part of any agreement with the state to minimize the risk of an oil spill, opponents of the project argue construction would harm nearby wetlands, while still carrying risk for an oil spill. 
The project’s public comment window came to an end on Monday.

(Getty Images)Six of Indiana’s public colleges and universities are cutting or consolidating more than 400 academic degree programs ahead of a new state law that takes effect this week, the Indiana Commission for Higher Education (CHE) announced Monday.
Officials said the “voluntary” changes target degree programs with low student participation. The cuts are intended to help students focus on more in-demand fields and to comply early with the new state budget, which now sets minimum enrollment and completion thresholds for all degree programs offered at public institutions.
Nearly one in five degree programs will be eliminated, suspended or merged across six institutions: Ball State University, Indiana State University, Indiana University, Ivy Tech Community College, Purdue University and the University of Southern Indiana.
Currently, the schools collectively offer about 3,400 academic programs, according to CHE. Of those, roughly 2,200 are degree programs at the associate, bachelor’s, master’s or doctoral level. As of Monday, 408 degree programs are on the chopping block.
Story continues below.

Gov. Mike Braun praised the move as a way to modernize Indiana’s higher education system.
“In just the past month, our state institutions have taken bold, proactive steps to increase the value of higher education for both students and families,” Braun said in a Monday afternoon statement. “This will help students make more informed decisions about the degree they want to pursue and ensure there is a direct connection between the skills students are gaining through higher education and the skills they need most.”
Examples of impacted programs include:


Indiana University Bloomington: Several undergraduate and graduate degrees in foreign languages — such as French, German, and Russian — will be suspended or consolidated.


Purdue University West Lafayette: Low-enrollment master’s and Ph.D. programs in areas like literature, microbiology and mathematics were merged or will phase out.


Ball State University: Suspended programs include an English Ph.D. program and bachelor’s in international business. exercise psychology. Multiple undergraduate education programs are also on track for consolidation.


Indiana State University: Eliminated programs include the M.A. in history and M.S. in political science.


Ivy Tech: Impacted programs include associate degrees in public safety, nanotechnology and machine repair.


University of Southern Indiana: Among the affected programs were an associate’s degree in early childhood education, the M.A. in liberal studies and an undergraduate electronic business degree.


Programs were evaluated based on enrollment and completion data. According to CHE’s latest degree reduction report, 75 programs were eliminated outright, including 68 with zero students currently enrolled. Another 101 were suspended, and 232 were consolidated or merged into other academic offerings.
The bulk of the cuts were reported at Indiana University, where 249 degree programs will be affected. Purdue University followed with 83 programs. Ball State submitted 51 programs, and Indiana State reported 11. Ivy Tech, the state’s two-year community college system, is taking action on 10 programs. The University of Southern Indiana reported four.
Students currently enrolled in any of the eliminated or suspended programs will be allowed to finish their degrees through a teach-out process, officials said.
After July 1, colleges must seek commission approval to continue offering underperforming programs that fall below statutory benchmarks.

Bob Ferguson, center, met with several statewide elected officials in June to discuss how federal funding cuts under discussion in Congress and by the Trump administration could impact the state. (Photo courtesy of Washington governor’s office)Slow revenue growth continues to pinch state budgets across the country, leading governors to propose spending cuts, hiring freezes and some tax increases.
In its spring survey of states, the National Association of State Budget Officers found that general fund spending will hold steady in fiscal 2026 as states expect limited revenue growth but increased costs.
Though most states are meeting or exceeding 2025 revenue projections, a growing number are downgrading their revenue expectations for the next fiscal year, Shelby Kerns, executive director of the national association, said in a news release.
“In a number of states, we’re seeing expenditure projections outpacing revenue growth, forcing policymakers to make hard choices in order to balance their budgets,” Kerns said.

States typically wrap up budget work by the end of June, with the next fiscal year beginning July 1. Kerns said the organization anticipates states may need to make mid-year budget adjustments depending on upcoming federal changes in tax policy and spending.
In recent years, many states have been flush with an influx of federal pandemic aid and strong tax revenues from a booming national economy. But with the end of pandemic aid, an uncertain economic future and deep cuts to state taxes, many lawmakers this year confronted major budget challenges in statehouses.
Just weeks after signing a budget that required deep spending cuts and increased taxes, Washington Democratic state Gov. Bob Ferguson told state agencies to prepare for even more belt tightening.
“We will very likely continue to face a challenging state budget environment in the coming year and anticipate increasing caseloads and ongoing uncertainty in the economy and federal funding,” said a June 4 memo from the governor’s budget director to agency leaders, according to the Washington State Standard.
Still, many states continue to tout major levels of reserve funds.
The National Association of State Budget Officers found at least 30 states expect to maintain a rainy-day fund balance exceeding 10% of their general fund expenditures. This year, 29 states grew their reserve funds, with the majority of states expected to continue to grow their savings next fiscal year.
In Tennessee, general fund revenue growth is slowing, but state leaders were able to rely on $1.5 billion in unspent state funds and $700 million in interest earnings from federal pandemic funds, the Tennessee Lookout reported.
“Despite tighter fiscal conditions, states overall remain in a solid fiscal position with rainy day funds at near all-time highs, low debt levels, and strong credit ratings,” David Thurman, Tennessee’s budget director and current association president, said in the group’s news release.

Traditionally, most new laws passed by the Idaho Legislature would have taken effect on July 1, when the new fiscal year kicks in. However, over the past five years, legislators have increasingly been attaching so-called “emergency clauses” to bills that make them take effect as soon as they are signed into law by the governor.
Now there are a mix of laws that take effect when they are signed into law in the spring and laws that take effect July 1.
 State of Idaho prepares for new budget year to begin as revenue lags behind projections

State officials will closely monitor the process for closing the books on the current fiscal year 2025 budget. As of May, state revenue was running $141 million below the revenue projection Idaho legislators built into the budget. The state was still projected to end fiscal year 2025 with a positive ending cash balance, but that projected ending balance has shrunk from $420 million to an estimated $278 million since the 2025 legislative session adjourned April 4, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
Although state officials say Idaho’s economy is healthy, Idaho Gov. Brad Little’s budget office asked state agencies to internally prepare for potential midyear budget holdbacks of up to 6%, Idaho Education News reported. 
Idaho Division of Financial Management Administrator Lori Wolff said that even though revenue came in below forecast, Idaho is still seeing year-over-year growth in revenue, which signals a healthy economy.
“Idaho also has 22% of general fund revenues in rainy day funds, greater than almost every other state,” Wolff said in a written statement June 12. “While we continue to watch revenue closely, we feel good about the strength of the state budget and our economy.”
After year-end budget transfers and reconciliation procedures are complete, state officials should have a better understanding of the final fiscal year 2025 budget numbers later in July or in August. 
 



 Here’s a look at five new laws taking effect this week in Idaho

House Bill 7: This bill creates a new mandatory minimum fine of $300 for adults convicted of possessing less than three ounces of marijuana. Republican legislators who supported the law said it is a way to be tough on marijuana and distinguish Idaho from neighboring states like Washington, Montana, Oregon and Nevada where recreational cannabis is legal. 
House Bill 322: This bill increases the salaries for judges in Idaho. Before the 2025 legislative session, Idaho Supreme Court justices encouraged the Idaho Legislature to raise pay for judges, saying that pay for Idaho judges was among the lowest in the nation and pay was so low that many judges who announced their retirement returned to practice law as attorneys, where they could make more money. The new law raises the pay for each judicial position in Idaho by $17,000 per year. 
House Bill 205: This bill allows drivers to exceed the speed limit when they are using the passing lane to pass another vehicle on roads and highways outside of city limits with a speed limit of at least 55 mph. The law does not apply to vehicles passing on the right side.
Previously, state law allowed drivers to exceed the speed limit when they were passing on a two-lane road. The new bill adds passing lanes to that section of law. 
Senate Bill 1099: This bill provides for a mandatory minimum prison sentence of five years for a person who has previously been found guilty of driving under the influence and is again found guilty of DUI, along with vehicular manslaughter.
Senate Bill 1141: This bill establishes a statewide ban on sleeping in public places. The law bans public camping and sleeping on public property in Idaho cities with a population of at least 100,000 people. Some nonprofit organizations are concerned the law will create additional hardships for people experiencing homelessness in Idaho.
“There’s a lot of ambiguity about how this law will be enforced locally,” said Connor O’Hora, outreach team lead for the Boise-based housing nonprofit CATCH, in a written statement. “But what we do know is that it will disproportionately affect those who have no other place to go. Our immediate focus is getting people emergency supplies and protecting their health and safety in the heat.”
Senate Bill 1144: This bill adds a new section to state law that requires that, for new and existing highway projects, existing or new bicycle and pedestrian facilities may only be improved as a secondary or collateral benefit to any highway project, or to improve safety near schools, parks or other areas designated for bicycles and pedestrians.
 One notable Idaho law takes effect a year from now

One law, House Bill 37, takes effect in a year on July 1, 2026. That law makes it so that that firing squad will become the primary method of execution in Idaho, not lethal injection. 
Idaho Department of Correction officials have previously said they have had a difficult time obtaining chemicals to carry out a lethal injection. And in 2024, the state was unable to carry out the scheduled execution of death row inmate Thomas Creech after officials were unable to establish an IV line, the Sun previously reported.

(Getty Images)Participation in Indiana’s Choice Scholarship Program grew by about 8.5% in the 2024-25 school year — marking a slowdown after record-setting enrollment growth in prior years. 
Even so, state spending reached nearly half a billion dollars on the private school voucher program, according to a new report released by the Indiana Department of Education (IDOE). That’s up from $439 million spent on the program during the 2023-24 school year. 
The latest round of taxpayer-funded scholarships totaled roughly $497.2 million, representing a 13.2% increase compared to what the state paid the previous year. And despite an enrollment slowdown, more Hoosier students than ever before are participating — and more schools are accepting vouchers, too.
In total, 76,067 students received a Choice Scholarship during the 2024-25 school year, up from 70,095 in 2023-24. The number of private schools participating in the program also rose, from 357 to 373.
Voucher student breakdown
The average award in 2024-25 was $6,536. Vouchers are calculated as either 90% of a student’s local public school funding or the full amount of their private school tuition and fees, whichever is less. 
But participating schools reported an average tuition of $8,369 — meaning most families still paid out-of-pocket beyond the voucher amount.
More than 54,700 students received the 90% public-funding amount, per the IDOE report. Roughly 21,300 students received scholarships that covered their full tuition.
Story continues below.
2024-2025-Annual-Choice-Report
 
More than 45% of participating private schools now charge over $7,000 per year in tuition and fees, while fewer schools offer tuition below $5,000, according to the state report.
As a result, scholarships did not cover the full cost of tuition for 54,767 students enrolled in the voucher program, meaning families were responsible for paying a combined $133.9 million out-of-pocket for school costs. That amounts to an average of $2,447 per student.
The report additionally noted that if all voucher recipients had instead attended their traditional public public schools, the state would have spent approximately $567.8 million on their education. That’s because vouchers are paid at a lower amount than public school funding.
But many students have never attended public school, meaning the state obligation is new.
The majority of voucher users in the last school year — nearly 70% — had no record of attending a public school in Indiana, an increase of about three percentage points from 2023-24. The IDOE report said the rise was likely attributed to “students who were already enrolled at their Choice school now qualifying without prior attendance at an Indiana public school.”
Retention rates are up. About 76.8% of students who used a voucher in 2023-24 returned to the program this year, compared to 64.3% the year before.


Data shows white students make up the majority of voucher users at 64.29%. Hispanic students account for 17.53% of voucher participants, while Black students make up just shy of 8.82%. Those demographics are similar to the prior school year.
The latest data further reported that the average family income among voucher recipients was $102,843 — well below the income ceiling of roughly $230,000 for a family of four, but 50% higher than the annual income for an average Hoosier family, which is estimated to be about $70,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
State spending goes up — but so do school costs
Indiana lawmakers have steadily expanded the program since it launched in 2011, making it one of the largest voucher systems in the nation — and among the first to go fully universal. 
Ahead of the 2023-24 school year, participation surged by more than 30% after state lawmakers lifted income caps to include nearly all Indiana families. 
The expansion boosted funding from $311 million to $439 million in a single year and made vouchers are available to Hoosiers earning up to 400% of the amount required for a student to qualify for the free or reduced-price lunch program, or roughly $230,000. Only 3.5% of Indiana families were estimated to have annual incomes above those eligibility guidelines.
The incoming ceiling was removed entirely during the most recent legislative session and allows all Hoosier families to tap into private school voucher dollars beginning with the 2025-26 academic year.
The previous two-year state budget passed in 2023 allocated more than $1 billion for Choice Scholarships. The new biennial budget, which takes effect Tuesday, earmarked more than $1.2 billion. Voucher enrollment for the upcoming school year, along with total program costs, are still to be determined, however.

  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Feeding images to those monitors are 160-plus cameras overlooking the central village area, less than one square mile of the reservation, including tribal administrative and commercial businesses.
There’s a good chance there isn’t another northern Wisconsin public space with such a high concentration of cameras or a staff to monitor the live images that are also recorded and stored for a minimum of 30 days.
A post on the tribe’s Facebook page by Clinton D. Isham, first revealed the extent of the tribe’s surveillance capabilities to the Wisconsin Examiner. 
“Bro, all those cameras that the Tribal police put up better pay off. Police want to do surveillance on Indians to lock us up, but can’t use them to protect us,” Isham wrote.
Isham’s comment was directed at why those 160-plus cameras at LDF didn’t record any image of Melissa Beson, 37, a tribal member who was last seen on the reservation on March 17 – the site where Beson was last seen was just outside the area of the cameras.
LDF Tribal Police Chief T.J. Bill said there’s another tribe in the Midwest interested in replicating what LDF has created as a way to improve safety for tribal members.
The significant investment at LDF in surveillance prompted the question of whether other Wisconsin tribes have also secured surveillance systems to address safety concerns and whether they are considering acquiring additional surveillance technology.
The Examiner reached  out to most of the other 11 federally recognized Wisconsin tribes about their surveillance, and along with LDF, three others responded: Oneida, Lac Courte Oreilles (LCO), and St. Croix.
Police chiefs of the four tribes said it appears that there is a high interest in using surveillance technology among the tribes, particularly a technology called Flock. 
Overall, the police chiefs said tribal members are supportive of using surveillance technology, including a reported survey by one tribe that tallied over 80% support by its members.
While law enforcement officials said the use of surveillance technology and implementation of the Flock system was broadly popular among tribal members, the expansion of surveillance capabilities has drawn controversy elsewhere in Wisconsin. 
The Milwaukee Police Department and Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Department have recently been at the center of a debate about the use of surveillance cameras and Flock. 
“It is critical that our community has a say in if and how invasive surveillance technologies are used, how they are deployed against residents, if and how their data is stored and shared with third parties, and whether spending our limited tax dollars on surveillance technologies is the best way to promote public safety,” the ACLU of Wisconsin wrote in a May letter to the Milwaukee Common Council. 
Lac du Flambeau
Bill, the LDF tribal police chief, who began working with the tribe in 2013, stated that the surveillance system was already in place when he joined the department. He said that employees of the tribe’s IT department did the wiring and placement of the cameras, mostly between 2010 and 2011.
“It was directed by the tribal government, the tribal council, who wanted it for the protection of the people, for the safety of the public,” said Bill.
Bill said he didn’t know the motivation behind the creation of the surveillance system but noted that the LDF police department has been at the forefront of using technology and was one of the first law enforcement agencies in the area that had officers wearing body cameras.
“We don’t have 24/7 coverage,” he said of the cameras being monitored by staff, “but we strategically place them (staff) during the busy times, so it all depends on what’s going on, what our crime statistics tell us.”
Besides the 160 cameras, the tribe’s casino has its own internal surveillance system, which the casino monitors, a typical feature for casinos. The nearby LDF K-12 school also has its own surveillance system, which the police department can access and monitor.
With all the cameras in the LDF police department’s inventory, Beson wasn’t recorded because she was last seen in an area where there are no cameras. Bill said there have been efforts to put up remote cameras to monitor using cellular coverage, but cellular coverage is poor in the reservation and the county.
“We can’t rely on cellular-based equipment, especially during the summertime when our population goes from 4,000 individuals to 50,000 (including tourists and seasonal residents) because everyone is on their cell phones,” he said. “The cell service is horrible here in the Northwoods, so we have to rely on something else because we tried cameras in remote locations outside of the community where we can’t hook up electricity or fiber, and it doesn’t work.”
The Wisconsin Department of Criminal Investigation (DCI) helped LDF set up a surveillance camera on Highway 70 near a former hotel that was being used for drug sales and possible human trafficking, but because that camera used a cellular connection, it wasn’t reliable.
Bill said the tribe has used recorded surveillance video to prosecute several offenses, including a string of burglaries.
“We went through the surveillance cameras and we found a couple of different vehicles, and we located one vehicle of interest and were able to track that vehicle through town, even though it was nighttime, and we were able to make an arrest for the burglaries,” he said.
They’ve also made several drug arrests using surveillance images.
“We’re able to watch individuals who make transactions,” he said. “The cameras are so good that we’re able to see into the cars where they’re doing the deals and catch them. We see the money exchanged in the car and a package delivered to the other person.”
A live feed from the convenience store showed a man lifting his wallet out of his pants and a small baggie with a white substance falling out, which alerted one of the monitors.
“He walked out of there and didn’t realize he had dropped it,” said Bill. “We went over there and we picked it up and it was a bag of cocaine.” Later, the man was charged with possession.
The big question is, do all the cameras make people safer, and do they deter crime?
Bill said the serious drug dealers know about the cameras and stay out of that area, but there are still some who forget about the cameras or think they hide their actions, but that’s pretty difficult when there are 160-plus cameras in such a concentrated area.
“For the most part, in my opinion, it is a deterrent,” he said. “To those we have arrested and interviewed, they’ll say they are doing the crimes, the transactions, outside the area of the cameras because they are everywhere, so it is a deterrent for them not to do their activity directly in the community, so they take their criminal activity outside that area.”
Having recorded digital evidence, said Bill, helps prosecute offenses.
“You go to court and you provide the evidence, that’s a huge part, not only to help with the investigation but also to protect the officer from allegations.”
Bill said there is support for expanding the surveillance system. This summer, the tribe is looking at using recently laid fiber optic lines to expand the system, allowing cameras to provide coverage of the more rural areas of the reservation such as where Beson was last seen.
Bill said there haven’t been complaints from tribal members over a lack of privacy or a “Big Brother” complaint about being observed by authorities when they are in the village area of the reservation.
“You get a complaint here and there, but it’s very few,” he said. “We don’t get the Big Brother concern. Overall, the community is in support of it.”
Oneida Nation
Eric Boulanger is the chief of police for the Oneida Nation in Northeast Wisconsin near Green Bay.
According to Boulanger, Oneida has a Security Department that is part of the tribe’s gaming commission that monitors cameras in parking lots outside the casino and several different businesses and buildings, and the school has a security department that monitors cameras within the school that the police also have the ability to access.
Over two years ago, Oneida also invested in four Flock cameras for use by the police department, which uses cameras and computers to record and track license plates. With Flock, Oneida has also integrated with the larger Flock system, which allows for searching and tracking vehicles in other communities.
Boulanger said what drove the investment in Flock is the positive reports from other local law enforcement.
“It’s a great law enforcement tool in general, not just for Oneida but any community that uses them,” said Boulanger. “It’s a fairly advanced system, and you’re able to search for vehicles and plates and that sort of thing. It lets you know if what you’re looking for is in your area.”
He added, “If you have an incident and you have any sort of vehicle description or if you have a suspect and you know their vehicle information, you can enter that into the system and then it’ll give you feedback on whether or not that vehicle was in your area.”
He added, “If you’re looking for a white Ford Bronco, you can put those parameters in there, and then they’ll show you pictures of those vehicles in a particular area.”
He was asked if the four Flock cameras are sufficient to cover the reservation.
“In the future, we may expand it,” he said. “Everything comes with a cost. They’re not real affordable, but you know where we have them placed, and with the other agencies in the area and the ability to use theirs, there’s pretty good coverage right now of our main thoroughfares, and highly trafficked areas.”
Asked if the surveillance cameras and Flock cameras help deter crime at Oneida, he said, “Well, you would think they would, but there are still plenty of people doing stuff they shouldn’t be doing.” 
“The cameras aren’t hidden, so it’s quite obvious and it’s posted, the areas under surveillance, “but people still do what they’re going to do. So, I mean, I would imagine it would deter some people, but obviously, it doesn’t deter everybody.”
He noted that recorded footage is very useful in the prosecution of a crime.
“Jurors and judges and prosecutors and defense attorneys like to have video,” he said. “It’s kind of hard to dispute a claim on either side if there is video.”
Boulanger hasn’t heard objections to the surveillance cameras or Flock.
“I haven’t heard any specific comments, nobody has directly addressed concerns with me about it, but I feel our community is pretty public safety cautious, so I think they’re probably more on the side of in favor of it than anybody would be against,” he said.
Lac Courte Oreilles
The Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indian Tribal Chief Susie Taylor said the tribal police doesn’t have a surveillance system of cameras operated by the police department or a special security department. Still, police have used footage from the casino for investigations, and the K-12 school does have its own surveillance system of cameras.
She notes that former chief of police Tim DeBrot was instrumental in securing Flock cameras for the tribe, which were placed earlier this year.
Taylor said the Flock cameras record and track information about vehicles, but they will not be used for speeding violations. She said the primary use is in the investigation of crimes.
In March, Taylor put out a press release about the Flock cameras that was printed in the Lac Courte Oreilles News:
“Flock cameras are designed to enhance public safety by capturing objective evidence, including license plate information, to help law enforcement prevent and solve crimes. These cameras do not use facial recognition and are not intended for traffic enforcement. Instead, they serve as a valuable investigative tool to identify stolen vehicles, locate missing children and adults, and deter criminal activity.”
In the press release, Taylor noted that the data from the cameras is stored and then deleted after a certain number of days if it is not being used in an investigation, and access to the information is limited to “authorized personnel” and not used for “surveillance or tracking individuals without cause.”
She also noted to the Wisconsin Examiner that the Flock cameras, by tying into the larger network of cameras, allow for the sharing of information across jurisdictional boundaries.
“Many other law enforcement agencies across the country have implemented Flock cameras due to their effectiveness in reducing crime and enhancing community safety,” she said.
She noted there are Flock cameras off the region’s major highway, Highway 53, located in Washburn County, that would be very effective in helping track a vehicle that had been on the reservation in Sawyer County.
Joe Morey, public relations director for LCO, said a survey of tribal members had been conducted regarding the use of surveillance technology, and over 80% of respondents were in support.
St. Croix
Of the four tribes, the St. Croix Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians has the least investment and deployment of surveillance equipment.
According to police chief Donnie Holmes, in 2014-15, the St. Croix Tribal Police Department began using body cameras.
Holmes said his office will place stand-alone cameras to address individual complaints or for investigations.  As an example, he mentioned that there were complaints at the Sand Lake basketball court and parking area, where robberies had occurred, so cameras were installed on the assumption that the criminals might return.
Individual tribal businesses have their own security system for recording video that could be used for an investigation or prosecution.
“Super expensive,” Holmes said of the cost of implementing a surveillance system for St. Croix similar to LDF’s or even Oneida’s. He said for St. Croix it would be even more of a challenge in that the reservation is located in pockets of land over four different counties: Burnett, Barron, Douglas and Polk.
However, St. Croix is exploring the acquisition of Flock cameras. The biggest factor against proceeding is the cost.
Holmes appreciates the capability of Flock cameras, especially for integrating with other Flock cameras to track a suspect’s vehicle. If a vehicle can be identified, Holmes believes Flock cameras would be helpful locating a missing person.
“The nice thing about Flock is they can alert to car movements with other cameras tied to the system,” he said.
Holmes was asked if tribal members would have any objections to having a more advanced surveillance system, and he noted that there is some interest in investing in technology, but he also wonders if there would be objections over privacy rights if a surveillance system became too expansive.
Flock
Holly Beilin, director of communication for Flock, said in Wisconsin three tribes are using Flock cameras and in the United States 24 tribes have it, but because of confidentiality, she cannot identify which tribes have it.
Boulanger, the Oneida Nation chief, was asked why he thinks tribes are showing an interest in Flock cameras.
“With technology it’s a useful investigative tool,” he said, “And if you know any tribal agencies or tribal nations that have independent police departments and can fiscally handle the cost, it is probably going to look towards some sort of Flock or surveillance system just because that’s the trend right now in law enforcement, using technology.”
Beilin objected when told that at least two of the police chiefs said the Flock system is pricey.
“We typically hear it is much more cost-effective than other solutions,” she responded.
One of the big issues across Indian Country is missing and murdered indigenous women and relatives. The Flock cameras can be especially helpful for missing persons because they are automatically tied to Amber Alerts for children and Silver Alerts for seniors.
Beilin said Flock is working on incorporating the new federal alert for Native Americans, called Missing and Endangered Persons (MEP), which will be implemented later in 2025 and will be known as Turquoise Alerts.
“If a vehicle is associated with an Amber Alert, the license plate passes a camera in real time and will alert local law enforcement, so that law enforcement know, like, OK, that vehicle just passed this camera and is going in this direction, so it’ll be, you know, at this location, in five minutes,’” she said, “and they can actually go, hopefully, and apprehend that person.”
However, she noted that those who use the Flock system don’t have to tie into the larger network of Flock cameras and instead can  just use them locally. She also noted the local user is responsible for how long information is stored.
“No customer has to share,” she said. “So if a tribe wanted to share with local law enforcement nearby, they could, and if they wanted to just have their own police get those alerts and use it for investigations. That would also be fine,”
She was asked what is Flock’s appeal for tribes.
“It actually works,” she said. “It solves crime, and it helps find missing persons. I mean, we just really see that as soon as the cameras are installed, it starts to actually help these agencies or these tribes. You know, the vast majority of crime has some kind of a vehicle involved, right? Which makes sense. We all literally drive daily, and as do folks who commit crime.”
As for whether the Flock system infringes upon privacy rights,“We don’t own the data, the agencies or the tribes do, so they can choose what to do with it,” she said. “We can never sell it or share it without their permission. They can set or legislate their own retention period, so maybe they only want to keep the data for. Our default (to erase data collected) is 30 days, but it could be even less.”
Cameras in the Southwest 
Sergio DeSoto is a consultant from Arizona who works with tribes in the Southwestern areas of the United States on surveillance systems. He said that most tribes he has worked with invest in camera security after an incident has raised safety concerns.
“We hear, ‘we want to make sure our people are safe,’” he said.
DeSoto said surveillance cameras are typically requested for housing, administration, courts, and border security, and most tribes have staff who live-monitor cameras.
The safety concern can be over external issues like sex trafficking on the reservation, or internal issues of domestic disputes or alcohol or drug-related issues.
He said the No. 1  motivation for the tribal nation he deals with is personal safety.
“They’re not interested in the assets; they’re more interested in the people,” he said.
Typically, he said, there is an issue or an incident that drives a discussion about how to raise safety at a particular location, such as a homicide in tribal housing. Once the surveillance system has been in place for a while, the tribe often requests help focusing on other areas on the reservation.
DeSota said the tribal councils are also learning the importance of educating tribal members before implementing a new surveillance system.
“With the elder center in Quechan (Fort Yuma Quechan Tribe in Yuma, Arizona), the tribal council did a super good job communicating with them that we want to make sure everybody’s safe,” he said.
Regarding the question of whether surveillance cameras help deter crime and increase safety, DeSota said he doesn’t have any data to support that contention. However, he noted that when tribes consistently seek to expand their systems, it would indicate that they are receiving positive feedback.

He's staying -- for now -- but, like many business owners, is worried about the impact of the law.","Victor Bencomo, an IT specialist at Marine Corps Logistics Base Barstow in California, updates a desktop in this 2017 file photo. Critics of Maryland's new tech tax worry about its impact on small firms wonking on Defense conrtracts, among others. (Photo by Keith Hayes/U.S. Marine Corps)When Maryland first announced its new 3% sales and use tax on data and information technology services this spring, Jake Stokes felt his business had no choice but to leave the state.
But after the Maryland Comptroller’s Office issued more guidance on the new regulations, including that pre-existing contracts would be exempt from the tax, he decided to stay. For the time being.
“We started to feel good — or at least that we bought time,” said Stokes, president of the Maryland-based government subcontractor Belay Technologies.
Depending on what regulatory decisions the state makes regarding the implementation of the tax, though, Stokes said he is ready to move the company to Texas — where he already has several employees.
Stokes is one of many Maryland business leaders expressing concern over the impact of the state’s new tax on data and information technology services and software publishing. Some said the tax will hurt Maryland’s economy more than any revenue it will generate.
The new tax, which took effect Tuesday, is expected to generate about $480 million in revenue for the state in its first year, with the amount approaching $750 million by fiscal 2030. The tax will apply to a range of businesses, including computer systems design, software publishing, data processing and hosting, and other services from news to libraries, internet publishing to web search portals.
New ‘tech tax’ dominates list of laws that take effect July 1, start of fiscal 2026

In a statement Monday, Gov. Wes Moore’s office defended the taxes, saying the governor worked with the Maryland General Assembly this session to turn the projected $3 billion budget deficit into a $315 million budget surplus, while still providing 94% of Maryland residents with a tax cut or no change in their income taxes.
Moore said that after “years of economic stagnation … Maryland’s economy is finally moving again. In just two years, Maryland has added over 100,000 jobs, more jobs than the previous eight years—which has recently been driven by private sector growth.”
That progress is “only possible” because Moore and other state and local leaders passed legislation that “will grow Maryland’s economy and ensure the long-term fiscal stability of the state,” the statement read.
Grason Wiggins, the Maryland Chamber of Commerce’s vice president of government affairs, agreed that the state needs more economic growth. But he said the tech tax will only serve to make the state less economically competitive with its neighboring states.
“This tax is going to make it more difficult for us to attract businesses,” Wiggins said. “It’s going to make doing business more costly here in the state of Maryland.”
The tax won’t just affect business owners, Wiggins added. Because of the broad range of services included under the tax, the cost will be passed down to consumers through increased prices of services and goods, he said.
Wiggins added that he has seen some companies indicating they are planning to leave Maryland, and has spent the last two months pleading with them to stay.
The only way to solve a budget deficit, Wiggins said, is to generate more economic growth.
“This may have plugged a hole,” he said. “But from a long-term perspective, if it drives businesses away, if it reduces job creation and limits spending, then from a long-term perspective, it’s really just moving the issue down the road and not really solving the problem.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Some politicians, such as Del. Brian M. Crosby (D-St. Mary’s), have also voiced their concerns over the tax. Crosby, vice chair of the House Economic Matters Committee, said it will have a “heavy impact” on defense contracting, one of the state’s emerging sectors.
It’s not an abstract concept to Crosby, the owner of a small business that is a subcontractor on Defense Department IT contracts: At the height of the debate over the tech tax this year, he acknowledged that he moved his business to Virginia because he did not think it could survive if he had to pay the tech tax in Maryland.
He added that he is worried about the impact it will have on other small businesses, particularly minority-owned, women-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. Larger contractors will have no incentive to work with smaller businesses outside of “set aside” contracts, he said.
Karen Syrylo, a Maryland-based certified public accountant, said she has heard complaints with the new tax for two main reasons: complicated legislative wording and complicated implementation.
The tax’s legislative wording is too confusing as it uses the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), a standard used by the federal government to classify types of businesses, to define services that fall under the tax, rather than creating its own definitions, she said.
Syrylo added that it has also been complicated for businesses to install the systems necessary to ensure that the vendor and purchaser are subject to tax.
She said tax will affect an “entire universe of purchasers.”
“Every business and every individual who buys any of these dozens and dozens of services are going to be paying more tax to their vendors,” Syrylo said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/3705942-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-01 07:00:42.685367

Of the 81% who want their communities to plan for climate-related water changes, less than half know that most of their neighbors feel the same.
The post Wyoming warming to climate change reality and worried about water, UW poll finds appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming residents are feeling the heat, and they’re more concerned than ever about what it means, particularly for water — a scarce commodity in the arid state.
The state is historically among the most skeptical in the nation when it comes to embracing climate change, but a new University of Wyoming survey reveals that attitudes are changing even with an economy heavily reliant on fossil fuel extraction.
The vast majority of residents, 86%, “believe that climate change is happening,” according to the Wyoming Survey on Climate, Water, and People. Though they’re split on the reasons for it, with 47% believing it’s natural and 39% acknowledging humans are the cause, the survey helps confirm that Wyomingites are increasingly concerned. Back in 2014, for example, just 55% of Equality State residents believed climate change was happening, according to the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication.

“That’s a huge change in 10 years,” said Kristen Landreville, lead author of the survey. Despite being split on the cause, “there is concern,” she added. “There is worry and there is a desire for action.”
Water concerns
It’s difficult to determine exactly why more Wyomingites are acknowledging climate change these days, Landreville said. Though the topic is constantly in the news, it likely has more to do with personal observations and local issues — particularly when it comes to water and past experiences with drought.

A University of Wyoming survey found that 39% respondents believe climate change is due to humans. (University of Wyoming)
In fact, the survey purposely led with questions about water before asking about climate, Landreville said. Whether it’s those in agriculture who rely on water or recreationalists who fish and boat, people notice variations in Wyoming’s seasonal pulse of water, which has been changing.
The survey found that 82% of respondents agreed that “Wyoming is at risk of changing water resources,” and 75% believe “it is wise and necessary to adapt to these water changes.”
It also showed broad support for various water conservation measures, including water reuse, voluntary water conservation in agriculture and a close look at industrial use. Respondents also said they trust their neighbors in agriculture more than industry officials when it comes to a clear-eyed view of Wyoming’s water risks, according to Landreville.
“Only 7% of our respondents trusted industry to tell them the truth about what’s going on with water in the state,” she said. “What’s interesting is that Wyoming ranchers and farmers were the second most-trusted group.”
Feeling alone, but not actually alone
Perhaps the most exciting results of the survey — at least for a social and communication researcher like Landreville, she admitted — is that Wyomingites vastly underestimate how much they agree on their growing climate-related water concerns, as well as a desire to do something about it. 
Of the 81% who want their communities to plan for climate-related water changes, fewer than half believe their neighbors feel the same way, according to the survey.
That massive disconnect, Landreville said, can drive a “spiral of silence” that leads to inaction and less pressure on elected officials to implement solutions. However, knowing there’s more agreement than residents previously realized is a huge opportunity to spur action at the local and state levels, she added.
“There’s more support [than understood] for creating community response plans,” Landreville said. “There’s more support for addressing water changes than Wyoming residents think. An implication of these findings, I think, is that it’s really important to share with people, ‘You know what? You’re not that different than your own community.'”
The survey, conducted by the University of Wyoming’s Center for Rural Resilience and Innovation, was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation. You can view an interactive report on the survey here and read the full report here.
The Center for Rural Resilience and Innovation will be conducting more focus groups and community discussions around these issues in the near future, Landreville said.

The federal lawsuit fails to demonstrate how the new requirements could harm potential voters, attorneys for Gray argue. 
The post Gray asks court to toss case challenging Wyoming’s new voter registration law appeared first on WyoFile .","Attorneys for Secretary of State Chuck Gray asked a federal court Friday to dismiss a lawsuit against Wyoming’s new voter registration law, arguing in two filings that the complaint does not sufficiently demonstrate how the new requirements could harm potential voters. 
Once the law goes into effect Tuesday, proof of state residency and U.S. citizenship will be required to register to vote in Wyoming. The law also requires someone registering to vote to attest that they’ve lived in the state for at least 30 days. 
Equality State Policy Center, a voting-rights group made up of several nonprofits, filed a lawsuit in May after the Wyoming Legislature passed House Bill 156, “Proof of voter residency-registration qualifications” during the 2025 session. 
The complaint alleges the new law is unconstitutionally vague as written and will impose an undue burden on the right to vote — particularly for women as well as Hispanic, young and low-income voters. 
The harms described in the complaint, however, are speculative and lack the kind of specificity required to have standing in a federal court, Gray’s attorneys argued in Friday’s filings. 
“Plaintiffs liberally assert these broad, sweeping claims, without bothering to submit supporting evidence,” attorneys with Dhillon Law Group argue. 
“For example, they have not identified even one woman, one Hispanic citizen, one impoverished individual, one transgender citizen, or one person with epilepsy who cannot vote because Wyoming wishes to enforce the citizenship requirement embodied in both federal and state law. Nor can the plaintiff offer any method to reliably measure the likelihood or extent, if any, of such hypothetical difficulties in Wyoming.”
The law was a key priority for the Wyoming Freedom Caucus and Gray, whom the complaint names as a defendant in his official capacity alongside the state’s 23 county clerks. 
“Wyomingites deserve fair, transparent elections and that’s why we are fighting tooth and nail to protect these election integrity measures,” Gray said in a Monday press release. 
The case’s profile has risen considerably since it was first filed, attracting high-profile attorneys who have fought for and against President Trump on the national stage. Ahead of Gray’s filings on Friday, the Republican National Committee filed a motion to intervene in the case while a coalition of 25 states plus Guam filed a proposed amicus brief, urging the court to allow the law to go into effect.

Legal fight
Shortly after Equality State Policy Center filed its complaint, attorneys for the group sought a preliminary injunction, asking the court to prevent the law from going into effect while the case plays out. 
Gray responded with two motions — one asking the court to allow the law to go into effect, another asking that the complaint be dismissed entirely. 
In the first filing, attorneys for Gray argue that ESPC has not demonstrated that the law will impose a severe burden on the right to vote, and that Wyoming has a compelling interest in enforcing current federal and state laws that limit voting to U.S. citizens. 
“Plaintiff’s request to preliminarily enjoin HB 156 — without evidence of actual harm, and well in advance of any election — is both premature and legally unfounded. Therefore, the motion [for a preliminary injunction] should be denied,” the filing states. 
Attorneys for Gray fleshed out their argument further in a motion to dismiss, arguing the plaintiff does not have standing, or the right to bring the lawsuit,   for three reasons.
The first centers on a 2024 U.S. Supreme Court decision. 
ESPC argued in its complaint that the new law will impede its “core work of encouraging voters to register and participate in their democracy” and would require the group “to redirect significant resources to increase its voter registration education efforts.”
But when several anti-abortion groups challenged the Food and Drug Administration’s approval and subsequent actions regarding mifepristone — arguing it forced them to conduct their own studies of the drug — the high court ruled that did not give them standing. 
“In short, increased educational efforts or advocacy efforts are not a concrete, particularized injury that establishes standing,” Gray’s filing argues.
Second, Gray’s attorneys say the plaintiffs failed to identify anyone who will be harmed by the law. 
As part of its legal strategy, ESPC included several affidavits from individuals explaining potential harms of the new law, including the organization’s executive director, Jennifer DeSarro, as well as representatives from both a homeless shelter and a food pantry, both in Cheyenne. 
“Despite Plaintiff’s claims of widespread harm, it has only identified one member organization that claims harm to its members,” Gray’s filings state, pointing to an affidavit from the Wyoming Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault. (Emphasis from the filing.)
“But this sole member has failed to meet the requirements” to have standing, the filing argues. 
“Third, to the extent Plaintiff argues its members’ members will face injury, such injuries are speculative, at best, and, thus, cannot serve as a basis for Plaintiff’s standing.”
Equality State Policy Center now has until July 9 to file a response.

The public outcry was so forceful that the measure’s sponsor pledged to scale back the proposal. Then on Saturday, before an initial U.S. Senate vote on Republicans’ tax and spending cuts package, he withdrew it altogether.
USDA Secretary in Santa Fe announces agency intends to repeal Clinton-era ‘roadless’ rule

But even though the land sales proposal was defeated, experts say federal lands face a slew of other threats from President Donald Trump’s administration. Agency leaders have proposed rolling back the “Roadless Rule” that protects 58 million acres from logging and other uses. Trump’s Justice Department has issued a legal opinion that the president is allowed to abolish national monuments. Regulators have moved to slash environmental rules to ramp up logging and oil and gas production. And Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce have gutted the ranks of the agencies that manage federal lands.
“This is not over even if the sell-off proposal doesn’t make it,” said John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration. “The whole thing about leasing or selling timber or throwing them open to mining claims, that’s a form of partial privatization. It’s pretty much a giveaway.”
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum has repeatedly described public lands as America’s “balance sheet.” He has argued that some lands could be used to provide housing, while calling for an expansion of mining and oil and gas drilling to increase their economic output.
“President Trump’s energy dominance vision will end those wars abroad, will make life more affordable for every family in America by driving down inflation,” Burgum said before his confirmation hearing.
Public lands advocates are bracing for ongoing battles for the rest of Trump’s term in office. They expect Republicans to add last-minute public lands amendments to other bills moving through Congress, and for land management agencies to attempt to strip protections from other federal lands. Given the vocal backlash to the initial sell-off plan, advocates expect future attempts to be shaped behind closed doors and advanced with little time for opponents to mount a defense.

Meanwhile, they expect states to play a key role in shaping those battles. In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, many leaders from both parties view public lands as special places open to all Americans and critical for clean water, wildlife and tourism. But some conservatives resent the fact that large portions of their states are managed by officials in Washington, D.C., limiting development and private enterprise.
Officials in some states, including Idaho, Utah and Wyoming, have pushed lawsuits or resolutions seeking to force the feds to hand over huge amounts of land. Public land experts say the lawmakers behind those efforts will likely press harder now that Trump is in the White House. Such state-level takeover attempts could shape the proposals that emerge from Trump’s allies in Washington.
 Public pushes back on land sell-off proposal from Utah senator

The firestorm over federal lands exploded when U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, introduced legislation that would force the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 3.3 million acres of land. The measure also would direct the agencies to make more than 250 million additional acres eligible for sale.
Long-thwarted efforts to sell public lands see new life under Trump

“We’ve never seen a threat on this magnitude ever,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “There’s been an overwhelming amount of opposition. We’ve seen record-breaking engagement on this issue.”
Lee, a longtime federal lands opponent, claimed the lands were needed for housing and argued the government has been a poor manager of its land.
“Washington has proven time and again it can’t manage this land,” Lee said earlier this month when announcing the proposal. “This bill puts it in better hands.”

But a wide-ranging coalition of opponents argued that the proposal had no protections to ensure the lands would be used for affordable housing, and that many of the parcels eligible for sale had little housing potential. A furious social media campaign highlighted cherished hiking trails, fishing lakes and ski slopes that were in danger of being sold, urging people to call their lawmakers to oppose the measure.
In recent days, Montana Republican U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, as well as Idaho Republican U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch, came out in opposition to the land sale proposal. That put into question whether Lee’s legislation could earn even a simple majority.
Then the Senate parliamentarian ruled the sell-off could not be included in the reconciliation bill without a 60-vote majority. That ruling came a day after Lee posted on social media that he would be making changes to the bill in response to concerns from Hunter Nation, a nonprofit whose board includes Donald Trump Jr.
Lee released a scaled-back measure last week that would exempt national forest lands but would direct the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 1.2 million acres. It would require land for sale to be within five miles of a population center and developed to provide housing.
Public land advocates say Lee’s changes did little to assuage their concerns. They argue that federal land sales or transfers should happen through the current, long-standing process, which requires local stakeholder input and directs the proceeds from land sales to be reinvested into conservation and public access on other parcels.
“It’s the overwhelming belief of hunters and anglers that the budget reconciliation process is not the appropriate vehicle for public land sales,” said O’Dea, with the hunting and fishing group.
On Saturday evening, Lee announced that he was withdrawing the proposal, saying that Senate rules did not allow him to include protections that land would not be sold to foreign interests. But he pledged to continue the battle over federal land ownership, working with Trump to “put underutilized federal land to work for American families.”
 States’ role in managing public lands

While the sell-off proposal aligned with some state officials’ goal of taking over federal lands, some lands experts say private developers would have been the real winner.
“If the lands are transferred to the states without money, the states lose,” said Leshy, the former Interior Department official. “It’s a hit on their budget, which means they’re gonna have to sell them off. If states got a significant amount of public lands, a lot of that would end up in private hands.”
In Utah, where leaders have made the most aggressive push to take over federal lands, lawmakers argue that they could raise lease prices for oil and gas operations, bringing in enough revenue to cover the state’s management costs.
“The policy of the state is to keep these lands open and available to the public,” Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican, told Stateline last month.
O’Dea pointed to an economic analysis of what it would cost Montana to take over federal lands. The report found it would cost the state $8 billion over 20 years to take on wildfire management, deferred maintenance and mine reclamation. He noted that many Western states have sold off a majority of the “trust lands” they were granted at statehood, undermining claims that a state takeover would leave lands in the public domain.
 Other Trump administration proposals slash environmental rules and expand logging, mining

While Lee’s land sales proposal has gotten the biggest headlines, public land advocates are fighting a multifront battle against the Trump administration’s moves to roll back the protected status of certain lands, slash environmental rules, and expand logging, mining and drilling operations.













The approach is to throw as much as you can at the wall and see what sticks.


– Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers





“The approach is to throw as much as you can at the wall and see what sticks,” O’Dea said. “There’s only so much you can mobilize opposition to. There’s a huge risk that some of these things could fly under the radar.”
Some conservative states and industry groups say Trump is allowing federal lands to be used to their full economic potential. Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, a Republican, said his constituents are “keenly aware of how the federal government’s ownership of 60 percent of Alaska’s lands can inhibit economic development and cause challenges for our communities.”
Leshy noted that public lands have proven to be a popular cause, but Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce could undermine public confidence that the federal government is capable of managing the land.
“If you make it terrible for long enough, maybe people say, ‘The feds shouldn’t be managing this, they do such a bad job,’” he said.

Caregivers for people with developmental disabilities may see boost to a living wage, columnist Kerry Drake opines. 
The post Even Freedom Caucus lawmaker sees need for supporting Wyoming’s developmental disabilities program appeared first on WyoFile .","I never dreamed I would hear a conservative Wyoming lawmaker boldly proclaim that a social safety net program is “one of the reasons why we have government.”

Opinion

Such enthusiasm in the Wyoming Legislature is generally reserved for subsidizing the fossil fuel industry or bringing an expensive project to a legislator’s district. A favorite tactic of far-right politicians is to portray themselves as budget hawks by railing about social programs that the state and federal government shouldn’t waste taxpayers’ money on.
So when Rep. Ken Pendergraft, R-Sheridan, strongly came out in favor of the state significantly boosting the budget of the Medicaid developmental disabilities waiver program last week at a Joint Appropriations Committee meeting in Gillette, it genuinely startled me. I’m on the opposite end of the political spectrum, but he’s spot on in his assessment that the program “is something that’s absolutely worthy of supporting and worthy of doing right.” 
A state study last year recommended adding $12 million to the Department of Health’s budget to increase the reimbursement rate for more than 570 providers who care for about 2,500 people with intellectual and developmental disabilities or acquired brain injuries in home and community-based alternatives to an institution.
Unfortunately, while a steering committee published the report, it didn’t recommend forwarding the funding request to the Legislature. The committee said a low response rate to a provider survey resulted in the decision.
The Department of Health, the Legislative Service Office and many providers are correcting that problem, giving the Appropriations Committee stacks of white papers and promising to compile more.


The Legislature’s Management Council approved Appropriations’ request to make the issue a priority during the interim. The committee will meet Aug. 19-20 in Dubois, with a trip to a developmental disabilities provider tentatively on the agenda.
Pendergraft could have played it safe and tried to please the Freedom Caucus, which endorsed his candidacy last year. But he chose to speak his mind on an issue he obviously feels passionate about.
I don’t know if the Freedom Caucus will take an official position on the disability waiver program in 2026, but I do know that after it took control of the House earlier this year, the caucus killed a $2.4 million a year raise in the Medicaid reimbursement rate for maternity health care requested by Gov. Mark Gordon and the Department of Health. The proposed higher disability waiver reimbursement rate is a similar issue for a vulnerable population that’s about five times more expensive.
Pendergraft, like the majority of Republicans in the House, voted against the rate increase for maternity care.
Pendergraft has a very personal reason for his position on the waiver issue. He explained that a man who belonged to his church suffered a traumatic brain injury in a car accident when he stopped to help a stalled motorist. The family lost its income and had astronomical medical bills, he said, so about a dozen church families helped his wife start a business.
“[The congregation] made tremendous sacrifices,” he recalled. “We paid the bills, we provided care for this individual, who needed constant care day and night.”
Jaded from years of hearing lawmakers contend almost every social problem, from juvenile delinquency to teen pregnancies, can be solved by putting it in the hands of churches instead of throwing public money at it, I wondered if Pendergraft was going down that well-traveled road. But he didn’t.
The legislator told the committee he and his wife provided care for a relative at their home for several years until she moved to a group home, and a co-worker who had a developmentally disabled child needed more help than the state could provide.
Citing his experience working at a nursing home and the long hours he spent helping the three families, Pendergraft said that state and federal governments, which split the costs, should reimburse providers at a level that will help them pay private caregivers competitive wages.
Daryl Skinner, executive director of Lincoln Self Reliance, agreed. He said staff turnover hurts the quality of care.
“The average length of time for direct care staff is six months,” he said. “Can you imagine having to retrain employees every six months? It’s a revolving door.”
Skinner said caregivers have to pass a medication training program, and medication errors increase with staff turnover. He added it takes time for new workers to learn how to interact and communicate with individuals who may be nonverbal and aggressive.
“People say, ‘I love this work, it’s the most meaningful experience I’ve ever had, but I can’t afford to pay my living expenses,’” Skinner said. “We pay an average wage of $16.81 an hour. Fifty percent of our workforce commutes to Jackson Hole, where dishwashers are paid $25 an hour.”
Though Pendergraft said he definitely wants to see waiver reimbursement rates raised, he also showed he’s not above playing some political games to accomplish that goal. 
“Before I sit down and authorize a $20-or-$30-or-$40 million check, knowing that taxpayers are already sacrificing, I want to look across the breadth of the Department of Health,” Pendergraft said. “ If it considers this to be a high priority, what’s it willing to sacrifice to pay for it?”
Pendergraft said the state only has a limited amount of money. “If you’re going to fund [higher DD waiver rates] you do it right, and you pay people what they should be paid,” he said. “And when you run out of money, you stop the spending.”
Stefan Johansson, the Department of Health’s director, had a diplomatic response. While he said he’s always open to looking at places to trim, his department had three rounds of budget cuts in the past dozen years that were “all north of $100 million.”
The state has increased funds when it could, like in 2023, when the Legislature added $6.3 million for higher reimbursement rates for providers and $7.4 million to reduce wait times for people who need disability waivers. Currently, the average wait to obtain services is about 14 months.
Johansson didn’t spell it out directly, but I detected a clear message: The state has made a lot of budget cuts in main programs, including Medicaid waivers, developmental preschools, mental health and substance abuse services at community mental health centers, and 24/7 facilities like the Wyoming State Hospital and Wyoming’s Life Resource Center. 
These programs are either required to be offered under federal law or part of lawsuit settlements. They account for more than 90% of the department’s biennial budget. If someone wants to cut a lot of “fat,” there aren’t many places to look.
Appropriations Committee Co-chair Sen. Tim Salazar, R-Riverton, had some encouraging words for Johansson.
“I know the challenges you face with limited dollars. I believe you’re doing everything you possibly can on this issue, given the budget that you have, and so I appreciate your efforts; I appreciate your attention,” Salazar said. “I’m not positive, but I tend to think help is on the way.”
That’s not a promise, but given the Legislature’s desire to cut budgets, it’s about as hopeful a sign as can be expected six months before the next session.

But this year is different, for many reasons, the most important being that just a couple of weeks ago, one of my best friends in recovery passed away from an overdose. 
It was a stark reminder of just how devastating this disease can be, and how dramatically things can change.
My friend worked very hard at his recovery for many years, and then he made some bad decisions that led to a series of relapses, and for the last few years, it was absolutely heartbreaking watching him try to get back to where he was a few years ago.
Diligence and perseverance are two of the most crucial qualities to sustaining a sober life, and once you lose one or the other of these, it can be frightening how hard it is to pull yourself back into that mindset. You’ve probably all experienced what it feels like to work out for a consistent period of time, and then get away from it. When you start again, it’s so easy to find excuses, especially the most convincing excuse, which is that you have plenty of time to resume your routine. That it doesn’t have to happen now. So you put it off one more day, and then one more day, and when you try to start over again, you get frustrated because it isn’t as easy as it was before. You can’t just pick up where you left off .
My friend couldn’t get back to the routine, and it became clear over time that what he really wanted was to to regain that feeling he had when he was sober without having to work as hard as he did those first few months or years that it took to achieve that level of serenity and well being. The hardest part about watching someone go through that is the helpless feeling of not knowing what to say. Because you both know that they know what they need to do. You both know that there’s no magic phrase or magic action that will restore that sense of happiness they once held so dear. It’s impossible.
So I have never felt as grateful as I do now for having been able to maintain my sobriety, for 42 years now. 
Forty-two years ago today, I stood up from the dining room table and told my wife at the time that I needed to get drunk. She didn’t argue with me or try to stop me because she knew it wouldn’t work. I ended up going to a sad little bar that is about five blocks from the house where I live now. I drank a few shots of whiskey and a few bottles of beer before she somehow found me and walked in.
“Do you want to come home?” she asked, and I did.
I never imagined that would be my last drink. In fact, I didn’t trust myself for a couple of years after that because I had been relapsing for two-and-a-half years before that last time. But amazingly, it was the last time. And my life has been a magic carpet ride ever since, filled with tragedy and triumph, sadness and absolute joy. Pain and euphoria. But never, ever dull. 
I would not be who I am today without sobriety. I would never have had the persistence to become a writer, much less publish eight books. The rejection would have killed whatever motivation I had years ago. 
And I never would have taken the risk to explore mediums that were completely out of my comfort zone, like doing a radio show or a podcast. I didn’t have the confidence or the ability to ignore people who find it necessary to criticize or even sabotage my work. I firmly believe in the saying that you hear often in AA, that what other people think of you is none of your business. I also believe that seeking revenge is like digging two graves. So I leave that to others. I seek to put positive vibes into the world, and even when I fail, I know I’m doing the best I can, as long as I don’t take that first drink.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-1320844709-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-01 12:19:33.126941

It’s a sad commentary on the power of the right-wing misinformation machine in modern America that simple and enormously positive concepts like diversity, equity and inclusion have been twisted so that some perceive them in a negative light.
What’s next on the hit list? Words like love, tolerance and common ground?
Tragically, however, as North Carolina Republican legislators made clear last week, they’re serious about this perverse crusade – so serious that they recently passed legislation that would ban diversity, equity and inclusion in state government.
The bill is so ill-conceived and poorly written that it would likely prohibit state agencies from recruiting employees at women’s colleges and HBCU’s.
Even programs to help accommodate the needs of veterans and people with disabilities would likely be unlawful.
The bottom line: The sponsors of this legislation claim that their attacks on DEI are about promoting equal opportunity. In truth they’re about promoting three words that are the opposite of DEI – call it UIE: uniformity, inequity and exclusion.

As Anita Wolfe sat in the hallway of a Charleston, West Virginia, county courtroom, waiting to testify against the U.S. government, she thought of her dad, who first started working as a coal miner when he was around 12.
She remembered his wild stories about coal-loading contests and working as a mule boy. But she also remembered his death certificate, which listed black lung and silicosis, two pulmonary diseases related to dust in mines, as contributing factors.
Before she retired, Wolfe launched and ran a mobile clinic through the National Institute For Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) that screened miners at their mines and tried to catch lung diseases early.

In April, as part of the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency initiative, around 90% of NIOSH staff received layoff notices. Many were placed on administrative leave — including the mobile clinic crew, workers who review miners’ test results and researchers trying to prevent these lung diseases in the first place.
Wolfe was in the courthouse to try to get those jobs back. Now, her mobile clinic workers are back, along with all the other workers in the institute’s Respiratory Health Division. But researchers elsewhere in NIOSH who also work on prevention are still slated to be laid off. 
To Wolfe, that’s a problem. About a fifth of the coal miners in Central Appalachia have black lung, Wolfe said. And from 1970 to 2016, more than 75,000 died. Nationally, a 2023 NIOSH study found that coal miners are twice as likely to die of lung diseases than nonminers. Wolfe called black lung and silicosis “entirely preventable.” 
“It comes down to how much is a life worth,” Wolfe said. “You want more coal, but you don’t care about the coal miners and what’s happening to them.”
*   *   *For some coal miners, pausing the black lung programs at the National Institute For Occupational Safety and Health created an immediate problem, because without a stamp of approval from the institute, coal miners can’t access federal “Part 90” benefits that allow them to get reassigned to jobs with less dust exposure. 
Black lung has no cure, but avoiding dust can stop the disease from getting worse. With the pause, X-rays and medical records now sat in folders, unexamined. 
So Wolfe and others began campaigning, collaborating with public health workers and miners to try to get the NIOSH workers back. Wolfe enlisted the support of West Virginia Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, who successfully petitioned to get black lung workers off administrative leave in the short term. Still, that was just a temporary fix.
Sam Petsonk, a lawyer, and Harry Wiley, a coal miner, decided to sue the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees NIOSH. “To me, he was very courageous for doing that,” Wolfe said of Wiley. 
At trial, Wolfe and Wiley were both called to testify, and on May 7, they sat with other witnesses in the courthouse hallway. For hours, the group made small talk about kids and summer vacations, scrupulously following instructions to avoid any chatter about the department’s “reduction in force.”

One by one the witnesses entered the courtroom. Wolfe was last. “Everything was going through my head,” she said. She was nervous. But then, she remembered her dad. “I just felt like he was there with me, you know? Kinda egging me on, like, ‘You got this, baby girl.’”
When Wolfe took the stand, she was calm, and described the value of NIOSH’s programs. The defense, she said, “didn’t offer much defense at all.” 
After the trial, Wolfe joined Wiley and Petsonk for sandwiches. “They seemed fairly confident that it was gonna be found in favor of the miner,” she said. 
A few days later, the judge ruled in Wiley’s favor. Staff at the mobile clinic and the broader National Institute For Occupational Safety and Health Respiratory Health Division got their jobs back for now, although the program is still working to get back up and running. Staff at the institute’s National Personal Protective Technology Lab were also called back; they certify a variety of respirators that help keep miners and other workers safe.
But other institute researchers working to prevent mining-related lung diseases heard nothing. 
While researchers in the Respiratory Health Division focus primarily on tracking disease and helping individual miners, researchers at NIOSH’s Pittsburgh and Spokane Mining Research Divisions focus on innovation, developing new tools to prevent disease in the first place.  
The judge’s preliminary injunction said the law requires that kind of research. But the injunction did not explicitly put Pittsburgh and Spokane researchers back to work.
The Department of Health and Human Services did un-fire their boss, a statutorily required associate director overseeing the Office of Mine Safety and Health Research. But it did not bring back the hundreds of researchers who report to that administrator.
“He’s new. He hasn’t even met us yet!” said Cassandra Hoebbel, a NIOSH researcher in Pittsburgh and a union steward for the Association of Federal Government Employees. 
“A lot of people contacted me and were like, ‘Oh my God, you got your job restored!’” she said. “It’s like, no they’ve only restored a tiny part of it.”
Hoebbel said that mine health and safety research at the institute has been mostly on pause since January due to the Trump administration’s restrictions on funding and travel. For almost five months, researchers have been unable to visit mines to measure dust levels, test new equipment or improve software tools. 
That’s a long-term loss for miner health, but it’s a short-term loss as well: NIOSH field work often leads to quick-fix changes by the mine operators the researchers collaborate with. Now, those improvements aren’t happening. External grants for technology development and commercialization were also “terminated for convenience.”  
That’s despite the fact that, after a long decline, lung diseases in miners are again on the rise: Black lung cases have been increasing for two decades, according to a 2018 NIOSH study, and severe cases have caught back up to their all-time high. And it’s not just black lung. A 2023 study found that coal miners are dying of a variety of lung diseases at higher rates than in the past. Some are also dying younger.
*   *   *“It used to be that people said black lung was an old man’s disease, and that’s not true. We just buried a thirtysomething miner,” Wolfe said.
Many younger miners suffer from lung diseases caused not by coal dust but from quartz dust, officially called respirable crystalline silica. As coal deposits became tapped out, mines went after harder-to-reach coal, generating more quartz dust from the surrounding rock. Modern mining machines may also contribute to the dust. 
Silica dust exposure is not unique to coal miners, who represent a small sliver of miners in the U.S. Silicosis is common in miners at all sorts of mines. 
While coal workers are eligible for “Part 90” transfers and benefits based on dust exposure, those who mine for sand, rocks, precious metals and other material are not. 
For all miners, silica dust protections are decades out of date. After Wolfe’s mobile clinics helped identify new clusters of lung disease, a 2014 rule lowered allowable limits for coal dust exposure. Similar standards lowered limits for silica dust in industries like construction.

But a rule to lower by half the silica dust exposure limit in mines stalled for a decade. The rule finally passed in 2024 — then a 2025 start date was postponed, after pushback from mine operators, who said implementation would be too difficult.
Mine operators objected to a final version of the rule that said it was not enough to implement a check list of “good enough” dust control measures, to give miners masks or to rotate them in and out of dusty areas to reduce their exposure. Instead, the final rule says mines need to actually reduce the hazardous dust.
The rule also mandates silicosis monitoring programs, similar to Wolfe’s black lung monitoring work, but for non-coal miners.
However, the same day President Donald Trump held a press conference promoting the “abandoned” coal industry, the Department of Labor postponed the rule’s upcoming start date for coal mines from April to August. (Stone mines still have until April 2026 to comply.)
Earlier this year, the Department of Labor announced plans to close 34 of the mine enforcement offices that work to hold mine operators accountable for the current silica dust standard. In late May, those plans were reversed.
*   *   *Dust is a constant presence in mines, and it lurks in overlooked places. Currently paused National Institute For Occupational Safety and Health research has the potential to improve the dust problem. 
Decades ago, government mine safety researchers identified controls that could be used to reduce dust in mines, such as improving ventilation. 
But mines have been using those strategies for years, and lung diseases stubbornly persist.
Traditionally, mine inspectors check dust levels a few times a year to confirm compliance. But those checks don’t provide much actionable information about how to make things better. That’s frustrating for mines and for miners. So NIOSH has been working on ways to make dust easier to spot.
Their personal dust monitors already let miners view their own mine dust exposure in real time. Other projects are helping miners make sense of that kind of data.
In 2015, Hoebbel observed field work for an award-winning study by institute researcher Emily Haas that outfitted miners with both a dust monitor and a video camera and then compared the feeds to see why dust levels spiked.
“They had two guys walking side by side,” Hoebbel said. One of their dust monitors “kept going up, up, up — and the other guy was walking right next to him and his was fine.”
The researchers, curious, asked, “When’s the last time you washed your sweatshirt?” Hoebbel said. “He’s like, ‘Oh man, I can’t tell you the last time I washed this thing!’” 
Before the study, the participating miners felt confident that wearing masks and following established procedures would keep them safe. Afterwards, they were full of questions about silica exposure. The mine in the study, for its part, replaced cloth vehicle seats and gloves with leather, which is easier to wipe clean. 
But attaching monitors to miners, while good for sussing out dirty sweatshirts, is less effective for tracking dirty equipment or faulty ventilation, which may be getting dust on sweatshirts in the first place.

So another institute project used air quality monitors to help mines and miners better understand sources of exposure within mines. In a recently published pilot study, weekly reports of real-time data helped staff at sand mine notice minute by minute shifts in dust at key locations. 
As a result, the mine’s industrial hygienist turned some machines on before miners arrived for the day, so they wouldn’t be exposed to an extra burst of dust that spiked when machines were starting up. 
A foreman also noticed a dust hot spot near a particular conveyor belt and used parts they had on hand to come up with a fix, reducing dust in the area threefold.
The approach is promising, and NIOSH has a history of creating useful gadgets for miners that are now widely used and often legally required. From October to January, those researchers made several site visits. Then, nothing. 
That project is currently paused, along with much of NIOSH’s other research into silica exposure and impacts.
Many dust monitors test general dust levels; teasing out silica in particular means distinguishing one speck of dust from another. So researchers were working to make same-day infrared spectroscopy tests more accurate. Others were developing continuous, real-time silica monitoring tools. 
Mining researchers were also collaborating with the NIOSH chemistry team to understand exposures to silica in nano-clay, or particles of clay minerals. But the institute’s analytical chemists are all still facing layoffs. So are the researchers trying to address all the other hazards miners face. 
Federal mine safety and health research began in earnest in the 1910s, around the time Anita’s father was born. Back then, hundreds of coal miners died each year in mine explosions. 
NIOSH and its predecessors made those incidents rare. But mine risks keep evolving: As mines age, for example, massive sinkholes can appear, and institute researchers have been helping mine operators predict them. 
They are also studying ways to keep lithium batteries from exploding, working to understand if a growing number of natural gas wells could leak explosive methane into mines and devising ways to better prepare miners to survive accidents using virtual reality and to prevent accidents involving giant haul trucks. 
All of that work is now on pause. 
*   *   *
Wolfe hopes that the Department of Health and Human Services will restore NIOSH researchers voluntarily. A recent Health and Human Services draft budget for 2026 includes stable funding for mining research, even though researchers are not currently working.
In the meantime, the fate of their work could be determined by another court case, this one brought against the Trump administration by plaintiffs including Hoebbel’s union, the American Federation of Government Employees. 
It’s among several lawsuits that allege that by cutting funding and staff without authorization, the administration’s DOGE initiative has usurped the powers of Congress. 
Many institute layoffs were previously scheduled for June 2. But several days before, a judge issued an injunction putting the layoffs on pause until that case is adjudicated. The Trump administration has appealed that injunction to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
At issue is whether Congress has the right to commit to generational goals, like the health of miners, that require stability as executives come and go.
For Wolfe, the answer is obvious. “I always tell people: ‘I’m not gonna argue with you about whether coal is good or bad. But as long as it’s mined and there are coal miners, we need to take care of them.’”

(Photo by Anna Claire Vollers/Stateline)HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — Mike Leslie, 66, sits at a desk beneath the buzz of fluorescent office lights, his fingers hovering over his new laptop keyboard. He smiles, eyes crinkling beneath a worn baseball cap. It’s a place he never imagined he’d be sitting.
Before last year, he’d never used a computer.
For most of his life, Leslie hadn’t needed one. He spent 36 years in pipe manufacturing near his North Alabama hometown, in jobs that included welding, driving forklifts, mixing concrete and running crews as a foreman. The work was hard and physical, but he didn’t mind.
Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Layoffs followed.
Leslie found himself looking for a job to make ends meet, at an age when more affluent men might think of retiring. He was no longer suited for manufacturing work. But he also lacked experience with the technology that now powers even the most basic tasks in nearly every modern workplace, such as the internet, email and Microsoft Office.
“A lot of people think old people are obsolete, but they’re not,” he said. “There’s a lot of knowledge in their heads. They just need the opportunity to get it out and learn new things.”
His life’s unexpected second act began in late 2023, thanks to an obscure state-federal initiative called the Senior Community Service Employment Program. For people ages 55 and older with low incomes, it provides paid part-time work at local nonprofits and government agencies such as libraries, senior centers and the Red Cross. Its on-the-job training is meant to prepare participants to transition into permanent jobs.
But 700 miles away in Washington, D.C., Congress is considering axing the funding for the very program that has made this new chapter of Leslie’s life possible. In his budget for the coming fiscal year, President Donald Trump has recommended eliminating this and some other programs that fall under the Older Americans Act, a landmark 1965 law that provides social and meal services for older people. The U.S. House also proposed eliminating the employment program’s funding in fiscal year 2025, while the Senate proposed keeping it.
At this point, experts say, anything is possible.
Advocates fear that the loss of this program, which serves about 50,000 older adults nationwide, could affect not just participants like Leslie, but also stretch further into communities, removing tens of thousands of employees from local libraries, city recreation facilities and senior centers.
 Isolated and unsure

Sitting at home post-layoff, Leslie felt isolated and unsure about what to do next. A friend told him about the job program, and he eventually decided to apply. He got in.
Medicaid cuts may disproportionately affect Black, Latino doctors and their patients

Now he helps manage the fleet of vehicles at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, a multicounty agency based in Huntsville that provides support services to older Americans and people with disabilities. As part of the program, he enrolled in a digital certification program that provided him with a laptop, prepaid internet access and a 10-week education course that taught him the basics of the Microsoft Office suite, email, internet, social media and other skills.
For Leslie, it’s been a foothold into a workforce that felt like it had moved on without him.
“You’ve got purpose,” he says, “getting up every morning, coming to a job you like.”
He’s a favorite around the office, where everyone calls him “Mr. Mike.”
In April, he wore a three-piece suit to the officewide celebration where he received a graduation certificate for acing his digital skills courses. He made his co-workers cry as he told them about how the program had given him his confidence back.
 ‘Lost in D.C.’

On a recent Wednesday afternoon, in a conference room not far from Leslie’s desk, some of his managers at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, known as TARCOG, were sitting around a table discussing what to do.
It had been a chaotic few months. TARCOG is responsible for administering many services for older people, from Meals on Wheels to transportation, caregiver support to services that prevent abuse and exploitation.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration began to dismantle the federal agency responsible for overseeing such services, while his proposed federal budget recommended cutting or freezing spending on them, including the employment program.
Michelle Jordan, TARCOG’s executive director, had been fielding questions from local leaders who were aghast that Meals on Wheels might be canceled. Across the country, national and local advocates at similar agencies sounded the alarm. In some states, local groups like TARCOG have reported delays in receiving federal funds they were promised.
Earlier this month, the Trump administration reversed course and recommended that most of the programs for older adults continue under a new federal agency.










These are people who worked hard all their lives. But they can’t pay the heating bill. They have to decide between medicine and groceries.


– Nancy Robertson, former executive director of the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments



But a few of the Older Americans Act programs would be left without funding. One of the largest is the senior employment program.
“These are real people, and I think that gets lost in D.C.,” said Sheila Dessau-Ivey, who directs the aging programs at TARCOG. “They just see programs and dollars, and say, ‘Well, we don’t need these.’ But those dollars are actually attached to a human life.”
The Senior Community Service Employment Program is a tiny fraction of the size of budgetary behemoths such as Medicaid and Medicare. Its budget is about $400 million and it serves about 50,000 older people nationwide each year. Eighty-six of those slots — including Leslie’s — are in the five-county swath of North Alabama served by TARCOG.
To qualify under the nationwide Senior Community Service Employment Program, a person must be at least 55 years old, unemployed, and have a family income of no more than 125% of the federal poverty level. For an individual, that’s currently $19,562 a year. Veterans are given priority in the program, as are people with disabilities, rural residents, people over age 65 and those experiencing homelessness. Funding comes mainly through the U.S. Department of Labor.
“We’ve had workers who were homeless when they started this program,” Jordan said. Past research found about 3 in 5 participants nationally reported being homeless or at risk of homelessness.
“You forget there are people living with us, sitting next to us in church, going to the grocery store with us, who just don’t have those skills or that confidence,” she said.
And it has an outsize impact on other vulnerable groups. In 2019, about two-thirds of participants were women, and about 44% were Black, according to research. A majority of participants reported having a high school diploma or less.
“These are people who worked hard all their lives, but they can’t pay the heating bill,” said Nancy Robertson, TARCOG’s retired former executive director, who’d come into the office to lend her experience to the group discussing how to advocate for funding.
“They have to decide between medicine and groceries.”
The program participants aren’t the only ones that would be hurt by the loss of the program, she said.
Participants can stay in the program up to four years. While they’re there, they provide more than 40 million hours of work to public and nonprofit agencies across the nation. The agencies and community groups that hire the participants — with salaries paid by the program — would lose those employees. An employee working in a small-town library, for example, might be the only reason the library is able to remain open for certain hours.
In Huntsville, the local senior center would lose 14 of its employees if the employment program closes. Across town at a community rec center, a beloved 91-year-old receptionist would lose the job she trained for.
 Congressional chaos

The U.S. population is aging rapidly. In 2003, about 1 in 7 people in the U.S. labor force was 55 or older. By 2023, that share was nearly 1 in 4. One of the looming challenges for lawmakers and community advocates is how to keep older people healthy and thriving.
Medicaid cuts could hurt older adults who rely on home care, nursing homes

As Republicans consider adding work requirements to programs like Medicaid, cutting funding for a work program designed to help older people doesn’t make sense, said Marci Phillips, director of public policy and advocacy at the National Council on Aging, a nonprofit organization focused on issues that affect older adults.
“If people age 55 and older have to show they’re working to qualify for Medicaid, but [lawmakers] are cutting the federal program to help workers age 55 and older, there’s a disconnect there,” she said.
Some lawmakers question the usefulness of the program. In 2019, only about 38% of participants who exited the program were employed a few months later, according to a 2022 study. That share was below the U.S. Department of Labor’s goal of 42%. Median earnings were also below federal goals.
Phillips said the program shouldn’t be judged by the metrics that are used to measure whether a traditional workforce development program is succeeding.
“These are older adults who have to work, but the realities of their health and their caregiving situations aren’t changing,” she said. “It’s a standard that doesn’t really recognize the population we’re trying to serve.”
Programs that are funded under the Older Americans Act are discretionary, meaning Congress can’t cut or eliminate them in the reconciliation bill that’s currently before the Senate and that has generated public outcry over potential cuts to programs including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps.
Trump has recommended eliminating funding for the employment program, but ultimately its fate lies in the hands of Congress.
The U.S. House is scheduled to take up the appropriations bill that provides funding for these programs the week of July 20. The Senate’s plans are less certain, as its members remain focused on Trump’s reconciliation bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. And it’s conceivable, Phillips said, that Congress may instead pass a continuing resolution, a temporary measure that keeps the government funded at current levels.
For his part, Leslie would like to travel to Washington to testify before Congress. If anyone understands the needs of older Americans, he figures, it’s them.
“Society looks at older people as not useful, but if you look at the people in Congress, they’re old folks too,” Leslie said. “If you’re old, why would you not want another older person to have something, to learn something?”
 Future possibilities

Leslie is studying to earn his license as a private investigator. It’s a job he’s always wanted, and now he feels like he has the skills he needs to chase that dream.
He’s also trying to organize a workshop this fall to be held at his church, Beaver Dam Primitive Baptist, where he hopes he and some of his TARCOG co-workers can share about services and programs available to help older adults.
“We’ve got 26 churches in our association, so we’ve reached out to all of them, saying there’s these things you need to know about,” Leslie said. “If I had known about some of this stuff when my dad was living, he may have had a better quality of life.”
He doesn’t know if his own program will be one of those still available by then, but he’s hopeful.
He believes the biggest reward has been less tangible than the modest paycheck and newfound computer skills, but more profound: The sense that his life has opened back up, full of possibilities.
“Senior citizens have a purpose in this world, and we can’t think that because they’re old we can just throw them away,” Leslie said. “They’ve still got knowledge. I think we should give them every chance to succeed.”

More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In Colorado, 12.3 people died by gun suicide per 100,000 residents that year. In total, 27,300 people in the U.S. died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.

Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.
“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
In April, the Colorado governor signed into law Senate Bill 25-3, which sets training requirements to purchase most semiautomatic firearms.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.
Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Hunters, hikers and outdoors lovers of all stripes mounted a campaign this month against a Republican proposal to sell off millions of acres of federal public land.
The public outcry was so forceful that the measure’s sponsor pledged to scale back the proposal. Then on Saturday, before an initial U.S. Senate vote on Republicans’ tax and spending cuts package, he withdrew it altogether.
But even though the land sales proposal was defeated, experts say federal lands face a slew of other threats from President Donald Trump’s administration. Agency leaders have proposed rolling back the “Roadless Rule” that protects 58 million acres from logging and other uses. Trump’s Justice Department has issued a legal opinion that the president is allowed to abolish national monuments. Regulators have moved to slash environmental rules to ramp up logging and oil and gas production. And Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce have gutted the ranks of the agencies that manage federal lands.
“This is not over even if the sell-off proposal doesn’t make it,” said John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration. “The whole thing about leasing or selling timber or throwing them open to mining claims, that’s a form of partial privatization. It’s pretty much a giveaway.”
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum has repeatedly described public lands as America’s “balance sheet.” He has argued that some lands could be used to provide housing, while calling for an expansion of mining and oil and gas drilling to increase their economic output.
“President Trump’s energy dominance vision will end those wars abroad, will make life more affordable for every family in America by driving down inflation,” Burgum said before his confirmation hearing.

Public lands advocates are bracing for ongoing battles for the rest of Trump’s term in office. They expect Republicans to add last-minute public lands amendments to other bills moving through Congress, and for land management agencies to attempt to strip protections from other federal lands. Given the vocal backlash to the initial sell-off plan, advocates expect future attempts to be shaped behind closed doors and advanced with little time for opponents to mount a defense.
Meanwhile, they expect states to play a key role in shaping those battles. In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, many leaders from both parties view public lands as special places open to all Americans and critical for clean water, wildlife and tourism. But some conservatives resent the fact that large portions of their states are managed by officials in Washington, D.C., limiting development and private enterprise.
Officials in some states, including Idaho, Utah and Wyoming, have pushed lawsuits or resolutions seeking to force the feds to hand over huge amounts of land. Public land experts say the lawmakers behind those efforts will likely press harder now that Trump is in the White House. Such state-level takeover attempts could shape the proposals that emerge from Trump’s allies in Washington.
Sell-off proposal
The firestorm over federal lands exploded when U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, introduced legislation that would force the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 3.3 million acres of land. The measure also would direct the agencies to make more than 250 million additional acres eligible for sale.
“We’ve never seen a threat on this magnitude ever,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “There’s been an overwhelming amount of opposition. We’ve seen record-breaking engagement on this issue.”
Lee, a longtime federal lands opponent, claimed the lands were needed for housing and argued the government has been a poor manager of its land.
“Washington has proven time and again it can’t manage this land,” Lee said earlier this month when announcing the proposal. “This bill puts it in better hands.”
But a wide-ranging coalition of opponents argued that the proposal had no protections to ensure the lands would be used for affordable housing, and that many of the parcels eligible for sale had little housing potential. A furious social media campaign highlighted cherished hiking trails, fishing lakes and ski slopes that were in danger of being sold, urging people to call their lawmakers to oppose the measure.
In recent days, Montana Republican U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, as well as Idaho Republican U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch, came out in opposition to the land sale proposal. That put into question whether Lee’s legislation could earn even a simple majority.
As USDA announces plans to repeal ‘roadless’ rule, ND has 250,000 acres that could be affected

Then the Senate parliamentarian ruled the sell-off could not be included in the reconciliation bill without a 60-vote majority. That ruling came a day after Lee posted on social media that he would be making changes to the bill in response to concerns from Hunter Nation, a nonprofit whose board includes Donald Trump Jr.
Lee released a scaled-back measure last week that would exempt national forest lands but would direct the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 1.2 million acres. It would require land for sale to be within five miles of a population center and developed to provide housing.
Public land advocates say Lee’s changes did little to assuage their concerns. They argue that federal land sales or transfers should happen through the current, long-standing process, which requires local stakeholder input and directs the proceeds from land sales to be reinvested into conservation and public access on other parcels.
“It’s the overwhelming belief of hunters and anglers that the budget reconciliation process is not the appropriate vehicle for public land sales,” said O’Dea, with the hunting and fishing group.
On Saturday evening, Lee announced that he was withdrawing the proposal, saying that Senate rules did not allow him to include protections that land would not be sold to foreign interests. But he pledged to continue the battle over federal land ownership, working with Trump to “put underutilized federal land to work for American families.”
States’ role
While the sell-off proposal aligned with some state officials’ goal of taking over federal lands, some lands experts say private developers would have been the real winner.
“If the lands are transferred to the states without money, the states lose,” said Leshy, the former Interior Department official. “It’s a hit on their budget, which means they’re gonna have to sell them off. If states got a significant amount of public lands, a lot of that would end up in private hands.”
In Utah, where leaders have made the most aggressive push to take over federal lands, lawmakers argue that they could raise lease prices for oil and gas operations, bringing in enough revenue to cover the state’s management costs.
“The policy of the state is to keep these lands open and available to the public,” Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican, told Stateline last month.
O’Dea pointed to an economic analysis of what it would cost Montana to take over federal lands. The report found it would cost the state $8 billion over 20 years to take on wildfire management, deferred maintenance and mine reclamation. He noted that many Western states have sold off a majority of the “trust lands” they were granted at statehood, undermining claims that a state takeover would leave lands in the public domain.
Other proposals
While Lee’s land sales proposal has gotten the biggest headlines, public land advocates are fighting a multifront battle against the Trump administration’s moves to roll back the protected status of certain lands, slash environmental rules, and expand logging, mining and drilling operations.
“The approach is to throw as much as you can at the wall and see what sticks,” O’Dea said. “There’s only so much you can mobilize opposition to. There’s a huge risk that some of these things could fly under the radar.”
Some conservative states and industry groups say Trump is allowing federal lands to be used to their full economic potential. Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, a Republican, said his constituents are “keenly aware of how the federal government’s ownership of 60 percent of Alaska’s lands can inhibit economic development and cause challenges for our communities.”
Leshy noted that public lands have proven to be a popular cause, but Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce could undermine public confidence that the federal government is capable of managing the land.
“if you make it terrible for long enough, maybe people say, ‘The feds shouldn’t be managing this, they do such a bad job,’” he said.

Tony Evers delivers his 2025 state budget address. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Gov. Tony Evers and Republican and Democratic legislative leaders have reached a tentative agreement on the 2025-27 state budget, agreeing to invest hundreds of millions in the University of Wisconsin system, to create new grant and payment programs for child care facilities, further boost investment in special education and cut $1.3 billion in taxes.
The deal comes after months of negotiations (and multiple breakdowns in communication) among Evers and Senate and Assembly leaders. Each leader highlighted pieces of the deal in statements.
Evers focused on the investments in education and child care, saying it is “a pro-kid budget that’s a win for Wisconsin’s kids, families, and our future.” 
“What was at stake is no secret — Republican lawmakers had long indicated this budget would not invest in child care providers, would provide no new increases for our K-12 schools, and would cut nearly $90 million from our UW System. But I never stopped believing we could work together to reach consensus and pass a bipartisan budget, and I’m proud of the months of work that went into getting to where we are today,” he said. 
Evers thanked Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg), Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) and Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) for coming to the table to get a deal done. 
“The people of Wisconsin expect their leaders to show up, work hard, and operate in good faith to get good things done,” Evers said. “We’ve shown we’ve been able to get good things done for Wisconsin when people put politics aside and decide to work together to do the right thing. I look forward to signing a bipartisan budget that makes these critical investments in our kids, families, and communities across our state,” Evers said. 
Evers has also agreed not to utilize his partial veto power — previous uses of which have been both limited and sustained by the state Supreme Court in recent weeks — on parts of the budget included in the deal.
Vos said in a statement that he appreciated Evers’ willingness to work with lawmakers to find a bipartisan agreement.
“This budget delivers on our two biggest priorities: tax relief for Wisconsin and reforms to make government more accountable,” Vos said. “This deal brings those investments and reforms together and creates a Wisconsin that works for everyone.” 
JFC co-chair Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) said legislators worked hard to find compromise while staying “committed to our core principals.” 
“We are proud to have worked diligently to craft this budget, listened to the priorities of our constituents and look forward to sending the bill to [Evers] later this week,” Born said. 
LeMahieu and budget committee co-chair Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) said in a statement that tax relief for middle-income Wisconsinites has been their top priority during the entire process.
“This compromise will provide meaningful tax relief for retirees and the middle class, stabilize the child care system without making pandemic-era subsidies permanent and strengthen our schools by reimbursing special education at a higher rate,” the Senate leaders said. 
Hesselbein  said she has “been at the table fighting hard on behalf of Senate Democrats to help hammer out a bipartisan budget agreement.” Her involvement in negotiations comes amid slim margins in the Senate. 
“Remember where we were a week ago: Republicans proposing $87 million in cuts to the UW, a mere 5% increase for special education and no direct payments to child care providers. Elections matter: the fact that Democrats gained four Senate seats and are close to taking the majority means that Senate Democrats were able to make this budget agreement better for the people of Wisconsin,” Hesselbein said.
Last session, the state Senate passed the budget bill with only Republican votes even after a couple of Republicans voted against the proposal. This session the Republican Senate caucus would only be able to lose one vote if it were going to pass the bill with only GOP support, yet, even prior to a deal announcement, a handful of Republican members had publicly expressed concerns about the spending in the bill. Among them was Sen. Steve Nass who, in a statement last week, laid out requirements for a budget that he could support, Sen. Rob Hutton who, in a Friday opinion piece, and Sen. Chris Kapenga who, in a post on Monday, drew their own lines in the sand.  
It is unclear how many Senate Democrats will vote for the budget when it comes to the floor this week. Sen. LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee) earlier told WISN UpFront that the caucus was sticking together and members were “not willing to be picked off one by one.”
The Joint Finance Committee is scheduled to meet at 9 a.m. Tuesday to vote on the rest of the budget before sending it to the full Assembly and Senate. 
Child care funding 
Child care providers, who have dealt with staffing shortages, high costs and declining state support, will receive a $300 million investment under the deal.
Evers had proposed spending an additional $480 million to continue funding Child Care Counts, a program that was funded using federal pandemic relief. With that funding running out, Evers had said the state should pick up the costs to continue supporting child care providers, while Republican lawmakers said they were opposed to providing checks to facilities.
Under the deal, the Child Care Counts program will be phased out, but the state will invest $110 million to support direct monthly payments and monthly per-child investments to child care facilities for a bridge program. That will continue helping providers to remain in business, cut child care wait lists and lower costs for families. The money will come out of the state’s federal interest earnings. 
The state will also invest $66 million in general purpose revenue for a “Get Kids Ready” initiative, which will be targeted at supporting child care providers serving 4-year-olds. This will be the first child care program in state history to be funded solely by general purpose revenue. 
Another agreed-upon budget item creates a $28.6 million pilot program to help support child care capacity for infants and toddlers. 
Under the program, providers are to receive $200 per month for every infant under 18 months and $100 per month for every toddler between 18 and 30 months.
Other child care investments include a $123 million increase in the Wisconsin Shares program, $2 million over the biennium for the creation of a competitive grant program aimed at supporting child care facilities seeking to expand their capacity and $2 million in Wisconsin’s Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies to help parents find child care and provide training to providers.
The deal also makes changes inspired by solutions that Republican lawmakers have advocated for including creating “large family care centers” that will be allowed to serve up to 12 children and standardizing the minimum age for an assistant teacher in a child care facility at 16. 
No cuts for University of Wisconsin system 
The University of Wisconsin system will get an investment of more than $256 million in the state budget under the deal — a significant compromise as Evers and the system had requested an $855 million investment, while Republican leaders in recent weeks were considering an $87 million cut to the system. Evers had threatened to veto the budget if it came to his desk with a cut. 
The funding includes $100 million to support UW system campuses statewide. Some of the funding would be distributed to campuses according to a formula. Of this, $15.25 million each year would be distributed to campuses with declining enrollment over the last two years and $11.25 million each year through a formula dependent on the number of credit hours undergraduates complete.
There will also be $7 million across the biennium to provide 24/7 virtual telehealth mental health services across UW system campuses, $54 million to support retainment and recruitment of faculty and staff, $94 million to increase wages by 3% in the first year and 2% in the second year for UW system employees and $1 million for UW-Green Bay’s Rising Phoenix Early College High School Program. 
The UW system will also be required to maintain the number of positions funded with general purpose revenue and program revenue at January 2024 levels. 
The system will also get over $840 million for capital projects. Other parts of the capital budget, including the Green Bay Correctional Institution, were addressed in the deal. 

$194 million for UW-La Crosse to complete the construction of the Prairie Springs Science Center and to demolish Crowley Hall 
$189 million for UW-Milwaukee to renovate the Health Sciences and Northwest Quadrant complex
$137 million for UW-Oshkosh to demolish a library facility, renovate and add a brand-new replacement addition 
$10 million for UW-Madison to renovate and build a new addition to Dejope Residence Hall 
$98 million for UW-Stevens Point to renovate and build a new addition to Sentry Hall
$800,000 for UW-Milwaukee to plan for renovations at Sandburg Hall East Tower 
Nearly $32 million for UW-Stout to renovate and build a new addition at its recreation complex
Nearly $19 million for UW-Madison to renovate the Chadbourne Residence Dining Hall, $5 million to plan for relocation and demolition of the UW-Madison Humanities Building and $160 million for renovation of UW-Madison’s Science Hall

K-12 special education funding up to 45% 
The deal also makes changes to the budget that Republican lawmakers on the budget committee passed in mid-June, boosting the special education reimbursement rate to 45% by the second year of the budget. 
The state’s special education rate was one of the crucial issues discussed by education advocates with many saying a significant investment would help alleviate some of the financial stress schools have faced and ease districts’ reliance on property taxes. 
Some advocates had called for a 90% investment, while Evers proposed a 60% rate. Republican lawmakers had initially approved raising the rate to 35% in the first year of the budget and 37.5% in the second year. 
Under the deal, the total investment in the special education reimbursement will be over $500 million. The rate will rise to 42% in the first half of the biennium and 45% in the second. It will remain at a sum certain rate, meaning the amount of money allocated is finite and will not increase based on expanding demand. 
The budget deal will also invest $30 million for comprehensive school-based mental health services.
Department of Health Services changes
The deal would also increase the hospital assessment rate to help maintain the state’s Medicaid costs. The Wisconsin Hospital Assessment is a levy from certain hospitals that the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) uses to fund hospital access payments, hospital supplemental payments and reinvestment in the Wisconsin Medicaid program. 
Wisconsin hospitals currently pay an assessment rate of about 1.8% of their net patient revenue to the DHS. That would rise to 6% under the deal with 30% of the funds being retained in the Medical Assistance Trust Fund, which supports Wisconsin’s Medicaid program. The rest of the funds will be used to invest in hospital provider payments and is estimated to provide over $1.1 billion in additional investments in Wisconsin hospitals. 
The changes use federal funding to increase hospital reimbursement while decreasing the amount of general program revenue for the Medicaid program.
Evers’ office noted that federal reconciliation legislation proposals have included provisions that would prohibit or limit the policy change in the future, meaning that this budget could be the last for Wisconsin to make these types of changes.
The state will also fund the current Medicaid program under the deal. 
The budget will also increase investments in free and charitable clinics by $1.5 million.
The deal does not include Medicaid expansion, which Evers continued to advocate for in the budget but Republican leaders have fervently opposed. It also doesn’t include the smaller postpartum Medicaid extension, which would allow postpartum mothers to receive Medicaid coverage for up to a year after giving birth. 
Wisconsin is one of 10 states not to take the Medicaid expansion and one of two not to take the postpartum expansion. 
Roads improvement program gets additional investment 
A couple of projects created in the last budget to help with road improvement will get additional funding under the deal
The state will allocate $150 million in the Agricultural Roads Improvement Program, which was created in 2023 to support local agricultural road improvement projects statewide. Of the additional funding, $30 million will go towards improving and repairing deteriorating bridges across the state.
According to Evers’ office, the program has so far funded 92 projects across the state. 
The deal would also generate nearly $200 million in additional revenue to improve the sustainability of the transportation fund, allocate $14 million for municipal service payments, invest $50 million to continue the Local Projects Program (also created in the 2023 budget), which supports local communities with construction projects that serve statewide public purpose, allocate $15 million for repairs and modifications to the Echo Lake Dam, invest $5 million for the Browns Lake dredging project and invest $30 million for the De Pere railroad bridge.
$1.3 billion in tax cuts
Evers has also agreed to support the tax cuts that lawmakers approved in committee in mid-June. 
Under those changes, more people will qualify for the state’s second tax bracket with a rate of 4.4%. For single filers, the qualifying maximum income will increase from $29,370 to $50,480. For joint filers, the maximum will increase from $39,150 to $67,300 and for married separate filers, the maximum will increase from $19,580 to $33,650.
It’s estimated that this will reduce the state’s revenues by $323 million in 2025-26 and $320 million in 2026-27.
The cut will affect 1.6 million Wisconsin taxpayers and provide an average cut of $180. Under Wisconsin’s tax system, people pay the first-bracket tax rate on the portion of their income that falls into that bracket, the second-bracket rate on their income up to the maximum of the second bracket and so on. Thus even high-income earners will get a tax break through adjustments to the lower bracket rates.
The proposal also included an income tax exclusion for retirees. It is estimated to reduce Wisconsin’s revenues by $395 million in 2025-26 and $300 million in 2026-27. This will allow Wisconsinites 67 and older to exclude up to $24,000 for single-filers and $48,000 for married-joint filers of retirement income payments. Those filers will see an average cut of about $1,000 per filer.
The deal will also include the elimination of the sales tax on household utility bills, which is estimated to cost the state about $178 million over the biennium and create a film tax credit similar to one that Republican lawmakers have been advocating for.

Ford/Maryland Matters)A federal judge gave Justice Department lawyers until noon Tuesday to confirm, in writing, the administration’s plans for implementing an executive order on birthright citizenship after the U.S. Supreme Court lifted nationwide injunctions on the order Friday.
Justice Department attorney Brad Rosenberg said at a hearing in U.S. District Court in Maryland on Monday that the Trump administration does not plan to begin acting on the order — which would deny citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. if neither parent was a citizen — for another four weeks.
That’s the grace period set in the Supreme Court’s Friday ruling.
But U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman was looking for more than verbal assurances.
“I want to know if the government thinks that it can start removing children from the United States who are subject to the terms of the executive order, and who are not plaintiffs or members of the plaintiff’s organization,” Boardman said.
She ordered Rosenberg to submit in writing, by noon Tuesday, the government’s view of what it can do under the executive order. She also gave Rosenberg until next Monday to respond to the motion by immigrant parents and soon-to-be parents to turn the case into a class action lawsuit — the reason for Tuesday’s hearing.
Last Friday’s ruling allows Trump’s birthright citizenship order to take effect in the 28 states, including South Carolina, that were not part of the initial lawsuits challenging it.
The Supreme Court ruled that Boardman and judges in two other districts in the U.S. could only block the executive order against plaintiffs that brought the respective cases, but said the district judges did not have the authority to impose nationwide injunctions.
How rights and citizenship under the 14th Amendment were tested in SC

But the ruling, as well as a concurring and a dissenting opinion, all said “that courts may award injunctive relief beyond the named parties when the case is brought as a class action.”
So, attorneys for pregnant immigrants were back in court Monday with a complaint involving 15 women who live in nine states, including South Carolina.
They seek to turn the case into a class action for “all children who have been born or will be born in the United States on or after February 19, 2025, who are designated by Executive Order 14,160 to be ineligible for birthright citizenship, and their parents.”
That class involves thousands of babies who have been born since Feb. 19, the day President Donald Trump’s executive order was scheduled to take effect, and thousands more who will be born while the case is decided, as well as their parents, the motion said.
A recent study by the Migration Policy Institute estimated that eliminating birthright citizenship could affect up to 250,000 babies a year.
The attorneys also asked Boardman to grant a preliminary injunction against Trump’s order immediately, to prevent any harm to their clients while the requst for class certification proceeded.
“Removal is not the only irreparable harm that we’re concerned about,” said William Powell, an attorney for the plaintiffs, during Monday’s hearing. “We’re obviously also concerned about other potential ways in which the order could be enforced to deprive newborns of potential rights.”
Potential members of the class are also documenting stress and anxiety, Powell said. He shared an anecdote about a plaintiff who is experiencing a more stressful and difficult pregnancy because she fears what will happen once her child is born.
“It is confusing to them exactly what these things mean,” Powell said. “We can’t really assure them the order is fully blocked, because it’s not.”
President Donald Trump issued the order on Jan. 20, his first day back in office. It claimed that citizenship does not automatically extend to everyone born in the U.S., excluding mothers who are here illegally or on a temporary visas unless the father has citizenship or is here with permanent legal resident status.
Rosenberg argued against class certification, which he said would be “prejudicial” to the government, and noted that the plaintiffs could have moved for class certification before Friday.
The case filed by CASA and the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project includes 15 women — under pseudonyms because of their legal status — in nine states: Maryland, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Washington.
Some are in the U.S. without documentation, some are here on visas, many have asylum or other immigration applications pending in various stages.
The pregnant woman in South Carolina, identified as “Monica,” is due in August. She and her husband are from Venezuela, living in the United States since 2019. Both have temporary protected status. She is a medical doctor seeking to validate her medical degree in the United States, according to the court filing.
“If her child is not given U.S. citizenship, Monica fears her child will be stateless, without rights in this country or any other,” it reads. “Although Monica and her husband are excited to welcome their baby into the world, they are also filled with uncertainty and fear over what status their child will have.”

Jay Reedy confirmed he is running for the 7th Congressional District seat set to be vacated by U.S. Rep. Mark Green.
Reedy, an Erin Republican, said he filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to enter the election and could announce his candidacy this week.
Green is planning to leave the post after voting on President Donald Trump’s spending plan, creating an opening for a host of candidates in a special election to be scheduled this year. 
Reedy is the latest Republican to say he will run for the seat, a position he said he wants to fill in an effort to cut federal bureaucracy and support Trump’s policies. Reedy testified for federal prosecutors in the April political corruption trial against former House Speaker Glen Casada and his top aide, Cade Cothren, who were convicted on nearly 20 counts of conspiracy, fraud and kickbacks.
In his sixth two-year House term, Reedy said he has been bothered by the federal government’s slow reaction to flood damage in Waverly in August 2021 where 20 people died and the community lost two school buildings. 
The Federal Emergency Management Agency provided $20 million to replace the schools, but FEMA required Waverly to resubmit paperwork, delaying work on the projects.
In addition, Reedy said the U.S. Department of Education should be eliminated because of its expense, roughly $268 billion, about $2.6 billion of which is sent to Tennessee. He also questioned environmental enforcement on farmland across the state.
“The federal government needs to stay out of Tennessee’s business,” Reedy said, adding he signed numerous lawsuits against the Obama and Biden administrations.
Other Republican candidates for the post are former Tennessee General Services Commissioner Matt Van Epps, and Springfield resident Jon Thorpe and Jason Knight of Clarksville.
Van Epps recently announced his leadership team with car dealership magnate Lee Beaman and his wife, Julie, serving as honorary co-chairs. Alex Joyner, who managed Green’s re-election campaigns in 2022 and 2024, will serve as campaign manager, and Rachel Barrett, another Green staffer, will lead finance operations. 
No Democratic candidates have announced yet they will run.

The owners of a Memphis-based health clinic MedPartners and SarJo Pharmacy purported to treat injured United States Postal Service employees, billing the cost of medications to the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act (FECA), according to an indictment filed June 12.
But the medication was never prescribed to patients, and the majority of the medications were not carried in stock by the pharmacy. About 500 of the 4,052 claims billed by SarJo Pharmacy between August 2018 and August 2021 were for drugs that were never actually manufactured or available to be purchased, the indictment states.
Collierville residents Kossie Lamon Simmons, 59, and Katina Marzie Simmons, 48, face charges of health care fraud and conspiracy to commit health care fraud and wire fraud, alongside 47-year-old Memphis resident Tritia Margalizita Townsend, who served as SarJo Pharmacy’s pharmacist in charge.
Between August 2018 and December 2021, FECA paid the pharmacy about $16.3 million. 
“Kossie, Katina and Townsend personally profited from their participation in the scheme by receiving fraud proceeds for the personal use and benefit of themselves and others,” the indictment states.
The trio are among 324 defendants facing charges as part of the U.S. Department of Justice’s 2025 National Health Care Fraud Takedown, according to Interim U.S. Attorney Joseph C. Murphy, Jr. The operation targeted those with alleged involvement in health care fraud and illegal drug diversion schemes throughout the United States. 
Indictment details alleged scheme
Kossie Simmons controlled and managed MedPartners, a health clinic founded in 2016 with locations in Memphis, Nashville, and Little Rock, Arkansas, according to the indictment filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee. Kossie Simmons also controlled and managed SarJo Pharmacy, which was founded in 2018 and had one location in Memphis. 
Katina Simmons managed and held 70% ownership interest in both companies. 
The indictment mentions an unnamed co-conspirator that held 30% ownership interest in both companies. Kossie Simmons, who previously pleaded guilty to health care fraud in 2007 and was barred from participating in any federal health care program for 25 years, exchanged text messages with the co-conspirator in August 2016.
“Been patiently waiting for the planets to come back into alignment from my first go round, now can attack this opportunity with the most valuable weapon of all EXPERIENCE,” Kossie Simmons wrote in one text message, according to the indictment. 
Katina Simmons enrolled MedPartners as a billing agent for the FECA program in August 2016, and enrolled the clinic as a physician office in the program in 2017, though Kossie Simmons was specifically barred from participating in a federal health care program.
SarJo Pharmacy opened in 2018 with Townsend as the only employed pharmacist. Townsend worked one day each week for four hours filling prescriptions for lidocaine and diclofenac, an anti-inflammatory medicine used to treat pain, the indictment states.
The Tennessee Board of Pharmacy began investigating the business in September 2020 and discovered the pharmacy was billing for prescription medications without valid prescription orders. Instead, two nurse practitioners who worked in MedPartners’ clinics would determine whether patients were eligible for compounded medications, or medicines created using drug ingredients “tailored to the needs of an individual patient,” according to the indictment.
Two other physicians who worked with MedPartners never authorized prescriptions for the medications billed, and the nurse practitioners did not have access to prescription pads, according to court documents.
Investigators executed search warrants on the businesses in August 2021. The businesses submitted 227 more claims between the searches and the end of that year, bringing in another $1.1 million in payments.
Kossie and Katina Simmons each face one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and health care fraud, which carries penalties of up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, if convicted. They also face seven counts of health care fraud, which carry penalties of up to 10 years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000, if convicted. 
Townsend faces one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and health care fraud and three counts of health care fraud.

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has signed the state’s massive operating budget, which includes funding for a new Cleveland Browns domed stadium and provides tax cuts for the wealthy.
This is a developing story and will be updated. The governor will have a press conference at 10 a.m. Tuesday on his decisions.
At 11:15 p.m. Monday, DeWine announced he approved the about $60-billion Republican spending bill. As of 1:30 a.m., he was only midway through scanning his 67 line-item vetoes, spokesperson Dan Tierney said.
So far, we know several items approved in the budget.
The Browns will be getting $600 million for their new Brook Park stadium.
The budget calls for the state to take legal ownership of $1.7 billion in unclaimed funds, setting a clock on how long people have to file claims and get reunited with their missing money.
That’s a major change for Ohio, which currently holds unclaimed funds in perpetuity. The budget will give people a decade to claim their money before it becomes the state’s property. Lawmakers want to grab $1.7 billion out of Ohio’s $4.8 billion pool of unclaimed funds right away — and then continue taking money on a rolling basis, after a decade of holding it.
The budget also changes a state law designed to make it harder for pro sports teams to leave publicly subsidized facilities, clearing a significant obstacle from the Browns’ road to Brook Park.
The new language says the so-called Modell law, designed to prevent major sports teams from pulling up stakes, would only come into play if a team chose to leave the state.
The changes to the law are likely to end a court battle that’s just getting started and take leverage away from the City of Cleveland, which is fighting to keep the Browns on the lakefront or negotiate a better exit deal if the team leaves.
Income tax
He also approved the GOP’s 2.75% flat income tax, meaning the highest earners in the state, those making more than $100,000 a year, will no longer have to pay 3.5% in income tax, making them equal to the lower tax bracket.
State data reveals that this could result in a loss of more than $1.1 billion in the general revenue fund. This was made up by cutting social services and some tax exemptions.
Medicaid
Tierney confirmed that some aspects of the Medicaid cuts, ones that were set to cut about 800,000 Ohioans off of health care, have been signed into law. Other provisions were vetoed, he said.

Thom Tillis (R-NC) listens during a Senate Judiciary Hearing on June 18, 2025 in Washington, D.C.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)From the beginning of his tenure in the North Carolina General Assembly, it’s always been evident that Thom Tillis was not a true right-wing, authoritarian extremist.
Arch-conservative – especially on matters of taxes and economic policy? Yes. Ready to pare the social safety net to the bone and “divide and conquer” the various groups of people who find themselves relying upon it to maintain a semblance of economic security? Certainly. Happy to ram through a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage while forecasting that its demise was inevitable? Sure. Willing to swallow his pride and abandon basic personal values on a regular basis in order to assuage an above average case of political ambition? Absolutely.
But a genuine, dyed-in-the-wool, Trump and Putin-loving, immigrant-hating, LGBTQ-bashing, white/Christian nationalist MAGA-believer? No way.
Like a lot of modern conservative Republicans, Tillis has certainly blown with the winds that overtook his party the last couple of decades. And he’s probably embraced a number of positions and policies that he would have found surprising back in his early 40’s, when he commenced his political career by running for a local park board position in order to champion a public bike path.
But as he made clear on multiple occasions while serving in the North Carolina House and during his 10-plus years in Washington, Tillis’s political values and instincts were and are much more in line with the rapidly withering Bush/McCain/Romney branch of Republicanism than the Trump-as-flawless-Dear-Leader cult. While he regularly caved in to the demands of the bully-in-chief and his hench-people (on immigration, on foreign policy, on advancing unqualified buffoons to court seats and cabinet positions), you knew they were always moves of calculated – some would say cowardly — political expedience. The Trump people knew this too and clearly never trusted him.
This past weekend, Tillis finally reached his limit. Faced with voting for one of the most monstrously destructive legislative proposals in American history — a bill that will wreak havoc on his state and further empower a man who openly aspires to become a national dictator – Tillis made clear there was a limit to how far down the Trump cult rabbit hole he was ultimately willing be dragged. By voting against the president’s disastrous mega-bill and then quickly announcing his decision not to seek reelection next year, Tillis appears to have taken a big step in officially severing ties with the sect and recapturing a small sense of who he is and what he believes as he contemplates his final 18 months in office.
Of course, as mental health experts will attest, leaving a cult — like overcoming an addiction — can be a complicated, up-and-down process. This is especially true for disillusioned former true believers.
Fortunately, in this case, Tillis’s departure seems more akin to that of someone who knew all along that they needed to get away from a controlling and abusive leader, but just hated the thought of being ostracized by the community they so long inhabited and the ideals that many members of the group still nominally professed – not to mention giving up a position of political power.
But as other Republicans like former Congresswoman Liz Cheney have discovered, there can be life beyond the cult. What’s more, and this is important, unlike Cheney whose time in Congress almost immediately ended after she bravely dared to cross Trump, Tillis is now a free man with a full year-and-a-half left in office to do and say what he believes, and maybe just maybe, to convince other disaffected Republican lawmakers who know the emperor is naked to, at least occasionally, join him.
Indeed, with partisan margins so razor thin on Capitol Hill, Tillis now has the opportunity to be the most important and impactful politician for good from North Carolina since Sam Ervin helped spearhead the demise of Richard Nixon a half-century ago.
For instance, as University of Richmond law professor and judiciary watcher Carl Tobias told NC Newsline Sunday, now that he’s free from reelection concerns, Tillis is well-positioned to stymie some of Trump’s looniest court nominees from advancing in the Senate Judiciary Committee – a body in which the GOP holds only a 12-10 advantage.
If only Tillis had had his epiphany before caving on the execrable nomination of Pete Hegseth as defense secretary.
Could all of this be wishful thinking? Maybe.
Blood runs thick and Tillis has already taken to social media to say that he wants a Republican to win his seat next year. But given the state of the North Carolina GOP, that will ultimately mean supporting a craven Trump toady who will be commanded to specifically condemn Tillis, so who knows how enthusiastically he’ll stick to that stance?
Whatever the state of Senator Tillis’s psyche at what is no doubt a difficult personal moment, he’s clearly come to a fork in the road on the overriding issue of our times: Trumpism. In one direction lies the rocky path of strength, honor, morality and making an important difference for the nation’s future that would be long remembered. Down the other lies the path of acquiescence, personal ease and comfort, and utter political and historical irrelevance.

At right is a copy by Mary Katherine Goddard printing, 1777. (Rhode Island State Archives)Honor the history behind Independence Day with a visit to the Rhode Island State Archives for a once-a-year showing of the state’s trio of copies of the Declaration of Independence.
The special holiday display will be open for visitors from 9 a.m. to noon on Friday, July 4, at the State Archives on Broad Street in Providence, Secretary of State Gregg Amore announced in a statement on Monday. 
“The State Archives are the keepers of three beautifully-preserved pieces of American history – Rhode Island’s copies of the Declaration of Independence,” Amore said in a statement. “I hope Rhode Islanders and visitors alike will take advantage of this opportunity to see our history up close.”
The event marks the only day of the year that all three documents will be publicly displayed in the state archives. During the rest of the year, the public can view the copies by making an appointment with archives staff, who can retrieve the documents from their storage space.
This year’s display also features a new, banner exhibit explaining the background of each of the copies of the country’s founding document. 
The oldest of the trio, the Southwick Printing, is one of roughly 200 copies printed in Philadelphia on July 4, 1776, immediately following the approval by Congress that same day. Then-Gov. Nicholas Cooke received Rhode Island’s copy two days later, according to the Department of State. A local printer for the Newport Mercury, Solomon Southwick, was also paid to reproduce the document to give to the state’s town clerks.
Six months later, in January 1777, a second printing of the Declaration was authorized through Connecticut printer Mary Goddard. Unlike the prior iteration, the second round publicly identified the names of each document signatory. A third, stone engraving of the same document was ordered in 1823, with 200 printings shared with surviving signers, government officials and departments, and higher education institutions.
Also part of the state’s July 4 exhibit: a newly authorized portrait reproduction of the First Rhode Island Regiment, a group of 130 Black soldiers who joined the Continental Army in 1778, and were immediately freed upon enlistment. The formation of the regiment marked the first and only time a state government offered freedom in exchange for service during the Revolutionary War, according to the Secretary of State’s office.  
The original “Brave Men as Ever Fought” portrait by Don Troiani was displayed at the Rhode Island State House from March to June, but is now en route back to its home at the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia. The state’s authorized copy will be traveling to various locations throughout the state in 2026, including the State House, Faith Chybowski, a spokesperson for the Secretary of State’s office, said in an email.
The State Archives houses more than 10 million letters, photographs and other important state documents in its home at 33 Broad St. in Providence. More information is available online at https://www.sos.ri.gov/divisions/state-archives.

Kelly Ayotte legalizes high stakes tournaments and slot machines such as these shown at a casino in Tampa, Florida. (Photo by Octavio Jones/Getty Images)The two budget bills signed by Gov. Kelly Ayotte Friday are sprawling — House Bill 2, the policy bills, has 162 pages of new laws. And many of the budget’s changes have already graced headlines, inspired protests, and set off debates in State House committees. 
Observers may know about the budget’s “bell-to-bell” cell phone ban for K-12 students, the end to New Hampshire’s yearly auto inspections mandate in January 2026, or the premiums added to Medicaid recipients that would charge $90 per month for a household of three. 
Other provisions,  however, may have fallen through the cracks. Here are eight changes in the budget that you might not have heard about.
Medicaid changes
In addition to the new premiums, the budget includes other changes to New Hampshire’s Medicaid program that will affect who can participate.
To start, it includes a renewed push for a work requirement. House Bill 2 requires that the Department of Health and Human Services apply for a waiver to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in order to impose a work requirement. 
That waiver application must first be approved by the state’s Joint Legislative Fiscal Committee — a powerful panel of senators and representatives — before DHHS can send it to the federal agency. Then, if the Trump administration approves, New Hampshire’s work requirement will take effect.
The budget also fully restores the income verification process for Medicaid that had been in effect before COVID-19. Those verifications, which required participants to provide annual income verification, were suspended from 2020 to 2023.
And it directs DHHS to apply for a federal waiver to increase the prescription drug copay for Medicaid recipients to $4. 
Aside from the cost and eligibility changes, the budget also directs Medicaid to pay for new services.
It allows the state to include name-brand drugs on its preferred drug list for Medicaid participants, allowing the program to pay for name-brand medication in the rare cases that it is cheaper than generic equivalents.
It instructs state officials to use Medicaid funds to “accelerate the implementation” of the state’s at-home dialysis program.
And it tells the state to implement an incentive program to encourage beneficiaries to receive outpatient procedures, such as ambulatory care, in a “lower cost” setting.
The “Momnibus 2.0” bill
The budget delivered one victory for health care advocates by including a bill known as “Momnibus 2.0.” The bill seeks to improve maternal health by targeting maternal depression and common health problems that follow giving birth. 
The goal: to reduce the prevalence of deaths of new mothers caused by postpartum substance use disorder and mental health crises.
Momnibus 2.0 requires health insurers in New Hampshire, including Medicaid, to cover maternal mental health screenings during well-child visits after pregnancy. Those screenings would occur at the child’s 1-month, 2-month, 4-month and 6-month check-ups.
The bill requires insurance and Medicaid to cover home visiting services for pregnant and postpartum women. It also mandates that employers provide those people at least 25 hours of leave from work in the first year of the child’s life to attend such appointments. And it sets up and funds a state psychiatric hotline for pregnant and postpartum women, beginning in July 2027. 
Betting and gambling changes
Throughout the budget, there are some provisions that expand gambling and betting in the state. But there are also portions that seek to help mitigate its effects.
For instance, the budget legalizes both video lottery terminals and high-stakes tournaments, a move that has provided a key revenue source for the rest of the budget. 
Video lottery terminals are machines that allow players to wager cash, credits, vouchers or tokens for games of chance, such as digital slot machines. And high-stakes tournaments are games of chance in which the required buy-in is $2,500 or more. The latter may be used by licensed operators under the state’s charitable gaming law. 
The expansion has prompted lawmakers to grow the scope of the agency overseeing these games: Under the budget, the New Hampshire Lottery Commission will be renamed to New Hampshire Lottery and Gaming Commission, and will oversee the new games.
At the same time, the budget includes some provisions designed to address gambling addiction. It directs the Lottery and Gaming Commission to contract with an organization to create a “voluntary statewide self-exclusion database.” That would allow people to choose to bar themselves from all forms of legal gambling in the state; the budget directs the commission to design specific rules for how it would work.
A fix for special education funding
After New Hampshire’s state special education fund ran out of money in 2024, prompting Department of Education Commissioner Frank Edelblut to warn schools about potential cost increases, lawmakers have been attempting to prevent future shortfalls.
One example can be seen in House Bill 2. The budget bill holds that if the special education fund falls short of fully funding the amount that school districts are owed, the fund will be required to fund at least 80% of what school districts were owed. The budget also empowers the governor to request additional money from the general fund to fill that special education fund and meet that 80% requirement. 
But not all special education funding fixes were added. During the budget writing process, the Senate took out an increase in per-pupil state funding for public school students receiving special education that had been passed by the House, drawing criticism from some advocates.

A state film agency?
New Hampshire has been the backdrop to a handful of successful movies, including the 1995 Robin Williams movie “Jumanji” to the 1981 Katherine Hepburn film “On Golden Pond.” Some lawmakers are interested in bringing the state further onto the silver screen. 
Currently, the New Hampshire’s Department of Business and Economic Affairs runs a web page with resources for studios looking to film in the state. That website includes information on how to obtain a permit to film on local roads and highways, how to shoot in the White Mountain National Forest, and how to connect to location scouts for specific needs.
But the budget would contemplate whether to create an entire office dedicated to film and creative media — as well as whether to pass a tax credit to incentivize more films to be set here. House Bill 2 requires that a panel of one senator and two representatives meet between now and Nov. 1 to produce recommendations.
A number of states have passed similar tax credits or enticements, such as Georgia, New Mexico, Illinois, New York, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New Jersey and California. 
Court-appointed attorneys for involuntary admissions hearings
House Bill 2 increases the state’s obligation to provide legal counsel to people who are fighting their involuntary commitments to hospitals and psychiatric facilities. 
Previously, state law held that a person being involuntary committed is entitled to an attorney to represent them in a hearing to overturn that commitment, and may be provided a public defender if they are unable to pay for one.
The budget updates that language to require the state to provide an attorney for anyone who is in that position and does not have a lawyer, regardless of whether they can pay for it. And it states that the funds for those attorneys — as well as any investigators or experts needed to help with that person’s case — should be paid for out of the state’s indigent defense fund. 
Year-round emergency services for substance abuse
Included in the budget is $10 million over the next two years that will allow DHHS to provide year-round emergency shelter to people suffering from opioid use disorder. That money will come from the Opioid Abatement Trust Fund, which contains money the state won in settlements against opioid producers such as Purdue Pharma. 
Mobile driver’s licenses
House Bill 2 instructs the Division of Motor Vehicles to create a mobile driver’s license in New Hampshire. Beginning Jan. 1, 2026, the agency will begin offering the “electronic credentials” to those who have attained physical driver’s licenses; it will also set a fee for them. 
Even with the new credentials, a driver will still need to have their physical license on their person while driving a vehicle, the statute clarifies. But the mobile licenses could potentially be used to verify identity or age in other environments, such as bars. 
The budget also requires the DMV to begin offering non-driver’s identification cards to residents who qualify.

(Photo by Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)University of Virginia president Jim Ryan’s abrupt resignation in the midst of federal pressure on the school to end its DEI initiatives set off a firestorm of controversy, with Virginia Democratic lawmakers now pledging that they will find ways to prevent further politicization of higher education. The lawmakers said they’re reconsidering legislation to support governing boards and reevaluating the gubernatorial appointments process.
UVA President Jim Ryan resigns amid federal ultimatum

Democratic legislators started speaking against the impetus of Ryan’s resignation soon after he announced the news Friday.
“It’s just outrageous,” said Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville. “I don’t know that this sort of thing has ever happened before, where the federal government has reached down, totally around the governing structure that a sovereign state has set up for governance of its universities, and has forced this sort of change.”

On Saturday, Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell said his colleagues are exploring all options to navigate what they framed as questionable higher education decisions made by President Donald Trump, Gov. Glenn Youngkin, and their administrations, including reviewing the governor’s multiple appointments to college governing boards.
“We’ve been getting calls to stand up from people all around the commonwealth, and we have to look at these people very carefully and decide where to confirm them,” Surovell said. “When we come back in January, reform is going to be on the table, because we cannot afford to ever let this happen again,” Surrovell added, in reference to the upcoming legislative session.
The New York Times first reported that the Department of Justice claimed that UVA had merely rebranded its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts instead of eliminating them as mandated by Trump’s executive order, which warned of federal funding cuts for noncompliance.
UVA’s governing board was the first in the commonwealth to dissolve its DEI initiatives and Virginia’s efforts to challenge DEI efforts ramped up under the Youngkin administration.. 
In January 2022, Youngkin renamed the state Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion through an executive order by replacing“equity” with “opportunity,” contrary to state code. Then in April 2023, Martin Brown, the office director appointed by Youngkin, remarked that “DEI is dead” at the Virginia Military Institute.
“Let’s take a moment right now to kill that cow. DEI is dead,” Brown said. “We’re not going to bring that cow up anymore. It’s dead. It was mandated by the General Assembly, but this governor has a different philosophy of civil discourse, civility … living the golden rule, right?”
In January 2022, the governor also eliminated DEI-driven education programs at the Virginia Department of Education through an executive order by striking down “divisive concepts” in school curriculum.
Ryan’s resignation marked an unprecedented development for university leaders, a coalition of whom condemned the “Trump administration’s political pressure campaign” leading to Ryan’s exit.
“We view this campaign as an egregious attack on the independence and integrity of public higher education in Virginia,” Timothy Gibson, president of the Virginia Conference of the American Association of University Professors, said in a statement Monday.
Also on Monday, Ross Mugler, acting president & CEO of the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges and a governing board member at Old Dominion University, said in a statement that the incident at UVA is not an isolated one; but a growing threat for all institutions.
“Governing boards and institutional leaders across the country must treat this moment as a wake-up call,” Mugler wrote. “Now is the time to reaffirm your board’s unwavering commitment to institutional autonomy, academic freedom and governance integrity. Boards must stand united with their presidents in the face of politicization, external interference, and efforts to erode public trust.”
In a letter to the UVA community on Friday, Ryan wrote that his resignation was “an excruciatingly difficult decision, and I am heartbroken to be leaving this way.” 
 Response from Republicans

Republican leaders have largely stayed quiet following Ryan’s resignation, except for John Reid, the GOP nominee for lieutenant governor.
“Good. That’s what happens when you stick your middle finger up at the elected governor and the voters of Virginia and then play a game of chicken with the president of the United States on an issue that’s overtly reverse racist like DEI,” Reid wrote on social media Saturday.
He also claimed that Ryan has “presided over the decline of the honor system” at the institution.
“The great University of Virginia deserves leadership that will help it to regain its reputation as a place of high personal standards and robust intellectual curiosity and debate instead of a standard issue incubator of biased and emotional anti-American thought,” he wrote, warning other university leaders to take note that “DEI is dead” and they “better start being honest and fair with students and taxpayers if you want to keep your job.”

Ryan had faced recent criticism about his leadership and calls for him to step down from some segments of the UVA community.
On May 15, the Jefferson Council, a UVA alumni organization, urged UVA’s Board of Visitors to find new leadership at the institution, taking out a full-page advertisement in the Richmond Times-Dispatch. 
“The damage to UVA’s values and traditions is not theoretical—it is palpable and measurable, and is the result of leadership that has failed the entire University community,” said Joel Gardner, president of The Jefferson Council, in a May 15 statement.
The advertisement alleged there were multiple leadership failures under Ryan’s tenure, which “undermined the University’s integrity and founding ideals.”
The council said a deadly shooting in 2022 that took the lives of three students and wounded two others was mishandled under Ryan’s watch, and that his administration enabled the “worst outbreak of antisemitism” in UVA’s history. 
However, Wahoos4UVA, a group dedicated to defending the university from political influence, refuted the Jefferson Council’s claims in a public letter, saying the alumni group compromises the institution’s leadership and reputation through partisan attacks.
“They say they want to restore Jefferson’s vision, but their approach undermines the very ideals of free inquiry, reasoned debate, and honor that Jefferson championed. Their tactics — lies, personal attacks, and public disrespect — stand in direct opposition to the honor code and the values that define UVA,” the group wrote. “We want to set the record straight: UVA is thriving — and the overwhelming majority of alumni are proud of the progress being made under President Ryan’s leadership.”
 Looking ahead

Senate Democrats have fought against Youngkin’s influence over governing boards at Virginia’s institutions by rejecting some of his appointments from confirmation. However, the governor’s administration contends that until the General Assembly confirms the appointments in January, they can still serve.
Democrats are now challenging that in court, in a case they hope will determine if leaders at three of Virginia’s universities broke the rules by allowing rejected appointees to remain in their governing boards.
The lawsuit targets the leadership of the Virginia Military Institute, the University of Virginia and George Mason University.
Surovell said the Senate may also reconsider a proposal from last year’s session that Youngkin vetoed, which would have redefined the authority of governing boards within public universities regarding their legal affairs. The proposal would have given the boards the authority to manage independent legal counsel. It also clarified that the state attorney general’s involvement in legal matters would be limited to instances where their services are specifically requested.
Deeds said another idea would be to amend the state code, which specifies that gubernatorial appointments cannot take effect until they are confirmed by the General Assembly, typically in January. Currently, once the governor agrees, a gubernatorial appointment can be allowed to serve immediately on boards including on governing boards at Virginia’s higher education institutions.

Recently, the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee was permitted to take up the appointments because lawmakers have not recessed from the 2024 Special Session.
Del. Katrina Callsen, D-Albemarle, said one of the areas lawmakers need to work on is ensuring the confirmation process for gubernatorial appointments is transparent and people understand how it works. She said even some of the new and seasoned legislators are uncertain of the process. 
“I think there absolutely can be ways to clarify so that we don’t have to take legal action in the future if someone does not step out of the role,” Callsen said.
Del. Amy Laufer, D-Albemarle, said she plans to introduce a legislative proposal that would require all public colleges and universities to elect nonvoting faculty and staff representatives to their boards. Most institutions allow nonvoting faculty representatives; the proposed bill would make it a requirement.
Lawmakers and supporters have advocated for similar efforts to give faculty and staff a voice in decision-making, aiming to improve policies on retention, recruitment, and overall workplace confidence.
The proposal has died in back-to-back sessions. Youngkin vetoed the bill in 2024, citing cost concerns and a lack of oversight. Deeds’ similarly unsuccessful proposal in 2023 focused solely on the University of Virginia’s governing board.
“I think it’s a great way to get more opinions and actual people that are interacting on the campus, to have their voices at the Board of Visitors,” Laufer said. “I think it’s crucial.”
Democratic lawmakers also haven’t ruled out the possibility of taking legal action against the federal government, as public concerns mount in the wake of Ryan’s resignation.
Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, called for a stand against the Trump administration’s attempts to interfere in Virginia’s higher education landscape, which she said are exemplified by threats to take federal funds from universities and leaders who don’t align with the administration’s educational ideology.
“They do not want an informed citizenry. They want folks to learn what they want them to learn, and in doing so, they are again undermining civil rights, civil liberties and higher education, because the fear is — as it was in antebellum days (by) not teaching slaves how to read and write — that if you have an informed citizenry, then one will begin to question and raise questions.”

It was an outcome of congressional legislation that passed with bipartisan support, based on the recognition that medicine alone isn’t adequate for people living with a serious medical condition if their other needs aren’t met. The program is implemented in the commonwealth with its grant funding distributed to various organizations by the Virginia Department of Health.
If someone can’t afford food or housing, or doesn’t have transportation, he or she will have difficulty accessing necessary medical care. If someone with HIV has another medical issue that goes untreated, he or she will be more vulnerable to the virus. These are issues the Ryan White Program was designed to help patients navigate.
As of 2022, there were about 25,000 people living with HIV in Virginia. Community organizations funded through the Ryan White Program serve a significant number of these individuals. Part of the reason why the amount of people living with HIV in Virginia isn’t larger is due to the success of these organizations in testing, treatment, and support. 
Despite a long track record of success, the Ryan White funding allocated to community organizations is being severely undercut across Virginia, and it doesn’t seem to be entirely due to DOGE (or the “Department of Government Efficiency”) at the federal level. These cuts are a first test in how the Virginia state government may respond if Congress reduces access to the Affordable Care Act and eliminates Medicaid benefits for tens of thousands of low-income state residents. In a word: shamefully.
In the Hampton Roads region, Minority Aids Support Services recently lost $500,000 in funding to support individuals with HIV/AIDS. In Richmond, Nationz Foundation lost almost half of its funding, and the Capital Area Health Network lost all of its Ryan White program money to provide comprehensive care to individuals with HIV/AIDS, and was subsequently forced to close its wellness program.
Fredericksburg Area Health and Support Services (FAHASS) — which serves a region stretching from from the Blue Ridge to the Northern Neck — experienced an $850,000 funding cut. This translated to the loss of six professionals and broad cuts to important services that were previously provided to individuals with HIV. The discontinued programs include: rental and housing assistance, mental health services for the uninsured, financial support for non-HIV prescription medicine, dental health services and medical transportation.
Taken together as part of a holistic program, these were life-saving services that will be much less accessible for many low-income individuals with HIV. Stacy Wells, CEO of the LGBT Life Center in Norfolk put it this way: “The reality is after the 25 years we’ve been building these programs, they’ve now been dismantled in just months.” 
It’s uncertain why these cuts were made. Ryan White funding is allocated by the federal government to states, which then distributes the money to local care providers. While the federal government under the administration of President Donald Trump has sought to reduce funding for health and human services in other areas, news stories across Virginia indicate that these recent cuts  were the outcome, at least at some level, of decisions made within state government.
I emailed a Virginia Department of Health spokesperson three weeks ago with a request for more information about the genesis and rationale for the funding cuts, and to learn more about the scope of Ryan White funding reductions across the commonwealth. Despite following up several times and receiving assurances that the information would be coming, I have not yet received it.
‘Care is resistance.’ Va. free health clinics strategize survival after state, federal funding cuts

For now, it is an open question about why the service providers that care for some of Virginia’s most vulnerable residents are being targeted for budget cuts, especially in a year when the state’s total revenue is more than $200 million dollars over earlier projections.
Maybe low-income people are an easy target? Members of Congress certainly seem to think so as they contemplate measures to reduce access to the Affordable Care Act and add new requirements and restrictions that will cut medical assistance to millions of Americans on Medicaid. 
How will our state respond if these cuts are enacted? Will state leaders fight to preserve healthcare access? Will they act with compassion to help those losing the treatments and services that they depend on? The current cuts to HIV/AIDS programs across the commonwealth, happening in a year with a budget surplus, do not bode well. 
These cuts have real-life impacts. People will lose access to medical care. Lives will become more difficult, and some lives will be lost prematurely. We are at risk of becoming a more harsh and uncaring society.
It doesn’t need to be this way. Virginia can stand up for its residents and ensure that everyone has access to the lifesaving medical care and support that they deserve. A good place to start would be by restoring funding to the community organizations across the commonwealth that serve individuals with HIV/AIDS.

Seventeen statewide anti-domestic and sexual violence coalitions, including one from Pennsylvania, have asked a Rhode Island federal judge to halt the Trump administration’s new restrictions for grants administered by an office within the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) under the Violence Against Women Act.
The request comes as part of a lawsuit led by the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence challenging the legality of the DOJ’s efforts to withhold funding awarded through its Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) in order to advance the administration’s priorities on gender ideology, DEI and immigration. The Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence is part of the suit.
The lawsuit was filed on June 16 by lawyers representing the ACLU of Rhode Island and the Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, as well as Democracy Forward, Jacobson Lawyers Group, and the National Women’s Law Center. The case was assigned to Senior District Judge William E. Smith in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island.
The Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence is made up of 10 agencies and has received grants from OVW for over two decades. Brianna Henries, spokesperson for the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence deferred comment to Democracy Forward.

“By forcing providers to choose between certifying compliance with unlawful conditions or giving up federal funding needed to help keep their communities safe, the Trump administration is holding funding hostage in an effort to force service providers to bend to the administration’s anti-DEI, anti-immigrant, and anti-trans goals,” Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, said in a statement. “This is unlawful and threatens important programs preventing domestic violence and sexual assault and supporting survivors.”
The lawsuit comes as the Trump administration has proposed a 29% cut to the OVW program’s funding in its fiscal year 2026 budget request.
Under new DOJ guidelines, organizations cannot use federal funds for research projects, promoting or facilitating violations of federal immigration law, programs that discourage cooperation with law enforcement, or initiatives that promote gender ideology.
Organizations are also prohibited from engaging in “activities that frame domestic violence or sexual assault as systemic social justice issues rather than criminal offenses.”
According to the lawsuit, the DOJ has started demanding that grant recipients certify they are complying with the conditions and could be subject to substantial penalties under the federal False Claims Act if they do not comply. Penalties include the potential withholding of funds, contract termination with the federal government and criminal prosecution.

Attorneys for the ACLU and the coalition claim such demands by the administration violate the Administrative Procedure Act, which prohibits “arbitrary and capricious” federal agency actions. They also argue the alleged quid-pro-quo for funding violates the First Amendment by “seeking to silence disfavored speech.”
“The new funding conditions are unconstitutional several times over,” the 49-page memo for the preliminary injunction states.
The grants were created under the Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 and the Violence Against Women Act to help organizations that support victims through legal services, housing assistance and crisis counseling.
According to the lawsuit, added funding conditions force organizations into an “impossible” choice: give up crucial support or comply with rules that contradict their values and legal responsibilities.
$1 million in grants awarded to Rhode Island annually
The Rhode Island Coalition has an annual budget of roughly $5.3 million, of which approximately $3.4 million is passed through to member agencies. Roughly $1 million of that comes from Office on Violence Against Women grants, the coalition’s executive director, Lucy Rios, stated in an affidavit.
Federal grants and contracts accounted for 79% of the coalition’s revenue, according to its annual report.
The coalition has received grant funding in various program categories every year since at least 2001. It has sought training and technical assistance grants and other competitive discretionary grants, including $114,533 awarded for the period Oct. 1, 2024, through Sept. 30, 2025. The lawsuit was filed ahead of a June 25 deadline to apply for a fiscal 2025 training and technical assistance grant that was anticipated in the amount of $113,574.
Rhode Island received $550,000 from the OVW in 2022 to create a safe visitation and exchange program for domestic violence survivors and their children — along with LGBTQ-related advocacy. The coalition also received a $350,000 grant to educate young men — particularly youth of color and immigrant communities — on the crimes of domestic and dating violence.
The coalition sought to continue the programs with additional grant funding, along with $900,000 to be used toward identifying potential high-risk cases for supervision and monitoring, according to the affidavit.
“Without access to this funding, vital programs that keep Rhode Islanders safe and keep our state at the forefront of addressing domestic violence are at risk, including RI’s first Safe Exchange and Supervised Visitation Center for families experiencing domestic violence,” Rios said in a June 16 statement. “We strive to be as courageous and resilient as the survivors in our communities as we stand up to protect the safety net for victims and infrastructure for prevention that we have been collectively building for nearly 50 years.”
A spokesperson for the DOJ’s Office on Violence Against Women did not immediately respond to request for comment.
The group of state domestic violence and sexual assault coalitions includes the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence; California Partnership to End Domestic Violence; Colorado Coalition Against Sexual Assault; DC Coalition Against Domestic Violence; End Domestic Abuse Wisconsin: The Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence; Idaho Coalition Against Sexual and Domestic Violence; Iowa Coalition Against Domestic Violence; Jane Doe Inc.

Construction employs more immigrant laborers, many likely living here illegally, than any other industry, and the industry is starting to draw more attention — even in conservative states — as the Trump administration pushes for more deportations. (Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)As President Donald Trump sends mixed messages about immigration enforcement, ordering new raids on farms and hotels just days after saying he wouldn’t target those industries, he has hardly mentioned the industry that employs the most immigrant laborers: construction.
Nevertheless, the Trump administration is going after construction workers without legal status to meet its mass deportation goals — even as the country has a housing shortage and needs new homes built. A shortage of workers has delayed or prevented construction, causing billions of dollars in economic damage, according to a June report from the Home Builders Institute.
Almost a quarter of all immigrants without a college degree work in construction, a total of 2.2 million workers as of last month, before work site raids began in earnest. That’s more than the next three industries combined: restaurants (1.1 million), janitorial and other cleaning services (526,000) and landscaping (454,000), according to a Stateline analysis of federal Current Population Survey data provided by ipums.org at the University of Minnesota.
Within the construction industry, immigrant workers are now a majority of painters and roofers (both 53%) and comprise more than two-thirds of plasterers and stucco masons. U.S. citizens in construction are more likely to work as managers and as skilled workers, such as carpenters.
Many immigrant workers are likely living here illegally, although there are some working legally as refugees or parolees, and others are asylum-seekers waiting for court dates. There’s also a small number of legal visas for temporary farmworkers, construction workers and others.
The pool of immigrant workers Stateline analyzed were employed noncitizens ages 18-65 without a college degree, screening out temporary workers with high-skill visas.
About half of the immigrant laborers in construction are working in Southern states, including conservative-leaning Florida, North Carolina and Texas, where there is more building going on, according to the Stateline analysis. Another 584,000, or one-quarter, are in Western states, including Arizona, California and Nevada.
In recent months, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE, has conducted construction worksite raids in Florida in Tallahassee and near Ocala, and in South Texas and New Orleans, as well as more immigrant-friendly California and Pennsylvania.










Roofers are right out there where you can see them.


– – Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance


Roofers may have been the first targeted by new workplace raids because of their visibility, said Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance, a California-based advocacy group with chapters in five other states.
“That’s the first place we heard about it. Roofers are right out there where you can see them,” Barajas said. He added that all segments of construction work have been targeted for ICE raids, and that even some legal workers are not showing up for work out of fear.
“Six or eight weeks ago, I would have said we weren’t affected at all. Now we are. There’s a substantial reduction in the number of workers who are showing up, so crews are 30%, 40% smaller than they used to be,” Barajas said.
In residential construction, a system of contractors and subcontractors opens the door to abuses, said Enrique Lopezlira, director of the Low-Wage Work Program at the University of California, Berkeley Labor Center. Lopezlira said contractors hire workers, often immigrant laborers, for low-wage jobs and pay them in cash, to save money on benefits and make the lowest possible bid for projects.
“It becomes a blame game. The developers can say, ‘I hired this contractor and I thought he was above board and paying people a decent wage.’ And the contractors can say, ‘I rely on subcontractors,’” said Lopezlira. “It becomes a race to the bottom.”
In many places, residential construction draws more immigrant labor because of looser state and local regulations and lower pay. But in some states with weaker unions and rules that are less strict, such as Texas, the commercial construction industry also employs many immigrants who are here illegally.
Commercial construction labor costs are 40% lower in Texas than they are in large Northeastern cities where unions are more powerful, said David Kelly, a lecturer in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan.
“The large difference [in cost] suggests workers and their employers in some regions are not paying for income taxes, overtime, Social Security or unemployment insurance,” Kelly said in an email. “Since undocumented workers have limited employment options they may be more willing than others to accept these conditions.”
Despite political claims that Democratic policies result in immigrants taking jobs others need, noncitizen immigrant laborers were about 7% of jobholders nationally as of May — about the same as 2015, according to the Stateline analysis.
That share has hardly budged over the past 10 years, including in 2019 under the first Trump administration, dipping to 6% only in 2020 and 2021.
In construction, however, the share of jobs held by immigrant laborers has increased from 19% in 2015 to 22% in 2024, according to the analysis. Immigrant laborers have gotten more than a third of the 1.5 million jobs added between 2015 and 2024, as home construction reached historic levels.

“The new funding conditions are unconstitutional several times over,” the 49-page memo for the preliminary injunction states.
The grants were created under the Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 and the Violence Against Women Act to help organizations that support victims through legal services, housing assistance and crisis counseling.
According to the lawsuit, added funding conditions force organizations into an “impossible” choice: give up crucial support or comply with rules that contradict their values and legal responsibilities.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)ABILENE, Texas — Bolstered by $3.2 million from a former Midland oilman, this West Texas city of 130,000 people is helping the Lone Star State lead a national nuclear energy resurgence.
Doug Robison’s 2021 donation to Abilene Christian University helped the institution win federal approval to house an advanced small modular nuclear reactor, which might be finished as soon as next year. Small modular reactors are designed to be built in factories and then moved to a site, and require less upfront capital investment than traditional large reactors.
Only two small modular reactors are in operation, one in China and another in Russia. Natura Resources is one of two companies with federal permits to build one in the U.S. After that initial $3.2 million donation, Robison formed Natura Resources and committed to investing another $30.5 million in the project.
“Nuclear is happening,” said Robison, who retired from the oil business and moved to Abilene to launch the company. “It has to happen.”
Robison’s words are being echoed across the country with new state laws that aim to accelerate the spread of projects that embrace advanced nuclear technology — decades after the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl calamities soured many Americans on nuclear power.
In the past two years, half the states have taken action to promote nuclear power, from creating nuclear task forces to integrating nuclear into long-term energy plans, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, which advocates for the industry.
‘The West will lead’: Utah, Idaho, Wyoming team up on nuclear energy development

“I’ve been tracking legislation for 18 years, and when I first started tracking, there were maybe five or 10 bills that said the word ‘nuclear,’” said Christine Csizmadia, who directs state government affairs at the institute. “This legislative session, we’re tracking over 300 bills all across the country.”
The push is bipartisan. In New York, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul last month directed the New York Power Authority to build a zero-emission advanced nuclear power plant somewhere upstate — her state’s first new nuclear plant in a generation. In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis in April signed legislation redefining nuclear energy, which doesn’t emit a significant amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases, as a “clean energy resource.” The law will allow future plants to receive state grants reserved for other carbon-free energy sources.
But no state is more gung-ho than Texas, where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott last month signed legislation creating the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office and investing $350 million in nuclear expansion.
“Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this legislation will position Texas at the forefront of America’s nuclear renaissance,” Abbott wrote in a statement.
In addition to legislative action, the Texas A&M University System has invited four nuclear manufacturers to build small modular reactors at the school’s 2,400-acre RELLIS campus in the city of Bryan.
In Texas and other fast-growing states, rising electricity demands are fueling the push. Tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon that require a tremendous amount of electricity to power vast data centers are teaming with nuclear developers to provide it.
Last October, Google signed an agreement with nuclear energy producer Kairos Power to deploy multiple small modular reactors capable of generating a total of up to 500 megawatts by 2035. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced in December that it is also looking to reach a similar deal. Some of the largest data centers require more than 100 megawatts of power capacity, enough to power around 100,000 U.S. households.
Constellation Energy announced last September that it would reopen Three Mile Island, shuttered since 2019, as part of a deal with Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI data centers. One of the two reactors at the plant, which is located south of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, partially melted down in 1979. But the remaining reactor reliably produced electricity for the next four decades.
“Folks shouldn’t sleep on nuclear,” Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said as welcomed back workers to the plant last month. “They should be aware of the important clean role it plays in our energy portfolio.”
But opponents say the renewed interest in nuclear energy is misguided.
Federal money could supercharge state efforts to preserve nuclear power

In Colorado, a coalition of two dozen environmental groups, including the state chapter of the Sierra Club, urged Polis to veto the bill.
“The idea that nuclear power is a clean energy source could not be further from the truth,” the groups wrote in a letter to the governor. “Nuclear power is the only energy resource that generates dangerous waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years.”
Some critics say small modular reactors are actually more expensive than traditional reactors, when they are judged per kilowatt of the energy they produce. And one 2022 study, conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the University of British Columbia, concluded that small modular reactors will produce more radioactive waste than traditional reactors.
“There’s a pretty healthy skepticism about advanced nuclear projects,” said Adrian Shelley, who heads the Texas office of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. Shelley said many environmental groups “are just deeply concerned about Texas’ ability to responsibly manage nuclear storage and especially nuclear waste in the long term.”
Ramping up
The United States currently has 94 nuclear reactors at 54 plants in 28 states. The oldest began operating at Nine Mile Point in New York in 1969; the newest reactors, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Burke County, Georgia, began operating in 2023 and 2024.
Scott Burnell, a spokesperson for the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said that between the mid-1990s and 2005, there were “no applications at all” for new reactors. In 2007, there was a surge of a dozen applications when the federal government began offering tax incentives. But interest in new reactors plunged again when the fracking boom boosted fossil fuels as an economical power source.
Over the past several years, activity has ramped up again. “There are a number of factors that we are seeing drive this increased interest,” Burnell said. “Probably the biggest one is the growth in data centers.”
The commission has approved three new nuclear projects in the past three years, including the one at Abilene Christian University. It is reviewing three other applications and is discussing potential projects with a dozen other nuclear developers, Burnell said.
Texas currently has two nuclear plants — Comanche Peak near Glen Rose in North Central Texas and the South Texas Project in Matagorda County on the Gulf Coast. The two plants, each of which has two reactors, provide about 10% of the state’s electric power, according to the Texas comptroller. The new small modular reactors would face the same safety standards as these plants.











We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars.


– Matt Loszak, CEO of Aalo Atomics



The project at Abilene Christian began when Robison’s Natura Resources established a research alliance with that school, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at Austin. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the project in 2024.
The reactor will be constructed at a laboratory at a different site, but its home already awaits in a trench at the bottom of a cavernous room at Abilene Christian’s Dillard Science and Engineering Research Center. The trench is 25 feet deep, 80 feet long and 15 feet wide, with a radiation shield made of concrete 4 feet thick. When the 40-ton reactor is finished, possibly by the end of next year, it will be transported to its home on a flatbed truck.
“The future is uncertain, but we’re ahead of the pack and moving at an amazing clip,” said Rusty Towell, an Abilene Christian engineering and physics professor who is working on the project. “So I think that there’s a great reason for optimism.”
Towell asserted that the project will produce only “small amounts of low-level waste” and that storing it safely will not be a significant challenge.
‘What Henry Ford did for cars’
John Sharp, the chancellor of Texas A&M University, said he invited nuclear companies to build small modular reactors at the school to help meet the country’s desperate need for more power. He said it made sense to give developers access to the faculty and students at the university’s nuclear engineering department.
Sharp said his pitch was simple: “Hey, we got some land. We got it next to some really smart people. Would you like to come and build a plant?
“And four folks said, ‘You betcha.’”
Matt Loszak, the 34-year-old CEO of Austin-based Aalo Atomics, one of the companies that answered Sharp’s call, said he had two employees 18 months ago. Now he has more than 50.
“We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars,” Loszak said, “which is really make them mass manufacturable and make it economical to deploy around the world.”
Robison said he’s been speaking at town halls in Abilene, a conservative community that is home to Dyess Air Force Base, for about five years. He claims the residents are “overwhelmingly excited” about having the small modular reactors at Abilene Christian, he said.
“Texas is an energy state,” he said. “We understand energy and what happens when you don’t have it.”

Ned Lamont last week vetoed House Bill 5002, which was the most significant piece of housing legislation to cross his desk since he became governor in 2019. 
Lawmakers will now spend the coming weeks reworking the housing omnibus bill, with negotiations likely focused on changes to policies that mandate towns to plan for more housing, changes to parking requirements and potentially reviving a measure dropped during the session that would tie school construction money to affordable housing.
Lamont vetoed the bill, which his staff negotiated, amid objections from some groups largely centering around provisions on parking reform and a requirement for towns to plan and zone for a set number of units. Opponents feared the bill would dilute local control and put unrealistic expectations on towns for building more housing.
Now, lawmakers are pushing forward with more negotiations on the bill ahead of a special session that will likely be held either next month or in the fall. Democratic leadership said they’re focused on preserving as much of the bill as possible, and Senate Democrats have additional measures they want to add into the omnibus bill.
“I think we can make it better. I think the only way to really make it work is if you have buy-in from the local communities,” Lamont said last week.
[RELATED: What to know about H.B. 5002, the omnibus housing bill]
Democrats responded with disappointment and frustration about the decision, but said they were pushing forward with crafting the best possible bill.
“All the politics of the last couple of weeks I’m less concerned with and remain focused on the actual outcome, which is housing for people and families,” said House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford.
“Housing remains a huge issue for so many people, and to do nothing lets many, many people down in our state,” said Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk.
Housing Committee co-chair Rep. Antonio Felipe, D-Bridgeport, said he fears by vetoing the bill instead of signing it and asking for specific adjustments, Lamont may have opened the floodgates to more widespread changes to the bill.
“It seems like this veto is really geared towards one particular area in our state, and it was short-sighted,” Felipe said, referring to much of the opposition, which centered in Fairfield County. “It was a mistake, and I really hope that we have the wherewithal to stick together and put together another good bill, because the more time comes off the clock, the harder it is for us to start addressing the housing crisis.”
Housing Committee ranking member Rep. Tony Scott, R-Monroe, said House Republicans haven’t been involved in negotiations on the new version of the housing bill, which he views as part of the problem. He has ideas, he said, but hasn’t had a meeting with Lamont to talk about them.
Lamont wasn’t clear last Monday, when he vetoed H.B. 5002, about what specific changes he wanted to see, although he said he wanted to push for policy that got town leadership more on board. Later in the week, details still weren’t available from his office.
“The Governor continues to meet with legislative and policy staff on developing aspects of a housing bill,” Lamont’s spokesman Rob Blanchard said in a statement Thursday. “He then hopes to meet with legislative leaders and engage with local officials on a draft proposal that helps to address the housing crisis while also ensuring towns and cities are partners in the process.”
Lawmakers said they have tried for years to get local leadership on board with housing policy change, particularly through a roundtable group on affordable housing convened in 2023. They questioned how realistic it is that the governor could come up with a meaningful policy that got people on board.
“It’s been very tough up until this point, but if he has a secret sauce, then more power to him,” Duff said.
Lamont said at a press conference to announce the veto that much of the opposition he heard, some of which he classified as misinformation, was around a policy known as fair share. The policy, which has been used in New Jersey for decades, would have required that towns plan and zone for a set number of units of affordable housing.
The numbers were based on a formula that divided up the regional housing need among towns. Felipe said there might be some adjustments to that approach to add more consideration for how much land is available to build housing in a municipality.
Rojas said there may also be adjustments to create a more robust process for towns to appeal their assigned numbers, although that process was already established in the bill Lamont vetoed.
“What is particularly troubling is that the governor’s decision seems to have been made in large part based on objections that were coming from misinformation-fueled objections,” said Erin Boggs, executive director of the Open Communities Alliance, which advocated for and helped craft the fair share portion. “We really can’t be a state that grounds its public policy on misinformation.”
Lamont also indicated he wanted to make changes to a policy that would ban formulaic parking requirements for smaller residential developments. The idea sparked opposition from local leadership who said it might result in not enough parking for residents, particularly those with mobility issues.
Casey Moran, a founder of CT Parking Reform, said these formulaic requirements are widespread. In Naugatuck, for example, studio apartments require at least three parking spaces. In Trumbull, accessory dwelling units require four parking spaces.
Adding parking makes building housing more expensive and takes up more land. Parking lots also create runoff that can hurt the environment.
Rojas said there may be changes to be made to the parking portion, although he didn’t get into detail.
Duff said that negotiations on the bill “can’t just be one-sided,” and that Senate Democrats want to add in a provision of the bill that would increase school construction reimbursement rates for towns that have at least 10% designated affordable housing. 
They’d removed that provision because they’d been told the governor would veto the bill if it was present, Duff said.
Lawmakers and advocates said it’s unlikely that there will be changes to a policy known as “Work, Live, Ride,” which prioritizes certain state infrastructure funding for towns that increase residential density near public transit.
Lamont last week also mentioned opposition to a measure that would have required towns to allow commercial properties to be turned into smaller housing complexes without a special hearing before planning and zoning boards.
Rojas said there may be changes to that policy.
Despite potential changes, he said he doesn’t think there’s a policy that will get everyone on board and significantly increase housing in Connecticut.
“Sometimes leaders using the authority and the power that they have, just need to lead, and that’s the way I feel about us at the state level and certainly at the executive branch level,” Rojas said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lamont-Veto-0623-DE-014-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-01 05:01:58.103237

(Photo by Aristide Economopoulos for New Jersey Monitor/States Newsroom.)Ohio lawmakers are trying once more to pass a controversial firearms measure building a wall between local officers and federal agencies.
To supporters, the bill is an expression of the anti-commandeering doctrine found in the Tenth Amendment. Opponents argue it’s a new attempt at nullification and its restrictions on federal cooperation will kneecap cops and prosecutors.
What’s in the bill
At the heart of Ohio House Bill 382, known as the Second Amendment Preservation Act, is a prohibition on state and local law enforcement agencies working with federal counterparts to enforce federal laws or regulations.
The bill allows ordinary citizens to sue Ohio agencies over alleged violations and imposes a $50,000 civil penalty per occurrence.

The driving idea behind the proposal is that states have the right and obligation to uphold firearms rights against any threat — notably, “foreign or domestic.”
Backers believe agencies like the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives have instituted regulations that violate Second Amendment rights, and that those restrictions are unconstitutional given the Tenth Amendment’s constraints on federal authority.
“This bill is a serious and necessary response to very real threats,” Ohio Gun Owners Executive Director Chris Dorr argued in a press release. He bragged that already 35 lawmakers have signed on to the proposal, “standing shoulder-to-shoulder with gun owners and making it clear: Ohio will not be a tool for federal tyranny.”
Although Dorr and other supporters reach for lofty arguments, the proposal’s inciting incident was relatively banal. The ATF under former President Joe Biden moved to restrict pistol braces.
Historically, it’s an accessory helping people with disabilities steady their aim, but in more recent years the braces have morphed into an attachment that allows a shooter to brace a weapon against their shoulder like a rifle.
Backers voice support for bill keeping Ohio cops from enforcing federal gun laws

The ATF’s final rule left out the former but required gun owners with the latter to register the weapon, alter it (removing the brace or elongating the barrel), or destroy the weapon.
The latest bill includes a provision meant to hamper enforcement of pistol brace regulations in Ohio, but Courts have since put the rule on hold. The current Trump administration also seems unlikely to defend it, but Dorr insists that’s no reason not to act.
“Pro-gun momentum like we are seeing under President Trump doesn’t last forever,” Dorr argued. “We have the votes. We have the people. We have the support. Now is the time to act — not next year, not after the next election — now.”
Where things get murky
The latest iteration of the proposal also brings back a section of legislative findings — essentially a statement of purpose written into statute. Among its assertions, federal powers not explicitly granted in the Constitution “are unauthoritative and of no force;” the supremacy clause does not extend to firearm restrictions “within the borders of Ohio;” and federal authority over commerce and taxes “merely identify” the government’s “limited powers,” rather than allowing it to “diminish” the right to bear arms.
Because the separation of powers doctrine generally places that kind of legal interpretation under the court’s purview, that section was quickly removed the last time lawmakers debated the bill.
Still, the new proposal attempts to distance itself from some of the more controversial provisions in the previous version. For instance, a prohibition on state and local agencies hiring people who previously worked for the federal government does not appear in the latest draft.
And for all the bill’s bright line assertions about where federal authorities ends, several carveouts underscore that it’s just not that simple.
State and local agencies rely on federal support on a daily basis — the national ballistics database, which helps draw links between firearms used in multiple crimes, offers just one example. Interagency task forces are crucial in drug and human trafficking investigations.
“This bill is a stinker.” Opponents bash Ohio Second Amendment ‘sanctuary’ legislation

Both examples were leveled by opponents last time the bill was offered, and sponsors amended the bill to allow them. However, critics argue those tweaks can’t redeem a flawed proposal.
Lou Tobin heads up the Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association. In an email he said he appreciates the sponsor “trying to address” problems that came up before. In practice, though, he doesn’t think the changes will make a difference.
Pointing to the ballistics database, Tobin said, “it only allows that ‘to enforce the laws of the state or a political subdivision’ when entering information into a national database necessarily assists federal law enforcement, too.”
“Allowing us to refer violent felonies to federal prosecutors when there are ‘ancillary’ weapons violations sounds like a compromise,” Tobin added, “but what ‘ancillary’ means in this context remains unclear. The bill says explicitly that it ‘shall be construed strictly against the state.’ So the bill is still going to have a chilling effect on law enforcement efforts to address violent crime in this state because people aren’t going to want to be sued.”
Erick Bellomy’s father was shot and killed in a botched robbery in 2017.
He now heads up the Ohio chapter of Brady United Against Gun Violence and said he’s “appalled” at lawmakers continuing to advance legislation like the Second Amendment Preservation Act.
“Law enforcement officers and police chiefs across the state have warned this bill makes it harder—not easier—to keep our communities safe,” he added. “When law enforcement and public safety leaders oppose a bill, we should listen.”
Bellomy criticized the legislation’s carveouts as “confusing and contradictory,” warning they “threaten to paralyze law enforcement.”
Like Tobin, he criticized provisions limiting cooperation with federal prosecutors unless gun charges are only “ancillary” to the case. The restriction is “so vague that it may prevent prosecutors from pursuing justice in violent cases involving guns,” Bellomy argued.
If lawmakers want to protect Ohioans, Bellomy said, they should focus on safe storage, extreme risk protection orders and community violence intervention efforts.
“These are real, evidence-based strategies that reduce gun deaths—without infringing on anyone’s Second Amendment rights,” he argued.
“Let me be clear: no one wants to take guns away from law-abiding citizens,” Bellomy added. “What we want is to ensure that guns are stored safely, used responsibly, and kept out of the hands of those with malicious intent or a history of violence.”

So can consumers in surrounding states, it said.
Tariffs — which are taxes on imports — affect various sectors of the economy differently. Retailers who participated in the survey were the group that said it was most likely to pass on increased costs from Trump’s tariffs. 
A full 90% said they expected to raise prices in the next six months. Seventy two percent of manufacturers and 71% of construction businesses said the same. Minorities of professional-services firms (43%), financial-services firms (38%), and freight carriers (20%) said the tariffs would increase their costs enough to force them to raise prices.
After taking office, Trump announced tariffs on almost all of the country’s trading partners. Then in early April, he said he would delay most for 90 days to give time to negotiate what he saw as more equitable deals. Very few deals have been completed with the 90-day deadline set to expire next week.
Trump said that even without deals in place, he’s not interested in extending the deadline beyond July 9.

“We’ll look at how a country treats us — are they good, are they not so good — some countries we don’t care, we’ll just send a high (tariff) number out,” the Associated Press quoted Trump as saying on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.” 
For businesses and customers in the region represented by the Cleveland Fed, tariffs are a serious matter, the report shows. The Cleveland Fed represents Ohio, western Pennsylvania, eastern Kentucky, and the northern panhandle of West Virginia. 
Eight times a year, the agency conducts its Survey of Regional Conditions and Expectations. The great majority of respondents to the May survey didn’t see Trump’s tariffs as helping their businesses.
Seventy percent said they’d have a negative impact on their businesses over the next six months and 20% said they’d have no impact. Just 9% of businesses said the Trump tariffs would be good for them over the short term.
How negative businesses were about Trump’s tariffs was related to how dependent they are on imports.
Retail, the sector that overwhelmingly said it would raise prices, said it got 27% of its inputs from overseas. That was followed by manufacturing, at 18%, construction, at 14%, freight, at 8%, businesses and professional services, at 6%, and financial services, at 2%.
Even though businesses in the financial services sector aren’t worried that the Trump tariffs will push their input costs up, they have another worry: that people will have less money for them to manage. Ninety percent of firms that responded said the tariffs would decrease demand for their services over the coming six months. 
More than half of businesses in every sector said they expected demand for their goods and services to decrease. And, compared to the February survey, the businesses seem more pessimistic generally.
“More firms were expecting to decrease employment, capital spending, and inventory levels than increase them because of higher tariffs. The share of firms expecting to decrease employment rose to 32 percent compared to 22 percent in our February survey,” the report said.

(Otto Kitsinger for States Newsroom.)The proposals to overturn legislation overhauling higher education, eliminate property taxes, and end qualified immunity will not be on the November ballot, despite advocates trying to get the question to Ohio voters.
Public education advocates have fallen short 50,000 signatures of the needed 250,000 to put a referendum on the Ohio ballot, Youngstown State University Professor Dr. Cryshanna Jackson Leftwich said. She was aiming to repeal Ohio Senate Bill 1, a controversial college overhaul bill.
The effort was led by a small grassroots organization made up of mainly Youngstown State professors like Jackson Leftwich. The group had no money, no backing from statewide or national education groups or paid canvassers — which she said was a problem.
Typically, successful coalitions submit hundreds of thousands more signatures, because oftentimes they are invalid.
When Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights, the group putting an amendment on the ballot to protect abortion, IVF and contraception, they submitted 300,000 more signatures than needed as cushion room. The group needed around 415,000, submitted 710,000 and ended with about 500,000 valid.
“It shouldn’t take millions of dollars to fight [for] democracy,” she said. “It shouldn’t take millions of dollars for consultants and lawyers for average voting citizens to say, ‘Hey, this is an unjust bill.'”
State Sen. Jerry Cirino, the top Republican on the influential Finance Committee, introduced the legislation.
“It provides for a policy to be established for what I call intellectual diversity, which is very important,” Cirino said. “It means openness to all various thoughts about various issues, which is the opposite of indoctrination — indoctrination is when you expose students to only one train of thought, so a monolithic thought environment. That is not good for students.”
This massive bill focuses on what the Republican calls “free speech,” banning public universities in Ohio from Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives, or having “bias” in the classroom, and limiting how “controversial topics” can and can’t be taught. Eliminating DEI would mean no diversity offices, training, or scholarships.
“I believe that will benefit students greatly and produce better students who know how to think and analyze and come to their own conclusions,” he added.
Students and professors from across the state have continued to argue that there is nothing wrong with their education, and they are furious that lawmakers are trying to interrupt their classes.
This is one of the most protested-against bills in recent Ohio history. There were roughly 1,500 people who submitted opponent testimony against S.B. 1, and there were about 30 who submitted in support. Which is why Amanda Fehlbaum, a YSU professor, was shocked when no larger organizations “stepped up” to help them, she said.
The group raised $45,000 in six weeks and collected the signatures without any paid assistance, which was very challenging, Fehlbaum added, emphasizing that larger groups said that a referendum would be “too expensive,” she said.
Cirino said Thursday that he isn’t surprised that the effort failed, because he said the bill is good policy.
“I think their biggest problem was that this was a group of disgruntled faculty members, mostly from Youngstown State, who are satisfied with the status quo in higher education,” he said. “They couldn’t be more detached from reality in terms of what needs to be done to make Ohio’s Higher Ed the very best we can be.”
But the S.B. 1 repeal wasn’t the only “everyday” group that couldn’t get on the ballot.
The Citizens for Property Tax Reform didn’t submit the signatures they gathered.
“It’s such a huge undertaking,” organizer Beth Blackmarr said Thursday.
Blackmarr helped create a coalition of homeowners in Cuyahoga County, hoping to put a constitutional amendment on the November ballot that would eliminate property taxes.
Her team, Citizens for Property Tax Reform, knew they weren’t near the 415,000 they needed. She didn’t have an estimate of how many they collected, nor how much money they raised.
“As naive as we are, we may have underestimated, just a little bit, how big the response was really going to be,” she said. “That’s been quite rewarding, so we’ve asked everybody to keep on trucking and keep going.”
Despite both being grassroots, her situation is different from Jackson Leftwich’s for two main reasons: constitutional amendment proposals can be pushed back to future elections, and she told us a month ago that her proposal didn’t even have to reach the ballot.
“Hopefully, what legislators will do is counter with some legislation of their own,” she told me in May.
And it has worked.
“I’m hoping this does help to push us,” State Rep. David Thomas, R-Jefferson, said when asked about the tax amendment.
Thomas leads property tax relief discussions in the House and said that he and the other members heard Blackmarr. Since her amendment, lawmakers have been proposing more property tax relief bills and have passed several in the budget.
“This is a win-win for Ohio,” Blackmarr said.
Strategy has to come into play when getting an issue proposed statewide, she added.
“Ohio makes it as difficult as possible,” YSU’s Education Association President Mark Vopat said, detailing all of the work that must be done to go through the extensive collection process. “I believe that the state has made it as onerous as possible for individual citizens like us, — we’re doing this as a voluntary effort — to actually get some sort of referendum passed.”
For all ballot proposals, campaigns need valid signatures from at least 44 of Ohio’s 88 counties.
For referendums, the total signatures must be 6% of the total votes cast for governor during the last gubernatorial election. This makes the number about 248,092 valid signatures.
For initiated statutes, the total signatures must be 3% of the total vote cast for governor during the last gubernatorial election. This makes the number about 124,046 valid signatures.
For constitutional amendments, the total signatures must be 10% of the total vote cast for governor during the last gubernatorial election. This makes the number about 413,487 valid signatures.
There have been efforts to make this harder, though.
Republican leaders in Columbus are floating the idea of attempting to make it more difficult to amend the state constitution, a proposal that was defeated in 2023 by Ohioans across the political spectrum.
Issue 1 in 2023 would have taken away majority rule in Ohio. The proposed constitutional amendment would have raised the threshold for constitutional amendments to pass from 50%+1, a simple majority, to 60%. It was defeated 57-43%.
The following year, 2024, the Senate GOP moved to increase the amount of counties campaigns must collect from and put more bureaucratic layers on advocates. They wanted to require all groups rallying for a cause that is receiving donations and spending money to register as a political action committee (PAC).
This means that groups would have to file disclosures with the government, and it could make it more difficult to collect signatures to get a proposal on a township ballot.
Other challenges campaigns can face deal with the political offices they must go through.
Ohio activists are starting to gather signatures to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot that would end qualified immunity — a protection for police and other government officials that prevents citizens from suing them.
State law prevents government officials from being held liable for civil damages unless the victim can prove that the officer violated their constitutional rights, which can be an uphill battle, advocates say.
The Ohio Coalition to End Qualified Immunity has been battling Attorney General Dave Yost to get their summary language approved so that they can collect signatures. He has rejected it eight times, and recently, in short, courts have required him to allow them to move forward.
From their approval, they would have only had two months at most to collect signatures. Although initially hopeful for November, their team told us Thursday that they are now aiming for 2026.
But when it comes to S.B. 1, Jackson Leftwich said this isn’t the end for them, either.
“If we got this on the ballot, we would have overturned it,” she said.
The group didn’t specify if and how they would try again, or just rely on the larger groups in future years.

(1 July 2025) – Delaware will start legal adult-use cannabis sales on August 1, 2020, marking an important milestone in the First State’s cannabis legalization effort. According to the Office of the Marijuana Commissioner, all licensed medical marijuana converts can begin recreational sales August 1.


 Joshua Sanderlin, the new Marijuana Commission, said: “The beginning of legal adult-use cannabis sales is a reflection of our tireless efforts and strong partnerships with State agencies, industry stakeholder and community leaders.” “Our focus is to build a safe, fair, and accountable market for marijuana that provides real benefits for Delawareans.” We will continue to grant conditional licenses for previously selected applicants in order to make sure they can start operations.


 Delaware passed legislation in 2023 legalizing recreational marijuana for adults and creating a comprehensive system that includes cultivators, manufacturers and retailers as well as testing laboratories. The focus was on applicants who were based on social equity. The law also established the Office of the Marijuana Commission to oversee the program, and create a robust regulatory structure. The proposed regulations were published in May 2024, and the finalized regulations in September 2024 following two rounds of public comments. The regulations of the Office Marijuana commissioner define licensing requirements for the industry and operational standards.


 The launch of a legal market for adult-use cannabis in Delaware, which prioritizes safety, equity and accountability, is a significant step forward. This new industry will create real opportunities for entrepreneurs, as well as generate vital revenue to support our schools, public health systems and infrastructure. The revenue generated by this market will also allow us to invest in communities that have been most affected by the drug war, correcting past wrongs, and making sure the benefits reach all corners of the state. I’m proud that we are moving quickly and carefully to create a cannabis industry that reflects our values, and provides more opportunities for all Delawareans .”


 The General Assembly passed additional measures in 2024 to strengthen Delaware’s program. House Bill 334 expanded the program parameters, while House Bill 408 created a transition path for medical marijuana businesses to enter the adult-use market. The licenses were expensive, costing $200,000 for cultivation and $100 for manufacturing or retail. This resulted to $4 million of critical funding for social equity applicants.


 OMC has announced that it will receive 1,269 licenses paid for during the period of August 19 to September 30 in October 2024. This is a substantial increase over its original projections.

 OMC will announce the winners of its lottery for 125 licenses available in December 2024.


 OMC is committed to creating a market for adult-use marijuana in Delaware that is well-regulated, compliant and fair. As implementation progresses, we will provide more updates.

Medicaid recipients fear potentially devastating cuts,Ian Karbal,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/health-care/pa-medicaid-recipients-fear-potentially-devastating-cuts/,"“Medicaid literally saved my life and my daughter’s life. I don’t want to be dramatic, but if it’s cut, it’s almost going to be like killing people.”","Lauren Stuparitz and her son (photo courtesy of Stuparitz)It wasn’t until she was 20 years old and pregnant with her son that Brittany Groover first applied for Medicaid. Growing up in a working class, western Pennsylvania household before the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, Groover’s father was insured through work, but she and her mom weren’t.
“My parents were the people that made just a little too much money to qualify for assistance,” she said. “I don’t recall going to the doctors for checkups. We would only go to urgent care if I had an ear infection or something.”
Once she was covered, the safety net allowed her peace of mind during her pregnancy. And six years later, in 2021, it allowed her to get treatment when she was diagnosed with stage 3a melanoma that spread to her lymph nodes. 
“I looked this up recently, because this has been a big, hot topic,” she said. “One immunotherapy treatment was $42,000. I had to do 18 of them.”

After 18 sessions of immunotherapy and three surgeries, Groover is in remission. And the experience led her to take up advocacy. Last year, she began working with the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Action Network, where she encourages healthy habits and tries to educate people on the importance of Medicaid.
But now, Groover, 31, is worried about what could come next.
She is one of more than three million Pennsylvanians — over one in five people — who are insured through Medicaid. According to the Cancer Action Network she is also among the one in 10 Americans with a history of cancer who are insured through the program, including one in three children newly diagnosed. So, she is paying close attention to whether Congress moves forward with steep cuts to the programs being pushed by the Trump administration.
“I’ve been thinking about this non-stop,” Groover said. “If I lose my Medicaid, and my appointment comes up for a PET scan, I would genuinely be thinking, ‘If I go to that and put myself in debt, then how am I going to pay for food, or put a roof over my head or take care of my son?’ That’s what every single person on Medicaid is dealing with.”
The proposed cuts are part of a sweeping budget bill that will enact many of President Donald Trump’s domestic policy priorities. The proposal, which only needs a simple majority vote, has already passed the U.S. House along partisan lines.
As it stands, senate Republicans spent Monday voting on a series of amendments in an attempt to unite divided factions of their party, with some concerned about the bill’s overall price tag, and others worried about the impacts of cuts to programs like Medicaid and food assistance. If passed, the bill will be returned to the House for a final vote or additional changes
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated the bill could result in nearly 12 million fewer Americans having health insurance by 2034. 
At the state level, the commonwealth’s Department of Human Services says cuts could result in more than 300,000 Pennsylvanians losing Medicaid coverage. Another 270,000 could lose access to marketplace plans or face steep premium increases, Val Arkoosh, the department’s head, has said.
Pennsylvania’s 10 Republican congressmen unanimously voted in support of the House version of the bill that passed last month. In a recent town hall, Sen. Dave McCormick, Pennsylvania’s only Republican in the Senate, also signaled support for reining in Medicaid spending. 
McCormick said the aim was not to reduce Medicaid spending from current levels, but to curb the program’s growth and refocus it on helping children, the elderly, the mentally ill and the disabled.
“Medicaid has been spiraling out of control,” he said. “We want to ensure that Medicaid protects the vulnerable people for whom it was designed”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
As the bill stands, this is primarily accomplished through new work requirements that would mandate most Medicaid recipients prove they work or volunteer at least 80 hours a month, or qualify for an exemption. McCormick said the goal is to ensure that healthy, able-bodied adults are not using the service. Critics say it’s a disguised effort to decrease spending by throwing up bureaucratic red tape for people who would otherwise be covered.
The next largest source of cuts would stem from a provision forcing states to lower taxes on health care providers like hospitals and nursing homes that help raise additional funding for Medicaid. The bill would require states to incrementally lower those provider taxes from a maximum of 6% down to 3.5% by 2032. 
Critics of provider taxes say they’re an accounting trick that allows the state to get additional Medicaid match funds from the federal government, with the revenue often returning to the health care providers that paid them in the first place. But defenders say they’ve become a critical source of funding.
The state Department of Human Services said the change could result in $2.7 billion in lost funds when they take full effect in 2032. That includes both the state revenue from the taxes as well as the federal Medicaid matching funds.
‘I felt so helpless’
Patrick Keenan, the director of policy at the Pennsylvania Health Access Network, an advocacy group, says a large majority of people on Medicaid who can work already do.
“Our analysis shows that 4% of folks on Medicaid aren’t working or qualified for an exemption to work requirements,” Keenan said. It’s a number that’s roughly in line with the national unemployment rate.
Moreover, Keenan said that, in practice, work requirements primarily result in a lot of people who should qualify for Medicaid not receiving it. 
“A lot of folks that are working and eligible get cut from the program, because it’s very difficult to get all the documentation, on one hand,” he said. “On another hand, it’s very difficult for all that documentation to be processed correctly, and there’s no additional funding for that — or very little — from Congress.”

Keenan pointed to Arkansas and Georgia, the only two states that have implemented Medicaid work requirements. In Arkansas, the requirement led to thousands losing insurance who previously qualified for Medicaid expansion, an Affordable Care Act program that allowed states to offer Medicaid to low-income adults. Arkansas’ work requirement program ultimately ended in 2019, after a judge declared it “arbitrary and capricious.”  In Georgia, the rollout of a program to offer expanded Medicaid coverage to a small group who could prove they met work requirements resulted in far fewer than expected actually enrolled. While the state estimated 246,000 people would be eligible, only 6,500 ended up actually enrolled, and it ultimately cost more per person to enroll them than it would have in other states that offered blanked Medicaid expansions.
For context, the U.S. House bill’s work requirements would apply to an even larger share of the Medicaid population than Georgia’s.
The CBO estimated that the proposed work requirements alone will result in five million fewer Americans receiving Medicaid by 2034. The report added only a few would likely be able to get insurance through an employer afterward.
The bill would also make it harder for anyone who can’t meet work requirements to get a plan through the federally funded health care marketplace. That’s because they would become ineligible for premium tax credits. Those tax credits are a mechanism in the Affordable Care Act that keeps marketplace prices down for low- and middle-income families. They can be paid directly to an insurance provider to lower monthly costs, and often lower premiums by hundreds of dollars.
But, the burden of ensuring Medicaid recipients all qualify for the program will ultimately fall on the state officials who oversee it. The bill would require Medicaid administrators to ensure enrollees are meeting work requirements at least every six months.
Brandon Cwalina, a spokesperson for the state Department of Human Services, said the new reporting requirements could “create an unprecedented and unfunded increase in the administrative burden on DHS that will strain existing operations and divert resources from mission-critical service delivery across the Medicaid and SNAP Programs.”
Even without that added strain, administrative errors can already lead to people losing health care.
In 2010, Lauren Stuparitz, a Pittsburgh native, was assaulted and suffered a head injury. For years, she struggled to read and concentrate, and was regularly in pain.
After three years, she gave up her teaching job and qualified for Medicaid, which she said helped her receive treatment that otherwise would have been unattainable. While she still suffers side effects, it was an enormous help.
“It’s been lifesaving,” Stuparitz, 40, said of Medicaid. “I feel like people use that word a lot, but I’m not actually sure what else to use because I don’t know if I’d have much of a quality of life without it.”
When her first son was born in 2020, he also received insurance through Medicaid. The safety net has been essential, especially since he was diagnosed with autism.
But, last year, Stuparitz hit a roadblock when she tried to recertify her Medicaid eligibility. 
At the time, she was doing temp work for the U.S. Census Bureau and making more money than usual. She says the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services incorrectly used that temporary pay to determine her annual income. 
As a result, she was told she no longer qualified and that her son was being switched to CHIP, a program for children in households that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid.

“I felt so helpless, honestly,” she said. “If I have to lose my insurance, that’s fine, but I need my son to be able to get what he needs.”
Her son had come to rely on regular appointments with early development specialists, who she learned didn’t accept his new insurance.
“For kids who are on the spectrum, having the routine is a critical thing,” Stuparitz said. “When things are in flux, it throws them off. It was probably one of the most stressful things I’ve ever had to deal with in my life.”
So for weeks, Stuparitz built up medical debt while she tried to get the situation rectified. She struggled to get through to a person in the Medicaid office who could help, and when she did, she said she was usually told to resubmit documents online.
Eventually, Stuparitz said she was able to prove she qualified for Medicaid, and was also able to bill the insurance for her son’s unpaid appointments.
While Stuparitz doesn’t blame the Department of Human Services or hold a grudge, she worries that what happened to her may become far more common if the amount of bureaucracy for people on Medicaid is increased.
“It’s just something that happens when you have a large system,” Stuparitz said. “But if your income’s not very cut and dry, I think it’s easier to happen. I feel like it has to be common, especially if you’re dealing with people who have a health condition that prevents them from working steady hours.”
A spokesperson for the department did not comment on the specifics of Stuparitz’s case when asked, but said “DHS works diligently to ensure the benefits DHS administers get to the eligible Pennsylvanians who need and qualify for them.”
“If it’s cut, it’s almost going to be like killing people.”
Jennifer Rabe-Coulibaly, 42, has lived her life between Middletown, in Dauphin County, and west Africa. Her parents were missionaries, and she followed in their footsteps. That means traveling back and forth every few months or years. 
Rabe-Coulibaly asked that the specific country not be named because of threats emanating from conflict there.
In 2021, Rabe-Coulibaly married a west African man, Emmanuel Coulibaly. In 2023, after he got a green card, they flew to Pennsylvania, where they’ve been living since. 
Overseas, both can be insured through the mission, but when they came to the U.S., they were unable to afford the premiums themselves. They both applied for Pennie, Pennsylvania’s marketplace option that provides more affordable insurance for low- and middle-income people who don’t qualify for Medicaid.
Almost immediately, they put their plans to use.

For Coulibaly, it meant receiving care for an issue he dealt with almost his entire life. As a child in west Africa, he was injured and his two legs developed to be different sizes. In America, with insurance, he was finally able to get treatment.
Coulibaly’s leg required major surgery and a hip replacement. When he failed to recover properly, he needed another operation.
“Without Pennie, my husband wouldn’t have been able to go through these operations,” Rabe-Coulibaly said. “One of the doctors said if he didn’t, in 10, 20 years, he’d be in a wheelchair.”
Meanwhile, Rabe-Coulibaly had become pregnant, which qualified her for Medicaid.
At 40, this meant more frequent doctor’s visits. At the same time, she was helping her husband recover, and had to go to his doctor’s appointments to translate. He speaks French and is still learning English.
“My (obstetrician), she’s like, ‘You need to take it easy,’” Rabe-Coulibaly said. “I said, ‘I wish, but I can’t.’ It was a lot.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
At eight months, Rabe-Coulibaly developed preeclampsia, and her baby was delivered with a cesarean-section. While both she and her baby are now healthy, things seemed so bad initially, Coulibaly later told her he thought she or the baby was going to die.
“Medicaid literally saved my life and my daughter’s life,” Coulibaly said. “I don’t want to be dramatic, but if it’s cut, it’s almost going to be like killing people.”
The experience has informed her perspective on Medicaid, Pennie and the potential impacts of Congress’ budget bill.
To start with, Rabe-Coulibaly isn’t sure that she’d be able to prove she meets work requirements, given the nature of her job. While in Pennsylvania, Coulibaly works for the mission, answering phone calls and emails, and making presentations at churches.She logs hours and files her taxes as self-employed, but is paid different amounts monthly, depending entirely on donations.
“It would depend on what Medicaid wants as far as documentation,” she said. “What I’ve been doing is just writing down on a piece of notebook paper what I’m doing.”
It’s also opened her eyes to how tenuous health care can be. 
In a previous version of the bill, many legal migrants, like Coulibaly, would have been barred from receiving premium tax credits that help pay for Affordable Care Act plans like Pennie, until they’ve been in the country for five years.
Without the additional funds, Rabe-Coulibaly said, her husband would not have been able to afford insurance.
That part, however, was struck down by the Senate parliamentarian on the grounds that such a move would require 60 votes, and not the 51 allowed by the reconciliation process.
A number of Republicans, as well as Trump, called for the parliamentarian to be overruled, but Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-South Dakota) and others said they had no intention to do so.
Still, the attempt has been on Rabe-Coulibaly’s mind.
Rabe-Coulibaly understands why people think non-citizens shouldn’t have access to social services generally, but she worries about what the future may hold for legal immigrants like her husband.
“The U.S. has a reputation of welcoming people from other cultures,” Rabe-Coulibaly said. “Part of that welcoming is to help them out in times of need. I’m not talking about taking advantage of the system, because I know there’s that out there, but I’m talking about in times of need, letting people like my husband benefit from some of these programs.”
It’s been another concern that’s kept her watching, like Brittany Groover and Lauren Stuparitz, as Congress debates the fate of health care programs that all three described as life saving.
“I was never a political person before all this,” Groover said about how she was affected by threats to Medicaid. “I wasn’t even registered to vote until last year.”
It’s one reason Groover wants to share her story, which she does on a YouTube channel and with the Cancer Action Network.
“All these people, they keep saying people are fraudulently on medicaid.” she said. “That is not a real thing that’s happening. I’m the person you’re talking about. I’m not abusing the system. I’m using the system exactly how it was designed, because it’s a lifeline for me.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_7930.HEIC-769x1024.jpg,,,2025-07-01 05:01:58.103237

Thousands of Ohio jobs are at risk as Republicans in Congress decide the fate of the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy tax credits, according to two new reports.


The 2022 federal climate law spurred announcements of more than $7 billion in clean energy projects in Ohio. An analysis by the nonpartisan business group E2 links those investments to nearly 5,000 announced jobs.


A separate research paper published this month by the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of labor unions and environmental groups, used broader criteria to conclude that Republicans’ ​“One Big Beautiful Bill Act” puts more than 17,000 direct manufacturing jobs at risk in the state. The ripple effect on other sectors that work with clean energy companies could bring the number to more than 91,000.


Cleveland, Ohio-based solar company YellowLite is among the firms already pausing hiring in response to federal policy uncertainty. The company said it had planned to bring on 20 to 25 more workers this year to keep up with growing business. Those plans are now on hold.


If the threatened cuts happen, the company fears business will ​“decline dramatically,” said Al Frasz, YellowLite’s commercial business manager. ​“We will probably be in a mode of having to lay off 35% to 40% of our employees.”


Frasz is one of dozens of business, labor, civic, and other leaders in Ohio calling upon Congress to revise the current reconciliation budget bill to preserve the IRA tax credits and other clean energy provisions.


Ohio is among the top states to benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy incentives. As of last summer, its 9th Congressional District had eight announced projects — more than any other district nationwide, according to E2, which advocates for policies that benefit the economy and the environment. Ohio also ranked among the top 10 states nationwide for announced projects.


“Businesses are reacting to the Senate’s proposal, like the House’s, that would drastically scale back the very tax credits that had been driving an American energy and manufacturing boom,” said Michael Timberlake, E2’s communications director, when the group released its data on May 29.




















Part of the Inflation Reduction Act’s success in spurring clean energy investments stems from its 10-year time frame for tax credits, noted Joe Flarida, executive director of Power a Clean Future Ohio, which works with local governments on clean energy. That signaled to businesses and communities that there would be some stability, which is important for business planning.


“What we saw was this massive movement and response to use and leverage those tax credits in a productive way,” Flarida said. Pulling the rug out from under organizations that planned or broke ground on projects expecting those tax credits ​“is going to be a wasteful-government-spending dilemma,” he continued. ​“What we’re going to see is a ton of investment that’s taken place over the past couple of years completely vanish overnight. And this is just bad policymaking.”


The Ohio Chamber of Commerce would like the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credits to continue through 2035, said Tony Long, the organization’s general counsel and director of energy policy. The state needs more energy generation, he added, noting that Ohio imports about a quarter of its electricity from other states.


“These credits will help continue to drive new development of energy sources,” Long said, noting that IRA tax credits have helped small and medium-sized businesses grow.


Private businesses won’t be the only ones impacted if Congress cuts or severely curtails the clean energy credits. ​“Direct-pay” provisions allow local governments and schools to access incentives after completing qualifying projects. Cities and counties in Ohio are already counting on more than $160 million in savings from those credits, 30 local government leaders told the state’s congressional delegation this spring.


Consumers also can expect higher electricity prices in the absence of clean energy credits, since less incentive to build new power plants means less energy in the marketplace. Full repeal of the tax credits could cost U.S. households an average of more than $110 per year, and businesses could expect a 10% increase in electricity costs, the Clean Energy Buyers Association estimated in February.


Debates continue on the federal reconciliation bill, which Republicans aim to pass in July. Impacts on businesses, workers, and communities will depend on the final provisions.

(Thomas Barwick/Getty Images)In coming weeks, our news feeds will be loaded with stories on the Trump administration’s plan to cut hundreds of billions of dollars from the nation’s Medicaid program.
Already, we’ve heard stories about non-U.S. citizens being on the rolls, able-bodied adults not having to work, and — of course — widespread fraud and abuse.
Yadda, yadda, yadda.
Before we go down this road, as Kansans, we need to get a few things straight.
Medicaid and Medicare are not the same thing. Medicare is designed to ensure health care for those of us over 65; Medicaid tries to do the same for the poor, our elders and people with disabilities.
Because Medicaid is underwritten by a mix of state and federal funds, states have a say in how their programs are administered. Since 2012, the Kansas Legislature has balked at taking advantage of federal incentives meant to close post-Obamacare gaps in Medicaid eligibility. Consequently, Kansas’ Medicaid program — known as KanCare — is one of the most restrictive in the nation.
Depending on your politics, you may think this is a good thing. But it doesn’t stop uninsured people from going to the emergency room. Hospitals just won’t be paid for treating them.
Other Kansas-specific facts to consider:

Childless adults are not eligible for Medicaid.
A parent caring for children is not eligible for Medicaid if their income exceeds 38% of the “federal poverty level,” which, for a parent with two kids, comes to about $843 a month.
The kids are most likely eligible, but the parents are not. Still, 70 percent of parents on Medicaid are working. Typically, the remaining 30 percent are either enrolled in a job training program or at home caring for a frail elder or child who should not be left alone.
Between 30 and 40% of all births are covered by Medicaid. About half of Medicaid recipients in Kansas are children.
In dire emergencies involving patients who aren’t U.S. citizens — complicated childbirths, for example — doctors and hospitals might be eligible for Medicaid reimbursement. The billing process, however, is ill-defined, restrictive and often not worth the hassle.

In Kansas, Medicaid does not pay for non-emergent care for non-citizens. Other states’ programs are not as restrictive.
In its latest annual report, the Kansas Attorney General’s Office notes that from July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023, its Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Unit “obtained judgements” for more than $308,000. During the same period, Medicaid spending in Kansas came in around $5.5 billion. That’s not a lot. The unit’s 2024 report isn’t out yet.
Forty percent of Kansas nursing home residents’ stays are covered by Medicaid.
To be clear, Medicaid does not give money to poor people. Instead, it pays KanCare providers — three giant, for-profit managed care organizations — to provide care. These providers also are charged with helping frail elders and people with disabilities live in community-based settings because it’s a lot cheaper than paying for nursing homes to care for them.
Nevertheless, nursing homes are loaded with Medicaid patients and community-based options have long waiting lists.
Cutting Medicaid won’t help.
Analysts who have studied the contents of the “big, beautiful bill” working its way through Congress are telling advocates to be on the lookout for three scenarios.
First, Supporters will insist they don’t want to cut Medicaid; instead, they will say we need to increase accountability because there’s so much fraud and abuse. And for this to happen, current and would-be recipients will need to jump through additional documentation hoops. Those who stumble won’t be eligible. Fewer recipients will result in less spending.
Second, The bill calls for rescinding a Biden-era regulation that required nursing homes to hire more nurses and nurse aids. Shelving the requirement would trim billions of dollars in proposed Medicaid spending. The nursing home industry supports the change, arguing its profit margins wouldn’t cover the costs and even if they did, there aren’t enough nurses and aids available for hire.
Finally, Medicaid has long allowed states to collect a “surcharge” from hospitals with the understanding that the revenues would be used to draw down additional federal dollars. Hospitals welcomed the arrangement, knowing that for every dollar put in, they would get back roughly $1.50. The bill’s supporters, however, call this “money laundering.” Lawmakers hope to either freeze or significantly reduce the federal payments, ignoring repeated warnings that many rural hospitals would be forced to close or downsize.
A recent survey by the REACH Healthcare Foundation and the United Methodist Health Ministry Fund found that 26 rural hospitals in Kansas are already in “immediate risk of closure,” and another 63 are teetering.
A review commissioned by the Kansas Hospital Association found that “over half” of the state’s hospitals are “operating at a loss.”
None of this is good for Kansas, and no one knows this better than our own senators and representatives.

It was at the height of the eugenics movement and growing nativism in the U.S. after WWI. Congress had passed increasingly restrictive immigration laws that put a new emphasis on “desirables” and “undesirables” in deciding who was allowed to emigrate from where. 
The Senate sponsor of the 1924 Immigration Act, Republican David Reed of Pennsylvania, wrote that the law’s goal was to make the United States a more “homogenous” country.  
Mass immigration threatened to “dilute” that uniformity (sound familiar?) so national origins quotas were introduced to greatly curb or ban any group deemed not American enough or not expected to readily fuse with the native-born population. 
The xenophobic policies of the early 20th century — making a toxic resurgence in 2025 — slammed the door on Slavic immigrants who spoke strange languages and didn’t easily assimilate. 
The only reason a Slovak teenager with a basket trunk of belongings could find her way to Cleveland, Ohio was because she had been born in America. 
Years earlier, her parents had filed through Ellis Island with thousands of other immigrants bound for jobs in the industrial Midwest. They settled in Pa. but did not became U.S. citizens. Eventually the tug of familial ties in Sačurov drug the family back home to their rural village.  
Years later, my grandmother, prodded by her Slovak mother, would return to redeem her birthright citizenship.  
It was all she had to start a new life in Ohio but more than the rest of her foreign-born family, save a younger brother, to come to the U.S. The young woman who couldn’t speak a lick of English was an American citizen by birth — same as every other Ohioan who came into the world on American soil. 
The Constitution affirms that unconditional right even if Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost doesn’t.
Yost signed on to a brief supporting Trump’s executive order to end birthright citizenship. He was running for governor at the time and angling for a Trump endorsement that went to Vivek Ramaswamy. 
But Yost joined 16 GOP attorneys general to defend the indefensible; excluding babies born to undocumented immigrants and people with temporary status in the U.S. from the 14th Amendment’s Citizenship Clause.  
In essence, the Republican AGs endorsed the power of one man to decide who, among those born in this country, is worthy of citizenship. It was grotesque sycophancy in service to a lawless megalomaniac high on his own supply of unchecked tyranny.  
Under the Trump criteria — abolishing 150 years of precedent and a longtime policy of unrestricted birthright citizenship — any baby born in the U.S. after his executive order would need to have at least one parent who is a citizen or lawful permanent resident to qualify as a citizen. 
That would exclude my grandmother today as a U.S.-born citizen to noncitizen parents and probably the grandparents of many other Ohioans born in America were they to be judged by the same standards Yost advocated in court. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
His brief argued that, despite plain text to the contrary, the Constitution “did not confer citizenship to children born to individuals who were not lawfully and permanently present in the United States.” 
Moreover, Yost and the others asserted, states like Ohio are being harmed because babies who “likely would have been born in a different country” if it weren’t for birthright citizenship, may “participate in state welfare programs…and receive state healthcare…and obtain a driver’s license.” 
Because they are American citizens “born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.” 
Whether a U.S.-born child’s parents are U.S citizens, stressed the ACLU, “does not impact whether that child is a citizen.” 
That principle, upheld in a Supreme Court case more than 100 years ago, confirmed that “a child born in the U.S. to Chinese parents — who at the time were prohibited from becoming U.S. citizens — was a citizen under the 14th Amendment.” 
But the Supreme Court in 2025, stacked with Trump-appointed justices bent on giving him free reign to ignore the rule of law, just slapped down federal courts who had issued nationwide injunctions to stop Trump from implementing his clearly unconstitutional executive order.
The court’s right-wing majority basically made birthright citizenship a state by state, case by case, class-action or individual plaintiff patchwork of litigation destined to wind through lower courts for who-knows-how-long. 
In the meantime, Trump is free to roll out orders on which U.S.-born child will be denied the citizenship guaranteed to them by law in states that don’t object. 
Yost won’t object to natural-born Americans in Ohio being deprived of their rights under the 14th Amendment. The Trump bootlicker applauded those efforts and derided the judges who dared block them.  
“Democratically enacted laws (which executive orders are not) cannot be put on hold by judges who think they are kings,” said Yost with blind irony, considering the self-described king in the White House. “Americans’ freedom depends on each part of the government staying in its lane,” he puffed. 
But apparently not on fealty to the Constitution from Ohio’s chief law enforcement officer.

More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.
“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.
Guns kill more US children than other causes, but state policies can help, study finds

Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

(Photo Illustration by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Georgia kids can continue liking, commenting and subscribing without notifying their parents this summer after a federal judge put a temporary hold on the state’s new social media age verification law while the case moves forward – but the bill’s author says a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling bodes well for the ban.
Senate Bill 351, which was set to go into effect July 1, would require social media companies to get a parent’s permission before they allowed a minor to create an account. All Georgians would also have to verify their age before accessing websites with material deemed harmful to minors.
On Thursday, Judge Amy Totenberg of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia ruled in favor of NetChoice, a coalition of social media companies, who argued that the law as written would likely violate free speech protections.
“The Court does not doubt the dangers posed by young people’s overwhelming exposure to social media,” Totenberg wrote. “But, in its effort to aid parents, the Act’s solution creates serious obstacles for all Georgians, including teenagers, to engage in protected speech activities and would highly likely be unconstitutional.”
Totenberg said the law would curb the speech rights of young people, impose a burden on all Georgians to participate in online speech, potentially put Georgians’ private data at risk and step into parents’ decisions on how to raise their children.
But Totenberg said the law’s biggest downfall comes in its long list of exemptions, which include news, sports, and entertainment sites, interactive gaming platforms, streaming services and more.
“For example, SB 351 would presumably apply to the Georgia Bulldogs Reddit forum, which features user-generated content. But it would exempt Barstool Sports, which features provider-generated content. It would apply to news coverage posted by users on X, but not news coverage posted by The New York Times to its own liveblog.”
Totenberg found that amounts to a content-based restriction on speech, which triggers a higher level of scrutiny – which she said Georgia’s law doesn’t meet.
“Because of the enormous burdens imposed on the First Amendment rights of children, adults, and social media platforms — along with the significant tailoring issues inherent in the law — even the State’s serious interest here cannot justify SB 351 under the First Amendment’s rigorous standards,” she said.
NetChoice celebrated the win in a statement.
“This is a major victory for free speech, constitutional clarity and the rights of all Georgians to engage in public discourse without intrusive government overreach,” said Chris Marchese, NetChoice director of litigation. “We are grateful the court recognized what we’ve long argued: SB 351 isn’t just poorly crafted — it’s profoundly unconstitutional.”
But the bill’s author, state Sen. Jason Anavitarte, a Dallas Republican who is now the Senate majority leader, said their victory is likely to be short-lived.
In a statement, Anavitarte pointed to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that backed a Texas state law requiring age verification for pornographic websites.
“One day after liberal Obama Appointee, US District Court Judge, Amy Totenberg, issued an injunction preventing Georgia’s age verification law from taking effect, The Supreme Court found that laws like SB 351 ‘have only an incidental effect on protected speech and that The First Amendment leaves undisturbed States’ traditional power to prevent minors from accessing speech that is obscene from their perspective….Requiring proof of age is an ordinary and appropriate means of enforcing an age-based limit on obscenity to minors,’” Anavitarte said.
“Based on Friday’s ruling at The Supreme Court, Judge Totenberg should be left with no choice but to allow SB 351 to go into effect,” he added. “I am immensely grateful for Justice Clarence Thomas’ well written opinion and remain optimistic that SB 351 will go into effect in its entirety.”
Attorney General Chris Carr’s said Carr intends to appeal the ruling.
“We will continue to defend commonsense measures that empower parents and protect our children online,” said Carr spokesperson Kara Murray.

Ford/Maryland Matters)A federal judge gave Justice Department lawyers until noon Tuesday to confirm, in writing, the administration’s plans for implementing an executive order on birthright citizenship after the U.S. Supreme Court lifted nationwide injunctions on the order Friday.
Justice Department attorney Brad Rosenberg said at a hearing in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt, Maryland on Monday that the Trump administration does not plan to begin acting on the order — which would deny citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. if neither parent was a citizen — for another four weeks. That’s the grace period set in the Supreme Court’s Friday ruling.
But U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman was looking for more than verbal assurances.
“I want to know if the government thinks that it can start removing children from the United States who are subject to the terms of the executive order, and who are not plaintiffs or members of the plaintiff’s organization,” Boardman said.
She ordered Rosenberg to submit in writing, by noon Tuesday, the government’s view of what it can do under the executive order. She also gave Rosenberg until next Monday to respond to the motion by immigrant parents and soon-to-be parents to turn the case into a class action lawsuit — the reason for Tuesday’s hearing.
The Supreme Court ruled Friday that Boardman and judges in two other districts in the U.S. could only block the executive order against plaintiffs that brought the respective cases, but said the district judges did not have the authority to impose nationwide injunctions.
But the ruling, as well as a concurring and a dissenting opinion, all said “that courts may award injunctive
relief beyond the named parties when the case is brought as a class action.”
So attorneys for pregnant immigrants were back in court Monday, seeking to turn the case into a class action for “all children who have been born or will be born in the United States on or after February 19, 2025, who are designated by Executive Order 14,160 to be ineligible for birthright citizenship, and their parents.”
That class involves thousands of babies who have been born since Feb. 19, the day President Donald Trump’s executive order was scheduled to take effect, and thousands more who will be born while the case is decided, as well as their parents, the motion said.
A recent study by the Migration Policy Institute estimated that eliminating birthright citizenship could affect up to 250,000 babies a year.
The attorneys also asked Boardman to grant a preliminary injunction against Trump’s order immediately, to prevent any harm to their clients while the requst for class certification proceeded.
“Removal is not the only irreparable harm that we’re concerned about,” said William Powell, an attorney for the plaintiffs, during Monday’s hearing. “We’re obviously also concerned about other potential ways in which the order could be enforced to deprive newborns of potential rights.”
Potential members of the class are also documenting stress and anxiety, Powell said. He shared an anecdote about a plaintiff who is experiencing a more stressful and difficult pregnancy because she fears what will happen once her child is born.
“It is confusing to them exactly what these things mean,” Powell said. “We can’t really assure them the order is fully blocked, because it’s not.”
President Donald Trump issued the order on Jan. 20, his first day back in office. It claimed that citizenship does not automatically extend to everyone born in the U.S., excluding mothers who are here illegally or on a temporary visas unless the father has citizenship or is here with permanent legal resident status.
Rosenberg argued against class certification, which he said would be “prejudicial” to the government, and noted that the plaintiffs could have moved for class certification before Friday.
The case filed by CASA and the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project includes 15 women — some under pseudonyms because of their legal status — in nine states, including Maryland, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Washington. Some are in the U.S. without documentation, some are here on visas, many have asylum or other immigration applications pending in various stages.

(Julie O'Donoghue/Louisiana Illuminator)Slow revenue growth continues to pinch state budgets across the country, leading governors to propose spending cuts, hiring freezes and some tax increases.
In its spring survey of states, the National Association of State Budget Officers found that general fund spending will hold steady in fiscal 2026 as states expect limited revenue growth but increased costs.
Though most states are meeting or exceeding 2025 revenue projections, a growing number are downgrading their revenue expectations for the next fiscal year, Shelby Kerns, executive director of the national association, said in a news release.
“In a number of states, we’re seeing expenditure projections outpacing revenue growth, forcing policymakers to make hard choices in order to balance their budgets,” Kerns said.
States typically wrap up budget work by the end of June, with the next fiscal year beginning July 1. Kerns said the organization anticipates states may need to make mid-year budget adjustments depending on upcoming federal changes in tax policy and spending.
In recent years, many states have been flush with an influx of federal pandemic aid and strong tax revenues from a booming national economy. But with the end of pandemic aid, an uncertain economic future and deep cuts to state taxes, many lawmakers this year confronted major budget challenges in statehouses.
Just weeks after signing a budget that required deep spending cuts and increased taxes, Washington Democratic state Gov. Bob Ferguson told state agencies to prepare for even more belt tightening.
“We will very likely continue to face a challenging state budget environment in the coming year and anticipate increasing caseloads and ongoing uncertainty in the economy and federal funding,” said a June 4 memo from the governor’s budget director to agency leaders, according to the Washington State Standard.
Still, many states continue to tout major levels of reserve funds.
The National Association of State Budget Officers found at least 30 states expect to maintain a rainy-day fund balance exceeding 10% of their general fund expenditures. This year, 29 states grew their reserve funds, with the majority of states expected to continue to grow their savings next fiscal year.
In Tennessee, general fund revenue growth is slowing, but state leaders were able to rely on $1.5 billion in unspent state funds and $700 million in interest earnings from federal pandemic funds, the Tennessee Lookout reported.

It’s between the people and the regime that has ruled them through fear, cruelty, and lies for over four decades.","The bombs have stopped—for now. After two weeks of missiles, threats, and the terrifying drumbeat of war, a ceasefire has arrived. Tel Aviv exhales. Washington strategizes. Tehran recalculates. 
But in Iran, the silence feels different. It isn’t peace. It’s a pause. And in that pause, another battle rages —quieter, older, far more consequential. Because Iran’s most dangerous war isn’t with Israel or the United States. It’s between the people and the regime that has ruled them through fear, cruelty, and lies for over four decades.
Every time Tehran fires missiles abroad, it’s also tightening the noose at home. While international cameras track explosions over airbases, Iran’s gallows work overtime. Protesters disappear. Students vanish. Women are dragged into courtrooms for removing a scarf. This regime thrives on crisis. It builds legitimacy on chaos. But that strategy is fraying. The Iranian people are done being afraid.
The movement inside Iran today is not a flash in the pan. It is not a hashtag moment. It is a generation that has risen, again and again, from the bloodied pavements of 1988 massacre of 30,000 political prisoners, from labor strikes, from underground classrooms and shuttered newspapers.
This is a citizenry refusing to kneel. They are not asking the world to save them. They are demanding that we stop strengthening the boot that crushes them.
Why does Tehran escalate abroad? Because it is desperate at home. This isn’t strength. It’s survival mode. And the regime knows its greatest threat doesn’t come from warplanes or sanctions —it comes from Iranians who no longer buy the lie.
In Tehran’s prisons sit poets, teachers, students, workers. They have no missiles. But they are more dangerous to the regime than any foreign power —because they carry a vision — a vision of a secular, democratic Iran. One without executions. One where women are free, where religion is a choice, not a weapon, and where leadership is earned, not inherited through violence. 
That vision is not vague. It has a framework. It has a leader. It has a name: the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI). Led by Maryam Rajavi, the NCRI offers more than protest —it offers policy. Her 10-point plan lays out a future secular democratic republic built on rule of law, gender equality, religious liberty, and peace.
It is not abstract. It is not exiled into irrelevance. It is organized, global, and growing. Inside Iran, it inspires courage. Abroad, it is gaining bipartisan support —from the U.S. House Resolution 166 to lawmakers in over 40 countries who know appeasement has failed.
This ceasefire will tempt many leaders to breathe easy, to return to familiar calculations: sanctions relief, backchannel deals, polite diplomacy with a government that kills children for chanting slogans. But history will not be kind to that strategy. If the world fails to act now, it risks turning this pause into a permission slip—for more executions, more repression, more lies.
So what can be done?  First, designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization across Europe. They are the regime’s mafia, both in Iran and abroad. Pretending they are a legitimate military force is a diplomatic fantasy.
Second, freeze the assets of regime elites and their families. There is no moral logic in letting torturers send their children to London prep schools while they hang teenagers in Mashhad.
Third, expose and dismantle the regime’s propaganda and influence networks in Western capitals. These aren’t think tanks—they are front groups that shield tyranny.
Finally, engage the alternative. The Iranian resistance has done the hard part: they’ve survived, organized, and laid out a democratic path forward. What they need now is recognition and solidarity —not weapons, not war. Just the truth, spoken clearly.
Regimes like Iran’s rely on one illusion: that they are eternal. But they are not.  They are loud, cruel, and brittle. And they fall —when the world stops looking away.
The Iranian people are already doing the hard work of history. The question is whether the rest of us will pretend this ceasefire is peace —or finally recognize that real peace only begins when dictatorships end.
Let us not mistake this moment for stability. Let us not waste the silence. Let us help turn this pause into a pivot—toward freedom, toward justice, toward an Iran reborn.

Antonio Felipe,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/01/connecticut-needs-to-be-more-affordable-lets-start-with-housing/,"The veto of HB5002 was a massive mistake, a setback for housing in Connecticut and a slap in the face to its hard-working families.","Connecticut did not meet the moment in 2025. Despite the outcry of our residents and the glaring reality of a housing and affordability crisis in our state, we didn’t do nearly enough to support our hard-working families.
This year, as co-chair of the state’s housing committee, I, along with many of mycolleagues, championed House Bill 5002. Ensuring access to quality housing is a foundational responsibility of the entire Connecticut legislature and yet I spent almost 12 hours debating House Republicans who were determined to sink the bill under false claims of eliminating local control.

Antonio Felipe
The bill passed both chambers after receiving strong public support from Gov. Ned Lamont. Then on June 23, the governor conceded and announced that he planned to veto the bill — even though he still stated support for most of the policies. In essence the governor capitulated to what he acknowledged was false information.
If that’s how decisions are made going forward our state is in deep trouble. A veto of this bill is a massive mistake, a setback for housing in Connecticut and a slap in the face to the hard working families and the most cost-burdened of us. I’d like to tell you why.
In 5002 we saw an opportunity for significant progress in housing, taking necessary steps while ensuring that local decisions were protected and local control was minimally impacted. One section of this bill simply requires that cities and towns submit affordable housing plans. The towns themselves create and submit these plans and zoning must only be changed if it is required to fit the plan that theysubmitted. 
Municipalities also have the opportunity to submit reasons why they cannot attain the goals set in their plan. We can use those reasons to help address the needs and barriers for local zoning.
This would allow towns to individually plan to meet these goals, maintaining local control over their plan on how to achieve more affordable housing. Another section called Work Live Ride is an optional program that incentivizes development near transportation hubs to ensure a vibrant workforce and that the current hardworking Connecticut residents can easily get where they need to go.
What are we doing about the actual building of affordable or multifamily housing in HB 5002?
There is over $100 million specifically prescribed for affordable housing projects, matching funds for our building trades to leverage their own capital to build housing, and a pilot program for housing authorities to buy properties and keep them affordable long term. 
There are fully optional partnerships with neighboring housing authorities for communities that struggle to build affordable housing., The bill would also grant the  ability to redevelop vacant commercial units, as of right, into much needed urban housing in downtowns and in areas closer to the services that many people living in our community need every day. Additionally we aimed to assist our most vulnerable residents with mobile showers and laundry for homeless persons, direct cash assistance for families eligible for Rental Assistance Program (R.A.P) Vouchers and make sure there are R.A.P vouchers available for families who have students in the Open Choice Program.
In 2025 we, the governor and the legislature, nibbled around the edges and were content with the status quo ruling the day under the guise of “fiscal responsibility.” I fully endorse smart fiscal policies aimed at improving our state’s financial position, lowering our debt, and protecting our taxpayers. What I don’t agree with is that we can’t pursue a more robust and forward thinking agenda that is fiscally responsible, while still acknowledging the moment that we are in and the residents who are struggling everyday with a rising cost of living.
We create these policies to build the resources necessary to invest in all people, especially our hard-working residents. What is the point of building a rainy day fund totaling $4.1 billion when a working family can’t find decent housing that fits their budget, or a young professional has no clear path towards owning a home?
House Bill 5002 was an opportunity to show hard-working families that we have their needs at heart and a veto by Governor Lamont ensured that once again we are missing the moment.
What was a large step in a progressive direction that hard-working families need us to move in became a false flag to anyone with hopes that Connecticut will begin to address the housing crisis we face. We are 46th in the United States in building permits per capita. We have the ninth highest cost of living. Our average rent inConnecticut is $2,071, the national average is $1,761 while our average apartment size is smaller than the national average.
We cannot continue to follow this administration’s current blueprint to build a rainy day fund by any means necessary while not acknowledging that for many families in our state the rain started years ago. 
We must address the many challenges that families and hard-working residents face as the cost of living soars. Connecticut is too expensive, too constrained and too segregated, but when faced with the opportunity to take a progressive step, we missed the moment.

Multiple firefighters shot, killed while responding to North Idaho brush fire; suspect found dead

Wess Roley, 20, was identified by local coroner officials, Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris said at a Monday afternoon news conference.
The suspect was found dead with a firearm nearby on Canfield Mountain, officials said Sunday. He appeared to have killed himself, Norris said Monday.
Officials believe he started a brush fire near a popular recreation area, and then fatally shot two firefighters and injured another.
The firefighters killed were identified on Monday as Battalion Chief John Morrison, of the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department, and Battalion Chief Frank Harwood, of Kootenai County Fire and Rescue, the Coeur d’Alene Press reported. The injured firefighter is Dave Tysdal, who works for the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department, the local newspaper reported.
The fire’s cause remains under investigation. But officials believe Roley started the fire with a flint starter, Norris said.
A shotgun was used, but the crime scene is still being processed, the sheriff said.
The seriously injured firefighter was released from surgery later Sunday. He was stable, Norris said Sunday. No more specific information about his condition has been released.
The firefighters Roley allegedly shot were the ones who spoke with him when they arrived on scene, Norris said.
Officials found no criminal record for suspect. Investigation ongoing.
Officials believe Roley had lived in California, Arizona and Idaho, Norris said. Officials could not find a criminal record for Roley, but Norris said local law enforcement had five minor interactions with him — including for trespassing and welfare checks.
“We know that he was a transient here,” Norris said. “We knew that he lived here for the better part of 2024. But as far as when he got here, why he was here, why he chose this place — I don’t know. He has relatives in the Priest River area. But I don’t know why he chose that. We don’t find any nexus to anything else. Maybe we’ll find more once we do an inventory of the vehicle.”
Norris said Roley appeared to be living in his vehicle and wanted to be a firefighter at some point. But he stressed information is preliminary and subject to change.
Roley grew up in an arborist family that climbed trees, and law enforcement received reports he was shooting at first responders from a tree, Norris said.
The crime scene remains active. Law enforcement have not yet inventoried Roley’s vehicle, which deputies pushed down a mountain embankment to make it harder for him to flee, Norris said.

Fire grows to 26 acres — but structures aren’t threatened
The brush fire, named the Nettleton Gulch Fire, grew to 26 acres by Monday afternoon, the Idaho Department of Lands reported. The active shooter situation Sunday delayed firefighting efforts.
Crews on Monday night had nearly completed hand lines around the fire, the department reported.
“The fire is burning through steep terrain in timber fuels,” the Department of Lands said in a press release. “Safety remains a top priority for the crews, with an abundance of snags on site, as well as the possibility of rolling logs and falling rocks.”
The department reminded the public that it’s dangerous to fly drones while emergency personnel are responding to a wildfire.
“A Temporary Flight Restriction is in place and remains in effect over the Canfield Mountain area,” the press release said. “Unauthorized drone and aircraft pose a serious hazard to firefighting and law enforcement activities. If you fly, we can’t. For firefighter safety we also ask the public to remain clear of the Canfield Mountain area.”

The Idaho Department of Lands is managing the fire, and the agency has the resources currently needed to respond, Kootenai County Emergency Management said in a Facebook post Monday morning.
“Should additional support be required, requests will be made through the appropriate channels,” the office said. “We kindly ask that individuals and organizations refrain from reaching out with resource offers, as their team is receiving a high volume of inquiries.”
Idaho governor orders flags at half-staff
Earlier Monday, Idaho Gov. Brad Little ordered flags be lowered to half-staff.

The order remains in place until the day after the memorial service, which has not been scheduled.
In a statement, Little said the entire state is grieving after the ambush.
“All our public safety officers, especially our firefighters, bravely confront danger on a daily basis but we have never seen a heinous act of violence like this on our firefighters before,” the governor said. “This is not Idaho. This indescribable loss is felt deeply by all those in the firefighting community and beyond.”
Little asked the public to join him and the state’s first lady Teresa Little in praying for the victims and their loved ones.
In a statement, Idaho Fire Chiefs Association President Kirk Carpenter said Idaho’s first responder families are devastated.
“Our thoughts and prayers are with our fire families in North Idaho. There are no words — please know that we are here for you, now and always,” he said.
In D.C., Idaho’s U.S. senators ask for prayers
Early Monday, as the U.S. Senate worked to advance a massive spending and tax cut bill, both of Idaho’s U.S. senators led a moment of silence to honor the victims of Sunday’s attack.
U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, asked fellow senators to send prayers for the full recovery of the injured firefighter who was released from surgery, along with the victims who died, their families “and the entire North Idaho community grieving this heinous act.”
U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, called the attack despicable and urged prayers.
“This evil attack on the people who dedicate their lives to protecting and serving our communities is despicable, and it’s not Idaho,” Risch said.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)A federal judge gave Justice Department lawyers until noon Tuesday to confirm, in writing, the administration’s plans for implementing an executive order on birthright citizenship after the U.S. Supreme Court lifted nationwide injunctions on the order Friday.
Justice Department attorney Brad Rosenberg said at a hearing in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt on Monday that the Trump administration does not plan to begin acting on the order — which would deny citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. if neither parent was a citizen — for another four weeks. That’s the grace period set in the Supreme Court’s Friday ruling.
But U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman was looking for more than verbal assurances.
“I want to know if the government thinks that it can start removing children from the United States who are subject to the terms of the executive order, and who are not plaintiffs or members of the plaintiff’s organization,” Boardman said.
She ordered Rosenberg to submit in writing, by noon Tuesday, the government’s view of what it can do under the executive order. She also gave Rosenberg until next Monday to respond to the motion by immigrant parents and soon-to-be parents to turn the case into a class action lawsuit — the reason for Tuesday’s hearing.
The Supreme Court ruled Friday that Boardman and judges in two other districts in the U.S. could only block the executive order against plaintiffs that brought the respective cases, but said the district judges did not have the authority to impose nationwide injunctions.
Supreme Court limits injunctions, allows Trump to act on birthright citizenship ban

But the ruling, as well as a concurring and a dissenting opinion, all said “that courts may award injunctive
relief beyond the named parties when the case is brought as a class action.”
So attorneys for pregnant immigrants were back in court Monday, seeking to turn the case into a class action for “all children who have been born or will be born in the United States on or after February 19, 2025, who are designated by Executive Order 14,160 to be ineligible for birthright citizenship, and their parents.”
That class involves thousands of babies who have been born since Feb. 19, the day President Donald Trump’s executive order was scheduled to take effect, and thousands more who will be born while the case is decided, as well as their parents, the motion said.
A recent study by the Migration Policy Institute estimated that eliminating birthright citizenship could affect up to 250,000 babies a year.
The attorneys also asked Boardman to grant a preliminary injunction against Trump’s order immediately, to prevent any harm to their clients while the requst for class certification proceeded.
“Removal is not the only irreparable harm that we’re concerned about,” said William Powell, an attorney for the plaintiffs, during Monday’s hearing. “We’re obviously also concerned about other potential ways in which the order could be enforced to deprive newborns of potential rights.”
Potential members of the class are also documenting stress and anxiety, Powell said. He shared an anecdote about a plaintiff who is experiencing a more stressful and difficult pregnancy because she fears what will happen once her child is born.
“It is confusing to them exactly what these things mean,” Powell said. “We can’t really assure them the order is fully blocked, because it’s not.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
President Donald Trump issued the order on Jan. 20, his first day back in office. It claimed that citizenship does not automatically extend to everyone born in the U.S., excluding mothers who are here illegally or on a temporary visas unless the father has citizenship or is here with permanent legal resident status.
Rosenberg argued against class certification, which he said would be “prejudicial” to the government, and noted that the plaintiffs could have moved for class certification before Friday.

The law, passed by the Nebraska Legislature and signed by Gov. Jim Pillen in 2024, takes effect Tuesday.
It targets OHA, which oversees more than 2,500 dwellings and 5,000 housing vouchers for low-income residents, but came with no additional funding, the agency’s leadership noted in a statement Monday about the lawsuit filed June 27 in Douglas County District Court.

OHA asserts that the new provision — which it estimates could cost nearly $1 million annually — is unconstitutional and preempted by federal law.
Joanie Balk, OHA chief executive, said her agency is funded through federal sources that explicitly bar the use of program funds to pay legal expenses on behalf of tenants. 
She said the unfunded mandate puts the OHA “at direct odds” with federal regulations and “threatens the integrity” of its programs, as the agency is required by federal law to take action against tenants who break its rules or are engaged in criminal activity. 
 ‘Last resort’

The lawsuit says OHA would effectively be unable to bring actions to evict tenants who fail to pay rent, commit crimes or otherwise violate terms of their lease agreement.
“Our organization is fully supportive of tenants having access to legal representation and in fact they already do through the Tenant Assistance Project (TAP),” said Balk. 
TAP is run by volunteer attorneys and law students who offer free services for people who appear for eviction hearings at Douglas and Lancaster County courthouses.

Balk said the lawsuit was “a last resort” made after repeated unsuccessful attempts to resolve the issue with state lawmakers and after attempts to identify resources to cover the required cost of attorney fees. 
State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North Omaha, a frequent critic of OHA, said he wasn’t surprised by the lawsuit and said the agency was “run by horrible people.” He challenged the assertion that OHA leaders tried to resolve the issue, saying he hasn’t talked to an OHA manager since December.
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha originally introduced the provision, amended into the broader Legislative Bill 840, requiring the housing authority to cover court-appointed counsel for Omahans it wants to evict. 
 Levels playing field 

Legal Aid of Nebraska applauded the new state law that guarantees legal representation for certain tenants facing eviction or lease termination. The law also covers tenants living in public housing units operated in Omaha by the Douglas County Housing Authority.

“With housing authorities regularly represented by attorneys, ensuring tenants have legal representation helps level the playing field,” Scott Mertz, director of Legal Aid’s Justice Project, said in a statement. “For many tenants, having a lawyer can mean the difference between staying housed or being evicted.
The OHA lawsuit included a statement from HUD that said the agency could not use public housing funds to pay for the court-appointed legal fees as called for in the new law. 
Earlier this year, the Legislature passed — but Pillen successfully vetoed — a McKinney-led attempt to seek potential remedies to a persistent bed bug infestation in OHA towers occupied by low-income residents.
In January, a class-action lawsuit was filed in Douglas County District Court seeking relief from the bed bugs. Former Omaha State Sen. Justin Wayne is on the legal team representing OHA plaintiffs in that lawsuit.

,California,2025-07-01 02:20:33+00:00,CalMatters,One of the biggest obstacles to building new CA housing has now vanished,Ben Christopher,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/2025/06/ceqa-urban-development-infill-budget/,"In a legislative battle a decade in the making, lawmakers just exempted infill urban development from the California Environmental Quality Act. That’s a big deal.","In summary
In a legislative battle a decade in the making, lawmakers just exempted infill urban development from the California Environmental Quality Act. That’s a big deal.


A decade-spanning political battle between housing developers and defenders of California’s preeminent environmental law likely came to an end this afternoon with only a smattering of “no” votes. 
The forces of housing won. 
With the passage of a state budget-related housing bill, the California Environmental Quality Act will be a non-issue for a decisive swath of urban residential development in California. 
In practice, that means most new apartment buildings will no longer face the open threat of environmental litigation. 
It also means most urban developers will no longer have to study, predict and mitigate the ways that new housing might affect local traffic, air pollution, flora and fauna, noise levels, groundwater quality and objects of historic or archeological significance.
And it means that when housing advocates argue that the state isn’t doing enough to build more homes amid crippling rents and stratospheric prices, they won’t — with a few exceptions — have CEQA to blame anymore.
“Saying ‘no’ to housing in my community will no longer be state sanctioned,” said Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, an Oakland Democrat who introduced the CEQA law as a separate bill in March. “This isn’t going to solve all of our housing problems in the state, but it is going to remove the single biggest impediment to building environmentally friendly housing.”
Unlike most environmental laws, which explicitly mandate, monitor or ban certain environmental behavior, CEQA is just a public disclosure requirement. The 54-year-old statute requires state and local governments to study and publicize the likely environmental impact of any decisions they make. That includes the permitting of new housing. 
But for years, the building industry and “Yes in my backyard” activists have identified the law as a key culprit behind California’s housing shortage. That’s because the law allows any individual or group to sue if they argue that a required environmental study isn’t accurate, expansive or detailed enough. Such lawsuits — and even the mere threat of them —add a degree of delay, cost and uncertainty that make it impossible for the state to build its way to affordability, CEQA’s critics argue.
With today’s vote, the Legislature will be putting that argument to the test. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who spent much of last week cajoling the Legislature to pass the bill as part of his budget package, is all but certain to sign it.
Now the question is whether this monumental political and policy shift will actually result in more homes getting built in California’s cities.
Many of the bill’s backers are optimistic.
“I think when we look back on what hopefully is California finally beginning to confront this housing crisis, this year — 2025 — and this bill will be viewed as a turning point,” said Matt Haney, a Democrat who represents San Francisco in the Assembly where he chairs the housing committee.
On paper, the new law, unlike most that deal with housing approvals and environmental regulation, is actually pretty straightforward.
Urban “infill” housing developments — housing built in and around existing development — are no longer subject to CEQA.
There are some exceptions and qualifiers, but development boosters say they are relatively minor. 
The exemption is“the most significant change to the California Environmental Quality Act’s effect on housing production since CEQA was passed,” said Louis Mirante, a lobbyist for the Bay Area Council, a business coalition that regularly pushes for legislation that makes it easier to build.
The bill is limited to projects under 20 acres, but that cap is only relevant to the biggest multi-block-spanning mega developments.
A certain level of density is required, but it really only precludes using the policy for single-family home construction.
Before any project can move forward, any affiliated tribal government will have to be notified first, but the consultation is put on a short timeline.
In order to qualify for the exemption, a proposed project must also be consistent with local zoning, the regulations that determine what types of buildings can be constructed where. But thanks to another CEQA-chopping bill authored by San Francisco Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener that exempts many changes to zoning rules from CEQA and which is also packed into the budget, that appears less likely to be a real constraint. 
To buy off the ferocious opposition of the State Building and Construction Trades Council of California, a construction union umbrella group, the bill also includes some higher wage requirements. 
But those rules are not likely to apply to most potential residential development projects. “The lion share of housing being built” in California will no longer be governed by CEQA, said Mark Rhoades, a planning and development consultant in Berkeley.
Take a massive five-story apartment building spanning a full city block, said Bill Fulton, a longtime urban planner and professor at UC San Diego. 
“You don’t have to worry about labor and you don’t have to worry about CEQA? That’s a big deal,” he said.
CEQA seachange
What a difference nine years make.
Consider how things went back in 2016 when then-Gov. Jerry Brown tried to ram a CEQA fix for California’s rising housing costs through the state budget process. Brown’s big idea was to “streamline” the housing approval process, allowing developers to make an end-run around the California Environmental Quality Act, so long as they set aside a certain share of units for lower-income residents.
A coalition of construction labor unions, environmental interests and local government groups torched the idea. The proposal didn’t even get a vote.
Nearly a decade later, once again a Democratic governor opted to stuff a CEQA-trimming policy package through the budget process in the name of cheaper housing. 
The measure passed overwhelmingly in both the Senate and Assembly — and this time it didn’t even include an affordability requirement.

 Buffy Wicks
 Democrat, State Assembly, District 14 (Oakland)



Wicks’ proposal is somewhat narrower than the 2016 version, exempting only infill. New suburban-style subdivisions carved from farmland or undeveloped sagebrush will not qualify. 
That infill focus has made it easier for the Democratic-controlled Legislature to swallow such a significant scaling back of California’s signature environmental law. Promoting denser urban development generally means using less land, constructing new housing that uses less energy and setting up new residents to do a lot less driving. 
“When you are building housing in an existing community, that is environmentally beneficial, it is climate friendly, that is not something that should be subjected to potentially endless CEQA challenges and lawsuits,” Wiener said on the Senate floor on Monday just prior to the vote, when the measure passed 28 to 5.
Even so, Wicks’ proposal always looked like a long shot. 
Since Brown’s failed gambit, lawmakers have managed to pass a raft of bills giving housing developers an escape route around CEQA. But those laws have always contained a trade-off. Developers get to skip CEQA, but in exchange they have to pay state-set “prevailing wages” (which typically work out to union-level pay), hire union workers outright, set aside a certain share of units for lower income residents, or some combination of the three. 
These conditions were born of political necessity. A CEQA lawsuit — or even the suggestion of one — makes for a powerful negotiating tool. Organized labor groups, mostly especially the building trades council, have not been keen to give up that leverage without getting something in return.
As housing developers proved less willing to use the new streamlining laws than those bills’ sponsors and supporters had hoped, many pro-building advocates, academics and commentators began calling for environmental streamlining with no strings attached.
Wicks answered that call earlier this year. Under her proposal, infill developers would be allowed to ignore CEQA, full stop. That marked a major break from recent legislative precedent, and one that seemed a stretch, even with so many Democratic lawmakers carting around copies of Abundance.
The deal that almost wasn’t
Just last week, Wicks’ proposal seemed on the verge of collapse.
A version of the bill introduced last week included what amounted to a minor wage hike for the lowest paid construction workers, who are virtually all non-union. While the state’s carpenters’ union supported it, the trades council emphatically did not — with one of the groups’ associated lobbyists likening it to Jim Crow. The trades objected so strenuously — arguing that it set dangerous precedent and undercut apprenticeship programs — that lawmakers removed the proposed wage change. 
Instead, developers working on projects that are entirely designated to be affordable would now be required to pay prevailing wages in order to take advantage of the new law. 
Developers of any projects over 85 feet tall would be required to hire a certain share of union workers. There are added restrictions for construction in San Francisco specifically.
By the standards of prior housing streamlining bills, those are relatively modest concessions. Most developments over 85 feet use concrete and steel frame construction, which require a higher skilled labor force that is often unionized anyway.
Most entirely income-restricted housing projects make use of public subsidies that require paying union-level wages.
“Affordable housing is forced to play by different rules because the state has decided that if you are receiving public funds a certain wage should be attached to it,” said Ray Pearl, executive director of the California Housing Consortium, which advocates for affordable housing construction. The addition of a prevailing wage requirement for affordable housing “is a head scratcher,” he said. “But it really is reaffirming existing policy.”
That leaves every other type of housing project: Market rate and mixed-income apartment buildings under seven-or-so stories. For that type of construction, which defines the bulk of urban development in California, CEQA is soon to be entirely optional — no string attached.
That this is the new trades-endorsed deal has been met with a perplexed kind of glee from some corners of the “yes in my backyard” movement. The new version of the bill “is now *even better,*” UC Davis law professor Chris Elmendorf marveled on Twitter.
Will it matter?
What will urban housing construction look like in California without CEQA?
There are no shortage of reasons not to build housing in California. Labor costs, even without regulatory requirements, are high. So are interest rates. Tariffs and aggressive immigration enforcement are more recent sources of uncertainty. Developers are always happy to complain about slow permitting, high local fees and inflexible building codes. 
“It’s not the CEQA costs that are holding up housing,” said Rhoades, the Berkeley consultant. 
“I don’t think this is going to make more development happen,” he said of the budget bill. “It’s going to make development that is already happening a little easier.”
Critics of the law can and do point to specific projects — housing for students, housing near public transit, affordable housing built upon city-owned parking lots — that have been sued in the name of the environment as examples of “CEQA abuse.”
Under the new laws, such litigation will largely go away in California’s cities.
“The one thing we do know is that CEQA is a time suck,” said Ben Metcalf, managing director of UC Berkeley’s Terner Center for Housing Innovation and the former head of the state’s housing agency under Brown. “If you can just get out of that six months, nine months, twelfth months of delay, that takes a whole cohort of projects and gets them in the ground sooner. In a state that’s facing a housing crisis, that’s not for nothing.”
But the more important consequence of CEQA, many of its critics regularly argue, has been its chilling effect. 
How many new units of housing would have been built, but for concerns that they might become ensnared in environmental litigation? How many developers, anticipating a possible legal challenge, have preemptively pared back their plans? How many financiers of housing projects pulled out or demanded higher interest rates over such concerns?

The move, fast-tracked under pressure from Gov. Gavin Newsom, sparked fierce pushback from environmental, community and labor groups.","In summary
Major changes to the California Environmental Quality Act include an exemption for high-tech industrial plants and other projects. The move, fast-tracked under pressure from Gov. Gavin Newsom, sparked fierce pushback from environmental, community and labor groups.



California lawmakers today approved one of the most substantial rollbacks of the state’s signature environmental review law in decades, including a controversial exemption that would allow high-tech manufacturing plants to be built in industrial zones with no environmental review.
The changes to the California Environmental Quality Act were embedded in a last-minute budget bill that sailed through the Senate and the Assembly. The new law exempts nine types of projects from environmental reviews: child care centers, health clinics, food banks, farmworker housing, broadband, wildfire prevention, water infrastructure, public parks or trails and, notably, advanced manufacturing.
Aiming to streamline and lower the cost of construction in California, the new law also restricts legal challenges under CEQA by narrowing which documents courts can consider. It also allows limited environmental reviews of projects that don’ t have an array of impacts. 
The changes in the 54-year-old law were forced by Gov. Gavin Newsom, who told legislators last week that he would not approve the state’s $321 billion spending plan without them. A provision in the budget act approved last week stated the spending plan “shall be inoperative and repealed” if changes to the state’s environmental review process were not final by midnight tonight.
Newsom signed the bill tonight, after it passed with overwhelming votes in the Senate and Assembly.
For decades, business and building groups have railed against what they call “CEQA abuse,” saying the environmental reviews drag out projects for years. But supporters say the law requires developers and others to examine and correct an array of environmental impacts, from air pollution to water use to traffic.
Recently, with climate change front and center, some liberals have joined calls for overhauling the environmental law, arguing that California must build faster and at scale to decarbonize its electric grid and construct housing and transportation systems.
The new exemption for “advanced manufacturing” facilities in areas already zoned for industrial use — including plants that build semiconductors and nanotech — drew some of the fiercest criticism. State law defines the category as processes that improve or create new materials, products or technologies. 
The changes were met with vehement opposition from more than 100 environmental and community groups, which said industrial plants will be more easily built in low-income communities. They also say the exemptions will advantage developers by limiting public oversight and could create legal confusion.
“This bill is the worst anti-environmental bill in California in recent memory,” a coalition of opponents, including the California Environmental Justice Alliance and the Western Center on Law and Poverty, wrote in a letter to Newsom and legislators.
“This law would not harm all California communities equally. This budget deal is an attack on lower-income communities of color that consistently get sited for harmful industrial projects.”ASHA SHARMA, LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY
At the over three-hour hearing preceding the vote, dozens of members of the public spoke in opposition, with some holding signs saying “When CEQA is silenced, polluters speak louder.”  
Asha Sharma, state policy manager with Leadership Council for Justice and Accountability, called the changes “a back-room, last-minute deal” that made the state budget “dependent on gutting environmental review for resource-intensive and polluting industrial projects.”
“This law would not harm all California communities equally,” Sharma said. “This budget deal is an attack on lower-income communities of color that consistently get sited for harmful industrial projects.”
The Assembly approved the bill with a 50 to 3 vote, and the Senate, 33 to 1. 
Assemblymember Al Muratsuchi, a Democrat from Torrance who voted against it, raised concerns on the Assembly floor about the bill’s exemption for advanced manufacturing plants, citing the environmental opposition and urged the measure to be revisited. 
The lone senator to stand against it was Republican Roger Niello from Roseville. However, several who voiced concerns about the bill in an earlier hearing today did not vote, including Democratic state Sen. Catherine Blakespear from Encinitas and Sen. John Laird from Santa Cruz. 
Newsom said his budget maneuver was necessary and thanked the leaders of the two houses of the Legislature.
“This was too important to play chance. It was too urgent, too important to allow the (legislative) process to unfold as it has for the last generation, invariably falling prey to all kinds of pratfall,” Newsom said.
The governor’s public comments were limited as the fierce debate broke out in recent days. But his press office account posted on social media last week that “the Legislature has a chance to deliver the most significant housing and infrastructure reforms in decades.”
“This is our moment to build the California Dream for a new generation,” his office said. “We’re done with the roadblocks and delays — let’s get this done.”
“This is a bill that, literally, will help us get more housing, more childcare centers, more health centers, more food banks, and bring clean advanced manufacturing to California.”STATE SEN. SCOTT WIENER
A major proponent of the exemptions, State Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco said in an interview with CalMatters today that criticisms by environmentalists were  “extreme, unfounded, melodramatic statements.” 
“This is a bill that, literally, will help us get more housing, more childcare centers, more health centers, more food banks, and bring clean advanced manufacturing to California,” Wiener said. “And to suggest that that kind of bill is bad for the environment — or the worst environmental bill in decades — or whatever it is they said, that’s just over the top.”
Wiener said the changes exempt manufacturing projects only on land that is already zoned as industrial. The goal is to make it easier for high-tech industries to build, with Wiener arguing that California risks losing out on major private-sector investment because it’s too costly and difficult to build in the state. 
“The environmental movement needs to ask itself: Why is it that CEQA keeps getting used to stymie climate action, whether it’s transit-oriented development or bike lanes or public transportation or phasing out oil?” Wiener said.
Several housing advocacy and business groups voiced support for the law today.  
Alex Torres, speaking on behalf of housing groups, the tech trade association Chamber of Progress, the Bay Area Council and others, said exempting advanced manufacturing from environmental review will help “the Bay Area’s competitiveness” and “shift some manufacturing opportunities to the Bay Area.” 
Several other manufacturing groups declined to comment to CalMatters about the law changes or did not respond to inquiries. 
‘Shortcutting’ legislative process
The debate today in the committee hearing included a testy exchange between senators about whether Newsom was forcing their hand. 
“We have a situation here where the executive branch is telling the Legislative branch that if it doesn’t pass this trailer bill, that the budget itself will be null and void. I have to say, that profoundly disturbs and offends me,” state Sen. Roger Niello, a Republican from Roseville, said at today’s hearing. 
Wiener fired back that all aspects of the budget and trailer bills were a three-party agreement. “We don’t have a dictatorship,” he said. 
“I wasn’t part of that three-party agreement,” Niello countered. 
Environmental and community groups also questioned the use of the budget to shortcut the legislative process, limiting public and legislative input.
“If the only way you can change state law is to keep it out of the public eye as long as possible, and condition passage of the state budget on the proposed changes, does that not show that its backers know the public wouldn’t support it if they knew the truth?” the coalition of opponents wrote to Newsom and legislators.
California lawmakers enacted CEQA in 1970 amid a rising tide of environmental awareness. It had broad bipartisan support: Gov. Ronald Reagan signed it into law, and President Richard Nixon approved its federal counterpart the same year. At the time, environmental concerns were mostly local — unchecked development, polluted waterways, pesticide use and the loss of open space.
Two years ago, in another effort to use the state budget process as leverage, Newsom proposed a series of last-minute changes to the law. That move was rejected by lawmakers.
But after years of failed attempts to rewrite the law, Democrats have begun to rally around a new message: The political conversation among Democrats in Sacramento, and across the U.S., has shifted following last year’s presidential election, with growing consensus that removing regulatory barriers is a top priority.
Still, just hours before their vote, lawmakers were grappling with how exactly the bill would affect communities on the frontlines of manufacturing, with Wiener fielding most of the questions. 
State Sen. Caroline Menjivar, a Democrat from Van Nuys, asked about the definition of “advanced manufacturing.” Laird, a Democrat from Santa Cruz, asked whether it included nuclear materials. Wiener said it did not. 
“It is a horrible day when a senator even has to ask if an exemption from environmental review includes nuclear manufacturing,” said Sharma, of the justice and accountability organization.
At the earlier committee hearing, State Sen. María Elena Durazo, a Democrat from Los Angeles, cited the massive cleanup of lead-contaminated soil around the battery recycling facility Exide Technologies in Vernon as a warning of the risk. 
“I don’t believe anyone here thinks that we use CEQA in any way other than to protect ourselves. The toxins…can leach into neighborhoods and devastate full communities.”RAQUEL MASON, CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ALLIANCE
Raquel Mason, senior legislative manager with the California Environmental Justice Alliance, told senators that there have been 23 Superfund sites in Santa Clara County — in the heart of Silicon Valley, and several are related to semiconductor manufacturing. 
“I don’t believe anyone here thinks that we use CEQA in any way other than to protect ourselves,” Mason said. “The toxins don’t just stay in the industrial zone facility. They can leach into neighborhoods and devastate full communities.”
Major labor group opposed to the CEQA changes
Samuel Appel, policy director at the United Auto Workers in the Western United States, which represents 100,000 workers in California, said the exemption for advanced manufacturing was especially alarming because of California’s position as a leader in the tech industry. 
“We’re concerned not only about toxic work sites that our members will be working at and organizing in. We’re concerned about the toxic communities that we’d be living in,” Appel said. “We are organizing and work in these facilities every day — at Tesla, in semiconductor facilities and in lithium and the lithium extraction industry and in aerospace. This is a giveaway for corporations, and city and local control is not enough to protect us or our communities.” 
A new law signed by President Joe Biden in 2022 offers $280 billion in federal initiative aimed at boosting U.S. innovation and manufacturing in strategic technologies, especially semiconductors. The law allocates ubsidies and tax credits to incentivize companies to manufacture chips in the United States, rather than overseas.
Semiconductors are the tiny processors that power everything from smartphones and electric vehicles to fighter jets and satellites — and demand for them is growing. The pandemic exposed major vulnerabilities in global supply chains, spurring bipartisan momentum to reinvigorate chip production.
Arizona, Texas and Ohio have landed many new chip fabrication plants, in part because of lower costs and fewer regulatory hurdles. That’s why some lawmakers, including Wiener say environmental streamlining is needed if California wants to attract a significant share of manufacturing dollars.
“These are jobs of the future, there’s going to be more and more of these jobs, and I want them to be in California,” Wiener told CalMatters. “We do so much of the innovation here and the creation of this technology. I want us to benefit from the technology in terms of growth and job creation here and so, you know, I think this is a reasonable bill. 
The measures lets certain projects skip a full environmental review if they just barely miss qualifying for an exemption — for example, if they meet every requirement except one. In those cases, the review would only look at the environmental impact of that one issue, instead of analyzing the whole project. Critics say it’s confusing and could weaken protections by letting potentially harmful projects avoid deeper scrutiny.
“We find the near-miss provisions to be extremely legally confusing,” said Matthew Baker, policy director at the Planning and Conservation League. “It would take a lot, probably, for the courts to sort out. We simply don’t really understand how it would work.”
Under CEQA, lawsuits challenging a project require the agency to provide a full record — including internal emails and staff notes — but the changes exclude those internal communications from the record, except for projects involving distribution centers or oil and gas infrastructure. Critics said that will make it harder to challenge potentially harmful projects.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/032311_Semiconductor_GETTY_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-30 22:59:05.824575

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)Five and a half weeks after a fire ravaged the Matunuck Oyster Bar, the popular South Kingstown restaurant reopened Monday thanks to a revision of Rhode Island’s outdoor dining law.  
Gov. Dan McKee signed legislation amending the state’s “Take It Outside” law at a ceremony under a tent diagonally across Succotash Road from the damaged restaurant. Tables topped with flowers and chairs were arranged on a wooden floor in the tented area where al fresco dining can take place this summer in what was the restaurant’s valet parking lot. Food is prepared in a mobile kitchen trailer.
The legislation sponsored by South Kingstown Democrats, Rep. Carol Hagan McEntee and Sen. V. Susan Sosnowski was approved unanimously by both chambers of the General Assembly on June 12, a week after they were introduced. The revised law allows restaurants damaged by fire or flood to offer temporary outdoor dining for up to 18 months, as long as they receive approval from municipal officials and meet health and safety regulations. 
At the time of the May 20 fire, the Matunuck Oyster Bar employed about 300 workers. The restaurant can keep roughly 50 restaurant employees working this summer because of the revised law, officials said. The restaurant will be open daily and offer takeout service in addition to dining under the tent.
“Rhode Island may be small, but we always rally around our own,” McKee said in a statement. “I want to thank our state and local leaders who acted quickly to make this possible and to everyone who rallied around a beloved local business when it needed it the most.” 
A GoFundMe page has raised over $260,000 to help the restaurant rebuild and help employees
“The fire made me realize more than ever the importance of community,” Perry Raso, the restaurant’s owner, said during Monday’s speaking program.
The Rhode Island Office of the State Fire Marshal is still investigating the cause of the fire but preliminary findings suggested the blaze was likely accidental in nature.

More investment in renewables will help lower Alaska's high energy costs, but the budget bill that Congress is debating would reduce renewable investments. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaskans pay nearly the highest percentage of their household incomes on energy of any state, and federal policy changes proposed in the budget reconciliation bill currently being debated in the U.S. Senate would make the problem worse, according to a report by the University of Washington’s Center for Environmental Health Equity and three Alaska organizations.
The report found that Alaska’s energy burden — the percentage of household income that is spent on energy — is the nation’s second highest, at 4.3% compared to a national average of 2.7%. Maine has the highest average energy cost burden, at 4.5%, according to the report’s authors.
The disparities between cost burdens in urban and rural Alaska are stark, the report said. Outside of urban areas like Anchorage and the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, where the median costs amount to 2.3% of household income, the cost burden in rural Alaska is considered severe, the report found.
In Southwest Alaska, the residents spend an average of 12% of their household income on energy. In northern Alaska, the burden is 8.3%, according to the report, titled “Energy Burden in Alaska: Understanding Energy Burden for Alaska Communities and Charting a Path Forward.”
Along with UW’s Center for Environmental Health Equity, other organizations writing the report were Cook Inletkeeper, the Alaska Public Interest Research Group and Native Movement.
In written statements, representatives of the Alaska organizations said provisions in the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” would further burden state residents, especially in rural areas.
“This report contains very timely information,” said Ben Boettger, energy policy analyst for Cook Inletkeeper. “The U.S. Senate is considering legislation that would weaken and then eliminate energy tax credits — namely the Investment Tax Credit and the Production Tax Credit, threatened by the ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ — that until recently weren’t available to the cooperative and municipal utilities that serve most rural Alaskans. We hope Alaska’s senators will bear in mind these extreme energy disparities as they consider where they stand in upcoming debates and votes on tax credit changes.”
The report makes a series of policy recommendations, but the proposals in the bill would make changes in the opposite direction.
The report recommends increased investment in renewable energy projects, notably in the highest-cost areas of rural Alaska. “Long term, bringing on community-scale renewable energy, especially for communities dependent on fly-in and barge-in diesel is the best and most accessible way to reduce energy burdens and support thriving communities,” the report said.
But the bill proposes to do the opposite by ending tax credits for clean energy projects and imposing new taxes on wind and solar projects. And even Elon Musk, once a close Trump adviser, has criticized those elements of the bill.
Already, more than $14 billion in clean energy projects have been eliminated this year because of Trump administration policies, according to one new analysis.
The Alaska report recommends expanding the weatherization program that helps homeowners achieve energy efficiency. Outside of the bill, the Trump administration is also seeking to eliminate the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP.
Other recommendations of the Alaska report focus on state policy. Among the steps that it said should be taken at the state level is an expansion of Alaska’s Power Equalization Program, which subsidizes rural electricity. Other recommended state-level policies include full funding of the Alaska Renewable Energy Fund and more administrative support for the state’s new Green Bank, the report said.
If tax credits for clean energy are eliminated, consumers across the nation will face higher costs, according to a new report from one national organization.
The Clean Energy Buyers Association, a Washington, D.C.-based industry group, calculated costs of the credit elimination in 28 states, including Alaska.
For Alaska, the end to the tax credits will mean 600 fewer jobs, an average $170-per-household loss in income, a 0.8% increase in household electricity prices, a 0.9% increase in business electricity prices, a 2.5% increase in household natural gas prices and a 4.3% increase in businesses’ natural gas prices, according to the organization’s analysis.
It would also cause an overall $50 million decrease in state gross domestic product. Alaska’s gross domestic product growth rate currently ranks second-to-last among the U.S. states.

On Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration may proceed with the implementation of his order in more than half of U.S. states.
Anchorage immigration attorney Margaret Stock noted over the weekend that when it comes to Alaska and Hawaii, the federal government would have to overcome special, state-specific laws if it wants to cancel birthright citizenship.
For Alaska, a federal law passed in 1952 states specifically that “A person born in Alaska on or after March 30, 1867, … is a citizen of the United States at birth.”
The same law, elsewhere, states that “A person born in Hawaii on or after April 30, 1900, is a citizen of the United States at birth.”
No other state has a specific law establishing birthright citizenship there.
Stock said she believes those laws protect the citizenship of children born in Alaska and Hawaii, but added that she has seen the federal government violate other immigration laws.

Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Tom Tillis of North Carolina have indicated that they will vote against it. If Murkowski were to join them in opposition, it would leave Vice President J.D. Vance to cast the tie-breaking vote in favor. 
If one other Republican were to also vote no, the bill would fail.
Senators are rushing to finish work ahead of the Fourth of July, an informal deadline preferred by the president.
In order to partially pay for tax cuts enacted during Trump’s first term, the bill proposes significant cuts to Medicaid spending and changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as food stamps.
Roughly 1 in 3 Alaskans receives health care through Medicaid, and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive think tank opposed to the big bill, estimated that 35,000 Alaskans could lose health insurance if the bill passes. 
Republicans proposed $6.7 billion in additional Medicaid spending for Alaska to offset some of those cuts, but over the weekend, the Senate parliamentarian ruled that change violated the rules of the budget procedure being used to advance the bill.
Large numbers of Alaskans receive SNAP food aid from the federal government, and the bill would require states to pay for a share of that aid, which is currently fully funded by the federal government.
Alaska, which has repeatedly been scolded by the federal government for mistakes managing SNAP, would be required to pay as much as $37 million per year to keep food aid steady, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimated. 
Republican senators inserted a provision into the bill that would have temporarily exempted Alaska and Hawaii from having to pay into the program, but on Monday, the Senate parliamentarian seemed likely to nix that benefit as well.
In a weekend opinion column published in the New York Times, Alaska Senate Majority Leader Cathy Giessel, R-Anchorage, and Alaska Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, urged Congress to reject the bill, saying it would be bad for Alaska. By phone on Monday, Giessel said her view had not changed since that column was published.
Other parts of the bill, geared toward Alaska, remained intact: a new tax exemption for Community Development Quota fishing groups and an increase in a federal tax deduction for Alaska whaling captains.
The bill contains more than $7 billion for Coast Guard icebreakers and $300 million to homeport a newly purchased civilian icebreaker commissioned into Coast Guard service. That icebreaker is slated to be homeported in Juneau.
On Monday, Murkowski was working to amend a section of the bill that threatens to deter low-cost solar and wind power projects that could reduce energy costs in Alaska.
Currently, federal law provides tax credits that incentivize those projects, but the new bill would eliminate those credits.
In addition, as of Monday afternoon, the bill contained a new excise tax on solar and energy projects placed into service after 2027 if they use parts from China and other prohibited foreign countries.
Almost all solar and wind projects use Chinese components because of their low cost and high quality.
Murkowski was seeking a gradual phaseout of those tax credits by allowing projects to collect them as long as they begin construction by 2027.

It mandates four new oil and gas lease sales in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and it requires other sales in Cook Inlet and the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. 
Seventy percent of rental and royalty payments from those sales would go to the state of Alaska, starting in 2034, up from 50 percent currently.
That’s down from a proposed share of 90%, which was in an earlier Senate version of the bill. 
The revenue sharing is particularly important for the state because a growing proportion of North Slope oil production is coming from federal land, rather than state land, and most promising new oil finds in the North Slope are on federal land.
An earlier version of the bill proposed to ban states for 10 years from passing laws restricting AI computer software development. That’s now down to five years and has multiple exceptions.
In the Alaska Legislature, Anchorage Reps. Alyse Galvin and Andrew Gray had issued a statement asking the Senate to reconsider the 10-year ban.
A provision advancing development of the Ambler Road was rejected by the Senate parliamentarian, and Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah has withdrawn a proposal to sell large amounts of U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land.
Overall, independent analysts have found, the tax cuts within the bill will bring increased financial benefits for the wealthiest Alaskans, while the poorest Alaskans will be left worse off because their tax cuts do not equal the cost of lost federal benefits and services.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in a Sunday estimate that the bill will increase the federal debt by more than $3.2 trillion over 10 years.
If the bill advances through the Senate, it will be subject to a vote in the House, where lawmakers passed a different version earlier this year.
That vote could come before the Fourth of July holiday.

Congressman Dwight Evans won’t seek reelection in 2026, announces plans to retire",John Cole,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/pa-congressman-dwight-evans-wont-seek-reelection-in-2026-announces-plans-to-retire/,Multiple Democratic lawmakers have expressed interest in potentially joining the race to succeed him.,"U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans (D-3rd District)U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans (D-3rd District) announced on Monday that he will not run for reelection in 2026.
“After some discussions this weekend and thoughtful reflection, I have decided that the time is right to announce that I will not be seeking re-election in 2026,” he said. “Serving the people of Philadelphia has been the honor of my life. I am deeply proud of what I have been able to accomplish over my 45 years in elected office — from revitalizing neighborhoods block by block to fighting for justice, economic opportunity, investments in infrastructure and education.”
“I cannot express the gratitude that I have for the trust that voters put in me as their voice in both state and federal office,” he added. “It has been a privilege of a lifetime to serve as their advocate in government.”
In May 2024, Evans suffered a stroke and did not vote for several months during his recovery. He was reelected to another term last year.  In his statement, Evans said that he is in “good health and fully capable of continuing to serve.”  He intends to serve the remainder of his current term that ends on Jan. 3, 2027.
Evans career in elected office spans several decades. He served in Pennsylvania’s General Assembly for multiple decades before he defeated indicted incumbent Congressman Chaka Fattah in the Democratic Party primary in 2016 to win a seat in the U.S. House.
He has cruised to reelection four times and represents a safe Democratic district, according to national ratings outlets.
Evans is a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, where he serves on the Subcommittees on Health, and Worker and Family Support.
The Philadelphia Inquirer reported in December that multiple Democrats would be interested in running for the seat, if Evans decided to not seek reelection in 2026. A few confirmed interest in the seat following Evans announcement. Earlier this year, Evans’ first quarter fundraising total, was the lowest in the state’s congressional delegation.
State Sen. Sharif Street, who also serves as the chairman of the state’s Democratic Party, said “We’ll be filing paperwork tomorrow that will answer that question.”
State Rep. Chris Rabb (D-Philadelphia) previously set up an exploratory committee for the seat in October 2023, but decided against challenging Evans.
“I had no intention of running against the congressman, but now that he has announced that he’s not running for re-election. I’m seriously considering it,” Rabb told the Capital-Star on Monday.
State Rep. Morgan Cephas, who serves as the chair of the Philadelphia caucus in the state House, told POLITICO on Monday that “me and my team are strongly considering a bid.”
Dave Oxman, a physician, and Robin Toldens, who the Inquirer reports is a former city government employee and real estate agent, are both Democrats who have already filed to run for Pennsylvania’s 3rd Congressional District

For the first time in a decade, we have a chance to write a new roadmap that should include eliminating combined sewage overflows.
The post It’s time to give the Mystic River watershed the same clean-up we gave Boston Harbor appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","NESTLED ON THE border of Cambridge and Arlington, the Alewife Brook Reservation is a serene urban wildland filled with wetlands, teeming with wildlife, and a popular oasis for residents. But it’s also the site where more than 1.6 million gallons of untreated sewage overflow — including human waste — have been dumped since the start of 2025. 
Despite tremendous progress made over the last 50 years to improve water quality throughout Greater Boston, outdated sewer infrastructure and underregulated stormwater practices continue to lead to the discharge of dangerous pollutants directly into our popular public waterways. A disproportionate number of the most egregious discharges, known as combined sewage overflows (CSOs), occur at Alewife Brook and along the Mystic River, a watershed region home to roughly 600,000 people. This poses a significant threat to their health and well-being, as well as that of critical ecosystems throughout the region.  
Fortunately, in 2025, we have an unprecedented opportunity to tackle this enduring challenge, which dates back to the cleanup of Boston Harbor, which began in the 1980s. 
For the first time in a decade, we have a chance to take what we’ve learned about improving water quality and rewrite a roadmap that should include eliminating CSOs altogether, establishing foundational strategies to protect our waterways, and promoting climate-resilient infrastructure, public health, and ecological health. If we miss this chance, we risk missing a crucial window for making the water our residents and neighbors recreate in and live alongside safe for everyone to enjoy for decades to come.

Constructed in the late 1800s, combined sewer overflows were designed as a connected sewer and storm drain system to ferry untreated wastewater and storm runoff into treatment plants. Today, these same pipes carry that mix of rainwater and sewage in the Boston area to the water treatment plant at Deer Island, during small rain events.  
When hit with moderate to severe rainfall events, however, these systems become overwhelmed, and — to prevent sewage from backing up into homes — divert untreated wastewater to outflows along our rivers and streams. These outflows expose communities to dangerous bacteria and other pollutants linked to severe health complications, and necessitate the all-too-frequent closure of local waterways, parks, and beaches.  
Unfortunately, incidents of discharges have become more common. As cities have grown and shifting rain patterns caused by climate change have brought heavier, more frequent precipitation events, our antiquated sewer system has struggled to keep up. Toxic water increasingly has no place to go but into areas where we work, play, and live.  
Indeed, even while dozens of CSO outflows in Boston, Cambridge, and Somerville have been eliminated over the past 35 years, over 100 million gallons of raw and partially treated combined sewage were discharged into the Mystic River and its tributaries in 2024 alone. In the recently published Mystic River water quality report card, one of these tributaries, the Alewife Brook,  scored an alarming D+.  
This year, an update to the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority Combined Sewer Overflow Long Term Control Plan, which creates a 10-year framework for MWRA, local governments, and institutions to address the remaining combined sewer overflows impacting the Mystic, Neponset, and Charles rivers, as well as Alewife Brook, is well underway and set to be finalized and rolled out over the coming months.  
Combined with federal regulatory changes, the plan is in a position to substantially improve public health throughout Greater Boston and accelerate the progress made thus far in improving the water quality in the Mystic River watershed and the region. However, to be truly effective in ensuring our waterways are clean and safe from hazardous waste, the overriding priority of the plan must be to eliminate the discharge of sewage from combined sewer overflows completely.  
To accomplish this, any long-term control plan must be flexible and responsive to our rapidly changing climate, incorporating climate-ready solutions that prepare our cities for the heavy rain and snow events we can expect over the next decade. This means considering, whenever possible, green infrastructure solutions, such as rain gardens, bioswales, and stormwater wetlands, that provide co-benefits to communities most impacted by CSO discharges. 
Executing the long-term control plan must also be a collective effort involving municipalities, community groups, policy-makers, engineers, and the public. Transparency must be woven throughout the 10-year process — and this year’s negotiations — ensuring that infrastructure proposals are accessible to all and multiple opportunities are provided for the public to deliberate, share feedback, and react to proposals.  
Together, these essential investments in infrastructure and planning present a massive opportunity to modernize our infrastructure and better protect our waterways to reflect and serve everyone in our communities. We can no longer afford to kick these urgently needed updates down the road.  
In the 1980s, Massachusetts embarked on a massive operation to clean up Boston Harbor. Today, we are reaping the benefits of that effort — proving that we can innovate to tackle big infrastructure challenges with massive and long-term payoffs for the public good.  
We now find ourselves at another pivotal moment in the quest to improve water quality. It’s time to step up, eliminate CSOs, and implement a sustainable, long-term plan to protect the Mystic River and Alewife Brook, so that residents living along these waterways will have access to clean, healthy water now and into the future.

Part Emergency Communications drill and part informal competition, amateur radio Field Day encourages ham radio operators across the U.S. and Canada to test their equipment and skills.

Kelsey Tolchin-Kupferer is the audio story editor at the Community News Service, a University of Vermont journalism internship, in partnership with Vermont Public. 

Radio waves were flying in Essex Junction this weekend as members of Radio Amateurs of Northern Vermont joined tens of thousands of amateur — or “ham” — radio operators across North America for Field Day.
Hosted annually by the National Association for Amateur Radio, Field Day encourages licensed operators to test their skills, equipment and emergency readiness. It’s also a chance for “hams” to socialize, recruit new operators and engage in some friendly competition.
Here’s how it works:
Amateur radio operators set up temporary radio stations in remote areas like parks, parking lots and fields. They then spend 24 hours trying to make contact with as many other stations as possible using only portable equipment and emergency power like batteries and generators.

Members of Radio Amateurs of Northern Vermont (RANV) have been participating in Field Day for more than 30 years.
“We take it extremely seriously, because the whole point of Field Day is to do an emergency communications — ‘EmComm’ — setup,” said RANV president Stewart Corey. “And it doesn’t get any more EmComm than what we’re doing.”
RANV’s setup is ambitious, with three 50-foot antenna towers and multiple stations running on generators. It takes several hours and several volunteers to assemble — and tear down — all the gear.
Still, RANV members say the real magic of amateur radio is how little it takes to connect.
“If you give me the right radio and a 12-volt battery and enough wire to string in the trees, I can talk to anywhere in the world,” said RANV member John Colt.
Colt uses his amateur radio know-how to help organize emergency communications drills at healthcare facilities across Vermont. He says when cell towers fail, the internet is down and the power goes out, ham radio operators can still get messages through.
“If you want something that will work when nothing else does, that’s amateur radio,” he said.
But emergency preparedness is only part of the appeal.
“It’s also an incredibly fun hobby,” Colt said.
Fellow RANV member Erik Wheeler agrees. He got his amateur license as a kid. 
“I walked into my teacher’s classroom — it was Travis Redman, a fantastic teacher at Rutland Town School — and there was a ham radio sitting there,” Wheeler said. “He taught me and several other students how to use it, and I’ve been hooked ever since.”

This year, Vermonters set up Field Day stations in Shaftsbury, Montpelier, Halifax, Newport, New Haven and Gateway in addition to the one in Essex Junction. Many stations encouraged members of the public to come and observe — and even get on the air.
Field Day is also an informal competition. Groups earn points for the number of stations they contact — called “QSOs” — and can earn bonus points for things like getting little kids on the air. 
RANV has placed first in the nation in its Field Day category for four years in a row. RANV operators log hundreds of contacts every hour, consistently outperforming hundreds of other ham radio clubs across the U.S. and Canada.
RANV president Stewart Corey says the club does so well because they’ve got great equipment and a dedicated team on-air for the full 24 hours. And, he said, Vermont’s location helps. 
“Because we’re up in the corner, we can face our beam southwest and hit a majority of the United States without moving it,” he said. “Geographically, we kind of get to cheat.”
Curious about ham radio? You don’t have to wait till next Field Day. Corey says RANV is always looking for new members. They meet monthly in Essex Junction.

(Screenshot of video from Spokane Valley Fire Department)Law enforcement on Monday identified the man who they believe killed two firefighters attempting to battle a brush fire in an ambush in Coeur d’Alene.
Wess Roley, 20, was identified by local coroner officials, Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris said at a Monday afternoon news conference.
The suspect was found dead with a firearm nearby on Canfield Mountain, officials said Sunday. He appeared to have killed himself, Norris said Monday.
Officials believe he started a brush fire near a popular recreation area, and then fatally shot two firefighters and injured another.
The firefighters killed were identified on Monday as battalion chief John Morrison, of the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department, and battalion chief Frank Harwood, of Kootenai County Fire and Rescue, the Coeur d’Alene Press reported. The injured firefighter is Dave Tysdal, who works for the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department, the local newspaper reported.
The fire’s cause remains under investigation. But officials believe Roley started the fire with a flint starter, Norris said.
A shotgun was used, but the crime scene is still being processed, the sheriff said.
The seriously injured firefighter was released from surgery later Sunday. He was stable, Norris said Sunday. No more specific information about his condition has been released.
The firefighters Roley allegedly shot were the ones who spoke with him when they arrived on scene, Norris said.
 Investigation ongoing

Officials believe Roley had lived in California, Arizona and Idaho, Norris said. Officials could not find a criminal record for Roley, but Norris said local law enforcement had five minor interactions with him — including for trespassing and welfare checks.
“We know that he was a transient here,” Norris said. “We knew that he lived here for the better part of 2024. But as far as when he got here, why he was here, why he chose this place — I don’t know. He has relatives in the Priest River area. But I don’t know why he chose that. We don’t find any nexus to anything else. Maybe we’ll find more once we do an inventory of the vehicle.”
Norris said Roley appeared to be living in his vehicle and wanted to be a firefighter at some point. But he stressed information is preliminary and subject to change.
Roley grew up in an arborist family that climbed trees, and law enforcement received reports he was shooting at first responders from a tree, Norris said.
The crime scene remains active. Law enforcement have not yet inventoried Roley’s vehicle, which deputies pushed down a mountain embankment to make it harder for him to flee, Norris said.
 Fire grows to 26 acres — but structures aren’t threatened

The brush fire, named the Nettleton Gulch Fire, grew to 26 acres by Monday afternoon, the Idaho Department of Lands reported. The active shooter situation Sunday delayed firefighting efforts.
Crews on Monday are trying to reduce the fire’s growth by building a fireline. Structures aren’t threatened, and the fire hasn’t prompted evacuations, Idaho Department of Lands officials say.
Fighting the fire is slow because the terrain makes it difficult to use ground assets, Norris said.
The Idaho Department of Lands is managing the fire, and the agency has the resources currently needed to respond, Kootenai County Emergency Management said in a Facebook post Monday morning.
“Should additional support be required, requests will be made through the appropriate channels,” the office said. “We kindly ask that individuals and organizations refrain from reaching out with resource offers, as their team is receiving a high volume of inquiries.”
 Idaho governor orders flags at half-staff

Earlier Monday, Idaho Gov. Brad Little ordered flags be lowered to half-staff. 
The order remains in place until the day after the memorial service, which has not been scheduled.
In a statement, Little said the entire state is grieving after the ambush.
“All our public safety officers, especially our firefighters, bravely confront danger on a daily basis but we have never seen a heinous act of violence like this on our firefighters before,” the governor said. “This is not Idaho. This indescribable loss is felt deeply by all those in the firefighting community and beyond.”
Little asked the public to join him and the state’s first lady Teresa Little in praying for the victims and their loved ones.
In a statement, Idaho Fire Chiefs Association President Kirk Carpenter said Idaho’s first responder families are devastated.
“Our thoughts and prayers are with our fire families in North Idaho. There are no words—please know that we are here for you, now and always,” he said.
The victims’ names will be released by local officials in due time, the Professional Firefighters of Idaho said in a news release.
 In D.C., Idaho’s U.S. senators ask for prayers

Early Monday, as the U.S. Senate worked to advance a massive spending and tax cut bill, both of Idaho’s U.S. senators led a moment of silence to honor the victims of Sunday’s attack.
U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, asked fellow senators to send prayers for the full recovery of the injured firefighter who was released from surgery, along with the victims who died, their families “and the entire North Idaho community grieving this heinous act.”
U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, called the attack despicable and urged prayers.
“This evil attack on the people who dedicate their lives to protecting and serving our communities is despicable, and it’s not Idaho,” Risch said.

(McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)The state of Utah is suing Snapchat over features it says are designed to addict children, while potentially exposing them to illegal drug sales, predatory adults and an artificial intelligence feature that has “known risks.”
That’s according to a complaint filed on Monday in Salt Lake County’s 3rd District Court, accusing the popular social media app of violating Utah’s Consumer Sales Practices and Consumer Privacy acts. 
It’s the latest attempt by Utah to target the legality of how social media companies interact with minors — the state has now filed four lawsuits against major social media companies, including similar complaints against Meta and TikTok. 
However, Snap (Snapchat’s parent company) is accusing the state of trying to circumvent a court ruling last year that put a temporary hold on a Utah law requiring age verification for social media users. The company says it’s not against increased safety regulations, but called Utah’s demands “unconstitutional.” 
Allegations of criminal activity and ‘gambling-like features’ 
In the 90-page complaint, attorneys for the state claim Snapchat leaves children vulnerable to exploitation, misleads parents into thinking the app is safe, and has “gambling-like” features that reward continuous use and compulsive scrolling. 
The complaint cites examples where Snapchat’s artificial intelligence chatbot, My AI, was allegedly “giving a 13-year-old account advice on setting the mood for a sexual experience with a 31-year-old.” The attorney general’s office also gives several examples of drug deals and sex crimes involving Snapchat.
The complaint accuses Snapchat of knowingly incorporating and refining features that “facilitate, enable, and promote the distribution of drugs and sexual exploitation,” a violation of the state’s consumer sales practices act.   
According to the complaint, Snap incorporates features that are “designed to be addictive to children,” including push notifications, beauty filters, personalized algorithms and the My AI chatbot. Meanwhile, the company hides or disincentivizes features that could decrease the time young people spend on the app, the lawsuit claims. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Addicting children and “ensuring their continued addiction” is also in violation of the state’s consumer sales practices act, the complaint reads — as is launching the My AI feature that had “known risks to drive engagement and profit.”
The state argues Snapchat is violating the Utah Consumer Privacy Act by failing to provide customers with the “ability to opt out of the sensitive data collected through Snapchat’s My AI feature.” 
According to the lawsuit, Snap was informed of these violations in a May 2025 letter, but the company “did not cure any of the violations.” Utah is hoping a court will force Snap to follow the laws it claims the company is violating, and order restitution and other civil penalties. 
“Utah is taking a stand to protect our kids in an increasingly digital world. This lawsuit against Snap is about accountability and about drawing a clear line: the well-being of our children must come before corporate profits,” said Utah Gov. Spencer Cox in a statement Monday. “We won’t sit back while tech companies exploit young users. It’s time for commonsense protections that ensure a safer online experience for every minor.”
Snapchat says Utah is trying to circumvent a prior court ruling 
In a statement, Snap said the company is committed to making the app a “safe and fun environment for our community, and have built privacy and safety features into our service from the start.”   
Utah changed its social media laws to avoid constitutional issues, but legal challenges persist

The lawsuit comes about a year after Utah lawmakers passed a bill requiring social media companies verify the age of their users. NetChoice, a trade association for internet companies like Google, Meta and Snap, sued the state, arguing the law violated the First Amendment — in September, a judge temporarily blocked the law from going into effect. 
Now Snap is accusing the state of trying to find a way around the court ruling. 
“Unable to accept the court’s rejection of the state’s legislation, the Utah Attorney General is resorting to civil litigation as a means to circumvent the court and impose age verification requirements and age-related restrictions in ways that are unconstitutional,” a company spokesperson said in an email.  
Snap said Utah’s lawsuit imposes restrictive and “technologically unfeasible” regulations that stifle free speech. 
Billions of conversations take place on Snapchat each day, the vast majority of them to simply connect with friends and family, according to the company. Snap said it supports steps to increase online safety for children, including the recently-passed SB142, which requires Apple and Google’s app stores to verify a user’s age before making downloads. 
The company also pointed to safety features that make teen accounts and friend lists private by default, and require a Snapchat user to be “friends” with someone before they can communicate with them. Other features allow parents to see who their child is talking to and who their friends are.

A New York federal judge issued a nationwide preliminary injunction last week that allows Job Corps centers, like the Northlands Job Corps Center in Vergennes, to remain open while the legal battle to determine their fate continues.
In issuing the order, Judge Andrew Lamar Carter, a federal judge for the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, stated that the arguments by lawyers for National Job Corps Association and a litany of fellow defendants — ranging from Education and Training Resources, the contractor who operates the Job Corps in Vergennes, to current Job Corps students — were largely likely to succeed. The plaintiffs all sued the U.S. Department of Labor to stop its attempt to shut down the program.
In late May, the Department of Labor told Job Corps centers across the country to “pause” all of their operations. This order would have forced Job Corps center to shut down a program that provides room, food and a vocational education to low income 16 to 24 year olds by Monday, June 30.

Instead, the department’s order would have instated what the administration characterized as a “cost-effective” $2.9 billion “Make America Skilled Again” grant program that shifts from federal programs like Job Corps to state-led registered apprenticeships, intended to train workers and provide an alternative to college.
The Job Corps centers had already been funded from July 1, 2025 to June 30, 2026 by Congress, which previously approved $1.7 billion for the program. 
The plaintiffs in the case argued that the Department of Labor “effectively prevented new enrollment” by ending background checks starting in March, court documents show. Students attending Job Corps need to be background-checked to attend the program, but it is unclear now whether or not the government intends to resume background checks, or if they can be legally compelled to do so.The Department of Labor claimed that they had only temporarily halted Job Corps operations. However, Carter wrote in his order that the “way that the DOL is shuttering operations and the context in which the shuttering is taking place make it clear that the DOL is actually attempting to close the centers.”Carter also found that the Department of Labor did not have the power to end the program, writing that the department must “concede that, as part of the executive branch, they do not have the authority to unilaterally eliminate a congressionally mandated program like Job Corps.”Carter also stated that there were clear harms in ending the programs, citing the circumstances of a plaintiff who is a student with the Job Corps program who was previously homeless.The plaintiff “will immediately be plunged into homelessness, and she will lose all of the progress she has made in her culinary program. She would be forced to leave a stable residence and placed in a homeless shelter,” he wrote. It is “undisputed,” he wrote, that she was being harmed by the department’s actions.“The Department of Labor is working closely with the Department of Justice to evaluate the injunction. We remain confident that our actions are consistent with the law,” Ryan L. Honick, a spokesperson for the Department of Labor wrote in an email.
A student enrolled at Northlands said the injunction is “a relief.” 
“We were all kind of scrambling to figure out a plan in less than two weeks of finding a job and trying not to be homeless,” she said in an interview. VTDigger is not naming the student because of potential retaliation by the federal government. 
She said that Northlands is the first place “I’ve ever had three meals a day, and a lot of emotional support, and it’s the first place that I think a lot of kids have a safe environment to explore themselves as a person and [have] the ability to grow.”
The student, who is enrolled in an associate’s degree information technology dual-program between Northlands and the Community College of Vermont, said the opportunities provided by the program were unprecedented for her. 
“I would be the first woman in my family to get a degree,” she said. “I would probably stay in Vermont. I love it… I’d get a job in programming or software development after this. And I’d probably pursue my bachelor’s degree.”
The injunction was also cause for political celebration among Vermont’s Democratic state and federal officials. 
Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark also joined 18 other attorneys general to file an amicus brief in support of the program.Noting that she was “pleased, and not surprised,” by the court’s order, Clark added that “this order will allow Northlands Jobs Corps Center in Vergennes to continue serving young Vermonters in their journey to achieve their career goals and access stable housing.”In an emailed statement, U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt. called the Job Corps “a critical training ground and opportunity pipeline for so many Vermonters.”
“I was pleased to see it remain open and operating for the time being,” she wrote. “But the Trump administration remains adamant in ripping away these programs that give Americans a fair shot at success – while training the exact trades workers that Vermont so desperately needs. I’ll keep fighting every step of the way to keep these funds going to the programs just as Congress mandated.”U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. and U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt. signed a letter with thirty eight other Senators urging the Department of Labor “to immediately reverse this decision to prevent a lapse in education and services for Job Corps students.”The injunction comes at a time where the Trump administration is butting heads with the judicial branch, as many of President Donald Trump’s sweeping executive actions have been repelled by various federal judges through nationwide injunctions.On June 27, Carter ordered parties involved in the Job Corps battle to file motions arguing whether or not the recent Supreme Court decision — which limited federal judges’ power to issue nationwide injunctions — would impact the injunction he filed by June 30. The Department of Labor requested an extension that may push the filing date to July 11.Carter also denied any order to stay the case, meaning the battle for the future of the Job Corps seems poised to continue.

Jeff Landry signs legislation on June 30, 2025. (Photo: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Gov. Jeff Landry taunted a member of his own party during a press conference Monday, accusing the Republican senator of killing a bill that Landry claims would have helped lower insurance rates. 
Landry invited members of the press to a ceremony Monday in which he signed into law a group of bills, including eight different measures aimed at lowering the cost of auto and homeowner insurance costs. The governor took turns listing and explaining each of the new laws while thanking the legislators who authored them, most of whom stood behind Landry as he spoke.  
Absent from that list was House Bill 677, a measure that would have regulated attorney advertising, prohibiting lawyers from making or including any kind of misleading or deceptive claims in advertisements about the amount of money a client received from a lawsuit. 
 Insurance companies have faulted personal-injury attorneys for Louisiana’s auto insurance crisis. Landry supported the bill as an effort to tamp down what some see as a litigious environment perpetuated by a group of trial lawyers well-known for their constant barrage of commercials and billboards. 
There are several questions about whether such restrictions on attorney advertising would be constitutional. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled lawyers had a right to advertise based on First Amendment grounds in a 1977 Arizona case which opened the floodgates for so-called “billboard lawyers” media buys. 
Nevertheless, the governor claimed the attorney advertising bill would have passed but for a single lawmaker — Republican Sen. Alan Seabaugh of Shreveport. 
“We tried to rein in lawyer advertising,” Landry said to the room of journalists and spectators. “Sen. Seabaugh seemed to not be able to come to work that day, and that bill died. I want you to know we tried. Last time we tried that bill, the [former] governor vetoed it. This time a senator couldn’t show up for work. Maybe we’ll get it done next year.”
The governor was referring to Seabaugh’s two-week absence, from May 19-29, during which the bill came up for a committee vote. Seabaugh, a lawyer, said he was stuck in a jury trial defending a nursing home being accused of wrongful death in Bossier Parish — a case he ended up winning. 

The advertising bill, which was sponsored by Rep. Kim Carver, R-Mandeville, had cleared the House in mid-May on a 75-25 vote and advanced to the Senate Judiciary A Committee, of which Seabaugh is a member. 
Carver, who did not return a request for comment Monday, brought his bill to the committee on May 28 where it failed to advance in a 3-1 party-line vote with Democrats holding an advantage due in part — but not entirely — to Seabaugh’s absence. 
“I don’t know where he’s coming from throwing shade on me for missing a vote that wouldn’t have mattered,” Seabaugh said in a phone interview Monday. “It was a 3 to 1 vote, so me not being there never affected the outcome.”  
The other Republican who missed the vote was Sen. Rick Edmonds of Baton Rouge. Edmonds, who is pastor, said he was present every day during the session but was presenting a separate bill in a House committee at the same time as the Judiciary A members were voting on Carver’s proposal.
Seabaugh said the governor is blaming him out of spite for having voted against a different bill that Landry helped write and shepherd through the Legislature — House Bill 148, a controversial measure that Landry signed into law following an ongoing public feud with another Republican elected official, Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple. 
 “He’s mad at me for voting against House Bill 148,” Seabaugh said, noting that his vote on the proposal, like with the Carver bill, made no difference to its outcome.
Seabaugh cited the same grudge as the reason why Landry vetoed one of his insurance bills on the last day of the regular session. In an interview that day, the senator said he felt blindsided by the veto because he thought he had the governor’s support. He contrasted Landry with former Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat.  
“John Bel would call and tell me when he vetoed a bill,” Seabaugh said at the time. “Jeff didn’t.”
After fielding only a few questions from the press at Monday’s bill signing, the governor did not respond to a request for further comment later on Monday.

The statewide public media network would lose $2.5 million in programming and operational funds if President Donald Trump’s desired cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting come to fruition, interim executive director Sajni Kumpuris told the commission earlier this month. She said Monday that the $2.5 million CPB grant Arkansas PBS receives accounts for 51% of the network’s operating expense funding.

Fiscal year 2026 begins Tuesday, and PBS affiliate stations renew their memberships and pay their dues at the turn of the fiscal year.
About half of the at-risk $2.5 million community service grant goes toward purchasing PBS programs to air, 30% of which is chosen by PBS’ national headquarters, Kumpuris said last month. Public television stations without PBS memberships cannot access this national programming.
Arkansas PBS usually collects more than $3 million per year in individual donations, and 80% of those who donate online cite programming as their reason for giving, said Marge Betley, CEO of the Arkansas PBS Foundation, which manages donations to the network.
Individual donations would likely “nosedive” if the network no longer aired national PBS programming, Betley said. Some of the revenue from donations goes to the network’s operational expenses while some goes to foundation staff salaries, among other things, she said.
The foundation’s executive committee agreed last week to cover up to $1.8 million in lost federal funding if Congress approves the Trump administration’s proposed Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Betley said.
“That amount is a combination of drawing from reserves that the foundation has built over many years as well as a portion of emergency reserves that we have set aside,” she said. “But there is also a portion of it that would come from a public campaign that would basically say, ‘This is specifically to address cuts at the federal level.’”
Arkansas PBS has already agreed to make cuts to cover the remainder of the potential federal funding loss, Betley said.
Besides purchasing programming, the network’s at-risk federal grant covers operational expenses, such as running the public media network’s Conway studio and its statewide emergency weather alert system, Kumpuris said last month.

Maria Sullivan and Chairman West Doss were the only commissioners to vote against renewing the contract, saying they were unwilling to commit to it without reading the terms first.
“We would be fiscally irresponsible to commit to something this afternoon, which is what PBS says we have to do, when we don’t know where they stand, where their funding is or if they’re going to exist,” Doss said.
Attorney William Puddephatt, the commission’s counsel, said PBS’ national headquarters has not answered his or the commission’s questions about the contract in sufficient detail.
Former commission chairwoman Annette Herrington said the renewed contract should not be substantially different than in previous fiscal years. She made the motion to renew the contract “to continue to serve all Arkansans with the programming that we have provided in the past.”
Programs the network would have lost if it had disaffiliated from the national network included Antiques Roadshow and PBS Kids 24/7, Kumpuris said. Arkansas PBS would also have reverted to its previous name, the Arkansas Educational Television Network.

(Peter Hall/Capital-Star)When dawn broke Monday on the Pennsylvania Capitol it was a foregone conclusion that lawmakers would miss the midnight deadline to approve the next state budget.
This marks the fourth year in a row the budget will be late, failing to meet the June 30 deadline. Gov. Josh Shapiro and leaders in the General Assembly offered scant insight into what’s causing the impasse and how long it might last.
For most Pennsylvanians, the lack of a budget will have few immediate noticeable effects. But if the gridlock persists into late July, it could result in financial stress for local governments, school districts, and nonprofits that receive taxpayer dollars from the spending plan.
Shapiro told reporters at a public appearance Monday that his staff and majority leaders from the Senate Republican and House Democratic caucuses had a busy weekend of meetings.
“We were all personally engaged. I think we made real progress, and we’re going to continue to make progress,” Shapiro said. “We understand what the issues are, and we are working through the solutions on those issues. I think the temperature is way down.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Republicans, who control the Senate, said that while they’ve acted on several “key components of the budget, to fund certain government functions,” they are focused on the state’s negative cashflow, as Shapiro’s plan would again dip into the state’s $11 billion surplus.
“Pennsylvania is facing a multi-billion-dollar structural deficit that we must address this year to prevent a financial crisis and tax increases in the future. Better aligning revenues with expenditures remains our top priority,” a statement from Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland), Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) and Appropriations Committee Chair Scott Martin (R-Lancaster) said.
Since February, when Shapiro delivered his proposed $51.5 billion spending plan for the 2025-2026 fiscal year, Democratic lawmakers in the House have been working to pass legislation to enact Shapiro’s policy goals.
They included increases in funding for basic education, special education and school repairs, and another $526 million installment in adequacy payments to the state’s poorest school districts. The House passed legislation to reign in costs for online charter schools, setting school districts’ tuition payments at $8,000 per pupil across the state to free up $378 million a year.
The chamber has also passed legislation to provide a larger share of state sales tax revenue for public transit agencies across the state, including the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA), which last week passed a budget that would cut its services by nearly half.
Shapiro also proposed $750 million in additional money for highways over the next five years by shifting fuel taxes and license fees away from the state police, since Republican lawmakers have insisted on transportation improvements for rural communities and industry.
The GOP-led Senate, meanwhile, has been circumspect about options to increase tax revenue, voting down a House bill to legalize and tax marijuana for recreational use and is deeply divided on a plan to tax slot machine-like skill games that have proliferated in corner stores and social halls across the state.
Shapiro has proposed a 52% tax on skill games, which is in the neighborhood of the state’s 54% tax on casino gaming. Pace-O-Matic, the predominant producer of the machines, has lobbied for a 16% tax, while Senate Republican leaders have offered a compromise of 35%. The division has given rise to a bitter fight between Senate leaders and powerhouse lobbying firms they accuse of running an attack campaign against GOP lawmakers, Spotlight PA reported.
House Appropriations Committee Chair Jordan Harris (D-Philadelphia) said Wednesday that transit funding remains a priority.
“The bottom line is that mass transit is good for Pennsylvania’s economy, not just for any region in particular, but for the whole economy,” Harris told reporters. “It helps us fund a lot of the other things that are part of this budget. How do people get to work? How do they get to school? How do they get to their doctor’s appointment? Many of them are getting there via mass transit, and that’s in rural, suburban and urban areas across this commonwealth.”
Business leaders have noted counties across the commonwealth also benefit directly from SEPTA’s employment, procurement, and commerce. 
“Over the past five years, SEPTA has awarded over $1.14 billion in contracts to Pennsylvania-based companies in 39 counties, with an average annual investment of $228 million. That’s not just rail cars and bus routes in the southeast — that’s steel, rubber, electronics, parts, safety equipment, and professional services supporting jobs across the Commonwealth,” Laura Manion, president and CEO of the Chester County Chamber of Business and Industry, and Mike Grigalonis, president & COO of the Chester County Economic Development Council, wrote in support of the transit funding increase.
House Minority Leader Jesse Topper (R-Bedford) told reporters Monday afternoon that his caucus has also been active in negotiating and focused on reducing the overall spending amount while fixing the structural deficit in which the state continues to spend more than it takes in.
“We believe that the No. 1 way to get ourselves out of what we’re facing in the next couple of years is through economic growth,” Topper said, adding that energy production and education to prepare young people for the workforce are priorities.
“We have a demographics issue in (Pennsylvania). We know that, and we have to make sure that our public policy during this time, as we talk about the budget, reflects the need for change in that area,” he said.
The Senate recessed Monday evening with no immediate plan to reconvene, while the House is scheduled to return to session Tuesday morning.
Harris said the stalemate over new revenue sources doesn’t necessarily prevent the General Assembly from passing a budget.
“We have the finances to produce this year’s budget if necessary, but we put all of our cards on the table, and we’re … still waiting for the negotiations to continue,” he said. “I think today, being the 30th, may help us move forward, hopefully getting this thing done.”

(Screenshot of video from Spokane Valley Fire Department)Law enforcement on Monday identified the man who they believe killed two firefighters attempting to battle a brush fire in an ambush in Coeur d’Alene.
 

Wess Roley, 20, was identified by local coroner officials, Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris said at a Monday afternoon news conference.
The suspect was found dead with a firearm nearby on Canfield Mountain, officials said Sunday. He appeared to have killed himself, Norris said Monday.
Officials believe he started a brush fire near a popular recreation area, and then fatally shot two firefighters and injured another.
Law enforcement have not released the names of the killed and injured firefighters, or a motive for the shooting.
The fire’s cause remains under investigation. But officials believe Roley started the fire with a flint starter, Norris said.
A shotgun was used, but the crime scene is still being processed, the sheriff said.
The seriously injured firefighter was released from surgery later Sunday. He was stable, Norris said Sunday. No more specific information about his condition has been released.
The firefighters Roley allegedly shot were the ones who spoke with him when they arrived on scene, Norris said.
  Officials found no criminal record for suspect. Investigation ongoing. 

Officials believe Roley had lived in California, Arizona and Idaho, Norris said. Officials could not find a criminal record for Roley, but Norris said local law enforcement had five minor interactions with him — including for trespassing and welfare checks.
“We know that he was a transient here,” Norris said. “We knew that he lived here for the better part of 2024. But as far as when he got here, why he was here, why he chose this place — I don’t know. He has relatives in the Priest River area. But I don’t know why he chose that. We don’t find any nexus to anything else. Maybe we’ll find more once we do an inventory of the vehicle.”
Norris said Roley appeared to be living in his vehicle and wanted to be a firefighter at some point. But he stressed information is preliminary and subject to change.
Roley grew up in an arborist family that climbed trees, and law enforcement received reports he was shooting at first responders from a tree, Norris said.
The crime scene remains active. Law enforcement have not yet inventoried Roley’s vehicle, which deputies pushed down a mountain embankment to make it harder for him to flee, Norris said.
  Fire grows to 26 acres — but structures aren’t threatened 

The brush fire, named the Nettleton Gulch Fire, grew to 26 acres by Monday afternoon, the Idaho Department of Lands reported. The active shooter situation Sunday delayed firefighting efforts.
Crews on Monday are trying to reduce the fire’s growth by building a fireline. Structures aren’t threatened, and the fire hasn’t prompted evacuations, Idaho Department of Lands officials say.
Fighting the fire is slow because the terrain makes it difficult to use ground assets, Norris said.
The Idaho Department of Lands is managing the fire, and the agency has the resources currently needed to respond, Kootenai County Emergency Management said in a Facebook post Monday morning.
“Should additional support be required, requests will be made through the appropriate channels,” the office said. “We kindly ask that individuals and organizations refrain from reaching out with resource offers, as their team is receiving a high volume of inquiries.”
  Idaho governor orders flags at half-staff 

Earlier Monday, Idaho Gov. Brad Little ordered flags be lowered to half-staff.
The order remains in place until the day after the memorial service, which has not been scheduled.
In a statement, Little said the entire state is grieving after the ambush.
“All our public safety officers, especially our firefighters, bravely confront danger on a daily basis but we have never seen a heinous act of violence like this on our firefighters before,” the governor said. “This is not Idaho. This indescribable loss is felt deeply by all those in the firefighting community and beyond.”
Little asked the public to join him and the state’s first lady Teresa Little in praying for the victims and their loved ones.
In a statement, Idaho Fire Chiefs Association President Kirk Carpenter said Idaho’s first responder families are devastated.
“Our thoughts and prayers are with our fire families in North Idaho. There are no words—please know that we are here for you, now and always,” he said.
The victims’ names will be released by local officials in due time, the Professional Firefighters of Idaho said in a news release.
  In D.C., Idaho’s U.S. senators ask for prayers 

Early Monday, as the U.S. Senate worked to advance a massive spending and tax cut bill, both of Idaho’s U.S. senators led a moment of silence to honor the victims of Sunday’s attack.
U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, asked fellow senators to send prayers for the full recovery of the injured firefighter who was released from surgery, along with the victims who died, their families “and the entire North Idaho community grieving this heinous act.”
U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, called the attack despicable and urged prayers.
“This evil attack on the people who dedicate their lives to protecting and serving our communities is despicable, and it’s not Idaho,” Risch said.

Thompson Federal Courthouse in Nashville on June 13, 2025. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE — Kilmar Abrego Garcia will remain temporarily in jail at the request of his own attorneys, who cited conflicting positions taken by the government over whether he is at risk for immediate deportation.
An order issued Monday by U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes keeps Abrego in the custody of the U.S. Marshals until a July 16 hearing in Nashville.
The order also directs the U.S. Marshals to hold him “separately from persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody pending appeal” and to ensure he is able to privately confer with his attorneys.
Abrego, an apprentice sheet metal worker living in Maryland, was deported to a Salvadoran prison in March after a traffic stop as the Trump administration began ramping up immigration enforcement efforts.

A government lawyer later admitted Abrego, who entered the country illegally about a decade ago, had been deported in error. A 2019 order from an immigration judge prevents him from being deported to his native El Salvador due to fears of gang violence. The Supreme Court ordered the government to facilitate his return.
A grand jury indictment unsealed June 6 alleged Abrego served for years as a paid driver to transport immigrants who had crossed the U.S. border illegally to points around the country.
Abrego, 29, has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Attorneys for Abrego, who initially sought his pretrial release over the objection of federal prosecutors, last week asked for a delay due to “contradictory statements” made by government officials over his potential deportation.
 

Both federal prosecutors and Abrego’s attorneys have conceded he will most likely be taken into the immediate custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials should he be granted pretrial release.
But government attorneys in Abrego’s separate immigration case told a Maryland judge last week that they expected ICE to begin the process of sending Abrego to a “third country.” The attorneys did not provide a timeline.
A White House spokesperson later denied Abrego would face imminent deportation.
In arguing their client be temporarily kept in jail, Abrego’s attorneys acknowledged the “irony” of their request.
“In a just world, he would not seek to prolong his detention further. And yet the government — a government that has, at all levels, told the American people that it is bringing Mr. Abrego back home to the United States to face ‘American justice’ — apparently has little interest in actually bringing this case to trial.”

“I refuse to stay silent as we watch far-right politicians attempt the largest cut to health care in American history, all so the richest 1% of Americans can receive $138 billion in tax cuts,“ Sen. Maria Collett (D-Montgomery), said at a press conference Monday. “My constituents have been calling me nonstop asking me and my colleagues to stand up to the chaos they see in Washington, to stand up to their healthcare access and their ability to afford day-to-day expenses,”
The budget bill would make substantial cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs, while increasing funding for the military, border security and immigration enforcement, as well as  extending tax cuts that primarily benefit wealthy Americans. The bill will also eliminate subsidies for clean energy projects, including a number planned or underway in Pennsylvania.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget office has estimated the bill will add more than $3 trillion to the nation’s deficit over the next decade, and could result in nearly 12 million Americans losing health insurance.
The Pennsylvania Department of Human Services has said it could result in more than 300,000 Pennsylvanians losing Medicaid coverage, and an additional 270,000 could lose access to Affordable Care Act marketplace plans through Pennie with the elimination of enhanced premium tax credits that make monthly insurance bills more affordable.
“The cuts that are coming out of Washington that are proposed are unconscionable,” Sen. Sharif Street (D-Philadelphia), the chair of the state Democratic Party said. “Medicaid is the health insurance for so many of the most vulnerable folks in our community.”
Republicans, however, have deemed the cuts as necessary. 
Pennsylvania U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick has said that the bill doesn’t cut Medicaid, but slows spending growth, which he says has ballooned too quickly. The cuts, he said, would ensure that the program can continue to protect services for more vulnerable populations like children, the elderly, the disabled and the mentally ill.
“Medicaid has been spiraling out of control,” he said at a town hall earlier this month. “We want to ensure that Medicaid is designed to protect the vulnerable people for whom it was designed, and so the legislation that’s in the Senate would slow the growth of Medicaid. It wouldn’t cut Medicaid.”
The bill is being passed through what’s called the reconciliation process, which allows Republicans to bypass the filibuster and pass the bill with a simple majority vote. 
Since passing the House last month, it’s undergone substantial changes as Trump and Republican leaders attempt to appease dueling factions of a divided party that can only afford to lose a small handful of votes.  
Primarily, the party is split between members concerned about the bill’s overall price tag and others worried about the impacts of cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP.
As of Monday, the Senate has been considering dozens of amendments to the bill. If passed, it will return to the House for further amendment or a final vote.
“It is ugly, it is hurtful, it is painful,” said Sen. Vincent Hughes (D-Philadelphia), the minority chair of the Senate Finance Committee. “We as Senate Democrats are sending a message to people right now that it is not too late. You can still make a phone call. You can still reach out to your senator.”

(Photo by Alex Kormann/Minnesota Star Tribune pool photo)MINNEAPOLIS —Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman’s life embodied the American dream. She was raised in a family that owned a junkyard, became a lawyer but declined a life of comfortable wealth for public service, emerging as among the most influential legislators in Minnesota history.
Now she’s an emblem of the American nightmare, another victim — along with husband Mark Hortman and their golden retriever Gilbert — of the political violence that’s consumed America in the past decade, adding Brooklyn Park to Buffalo, El Paso and other grim signposts of a damaged democracy.
The Hortmans were remembered at their funeral Mass at The Basilica of Saint Mary in Minneapolis Saturday as kind, generous and driven by a common set of values to make the world just a little bit better.
The funeral was mostly light on politics, despite the hundreds of politicos in attendance. Father Daniel Griffith in his homily, however, highlighted the injustices that Melissa Hortman tried to ameliorate.
“In Minnesota we have been the ground zero place, sadly, for racial injustice — the killing of George Floyd just miles from our church,” Griffith said. “And now we are the ground zero place for political violence and extremism. Both of these must be decried in the strongest terms, as they are, respectively, a threat to human dignity and indeed our democracy.”
Gov. Tim Walz, who was both friend and governing partner to Hortman, was visibly shaken while serving as a pallbearer alongside the Hortman children. The packed Basilica was filled with Hortman’s family, friends and vast political network that Melissa Hortman built over decades by way of her effectiveness at the Legislature and down-to-earth charm. Former President Joe Biden — who hosted the Hortmans at the White House — Vice President Kamala Harris, former Gov. Mark Dayton, Democratic and Republican lawmakers and state commissioners also memorialized the lives of Hortmans.
Melissa Hortman served in the Minnesota Legislature for two decades. The Democratic-Farmer-Labor legislator was beloved around the Capitol and is known for scoring major legislative victories including free school lunch for K-12 students, a new paid leave program and a mandate that Minnesota utilities use 100% carbon-free energy sources by 2040.
The Hortmans were killed on June 14 in their Brooklyn Park home in a politically motivated assassination. Their deaths have roiled Minnesota politics.
Hortman was a Catholic Sunday school teacher whose politics were shaped by Catholic social teaching. She was a devotee of the Golden Rule, from Matthew, “Do unto others what you would have them do unto you.” So she would have endorsed the choice of Gospel reading Saturday, Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount, which is a fundamental text of Christianity.
“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God,” Griffith said. “Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness.”
In his sermon, Griffith highlighted Melissa and Mark Hortman’s service and community, which he called, “the antidote to our present afflictions” and a stark contrast to the “idol of autonomy” that has ravaged America’s political landscape.
Melissa and Mark Hortman met in Washington D.C. when they were both mentoring a student. Colin and Sophie Hortman, their adult children, released a statement in the days after their killings, calling for people to honor their parents’ legacy by standing up “for what you believe in, especially if that thing is justice and peace.”
Walz during his five-minute eulogy encouraged Minnesotans to find common humanity and “build a state equal to (the Hortmans’) aspirations and a politics worthy of their example.”
“Melissa was an extraordinary legislator, and Mark was her proudest supporter,” Walz said. “It’s easy sometimes to forget, for all of its significance, politics is just people. That’s all. It is just a bunch of human beings trying to do their best. Melissa understood that better than anybody.”
Robin Ann Williams, a close friend of Melissa and Mark, eulogized them at the request of the children. She remembered the Hortmans as anything but a stereotypical political family, just as focused on their children and dog and card nights and monthly dinners for law school friends as on the latest political flareup.
Williams also captured the dynamic between Melissa and her supportive husband.
“I always saw her as a balloon bouncing around, but still tethered to the earth by Mark,” Williams said.
Williams remembered the many dinners she shared with the Hortmans, including their last together on June 6 at an Italian restaurant in Robbinsdale. Walz had just called for a one-day special session, and Melissa was often getting up from the table to take calls from the governor or her DFL caucus members. No one at the table, including Mark Hortman, minded the disruption.
Even though many are grieved by the Hortmans’ deaths, Williams said that the couple would have wanted people to remember them with joy, citing Kahlil Gibran’s “The Prophet”:
“Some of you say joy is greater than sorrow, and others say, nay, sorrow is the greater. But I say unto you, they are inseparable. Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.”
Williams then said, “We are buried in sorrow right now, but I do believe that we will experience joy again. Mark and Melissa would not want it any other way. Goodbye, my friends.”
Colin Hortman ended the service with a prayer of St. Francis, which Melissa Hortman carried in her wallet.
Lord, make me an instrument of your peace:
where there is hatred, let me sow love;
where there is injury, pardon;
where there is doubt, faith;
where there is despair, hope;
where there is darkness, light;
where there is sadness, joy.
The procession departed in silence, except for the massive bell of The Basilica of St. Mary tolling, tolling.
The caskets were loaded into two hearses.
Walz handed Sophie and Colin Hortman American flags in the traditional 13-fold, for the Hortmans.
When the Hortmans were lying in state at the Capitol Friday, Rep. Michael Howard, DFL-Richfield, wondered aloud what Melissa Hortman — who was famously blunt and unimpressed with grandeur — would have thought about all the pageantry.
“I think she would have said, ‘It’s a bit much.’”

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)  Basin Electric Power Cooperative officials testified Monday that data centers are not behind the need for a natural gas-fired power plant in northwest North Dakota but it is getting requests from potential large-load customers. 
Basin officials made comments Monday at a Public Service Commission hearing in Williston on its proposed Bison Generation Station near Epping in eastern Williams County. 
The project would generate electricity from natural gas that is abundant in North Dakota’s oil-producing region. It also would generate power by using steam produced by the plant to turn turbines.  
The nearly $4 billion Bison Generation Station would be the first combined-cycle power plant in North Dakota. 
Basin Electric describes the project as one of the largest power generation projects in the cooperative’s history.
Benjamin Hertz, manager of power supply planning for Basin Electric, said the company is  forecasting higher levels of power use from traditional customers. 
“Much of this is due to oil and gas related activity in this region,” Hertz testified Monday. 
AI driving data center demand at accelerating pace 

Basin Electric, which provides power to smaller electric co-ops, last week announced it is developing a program to deal with large-load customers such as data centers. 
Hertz said Basin Electric has been approached with a great number of large load requests throughout its service territory that could require more power generation. 
“Basin Electric has resolved to plan for new large loads and data centers separately from its traditional load growth,” Hertz said. “This program has been designed to protect Basin Electric’s  existing member rate-payers.” 
The Bison Generation Station would have two roughly 745-megawatt units to produce about 1,490 megawatts of power. 
Jody DeLong testified as chair of the board for North Dakota Native Vote and as a concerned citizen. 
He questioned the need for such a large power plant, especially if it is not needed for data centers. 
He called the project a “$4 billion gamble” with no explanation for how it will benefit rate-payers while adding to greenhouse gas emissions. 
“There’s no clear, detailed load data for local communities, including the Mountrail-Williams Electric Cooperative, or other cooperatives in North Dakota, which would demonstrate an urgent or unmet energy need among residents,” DeLong said. 
The three-person Public Service Commission regulates for-profit electric utilities but not for member-owned cooperatives. 
Construction on the project could begin this year with the power plant being fully in service in 2030.
At peak construction in 2027, the project would employ about 1,000 people. It would employ about 50 people when complete. 
The PSC took no action after Monday’s hearing. Basin Electric will provide commissioners with more information in the coming weeks. 
In addition to PSC approval, the project will need a permit from the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality.

Mike Kehoe released his budget plan during the State of the State speech Jan. 28 in the Missouri House chamber (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Gov. Mike Kehoe made his first round of budget vetoes hurt Missouri lawmakers where it matters most, in the earmarked state funds they added to spending plans this year.
Kehoe on Monday signed the package of 13 spending bills passed by lawmakers this year, but not before vetoing $300 million in general revenue items and putting a hold on spending for $211 million more.
The list of cuts eliminated 109 of the 248 earmarked items tracked by The Independent throughout the budget process. Another 23 were reduced by the Republican governor’s use of the line-item veto and 23 more are under restriction, meaning the only way the money will be spent is if Kehoe specifically orders it or lawmakers vote to override him.
The cuts were necessary, Kehoe said in a news release, because state revenues are being squeezed by extra spending for public schools he did not support, tax cuts he does support and the cost of disaster relief from a major tornado in St. Louis and storms in other parts of the state.
In all, Kehoe issued 208 line-item vetoes and put restrictions on 32 expenditure items. The budget passed by lawmakers, the release said, had 450 items and nearly $775 million spending Kehoe did not recommend.
“We want to assure Missourians that this action is not indicative of a larger economic problem, as our economy remains strong and resilient,” Kehoe said in the release. “Just as President Trump and the federal government is reigning in spending, the State of Missouri must do the same. While we do not have an economic problem in Missouri, we do have a spending problem in state government.”
The vetoes and spending restrictions come despite a historically healthy state surplus and revenues for the current fiscal year that are exceeding expectations. Through Friday, revenues for the current fiscal were $216 million more than anticipated when the budget was written and $31 million more than an updated estimate made in December.
That will change in the coming year and beyond, the release said.
“The Office of Administration’s Division of Budget and Planning estimates a nearly $1 billion shortfall in general revenue starting in (fiscal year 2027),” the release stated. “Contributing to this shortfall, ongoing general revenue spending authorized in the (fiscal year 2026) budget is projected to outpace ongoing revenues by nearly over $1 billion and grow larger in future years.”
In the letters accompanying his budget actions, Kehoe refers regularly to the revenue issue as his basis for vetoes and restrictions.
“A course correction in state finances is not only warranted but will be constitutionally required to achieve a balanced budget in future years and safeguard Missouri’s financial security and AAA bond rating going forward,” Kehoe wrote.
When Kehoe released his budget proposal in January, it anticipated the state would end the current fiscal year with an unobligated general revenue balance of $2.6 billion. At that time, the unobligated surplus at the end of the coming fiscal year was projected at $1.4 billion, but during the recent special session state Budget Director Dan Haug told lawmakers he expects no more than half that amount — $600 million to $700 million — will remain on June 30, 2026.
  Missouri Senate Appropriations Chairman Lincoln Hough, right, discusses a budget item May 8 with House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton during negotiations over the fiscal 2026 budget (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
Kehoe is wrong to use uncertainty about future revenues and the size of the remaining surplus to justify his cuts, Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Lincoln Hough, a Republican from Springfield, said in an interview with The Independent.
He told the governor that in a conversation last week, Hough said.
“He said revenues aren’t really coming in where we thought they were,” Hough said. “And I said, ‘Well, governor, I hate to disagree with you on this, but it’s actually about a percent over what we agreed on for the (consensus revenue estimate) as far as I know right now.”
Lawmakers approved $53.4 billion in spending for the coming year, including $16 billion in general revenue. Kehoe’s actions reduced the total budget to $50.8 billion and $15.5 billion in general revenue. A large portion of the overall reduction is from Kehoe vetoing changes in how federal highway funds are managed.
Major new spending items in the budget include:

A $300 million increase for the foundation formula, the state’s basic aid program for public schools.
$107 million to revamp the child care payment system so providers receive their money at the beginning of each month for the children enrolled in their center.
$50 million to expand the number of children served by the MOScholars voucher program, which helps parents pay tuition at private and parochial schools.
A state employee pay raise plan based on longevity, with raises up to 10%, plus pay increases for Department of Corrections officers who work in high-security and administrative segregation areas.
Almost $93 million to pay off a judgment against the state for damages claimed by a vendor who worked on the state’s computerized Medicaid enrollment system. A $23 million judgment grew to more than $50 million as the state appealed and interest accrued. The appropriation includes both state and federal funds to allow flexibility in the way the judgment is paid.

The surplus revenue being used by lawmakers and Kehoe in the budget approved Monday represents money accumulated when tax collections increased at double-digit rates for two years and the state substituted federal COVID relief funds for general revenue spending.
The state collected $13.4 billion in general revenue last year and the consensus revenue estimate released in December projected receipts would decline by about 0.6% in the current fiscal year. Revenues through Friday were up by about 0.4%.
The projected increase in revenue for the coming year has evaporated because of a tax cut bill enacted by lawmakers that is awaiting Kehoe’s signature and possible revenue reductions due to federal tax changes.
The new tax break would allow investors to reap the profits from long-term capital gains — the increase in value of an asset held for 12 months or longer — without paying state income tax. The bill also would expand the “Circuit Breaker” tax credit intended to offset property taxes for lower-income seniors and people with disabilities.
The tax changes being debated at the federal level are also likely to lower Missouri tax collections. The House-passed version of the budget reconciliation bill would reduce Missouri tax receipts by at least $170 million in the coming year, experts have said, while changes to benefits such as Medicaid and food stamps could shift hundreds of millions of costs from federal to state taxpayers.
The vetoes and restrictions can be reversed by legislative override votes, which would take place in September. The vetoes and restrictions include, for example, almost every general revenue-funded road project added by lawmakers, including projects in Hough’s district, the district of Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, a Republican from Shelbina, and House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton, a Republican from Noel.
One item important to Deaton, $19 million to buy land in McDonald County for a state park in his district, drew a second veto, but most of the money made it through. Kehoe cut $7.5 million from the appropriation, while Gov. Mike Parson, who left office in January, vetoed a similar appropriation in its entirety a year ago.
Whether any of the vetoes or restrictions will be overridden will depend on how mad people are about them, Hough said.
“It just depends on what the specific line would be that would rise to the level of irritating people enough to the point where they say, ‘We want to go override the governor in his first year,’” Hough said.
This article was updated at 6:20 p.m. to correct the amount vetoed from the McDonald County park funding.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)New Iowa laws on issues from transgender civil rights protections to changes to Iowa’s unemployment insurance tax system will be officially enacted Tuesday.
July 1, the beginning of the fiscal year, is when most laws passed during a legislative session begin enforcement. However, there are some measures that have other start dates – for example, warnings will begin Tuesday for violations of Senate File 22, the law banning the use of cellphones while driving outside of hands-free or voice activated modes, but criminal charges will not start until January 2026.
Additionally, there are also several education-related laws that take effect July 1, but will not be enacted until the 2025-2026 school year begins.
Here’s what to know about some of the changes in Iowa Code taking effect:
Gender identity in the Iowa Civil Rights Act: The first bill Reynolds signed in the 2025 legislative session was  Senate File 418, removing gender identity as a protected class in the Iowa Civil Rights Act. As the measure takes effect, there will no longer be legal protections against discrimination in employment, housing, public accommodations and education for transgender individuals or others who have been denied access to these services or opportunities because of their gender identity.
This new law directly relates to another measure going into effect Tuesday through the state’s Health and Human Services appropriations bill, House File 1049. The law bans Medicaid coverage for transgender Iowans seeking gender-affirming health care, like sex reassignment surgery, hormone treatment therapy and other physical health care treatments for gender dysphoria. Previous attempts to enact a ban on Medicaid coverage for gender-related health care were struck down in court because of the protections provided by the Iowa Civil Rights Act.

Unemployment insurance taxes: Iowa will collect less in unemployment insurance taxes from employers with the enactment of Senate File 607. The law cuts the taxable wage base used in collecting unemployment insurance taxes from employers in half, from 66.7% to 33.4%, in addition to making changes to employer contribution rates. When signing the bill into law in early June, Reynolds said the change was “long overdue” in correcting overpayments into the state’s Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund .
Anti-SLAPP lawsuits: “Strategic lawsuits against public participation,” or SLAPP lawsuits, can see expedited relief in courts under House File 472. SLAPP lawsuits are cases brought by an entity against news organizations or activists to suppress public speech or reporting on an issue by engaging in an expensive, drawn-out legal battle. The new law will allow these lawsuits – court actions related to First Amendment rights, like the freedom of speech and press – to be addressed more quickly. The law passed includes a caveat that anti-SLAPP protections cannot be applied retroactively, meaning that only lawsuits filed July 1 onward are eligible for expedited relief.
Citizenship verification for voters: House File 954 allows registered voters to have their citizenship status challenged at the polls. However, supporters of the measure and Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, who proposed the law, say it also contains provision that will prevent the need for widespread voter eligibility challenges similar to what happened in the 2024 election, by allowing the Secretary of State’s office to verify citizenship status of registered voters before an election through contracts with state and federal agencies, as well as private entities.
The measure also includes a ban on ranked choice voting, though this component of the bill does not go into effect until Jan. 1, 2026.
Election recounts: The process for conducting – and calling –  election recounts in Iowa will be different under House File 928. Initial election results must be within a threshold of 1% or 50 votes, whichever is less, and within a 0.15% difference for recounts in statewide and federal races, for a candidate to request a recount under the new law. Previously, candidates could request a recount with no limitations on the margin of victory in initial results, though the state would only cover the costs of a recount if results were within one percentage point.
The law also changes the composition of election recount boards to be led by the county auditor, with staff and hired election workers making up the boards. An equal number of workers from each political party is required.
Pharmacy benefit managers: The law setting regulations on pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs),  Senate File 383, is a measure some pharmacists and supporters say will help keep rural and independent pharmacies across the state in business. The law stops PBMs, the entities that negotiate prescription drug prices between drug manufacturers, health insurance companies and pharmacies, from engaging in certain business practices that push consumers to use mail-order or specific pharmacies, like the use of financial incentives or penalties. It also sets a dispensing fee of $10.68 from PBMs to pharmacists for each prescription filled at rural and small pharmacies.
Though the law will be enacted Tuesday, a lawsuit from several businesses and organizations filed in late June is seeking to overturn the measure.
Firearm age limits: The minimum age to own and carry handguns, like pistols and revolvers, is lowered from age 21 to age 18 by House File 924. While buying a handgun from a federally licensed firearm dealer would still be banned for 18- to 20-year-olds under federal restrictions, the measure makes a change that lawmakers said addresses recent federal court decisions that found similar laws restricting firearms for adults under age 21 were unconstitutional.
Here are 11 new Iowa laws that include criminal penalties

Cellphones in school: With rules set to take effect as K-12 schools return for the 2025-2026 school year, House File 782 requires public K-12 school districts set policies that, at minimum, restrict the use of cellphones during instructional periods. The measure, one of Reynolds’ priorities for the 2025 legislative session, includes exceptions, such as students with an Individualized Education Program (IEP) or 504 plan that involves the use of a cellphone or other device in their accommodations, and when a school district approves a parent’s request for their child to retain access to their phone because of a “legitimate” reason related to their mental or physical health.
Fetal development instruction: Senate File 175 requires Iowa schools’ human growth and development classes for students in grades 5-12 include fetal development videos and graphics that depict “the humanity of the unborn child by showing prenatal human development, starting at fertilization.” The content shown in schools to meet this requirement cannot come from entities that perform or “promote” abortions, or that contract, affiliate, or make referrals to organizations which perform or promote abortions.
Threat assessment teams: Senate File 583 allows K-12 public school districts, private schools and charters schools to establish threat assessment teams to prevent school shootings and violence. These teams, which can be made up of school officials, law enforcement, mental health and social services workers, are able to share “reasonably necessary” information about students if their behavior is deemed a potential safety risk to other students or school staff.

Jason Dockter, R-Bismarck, speaks on the House floor on May 1, 2025. (Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Ethics Commission found Rep. Jason Dockter committed three ethics violations related to his ownership of a Bismarck building, but the agency did not hand down any penalties for the lawmaker.
The announcement, released Friday evening, marks the first time the commission has declared that a public official engaged in unethical behavior.
The Ethics Commission noted the Bismarck Republican likely leveraged his position and his relationships with state employees to arrange a lease with the Attorney General’s Office, according to the commission’s 93-page investigation report.
The report also identified unanswered questions regarding the finances of the building and highlighted challenges that stalled the investigation, including witnesses who declined to be interviewed.
ND Ethics Commission has no authority to punish officials violating ethics laws, state leaders argue

Dockter chose not to appeal the decision, according to the commission. The commission concluded that in this circumstance, it’s up to the Legislature to decide whether disciplinary action is necessary.
Dockter is the partial owner of a company that leases a building located at 1720 Burlington Drive in south Bismarck to the North Dakota Attorney General’s Office and Department of Health and Human Services. At one point, North Dakota Information Technology was also a tenant, according to the report.
In 2023, Dockter voted in favor of two budget bills that set aside money for the Attorney General’s Office and Department of Health and Human Services leases. State law and ethics rules forbid lawmakers from voting on legislation that could give them a unique financial benefit.
Eight different people submitted complaints about Dockter raising concerns about the building deal in September and October 2022, according to the report.
More than two-and-a-half years since the complaints were first filed, the Ethics Commission has concluded that these votes represented two violations of its conflict of interest rules.
Additionally, a 12-person Burleigh County jury last year found Dockter guilty of a criminal misdemeanor for casting the votes. The Ethics Commission considers this conviction a third ethical violation. A district court judge ordered him to complete 250 hours of community service and pay a $2,500 fine, in addition to 360 days of unsupervised probation. Dockter has completed those requirements, court records indicate.
Dockter did not respond to a request for comment sent to the attorney representing the company that owns the building, Monte Rogneby.
The commission recounted the lengthy saga of the building deal in its report, which drew from sources including witness interviews, court records and state investigations.
The report notes that Dockter’s violations “likely could have been avoided with education on how to disclose and manage conflicts of interest.”
“It is clear from the commission’s investigation there is a general lack of clarity on what a potential conflict of interest is and how to disclose and manage them when they come up,” the report states.
Jury finds Rep. Dockter guilty of misdemeanor conflict-of-interest charge

The commission’s report includes excerpts from a November 2024 interview of Dockter conducted by Ethics Commission staff. In the interview, Dockter stated that he did not believe at the time he cast the votes that that was breaking any ethics laws or rules. 
His reasoning included, among other things, that the bills did not single him out specifically, that the leases were only one small part of the budgets and that his votes wouldn’t have changed the outcome of the legislation.
The commission also discovered that Dockter partially owns three other Bismarck properties that are leased or were previously leased to state entities:

601 Channel Drive, which was previously leased to the Highway Patrol and is now rented to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation
1700 Schafer St., which is leased to Bismarck State College
1838 E Interstate Ave., which is leased to the North Dakota Board of Pharmacy

The commission says that its conflict of interest rules don’t set specific penalties for violators, so the agency did not penalize Dockter for the violations.  
According to the commission, the Legislative Assembly can make a determination of whether Dockter violated House rules requiring lawmakers to declare conflicts on bills they have special interests with. It also has the discretion to pursue disciplinary action against Dockter.
Dockter during the 2025 legislative session declared conflicts of interest on bills multiple times, the report states.
The Ethics Commission said that it ran into several roadblocks that stalled the completion of its investigation into Dockter. It had to the investigation on hold while the criminal case against him proceeded, for one.
The commission also struggled to get agencies including the Attorney General’s Office and Legislative Council to turn over records. 
Legislative leaders to discuss ethics rules after guilty verdict

According to the commission, the Attorney General’s Office declined to provide some email records and documents from a Montana investigation commissioned by the state into the building deal. The agency did provide some other requested records, however, the report states.
The Attorney General’s Office also did not respond to the North Dakota Monitor’s request for comment Monday.
The Ethics Commission also was unable to obtain Dockter’s legislative emails. Lawmaker emails are not public records, though emails of other state officials are public. Legislative Council Director John Bjornson said he needed either a waiver from Dockter or a subpoena to provide the emails, according to the Ethics Commission’s report. The commission declined to pursue the emails.
Additionally, some witnesses — including Bureau of Criminal Investigation Division Director Lonnie Grabowska and Liz Brocker, former executive assistant to Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem — refused requests for interviews from the commission. Grabowska instead asked for questions to be sent over email which he said would “allow for the exchange of question and answer in an effective manner,” according to the report.
The Ethics Commission noted it does not have a clear way to obtain a subpoena to compel people to sit for interviews or force agencies to produce records.
The report also called on the Legislature, the Legislative Audit and Fiscal Review Committee and the Office of the State Auditor to look into lingering questions regarding the lease deal.
Sources cited in the report dispute whether all of the money that went into the property was authorized by the Legislature. For one, the money the Attorney General’s Office spent on the building ultimately went more than $1.5 million over its initial estimate.
The report notes that the property and the Attorney General’s Office have been unable to mutually settle the financials of the building renovation.
The Ethics Commission also suggests the Office of State Auditor should consider conducting a more comprehensive performance audit of the Attorney General’s Office regarding the building project. 
It’s unclear what steps the Legislature might take with respect to the commission’s recommendations. House Majority Leader Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson, did not respond to a request for comment Monday. 
The Ethics Commission was established in 2018 by a voter-initiated amendment to the state constitution. It’s tasked with promoting ethical behavior in the areas of elections, transparency, corruption and lobbying.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey lawmakers approved a $58.8 billion spending bill in votes that largely fell along party lines just hours before a deadline that would have sent the state government into a shutdown.
The budget, which Gov. Phil Murphy must sign before midnight, maintains a full pension payment and promises to send more than $12 billion to aid the state’s K-12 schools, but it dips into state reserves to support a structural deficit that has expanded above the levels Murphy pitched in February.
“What does this budget include? It includes record amounts of property tax relief. It includes fully funding the pension payment for the fifth year in a row, fully funding the school funding formula,” said Sen. Paul Sarlo, the chamber’s budget chairman.
The Senate approved the bill in a 26-13 vote, while the Assembly approved it in a 52-27 vote with one abstention.
The governor is expected to sign the bill later Monday. It’s unclear whether he’ll employ a line-item veto that could strike specific spending items without spiking the entire spending bill.
Democratic lawmakers praised the bill for its reversals of some cuts proposed by Murphy.
“I think the budget came out pretty well. There’s a tremendous amount of spending on really important things,” said Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union)
The plan includes a $6.7 billion surplus the state is forecasted to maintain at the end of the fiscal year that begins July 1. While reduced from the record levels seen in recent years — the state’s reserves pushed to above $10 billion in fiscal year 2024 but have since been reduced by deficit spending — the surplus is still among the largest in state history.
The budget will continue to run a structural deficit. Spending levels in the bill exceed revenue — including from one-shot sources that cannot or will not recur in the fiscal year that begins in July 2026 — by $1.5 billion, down from $2.1 billion the prior year but up from the $1.2 billion Murphy proposed in February.
Republican members criticized the spending bill’s size and breakneck passage. Those misgivings have become something of a yearly exercise for GOP lawmakers who have seen the budget swell from the $35.5 billion approved in Chris Christie’s final year as governor.
“The truth about the budget is that it continues us on an unsustainable path. The budget does not make New Jersey more affordable. We are once again spending too much,” said Assemblywoman Nancy Munoz (R-Union), the chamber’s GOP budget officer.
Much of those increases can be attributed to heightened pension payments and school aid, which have risen by nearly $8.8 billion under Murphy.
“We can all agree this budget spends more than Gov. Murphy’s budget in 2018. But why? Let’s talk about where the budget growth has been focused. The top six drivers in spending growth are the following: the pension payment, school funding, direct property tax relief, Medicaid health benefits, and programs for the developmentally disabled,” said Assemblywoman Eliana Pintor Marin (D-Essex), the chamber’s budget chair.

The budget includes payments under Stay NJ, a property tax relief program that promises to halve seniors’ property tax bills, to a cap of $6,500. Stay NJ will pay a half-year’s benefit in the fiscal year that begins July 1.
Republicans also derided new taxes both chambers approved Monday. Those include higher fees on the sale of properties worth more than $2 million, casinos’ online wagering wins, cigarettes, and electronic cigarette fluid.
The budget has faced criticism from other corners, including from high-ranking members of the administration. Acting State Comptroller Kevin Walsh railed against a provision that would bar officials from blocking Medicaid payments to low-performing nursing homes.
“If the budget passes without changes, the Legislature will be on the side of bad nursing homes that harm New Jersey’s most vulnerable residents — without even giving the public a chance to weigh in,” Walsh warned on social media Sunday.
Attorney General Matt Platkin railed against provisions that would divert $45 million in opioid settlement money to the state’s general fund, arguing those dollars were meant to fund addiction treatment and not be used to support overall state spending.
Others took aim at diversions from the state’s Clean Energy Fund. NJ Transit is set to receive $140.1 million in clean energy money in the coming July-to-June fiscal year, and the budget would pull an additional $50 million of its dollars into the general fund.
The diversions have irked progressive and environmental groups that charge money from the fund should be used for renewable energy projects. They said pulling its funds into the state budget could delay generation capacity that could push down spiking electricity prices.
“The public is being told we’re making progress in making our state’s energy system more affordable and reliable, but the budget tells a very different story,” said Anjuli Ramos-Busot, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club. “We urge lawmakers to reverse this raid and deliver a budget that invests in the future, not robs from it.”
Antoinette Miles, state director for the New Jersey Working Families Party, said the spending bill does too little to insulate New Jersey from expected federal cuts that could deprive it of between $2.5 and $5 billion in federal Medicaid dollars. The budget, she said, “fails to meet the moment.”
Business groups welcomed some parts of the budget — like sales tax exemptions for baby items like cribs and tax credits for manufacturers — they chiefly worried it would make New Jersey businesses less competitive.
