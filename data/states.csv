WILMINGTON, Del. — A field of more than 450 American flags along the Christina Riverfront is setting the tone for many Delaware Veterans’ Day Tributes, as communities statewide prepare to honor service members with ceremonies, open houses and quiet moments of remembrance on Tuesday, Nov. 11.
The Wilmington Rotary Club’s annual “Flags for Heroes” display transforms the Riverwalk into a patriotic corridor, with rows of flags flying in honor of veterans, first responders, teachers, health care workers and everyday heroes. Community members can sponsor flags in tribute to the heroes in their lives, with proceeds supporting the Rotary Club’s Service Foundation and charitable partners, including the Food Bank of Delaware, to help provide meals and support for local children and families in need. Volunteers install and maintain the flags, turning the project into a visible act of service that links gratitude with hands-on help.
Delaware Veterans’ Day Tributes:
In New Castle, the Delaware River and Bay Authority will host one of the state’s central Veterans Day observances at Veterans Memorial Park, 163 Cherry Lane, adjacent to the Delaware Memorial Bridge. The day begins with a 10 a.m. dedication of the newly expanded Wall of Remembrance, followed by the official Veterans Day Service from 10:30 a.m. to noon, sponsored by the Delaware Commission of Veterans Affairs and hosted by DRBA. The expanded monument honors thousands of service members from Delaware and New Jersey who gave their lives in service to the nation. President Joe Biden is expected to participate in this event, as he did throughout much of his Presidency.
Kent County will stage another major statewide event at 2 p.m., when Kent County Chapter 850 of the Vietnam Veterans of America hosts its Veterans Day Ceremony inside the Kent County Levy Court building in Dover. Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. William Welser III is scheduled to deliver the keynote address. The indoor venue replaces the traditional outdoor setting due to weather concerns and will focus on reflection, recognition and remarks rather than wreath-laying.
Across Delaware, Veterans Day remains a personal observance for many families, shaped by generations of military service, the presence of Dover Air Force Base and the strong footprint of National Guard and Reserve units. Local events on Tuesday offer residents multiple opportunities to say thank you in person.
At the Wilmington VA Medical Center, 1601 Kirkwood Hwy., commemorative activities are expected to bring together veterans, families and staff while connecting them with health care and support services.
In Lewes, American Legion Post 17, 113 American Legion Rd., plans a Veterans Day gathering and ceremony, followed by fellowship among veterans and supporters.
In Wilmington, Diamond State VFW Post 2863, 8 Ashley Pl., and VFW Post 2907, 313 Brandywine Blvd., will hold observances and open houses, inviting neighbors to honor local veterans and learn more about veterans’ organizations. VFW Post 8801, 4941 Wheatleys Pond Rd. in Smyrna, is also expected to host a commemorative service.
In Seaford, American Legion Nanticoke Post 6 will hold an 11 a.m. ceremony at Kiwanis Park, followed by a 12:30 p.m. open house at 230 N. Front St. VFW Virgil Wilson Post 4961, 9767 Middleford Rd., will host its own Veterans Day program and open house for southern Delaware residents.
Along the coast, VFW Post 7447 will lead an 11 a.m. ceremony at the Rehoboth Beach Bandstand, followed by open houses at area posts.
Millsboro’s Amvets Post 2 on Long Neck Road will host an 11 a.m. ceremony with a guest speaker and lunch, welcoming veterans, families, and community members.
In Wilmington and Hockessin, Goldey-Beacom College will hold a Veterans’ Appreciation Luncheon at 11 a.m., featuring the Delaware Military Academy Color Guard, highlighting connections between students, campus leaders, and those who served.
From the Riverfront flags to Levy Court in Dover, Veterans Memorial Park in New Castle and hometown posts across all three counties, Delaware’s Veterans Day observances underscore a shared message: service and sacrifice are honored not just in history books, but in the lives of neighbors, coworkers, parents, children and friends who answered the call — and in the communities that continue to stand with them.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/240522174_10225628141920250_6921445021049742016_n-1.jpg,,,2025-11-10 09:18:49.666792

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)State elections officials have begun reviewing signatures gathered by people opposed to Alaska’s system of open primary elections and ranked-choice general elections to determine whether a repeal ballot measure will appear before voters in 2026.
Alaskans enacted the state’s existing elections system via a ballot measure in 2020, and a repeal measure last year failed by only 737 votes out of 320,985 cast. 
Proponents of the repeal vowed at that time to renew their effort and began gathering signatures in February to force another vote. 
Based on state law and the number of people who voted in the 2024 statewide election, repeal supporters needed to collect signatures from at least 34,099 registered voters, including a certain minimum number in at least 30 of the 40 state House districts.
This week, supporters of the repeal measure said they were submitting more than 48,000 signatures to the Alaska Division of Elections for review. 
If the repeal petition is deemed to have enough signatures, it would go before voters in either the 2026 primary or the 2026 general election, depending upon the length of next year’s state legislative session.
If voters approve the measure in 2026, all three components of the 2020 ballot measure would be repealed. 
That would have three main results. Financial donors to political campaigns would be able to conceal their identity by contributing to a political nonprofit, which could donate money to causes on their behalf. 
The 2020 law, currently in effect, requires campaigns to disclose the “true source” of their money.
The second effect would be the repeal of the state’s open primary system, in which all candidates, regardless of political party, run in the same race. Under the current law, the top four vote-getters in a given race advance to the general election.
If that is repealed, political parties would be able to determine the rules for deciding which of their candidates advance to the November general election.
The third change is to general election. Instead of voters being allowed to rank all candidates in order of preference, voters would be able to choose only one candidate, and the candidate with the most votes would win.
One other ballot measure, which would reimpose a limit on financial donations to political candidates, has already been certified and is slated for the 2026 ballot.
Two other ballot measures remain in the signature-gathering process. One would decriminalize several psychedelic substances, and the other would reinforce the state’s existing prohibition on noncitizen voting. 
Backers of those measures must gather sufficient signatures before the start of the January legislative session in order to force a vote in 2026.

Scheduling note: WhatMatters is honoring our veterans on Tuesday and will return to your inboxes on Wednesday.
First unveiled in 2017, Google Lens enables users of Google devices and software to look up physical objects, translate text and conduct visual searches within seconds. But with the proliferation of artificial intelligence, its use inside the classroom is posing a challenge among teachers and potentially harming students’ ability to learn effectively.
As CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones explains, millions of California’s 5.8 million K-12 students use Google laptops known as Chromebooks. AI-powered tools such as Lens have made it easier for students to cheat on digital tests by allowing them to highlight text on their laptops and having Lens spit out near-instant explanations or interpretations.
Dustin Stevenson, a high school English teacher at the Los Angeles Unified School District, said he noticed students in his class, who were previously struggling throughout the semester, were suddenly acing tests following the latest update to Lens. 
For William Heuisler, a high school ethnic studies teacher in L.A., the distractions on learning posed by Chromebooks got to the point where he had to ditch technology altogether in his classroom and return to pencil and paper.

Heuisler: “Can you get by in life not knowing how to write, how to express yourself? I don’t know, but I hope not.”

Research backs Heuisler’s concerns: A recent study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that students who use AI for help writing essays had 55% less cognitive activity than those who didn’t.
In the meantime, L.A. Unified has decided to keep Lens on its student laptops, according to a district spokesperson. It has placed some guardrails, however, including allowing students access to the tool after they completed a lesson on digital literacy.

Federal judge bars Trump from deploying CA National Guard troops to Portland

An Oregon district court judge sided with California on Friday, issuing a permanent injunction blocking President Donald Trump’s deployment of state National Guard troops to Portland, Ore., including California’s.
The decision wraps up a three-day trial between the Trump administration against California, Oregon and the city of Portland.In a sprawling 106-page ruling, federal judge Karin Immergut, a Trump-appointee, pointed to evidence that the violence by protesters outside a federal immigration detention facility in Portland didn’t rise to a level that threatened the federal government or prevented its operations. She also wrote that local police did their jobs in quelling any unrest and questioned the reliability of the federal government’s claims that protesters severely damaged the federal facility or breached it. 

The ruling: “There is no evidence that the protesters outside the Portland ICE building acted with a purpose to overtake an instrumentality of government by unlawful or antidemocratic means. … Finally, it is telling that all of Defendants’ evidence of danger predates July 5 — more than two months prior to the President’s federalization of the National Guard.”

Immergut’s ruling follows her temporary block that sided with California and Oregon last month. This is the second time a district judge sided with California against Trump’s use of the military after a trial. 
Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court is weighing an emergency appeal by the Trump administration over its sending of National Guard troops in Illinois, which remains temporarily blocked by lower courts. Its ruling may have national implications over how courts consider future disputed troop deployments. 



CA state park reopens following Palisades Fire

Ten months after the Palisades Fire ripped through L.A. County and killed 12 people, Will Rogers State Historic Park finally reopened Saturday, albeit partially, after remaining off-limits since the devastating wildfire broke out.
Members of the public can again access about 4.2 miles of trails and visit the park’s main lawn and picnic area, returning precious parkland to a region with a limited supply of green space. Will Rogers has also opened up its equestrian operations, though on a smaller scale as restorations continue. Its remaining 4.8 miles of trails are still closed for repair.
The Jan. 7 Palisades wildfire burned about 8,000 acres of state parks land, including Will Rogers’ famed ranch house, park facilities and hundreds of historic trees located in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
The park’s reopening is “cathartic for both park staff and visitors,” said Noa Khalili, the acting senior environmental scientist of the state parks’ Angeles district who helped save historic artifacts from the ranch house.

Khalili: “(The fire) is traumatic to those of us who work here in this beautiful place. And so the process of repair and restoration is healing.”




CA officials to attend international climate change conference

From CalMatters’ climate reporter Alejandro Lazo and environmental justice reporter Alejandra Reyes-Velarde:
As the United Nations Climate Change Conference begins, California officials are the highest profile American delegation this week in Bélem, Brazil. Though the Trump administration has abandoned the Paris climate agreement and won’t send officials to the talks, subnational governments like California can’t sit in at the negotiations. But representing the world’s fourth largest economy, Gov. Gavin Newsom will burnish the state’s reputation — and his own — for clean-energy policy and regional agreements. 
Scholars say the state’s presence in Bélem does carry some weight. 

David G. Victor, UC San Diego climate policy professor: “If we weren’t doing things like this, then the rest of the world would be even more puzzled as to what’s going on inside the United States. The symbolic value of showing that the United States has not completely abandoned climate and clean energy … is pretty important for the rest of the world, but there’s not a huge caloric value to it.”




UC strike averted

The University of California dodged what could have been one of the biggest labor strikes in its history, after reaching a tentative agreement on Saturday with the University Professional and Technical Employees labor group. 
The union represents 21,000 health care professionals, technical and research support professionals. After 17 months of negotiations, it threatened a two-day walkout on Nov. 17 that included other allied unions. The statewide strike was expected to total more than 80,000 workers, including health care workers and nurses at five medical centers — crippling the university system’s health and research operations.
The tentative agreement includes wage increases, caps on health care premium increases and “improvements in work-life balance, career progression, and job security,” according to UPTE.






California Voices
Instead of promising equal treatment, Proposition 209 preserves discrimination, and gives legal cover to dismantle every attempt at redress, writes Marcus Anthony Hunter, professor of Sociology and African American Studies at UCLA.
With health care costs vastly outpacing inflation and wage growth, limiting growth in health care costs is both fair and essential, write Amanda McAllister-Wallner and Kiran Savage-Sangwan, executive directors of Health Access California and the California Pan Ethnic Health Network, respectively.

Amanda McAllister-Wallner
Amanda McAllister-Wallner is executive director of Health Access California, a consumer advocacy coalition.


Kiran Savage-Sangwan
Kiran Savage-Sangwan is executive director of the California Pan Ethnic Health Network, which mobilizes communities of color to advocate for health equity. 


A new poll shows 8 out of 10 Californians are worried about the cost of health care and want the state’s next governor to bring down out-of-pocket costs. 
Without action, the cost burden of health care will worsen next year for 1.5 million Californians, because Congressional Republicans refuse to extend federal subsidies that make health insurance affordable through Covered California.  
Instead of making care more affordable, the California Hospital Association recently sued to block a state initiative designed to slow the stratospheric rise in health care costs and prevent Californians from being priced out of life-saving care.  
This legal action from the hospital group demonstrates that, even as state leaders work to minimize damage from federal health care cuts, they also must continue holding the health care industry accountable for delivering quality care without wasting our precious health care dollars. 
As advocates for health consumers and marginalized communities, we believe limiting growth in health care costs is both fair and essential. Increases in health care costs have vastly outpaced inflation and wage growth. 
Yet research shows more expensive health care has not improved our health outcomes, equity, or access. According to the California Health Care Foundation, “health care costs and medical debt are making Californians sicker.” 
A 2024 survey found more than half of Californians skipped or postponed care due to costs. Among Californians with low incomes, that number rose to 3 out of 4. More than half of those who skipped care said their health was worse as a result.
Consumer advocates backed the creation of California’s Office of Health Care Affordability in 2022 and have worked closely with it developing cost reduction strategies. The board spent years hearing from experts, advocates, and everyday Californians. It considered a variety of cost reduction approaches before setting an annual 3% price growth target, aligned with the typical growth in workers’ wages. 
Raking in profits
Hospitals may not like the outcome since it ends their ability to set whatever prices they want —  no matter how much they harm consumers and our economy. This lawsuit is a blatant attempt to change the rules of the game.
Hospital executives claim that high health care prices reflect hospitals’ focus on equity or superior compensation paid to health care workers. 
Yet California Health Care Foundation data show that about 25 cents of every dollar in the health care system, or up to $73 billion dollars a year, “doesn’t help patients get better care or become healthier.”
Instead, these costs result from such factors as administrative bloat and excess profits the health care industry generates by eliminating competition. 
Hospitals’ claims of financial stress also deserve further scrutiny. As some hospitals struggle, major health care systems are raking in profits, while working families struggle to pay bills. 
Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, the state’s largest hospital chain, had revenue over $32.7 billion, net assets over $46 billion, and a CEO it paid more than $12 million in 2023. 
Other wealthy hospitals, like Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Scripps Memorial Hospital, and Loma Linda University Medical Center benefit from tax breaks that far exceed their charitable and community contributions.
It is particularly galling that the hospital lawsuit invokes “equity” no less than 50 times in an attempt to justify price-gouging. 
In reality, high prices worsen inequality, as they result in people of color being more likely to delay or skip care. If hospital leaders genuinely cared about equity, they’d work to lower costs, not defend pushing care out of reach.
Gov. Gavin Newsom and California’s state leaders have led groundbreaking efforts to tackle health care affordability. Now they’re pushing back against President Donald Trump and Republican leaders’ drive to terminate Medi-Cal coverage for millions and hike costs for Covered California enrollees. 
The hospital industry’s lawsuit underscores that protecting Californians’ health — and our pocketbooks — requires holding the industry accountable at the same time.

Critics now say such programs are discriminatory.,"Guest Commentary written by

Marcus Anthony Hunter
Marcus Anthony Hunter is a professor  of Sociology and African American Studies at UCLA 


California likes to think of itself as a laboratory for progress. But when it comes to racial equity in higher education, the experiment has failed. 
Two stories broke recently that show just how twisted the state’s idea of “fairness” has become. A scholarship at UC San Diego — created to honor victims of Klan violence and help Black students — was forced open to white applicants after a legal challenge. Think about that. A program meant to repair racial terror now has to include descendants of those who were never targets of it.
Then Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill that would have let public colleges prioritize descendants of enslaved people in admissions — a modest acknowledgment of history. Vetoed.
These aren’t isolated incidents. They’re symptoms of the same disease: California’s anti-discrimination laws are now tools for preserving discrimination. It’s a legal sentiment that has travelled west to east.
California’s Proposition 209 is where it started. Passed in 1996, it bans public institutions from considering race in education, employment, and contracting. The pitch was simple: treat everyone the same. The reality has been anything but.
Black enrollment across the UC system tanked after Prop 209. At UCLA and Berkeley, Black students remain drastically underrepresented even as California grows more diverse. 
But the law didn’t stop at admissions. Its “colorblind” logic metastasized, infecting scholarships, support programs and outreach efforts.
Now we’re living with the consequences. The UCSD scholarship case and Newsom’s veto both spring from the same trap: Prop 209 made it illegal to center race, even when systemic racism is exactly what needs addressing. California painted itself into a corner where a remedy looks like privilege and repair looks like discrimination.
Let’s be clear — programs supporting Black students were never about giving someone an unfair edge. Rather, racial equity initiatives are about course correction. Centuries of exclusion — from schools, from property ownership, from public life — required a legal apparatus, and so does any solution meant to repair the harm and damage.
When a scholarship designed to address racial violence gets forced to “include everyone,” the whole point disappears. When a bill recognizing the descendants of enslaved people gets killed for threatening “neutrality,” the state isn’t neutral. It’s actively maintaining inequality.
Prop 209 promised equal treatment. Instead, it gave legal cover to dismantle every attempt at redress. Equality became a cudgel against equity.
These decisions have consequences beyond symbolism. Black students lose funding. Admissions officers back away from targeted outreach. “Fairness” becomes code for inaction. And when every race-conscious remedy gets stripped away, campuses become less representative, less vibrant and less honest about the ground they stand on.
A new definition for discrimination
The definition of discrimination is flipping before our eyes. It used to mean perpetual exclusion of a group of people; now it means helping the excluded. A scholarship for Black students becomes discrimination. Two centuries of systematic exclusion somehow aren’t.
California has been at a major crossroads, see-sawing between anti-discrimination and anti-Black policies and practices. California doesn’t have to stay stuck here. 
Even under Prop 209, we have options. Intentional partnerships with private funders to support targeted scholarships is one option, alongside expanding outreach to Black communities and schools. Using race-neutral proxies — such as neighborhood data, family wealth, school quality — to shape admissions and aid is another possibility. 
Most importantly, we must tell the truth: You cannot spell equality without equity, which means equality without repair isn’t justice.
California used to lead on innovation and inclusion. If we want to resume or assume that leadership role again, we need to admit what’s obvious: Even in Blue states, a colorblind system still produces color-coded results. Downplaying distinctions only increases and solidifies racial gaps in wealth, health, education, access, safety and happiness.
Real fairness isn’t pretending race doesn’t exist. It’s seeing clearly what race has done — and choosing to repair the damage.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/061321_StandfordCommencement_HM_CM-03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-10 08:56:21.708756

Some teachers say that AI tools, particularly Google Lens, have made it impossible to enforce academic integrity in the classroom — with potentially harmful long-term effects on students’ learning.



A few months ago, a high school English teacher in Los Angeles Unified noticed something different about his students’ tests. Students who had struggled all semester were suddenly getting A’s. He suspected some were cheating, but he couldn’t figure out how.
Until a student showed him the latest version of Google Lens.
Google had recently made the visual search tool easier to use on the company’s Chrome browser. When users click on an icon hidden in the tool bar, a moveable bubble pops up. Wherever the bubble is placed, a sidebar appears with an artificial intelligence answer, description, explanation or interpretation of whatever is inside the bubble. For students, it provides an easy way to cheat on digital tests without typing in a prompt, or even leaving the page. All they have to do is click.
“I couldn’t believe it,” said teacher Dustin Stevenson. “It’s hard enough to teach in the age of AI, and now we have to navigate this?”
Keeping up with students’ methods of cheating has always been a cat-and-mouse game for teachers. But some now say that AI tools, particularly Lens, have made it impossible to enforce academic integrity in the classroom — with potentially harmful long-term effects on students’ learning.
‘A terrible idea’
Lens has been around for nearly a decade. It’s the camera technology that scans QR codes or identifies objects in photos. But as AI has evolved, its uses have expanded, and Google has made it more available to users, especially those using Chrome, the Google browser.
During the COVID school closures, most school districts in California gave students Chromebook laptops to do remote work. Thousands of those laptops were actually donated by Google. After schools reopened for in-person learning, schools kept using the Chromebooks, making them an integral part of classroom instruction.
Millions of California’s 5.8 million K-12 students use Chromebooks, making it by far the most popular laptop option in schools. 
For William Heuisler, a high school ethnic studies teacher in Los Angeles, the ubiquity of Chromebooks was the first red flag.
“After COVID-19, it was clear that Chromebooks were a terrible idea in my classroom,” Heuisler said. Students used the laptops to play games during class, watch soccer matches and otherwise focus on anything but the lesson plan. 
Then came AI, with its immense potential to enhance education — and facilitate cheating. That’s when Heuisler decided to ditch technology altogether in his classroom and return to the basics: pencil and paper. Tests, homework and in-class assignments are all on paper. The school already bans cell phones.
It’s more work for him, but worth it, he said. 
“We want teenagers to think independently, voice their opinions, learn to think critically,” Heuisler said. “But if we give them a tool that allows them to not develop those skills, I’m not sure we’re actually helping them. Can you get by in life not knowing how to write, how to express yourself? I don’t know, but I hope not.”
AI and cognitive activity
Heuisler is not alone, according to research from the Center for Democracy and Technology. In a recent nationwide survey, the organization found that more than 70% of teachers say that because of AI, they have concerns about whether students’ work is actually their own. Nearly 75% of teachers say they worry students aren’t learning important skills like writing, research and reading comprehension.
The impact on students’ learning appears to be real, according to a recent study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The study, “Your Brain on ChatGPT,” found that students who use AI for help writing essays showed significantly less cognitive activity than those who didn’t, and often couldn’t remember details from essays they had just written. The essays themselves were also of poorer quality, with limited ideas, sentence structures and vocabulary compared to the essays written by students who didn’t rely on AI.
Nonetheless, about 85% of teachers and students use AI in the classroom, the Center for Democracy and Technology found. Teachers use it to organize lesson plans and grade papers, and students use it to do things like research and brainstorming. 
Lack of consistent rules
But rules related to its use vary widely. The California Department of Education offers extensive guidance on how teachers can use AI in the classroom, but no strict requirements — even regarding students who use AI to cheat. One video urges teachers not to punish students caught using AI to write an essay. Instead, the video encourages teachers to come up with essay assignments that can’t be easily written by a machine, or require students to provide their notes and cite AI just like they would cite any other source for an essay. 
Even within schools, teachers have different AI rules. Some encourage students to incorporate AI into their work, while others ban it outright. A recent survey by RAND research organization found only 34% of teachers said their school or district had consistent policies related to AI and cheating, and 80% of students said their teachers haven’t provided guidance on how to use AI for schoolwork.
That confusion is the crux of the problem, said Alix Gallagher, a director at Policy Analysis for California Education who has studied AI use in schools. Because there are few clear rules about AI use, students and teachers tend to have “significantly” different views about what constitutes cheating, according to a recent report by the education nonprofit Project Tomorrow.  
“Because adults aren’t clear, it’s actually not surprising that kids aren’t clear,” Gallagher said. “It’s adults’ responsibility to fix that, and if adults don’t get on the same page they will make it harder for kids who actually want to do the ‘right’ thing.”
Districts need to provide high-quality training for teachers and consistent policies for AI use in the classroom, so everyone knows what the rules are and teachers know how to navigate the new technology, she said.
Unsustainable?
In Hillary Freeman’s government class at Piedmont High School near Oakland, AI is all but forbidden. If students use AI to write a paper, they get a zero. She only allows students to use AI to summarize complex concepts, write practice questions for a self-assessment or when Freeman explicitly permits it for a specific task.
She appreciates that AI can sometimes be useful, but she worries that it’s too easy for students to use it as a crutch.
“Reasoning, logic, problem-solving, writing — these are skills that students need,” Freeman said. “I fear that we’re going to have a generation with huge cognitive gaps in critical thinking skills. … It’s really concerning to me. I want their futures to be bright.”
Detecting students’ use of AI is another obstacle, she said. It means spending time digging through version histories of students’ work, or using AI plagiarism screeners, which are sometimes inaccurate and more likely to flag English learners.
“It’s a huge ‘add’ to my job, and it doesn’t seem sustainable,” Freeman said. 
Digital literacy and academic integrity
Google, meanwhile, so far has no plans to remove Lens from its Chrome browsers, even on school-issued laptops, although it is continuing to test various levels of accessibility. It recently paused a “homework help” Lens shortcut button, in response to feedback from users. 
The tech giant encourages students and teachers to learn more about positive and ethical uses of AI and how it can enhance learning. It’s also invested more than $40 million in AI literacy for students and teachers over the past few years.
“Students have told us they value tools that help them learn and understand things visually, so we have been running tests offering an easier way to access Lens while browsing,” said Google spokesman Craig Ewer. “We continue to work closely with educators and partners to improve the helpfulness of our tools that support the learning process.”
School administrators also have the option of disabling Lens on district-issued Chromebooks. 
Los Angeles Unified has decided to keep Lens on its student laptops, at least for now, because the tool has plenty of positive uses that students should have the opportunity to explore the technology, a district spokesperson said.
But the district has instituted some guardrails: the tool is only available to students who have completed a lesson on digital literacy, and students and teachers must comply with the district’s academic integrity and responsible-use-of-technology rules. Those rules include bans on plagiarism and cheating.  
“As new digital tools evolve, we continuously evaluate how they are used within our schools. When certain technologies or features may present concerns, we carefully analyze the risks, benefits, and overall impact on the learning environment,” a district spokesperson said.
This isn’t the district’s first challenge with AI technology. In 2024 Superintendent Alberto Carvalho unveiled a nearly $3 million chatbot called Ed, only to shelve it three months later when the company laid off half its staff.
Meanwhile, Stevenson said Lens vanished from his students’ Chromebooks last week after he alerted the district that some students were using it to cheat.
“It’s encouraging, but it also reveals how haphazard the introduction of AI has been,” Stevenson said. “Teachers and school leaders spend countless hours considering each detail of the learning experience, then Google totally undermines it with the click of a button. This isn’t how education is supposed to work.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/032823_EthnicStudies_CM_11.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-10 08:56:21.708756

The committee approved nearly $22 million in contracts for the Alabama State Department of Education on Thursday.(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The Joint Legislative Contract Review Committee approved $21.7 million in contracts for the Alabama State Department of Education (ALSDE) on Thursday afternoon.
Two of the contracts aim to help ALSDE comply with the 2019 Literacy Act, ALSDE’s Director of Governmental Affairs Tina Hammonds said. A nearly $21 million contract with Lexia Learning Systems, a company based in Texas, will help prepare teachers to teach in the science of reading, including multi-sensory language instruction for K-3 teachers, reading specialists, and higher education faculty. 
“We started with teaching the teachers in college to be able to teach the students that are going to be teachers,” Hammonds said. “Then we have to go into the field to teach the teachers that are already in the field. Then we’ll be able to have a continuum for both sets to be able to have further learnings.”

The contract is 100% state-funded. Sen. Chris Elliott, R-Josephine, said that the contract will prevent more taxpayer dollars from being spent on training.
“I hope that is the result of this, and that is that we don’t have to spend additional state taxpayer dollars to train teachers in state colleges and universities to do what they are there to do and get a degree in,” he said.
Hammonds said that is the goal, but implementation of the Literacy and Numeracy acts will take time.
“This is the new standard we’re working on, the Numeracy Act and Literacy Act to try to make sure that the different forms of higher education and the different ed prep programs and the two and four year college opportunities are all preparing teachers that are going to come back for licenses in our state,” she said. 
The committee also approved a $760,000 contract with American Institutes for Research, based in Virginia, to help teachers teach fourth through eighth graders who are falling behind in reading. The contract is 100% federally funded.
“We want to make sure that those kids don’t continue to be intermediate as they move forward,” Hammonds said. “That’s also part of our COVID issue. We’re going to try to put as much intensive state and federal funding toward those kids over the next few years to see if we can’t make sure to give them the best future they can have.”

Tyler Clancy, R-Provo speaks at a ceremonial bill signing at the Utah State Capitol on April 15, 2025 (Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)Rep. Tyler Clancy, who currently works as a detective with the Provo Police Department, admitted that when he was first approached by the governor’s office about becoming the state’s next leader of Utah’s Office of Homeless Services, he said he turned down the job “a couple of times.” 
He knew the role of state homelessness coordinator is a tough job, tasked with navigating a complex web of state and local systems on controversial issues impacting the lives of the state’s most vulnerable. 
Clancy, R-Provo, said he was mostly reluctant to step down from representing District 60 in the House and leave his job in law enforcement. But the position makes sense for Clancy, who during his time in the Legislature has sponsored several bills focused on homelessness policy. 
Clancy eventually accepted, he said, because he sees Utah — and the federal government — at a crossroads when it comes to changing the way homeless services function. 
“We’re in a unique moment,” Clancy said in an interview last week with Utah News Dispatch. “And this is where I can make an impact and continue to serve my state.” 
Gov. Cox picks lawmaker with police background as new state homeless coordinator

Last month, Gov. Spencer Cox announced Clancy would be taking the place of the state’s current homelessness coordinator, Wayne Niederhauser, after he retires on Dec. 5. Clancy was publicly named Niederhauser’s successor just nine days after Niederhauser’s retirement announcement.
Clancy won’t step into his new job as state homeless coordinator until after the Utah Legislature’s 2026 session, which begins Jan. 20 and ends March 6. But come March 9, he’ll no longer be called Rep. Clancy. 
Call him Coordinator Clancy. 
Niederhauser, Clancy acknowledged, leaves some “big shoes to fill.” A former state Senate president, Niederhauser has long been lauded as a skilled collaborator with strong relationships and trust on Utah’s Capitol Hill, which has been key for significant new investments in the state’s homeless system over the past five years. 
“It’s a daunting task,” Clancy said of replacing Niederhauser. “I don’t know that if there’s a state or a city we can look and say, ‘Well they got (homelessness) right.’ That’s what we’re really trying to do, be a leader in the space to find results-oriented solutions that help people heal and continue on their path to self-sufficiency.”

Niederhauser, in a recent interview with Utah News Dispatch after his retirement announcement, said when he took the job in 2021, he didn’t expect to stay as long as he did — but come December, he said he felt it was time to “pass the baton.” He said it was a “mutual decision” between him and the governor. 
“It’s not an easy space. It’s fraught with controversy and politics and all of that, and you know, some fresh energy, I think, will be really good,” Niederhauser said. He added that the “politics have changed” over time, including on the federal level, “and so we need some fresh energy, some fresh ideas, and we’ll just hand the baton off and go from there.” 
What’s next? 
Niederhauser’s departure announcement comes at a time when a major project is unfinished: a proposed 1,300-bed “homeless campus” that the governor has thrown his full weight behind, recently calling it a “top priority” as he begins to prepare his 2026 budget recommendations for lawmakers. 
Finding funding for the expensive project — estimated to cost at least $75 million to build and more than $34 million a year in ongoing money to operate — will be a major obstacle, but the governor said he hopes some federal dollars could help make it a reality. 
Utah Gov. Cox says homeless campus — envisioned to fulfill Trump’s order — is a ‘top priority’

That “transformative” campus is key for the governor and other state leaders’ vision to not only increase the state’s currently maxed out homeless shelter capacity, but also make homeless services more focused on “healing” and “accountability.” 
Plans for the campus are still taking shape. But the state’s top homelessness leaders have proposed including hundreds of beds for people who are civilly committed — or court ordered into mental health treatment — along with a “secure” facility for substance abuse treatment as an alternative to jail, where people who are “sanctioned” to go there would not be able to leave voluntarily. 
How Trump’s vision fits in
Their vision coincides with President Donald Trump’s executive order issued in July, titled “Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets.” That executive order encourages cities and states to enforce stricter anti-camping laws, expands power to involuntarily treat and civilly commit people experiencing homelessness, and directs federal officials to end support for “Housing First” strategies, an approach to homelessness that prioritizes providing housing while offering — but not requiring — treatment. 
But months before Trump’s executive order, Utah’s Republican state leaders had said they wanted Utah’s homeless system to start moving away from Housing First policies — policies the state once championed — that they now say “lack accountability.” 
Clancy, earlier this year, successfully sponsored a resolution urging the federal government to change federal homelessness regulations to provide more flexibility for federal homelessness funding. “Block grant funding,” the resolution says, “would provide Utah with tools to better leverage” Department of Housing and Urban Development money “by granting the state more discretion over the allocation of funds, enabling local agencies to design more effective programs tailored to the specific needs” of Utah’s homeless population.

That resolution (approved by the Legislature and signed by the governor in February) also included a request to “rescind housing first policy mandates to permit flexibility” for housing options that “meet the diverse needs and preferences of families experiencing homelessness, including sobriety, goal-setting, and accountability.” 
Clancy said that’s context he feels has been looked over as Utah recently gained national attention after The New York Times published an article titled “In Utah, Trump’s Vision for Homelessness Begins to Take Shape.” 
“We were working really hard on this mission of reform before President Trump took office,” he said. “We’ve been working on reforming Housing First, looking at an all-of-the-above model, even when President Biden was in office.”
Clancy said Utah state leaders’ vision aligns with Trump’s — including expanding mental health care “for those who really do need those acute mental health services,” he said. He added that he’s “confident” that Utah leaders will “continue to collaborate” with the Trump administration as they figure out next steps. 
What are those next steps? Clancy said that resolution “puts Utah in the driver’s seat to help lead the way” since “we have already identified that we’re willing to do this.” 
Clancy talks next steps
If not for the ongoing government shutdown, Clancy said “we would be having a lot of those conversations. But the minute it reopens, we’re going to be working very, very closely with the Trump administration to get every dollar and cent that the state of Utah can get.”
“We will work for that and make sure that we’re using that money to help save lives and change lives,” he said. 
Clancy said due to legislation passed over the past several years, Utah’s existing homeless system has already been set up “to be ready” for whenever the federal government changes how funds are distributed through local homeless services networks known as “continuums of care.” 
So whenever the changes are enacted on the federal level, providers who receive the funding will be allowed to enact more “accountability” requirements, he said. Now it’s just a matter of when the federal government will act. 
“So I think what’s next is for the federal government to repeal those very restrictive (Housing First) rules on the existing federal funding,” Clancy said. 
But for now, due to the shutdown, “we’re kind of in that holding pattern,” he said, but “Utah is ready to act on that mission.”

Concerns and criticism
Big changes don’t come without trepidation. In recent months, some homeless providers have been feeling nervous and skeptical about whether the changes will actually help more people — or create more punitive and chilling policies that could leave more people falling through the cracks, deprioritize permanent supportive housing and destabilize people who are currently housed. 
In a July letter urging the state’s Homeless Services Board to “fulfill” Trump’s executive order, the governor, House Speaker Mike Schultz and Senate President Stuart Adams said to, among other things, “ensure any funding requests are accompanied by a clear strategy that aligns with the President’s executive order, with a focus on reprioritizing existing resources.” 
How can the state “reprioritize” existing funding without leaving some housing or homeless service providers unfunded? Clancy said, to him, “reprioritization is more about recognizing what are the unique challenges” facing certain “subpopulations” of homelessness and “making sure we’re matching appropriate funding to those needs.” 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“If there’s a program or programs that are not successful, the onus would be on every government official to make sure that we’re being wise stewards of taxpayer dollars,” Clancy said, but he added he doesn’t see it as something that will jeopardize needed housing programs during a time when Utah’s housing affordability issues are worse than ever. 
Instead, he said he sees it as an opportunity to allow — but not require — providers to add “accountability measures” on programs. Under current federal policies, Clancy said “right now, there’s a prohibition,” but reprioritization would mean “removing that restriction and then seeing where the results lay.” 
“When we talk about Housing First, it’s this idea that severe addiction and severe untreated and persistent mental illness will magically melt away if you give someone a key to a single-room occupancy apartment,” he said. “That, I think, you’re going to see a shift away from. Does that mean we still don’t need capacity? No, of course we do. But how is that capacity linked to engagement?” 
Some, including Democrats and homeless service providers, have criticized the “homeless campus” proposal as an expensive project that will need to be fully funded in order to succeed — but meanwhile, the state’s current homeless shelters and other existing resources like deeply affordable housing, substance use treatment, mental health treatment, and jail capacity have long gone underfunded. 
‘Compassion that kills’: Gov. Cox says ‘sea change’ in Utah’s homeless system is coming

Clancy acknowledged those criticisms — and to a certain extent he agrees, “particularly in the mental health space,” he said, especially for people who are facing “serious psycho-effective disorders” to the point they may not realize they’re mentally ill and they’re living on the streets in the middle of winter. 
“That’s where I would probably agree with critics who say, ‘This is heavily driven by funding,’” he said, but he added he would “disagree” when it comes to other people who “cycle through the same programs six, seven, eight times, to no success because it’s not meeting the severity of their needs.” 
Clancy said he believes he’s not criticized for advocating for more funding — but rather for highlighting “the need for higher engagement programming” to add more accountability measures on services for people suffering from drug addiction or other issues. 
“What we’re talking about is not involuntary versus voluntary treatment,” he said. “We’re talking about voluntary treatment or an unchecked spiral into this world of hell.” 
As for mental health capacity, Clancy said he doesn’t see a need to drastically change Utah’s existing laws in order to civilly commit more people than already qualify for that legal status — but rather he said the state needs to focus its efforts on increasing capacity. 
Utah’s new homeless campus should have 300-plus beds for civil commitment, board chair says

In September, Rep. Steve Eliason — a lawmaker who has a long track record of legislation related to homelessness, mental health and civil commitment — estimated that there’s “at least 1,000 people under civil commitment on the streets” with no available inpatient beds for them. 
“So that’s where I think when we talk about working together with the federal government, it’s about making sure our mental health services have the right funding to make sure we can match people up with the needs that they have,” Clancy said. “In Utah in particular, I think we’re in a really good place with civil commitment on the legal level, but our challenge is largely driven by capacity.” 
While critics see Utah’s vision as one focused on treating homeless people like criminals, Clancy said it’s more of a matter of putting “treatment” and “recovery” first. 
“We want that system of care to be recovery focused, for people who have faced serious trauma in their lives,” he said. “It’s not a one-size-fits all issue, we always say that. But now it’s time to put it into action.”

But the victories last week of Democratic candidates for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, a Democratic Socialist mayoral candidate in New York, and a California ballot question with the potential to upend the balance of power in the U.S. House of Representatives, are prompting introspection on both sides of the aisle. 
Was the Democratic sweep, as some Republicans suggest, nothing more than the expected outcome in traditionally blue states? Or was it a repudiation of President Donald Trump’s failed promises, chief among them to make America more affordable? And how will it play out a year from now during the midterms?  
Inflation in the U.S. stood at 3% in September, up from 2.9% a year ago, when Trump promised “Starting on day one, we will end inflation and make America affordable again, to bring down the prices of all goods.”
A presidential advisor asserted last week that Trump is now poised to take up affordability. 
Trump’s tariffs amount to an average tax increase of $1,200 in 2025 and $1,600 in 2026 per American household, according to the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan nonprofit organization. 
The economy was the number one issue in three of the four key races on Tuesday, according to CNN exit polls. 
Will the success of Democratic candidates’ focus on affordability be a jolt to Republicans?
“It better be,” said longtime Southern Nevada Republican campaign consultant Lisa Mayo DeRiso. “If not, Republicans are going to be in deep, deep doo doo.” 
Mayo DeRiso says the election results are a “message to America that people in need want somebody to solve these problems,” and are “a good wake up call for Republicans. But we say that all the time. ‘We’re going to reach out to the Hispanic community. We’re going to  have a broader tent.’ We haven’t done a good job with that.”
Republicans are not alone in losing sight of their aspirations, says progressive campaign consultant Annette Magnus. 
“In Nevada and nationally, Democrats still need to figure out who we are and what we’re fighting for, because I think there is an extreme disconnect between what people actually want and need and what our politicians in the Democratic Party are willing to fight for,” she said, citing the upcoming special session of the Nevada Legislature as an example of Democrats’ often scattered priorities. 
State lawmakers are expected to be summoned this month, perhaps this week, to Carson City by Gov. Joe Lombardo “to finish what the Legislature left unfinished – plain and simple.” 
The unfinished business will likely include a rehash of a previous effort to increase Nevada’s film tax credits, the 2013 legislative answer to kickstarting the post-Great Recession economy, sponsored that year by then-State Sen. Aaron Ford, who is now attorney general and one of two Democrats vying to take on Lombardo, a Republican who is up for reelection next year.   
Lombardo has been widely criticized for capitulating to Trump’s agenda (mobilizing the National Guard to assist with deportations; remaining silent as Nevada’s moneymaker, the tourism industry, is hobbled by a tariff-driven downturn in domestic and international travel), while doing little to address the economic carnage of vanishing federal benefits, such as food stamps and health insurance subsidies. 
“I want Joe Lombardo to be our next governor,” says Mayo DeRiso. But the governor’s trip last week to Washington, D.C. for a fundraiser, as Nevadans stand in line at food banks, “and calling a special session to try to get billions of dollars in tax credits for a bunch of Hollywood movie people, are not good decisions heading into the holidays.” 
Long-time Republican consultant Sig Rogich, departing from Lombardo’s film tax credit script, called the proposal “a boondoggle.  It’s a big mistake for our state, and I wish the governor wouldn’t do it,” he told Sam Shad Thursday on Nevada Newsmakers.
Rogich also took aim at the transferability of the credits, which are generally sold by the recipients to a casino company, which gets a credit on its tax bill. 
“What does that do for the state? It should be using that money for schools,” Rogich said, adding his wife, Sen. Lori Rogich, “has a passion for special needs children. We couldn’t get any money in the Legislature to do anything with it, and yet, they’re going to give the movie industry, Hollywood all these tax benefits, and then they sell them like they did with the Raiders.”
Magnus has similar concerns about the film tax credit, which Democrats have spearheaded in multiple sessions. 
“It’s going to be a real crappy look if we go up to Carson City and the first thing they approve is a film tax credit, and we don’t deal with SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), because people are starving, and that’s what I mean by priorities,” she says.  
Ford is defending his support of the film tax credit.
“At a time when our state is lagging behind the rest of the nation in job growth, unemployment remains amongst the highest of any state in the nation, and costs for working families are at record highs,” Ford said in a statement. “It is critical to make responsible long-term investments that will diversify our state’s economy and create good-paying union jobs in our state.”
Even before Trump halted SNAP during the government shutdown, his One Big Beautiful Bill Act put states on notice they’d be responsible for a portion of the program’s administrative costs, leaving Nevada with a $19 million hole to fill in the current biennium, and after that, upwards of $50 million a biennium. As many as 130,000 Nevadans could lose benefits because of new eligibility requirements in the law. 
“The Democrats are finally coming around to figuring out they need to start talking about the economy and start talking about issues that are impacting people’s pocketbooks and how Americans feed themselves,” says Magnus. 
Both Ford and Washoe County Commission Chairwoman Alexis Hill, a Democrat who announced her candidacy for governor in August, are emphasizing affordability in their campaigns. 
Hill said last week she was “inspired by voters going to the polls and voting against the Trump agenda. I think the elections show that candidates who start at 1% in polls can end up giving victory speeches when they have a powerful economic message, and grassroots support.” 
She’s promised to end “billionaire giveaways” via tax abatements, and has floated the possibility of placing temporary caps on rent. 
Ford has filed multiple lawsuits against Trump, including for suspending SNAP benefits. At his campaign announcement, he spoke of growing up poor. “I’m fighting for the kind of government that sees people like I was and says, ‘you matter.’” 
It’s unknown whether Lombardo, who is riding the wave of his second Trump endorsement, will feel bound to embark on that delicate dance toward the middle, where much of Nevada’s electorate resides. He has yet to draw a formidable challenger.
Ford and Hill, however, are headed for a “spirited primary race,” Magnus predicts. “Democrats are better off when we have primaries.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1431845504-1024x713.jpg,,,2025-11-10 08:21:40.929623
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-10 13:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,What’s so special about a special session? Here’s what to know.,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/10/ct-legislature-special-session/,CT's General Assembly convenes a special session in emergency cases — though the legislature has taken a broad view of what constitutes one.,"Connecticut’s General Assembly will convene in special session Wednesday, once again taking a broad view of what constitutes an emergency necessitating action prior to the next regular annual session, which opens Feb. 4.
Based on frequency, there is little special about special sessions. Legislators have returned to Hartford for special sessions at least once in 41 of the 54 years since 1971, when the General Assembly began meeting annually.
The Connecticut Constitution dictates that the legislature, a part-time body whose members typically hold outside jobs, meets in regular session for five months in odd-numbered years and three months in even-numbered years. It imposes no limits on special sessions.
Who decides to call a special session?
The legislature can call itself into session, but typically it is initiated by a governor. He issues “a call,” a proclamation outlining what subjects are to be addressed.
How are the legislators called back?
This used to be cumbersome, requiring a notice delivered to lawmakers by certified mail as much as 15 days in advance, or served in person by a state marshal, police officer or other “indifferent person” at least 24 hours prior to a session convening. Gov. William A. O’Neill once had state troopers hand them a summons to return as they left on the last night of a session without passing a budget.
So there will be cops running around the state over the weekend ordering them back?
Nah, it’s done by email now. The legislature passed a law in 2016 allowing the electronic transmittal of the call. It has to be sent at least 72 hours ahead of the session.
So, the legislators only can act on the subjects outlined by the governor in the call? 
Not exactly. The legislature always has the option of calling its own special session to address other subjects. Legislators literally can be in more than one special session at the same time. 
Sounds confusing. How does that work?
The best way to envision simultaneous special sessions is to picture a computer with several screens open. Just like you toggle back and forth on your computer, the legislature can do that with different special sessions.
How long do special sessions last?
Most are brief, a day or two. There are notable exceptions.
Like when?
The mother of all special sessions was in 1991, the year the income tax was adopted, repealed and took effect after the repeal bill was vetoed, all in a special session that ran through Sept. 19.
And then they went home?
Briefly. Once repeal failed, they moved onto what they called “repair.” They struggled through Thanksgiving, finally calling it quits for the year on Dec. 18.
During a regular session, the legislature takes months to draft bills and submit them to a committee review and public hearing. How do they all that in a special session that lasts a day or two?
They don’t. As we saw Friday, when the governor and lawmakers released a housing bill that will be debated Wednesday in the House, the legislation generally is written before the lawmakers return.
Do they ever do that in special session?
Sometimes. If the House speaker and Senate president pro tem agree, any bill can be “emergency certified” and presented for a floor vote without a hearing or committee review.
Are they barred from holding a public hearing in special session?
No, the legislature writes the rules. 
Aside from the income tax, what are some of the more notable things done in special session?
Connecticut’s groundbreaking system of publicly financing campaigns occurred in a special session called by Gov. M. Jodi Rell in 2005. The bill passed in September after a summer of negotiation.
Recreational cannabis was legalized in a special session in a bill that won final passage in the Senate on June 17, 2021. The regular session had ended June 9 with passage by the Senate, but not action by the House.
The Senate passed the bill again in the special, only to see it revised in the House. The Senate passed the final version.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The state’s General Fund budget was in trouble in 2012.
Expenses were up, revenues were down and the economy was still trying to shake off the hangover of the Great Recession. A huge hole had opened in the General Fund, which pays for Medicaid, prisons and most non-education services.
The Legislature found a solution: Borrow $437 million from the Alabama Trust Fund, a repository for oil and gas revenues. One problem: that was against the law.
So lawmakers figured a way out. They passed a budget moving the money to the General Fund, then put a constitutional amendment before voters that September — a few weeks before the General Fund took effect — asking them to approve it. Voters did so by a 2-to-1 margin, staving off major cuts.
The Legislature didn’t have to do this. They could have cut funding and let the consequences fall as they pleased. But that would have hurt Alabamians, especially when it came to finding health care. So they kept the budgets whole.
When Alabama leaders see an emergency, even one that exists solely in their heads, they move fast.
That makes the passivity of Republican leaders during the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) crisis even more notable.
The federal government shutdown, which may be headed toward an end, put over 726,000 Alabamians — 15% of the population, nearly half of them children — at risk of hunger after the Trump administration stopped paying SNAP benefits earlier this month. But Alabama leaders have responded with a collective “meh.”
Gov. Kay Ivey, who ricocheted around the state in fury when Mercedes-Benz workers tried to get more regular shift-scheduling, took several days to act. At first, her office read a script that could have been handed to it by the Trump administration. Ivey blamed congressional Democrats, most of whom were trying to prevent people from losing their health insurance. She was silent on the White House refusing to implement a SNAP contingency plan.
She read the condemnation again on Tuesday, when she sent $2 million to eight food banks around the state. That money, if used entirely on food, will pay for 10 million meals.
That’s good. But with 726,000 SNAP recipients, that works out to about 14 meals per person. Roughly four to seven days of help. And that doesn’t include the non-SNAP recipients the food banks continue to serve.
Alabama Democrats proposed using emergency funds and excess money in state agency budgets to fund the approximately $142 million a month it will cost to feed SNAP recipients.  According to the Public Affairs Research Council of Alabama, those savings accounts held about $4.8 billion in October 2024.
Two of those accounts — rainy day funds for the Education Trust Fund and General Fund — are set up in constitutional amendment. Ivey said Tuesday that the state could not tap into those accounts, which held roughly $1.1 billion last year, unless the state goes into proration, when state revenues can’t fund state agencies to their budgeted amount.
But the other accounts were set up by statute. By lawmakers. Which means they can be rewritten by lawmakers to address pressing needs.
It’s not like legislators treat the Code of Alabama as holy writ. They have amended the Rolling Reserve Act, controlling most of the other emergency funds, five times over the last 14 years.
You can make arguments against using the money this way. Our public school system relies on income and sales taxes that can vanish during a recession. Back-up funds could be critical in maintaining school operations.
But lawmakers aren’t arguing about stability. They’re pleading helplessness. No matter that Republicans threw $180 million at rich families for private school tuition, which makes zero sense for the long-term health of public education. Subsidizing the state’s top income earners is critical. Preventing starvation is not.
Alabama can’t fund SNAP on its own without some radical overhaul of its tax code. But it could provide sustainable short-term relief for 726,000 men, women and children.
Our leaders choose not to.
I’m sure they don’t want to get crossways with President Donald Trump, their one and only constituent. U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville thinks that only inner-city Democrats use SNAP. This should be news to the rural and heavily Republican Wiregrass, where SNAP uptake is higher than the state average in several counties.
But at the basic level, Republican leaders in this state don’t seem to view hunger as an emergency. They’ve tolerated the state’s high rates of poverty for decades. Ivey has approved Trump’s destruction of the U.S. Department of Education, which feeds many Alabama schoolchildren.
What do they consider emergencies? Large corporations not getting enough of your tax dollars. The existence of transgender people. It took them all of a week this year to force definitions of sex into the state code. They even limited House debate on the measure to speed up its passage.
But when hunger rears its head?
Suddenly, our lawmakers are powerless before the law. Suddenly, a government that knows how to punish can’t figure out how to help.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Garlan-Gudger-Nathaniel-Ledbetter-Kay-Ivey-Feb-12-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-10 08:00:54.850821

(Photo: Getty Images)In the run-up to the 2020 election, all 20 Democratic presidential candidates promised voters they’d pursue bold changes to health care, such as a government-run insurance plan or expanding Medicare to cover every American.
Fast-forward to the congressional stalemate that has closed the federal government for more than a month. Democrats, entrenched on one side of the legislative battle, staked their political future on merely preserving parts of the Affordable Care Act — a far cry from the systemic health policy changes that party members once described as crucial for tackling the high price of care.
Democrats succeeded in focusing national attention on rising health insurance costs, vowing to hold up funding for the federal government until a deal could be made to extend the more generous tax subsidies that have cut premiums for Obamacare plans. Their doggedness could help them win votes in midterm elections next year.
But health care prices are rocketing, costly high-deductible plans are proliferating, and 4 in 10 adults have some form of health care debt. As health costs reach a crisis point, a yawning gulf exists between voters’ desire for more aggressive action and the political urgency in Washington for sweeping change.
“There isn’t a lot of eagerness among politicians,” said Jonathan Gruber, an economist who played a key role in drafting the ACA. “Why aren’t they being more bold? Probably scars from the ACA fights. But health care is a winning issue. The truth is we need universal coverage and price regulation.”
Voters rank lowering health care costs as a top priority, above housing, jobs, immigration, and crime, according to a September poll by Hart Research Associates for Families USA, a consumer health advocacy group.
And costs are climbing. Premiums for job-based health insurance rose 6% in 2025 to an average of $26,993 a year for family coverage, according to an annual survey of employers released Oct. 22 by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. For all the attention given to grocery, gas, and energy prices, health premiums and deductibles in recent years have risen faster than overall inflation and wages.
Democratic headwinds
The appetite for big, bold ideas to drive down such high costs has waned in part because Democrats lack political leverage, according to economists, political strategists, and health care advocates. They’ve also been burned before for backing significant changes.
After the ACA was enacted in 2010, for example, a backlash over the law — and its mandate that most everyone have insurance — helped Republicans win the House and gain seats in the Senate. In 2016, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton backed the public option, a proposed government-run plan that would compete against commercial insurance. She lost to Donald Trump.
Democrats are also outnumbered in Congress. Sweeping changes to health care, such as the creation of Medicaid and Medicare and passage of the ACA, historically have occurred when one party has controlled both Congress and the presidency. Republicans currently have all that muscle. So for now, Democrats are fighting to preserve the status quo while portraying Republicans as a threat to Americans’ insurance coverage.
If the ACA subsidies aren’t extended, many of the roughly 24 million people who buy coverage on the health law’s marketplaces will see their premiums more than double next year, according to KFF. A KFF Health Tracking Poll released Nov. 6 found that three-quarters of the public supported extending them.
“There’s no doubt people believe the current system needs reform,” said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist. “Protecting people from premium increases is part of that. You don’t win the future by losing the present.”
Even bipartisan legislative proposals aimed at lowering health costs have fizzled in an environment defined by political threats and partisan social media attacks.
Bills that would have improved health care price transparency and reined in companies that manage prescription drug benefits gained traction in late 2024 as part of a spending package. Then Elon Musk, who was serving as a senior adviser to President-elect Trump, took to his social media platform, X, to rally opposition, deriding the budget bill for what he asserted was excessive government spending.
GOP leaders dropped the health provisions, prompting Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) to say on X that Musk “tweeted to kill” the bipartisan health policies that Congress had hammered out.
But Democrats’ focus on health care has cut both ways. Their messaging amid efforts to save the ACA from repeal and to preserve the law’s protections for those with preexisting conditions helped the party take back the House in the 2018 midterm elections. “I still have PTSD from the experience,” Republican Mike Johnson, now the House speaker, said recently.
And voters want relief. Six in 10 Americans are extremely or very worried about health care costs rising next year, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll.
Hagen Wenzek, 56, is among them. The chief executive of GI Digital, a high-tech startup, felt a pain in his calf in late summer and asked OpenAI’s ChatGPT what it might be. It suggested he could have deep-vein thrombosis, or a blood clot. He went to the emergency room and obtained an ultrasound that confirmed the diagnosis, so doctors monitored him and gave him blood thinners.
His insurance was billed $7,422, and Wenzek got a bill for $890. The average cost of an ultrasound is about $400 without insurance, according to GoodRx, a digital health platform.
“The hospital is making thousands for a procedure that costs $500. It’s kind of ridiculous,” said Wenzek, of Sleepy Hollow, New York. “I have a $40 copay just to go see a doctor for anything, and I’m on a startup budget.”
‘Defending the status quo’
The lack of bolder ideas to tackle spiraling costs could also work against Democrats, some critics say. Comedian and political commentator Jon Stewart, in an episode of his podcast in October, accused Democrats of committing “malpractice” by not presenting ideas to fix what people hate about the health care system. Instead, he said, they’re shutting the government down to protect a system that voters already believe is failing them.
“Once again, the Democrats are in a position of defending the status quo of policies that most people in the United States think suck,” he said. “Meanwhile, on the same day, Trump rolls out TrumpRx. Hey, I’ll just threaten Pfizer with 100% tariffs and then just open up a prescription drug outside of the middle managers and sell directly to the public at a discount.”
TrumpRx, which is intended to help patients find lower-priced drugs, and pledges by Big Pharma to lower drug prices could help the GOP with voters, though Democrats are also hammering Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the bill the president signed into law in July that reduces Medicaid spending by about $1 trillion over a decade.
Republicans are promising fixes, using the shutdown to try to leverage voter frustration. Vice President JD Vance said on Newsmax in October that “we do have a plan, actually,” in reference to a question about health care reform. (Trump has promised repeatedly that he would produce a plan to replace the ACA but never has.)
Senate Majority Leader John Thune said on CNBC in October that Trump wants to overhaul the ACA and “give people health insurance that is higher-quality and more affordable.”
The White House did not respond to an email requesting comment from Vance.
“It’s not that Democrats are focusing on tax credits to the exclusion of bigger, bolder reforms,” said Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA. “If you can get the conversation on health care, if we can prevent premiums from spiking, then we can focus on why health care costs so darn much to begin with.”
But some Democrats say voters are hurting and want bigger and bolder ideas now. Earlier this year, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said on the podcast “Fast Politics” that the party needs to offer more on health care in the next election.
“I’ll tell you what people are going to expect,” he said. “They’re not going to expect us to tinker around the edge with the ACA. They’re going to expect universal health care.”
For now, at least, there are more innovative ideas in states. Oregon has established a governing board to set up a single-payer health system in which the state would take on health care financing — eliminating private insurance, premiums, and all deductibles for all residents as soon as 2027. The question is whether it will work. Vermont abandoned a similar effort in 2014.
“With the political environment we’re in, there isn’t currently an appetite for big reform, but we know it needs to happen,” said Mona Shah, the senior director of policy and strategy at Community Catalyst, a health advocacy group. “Across party lines, people want government intervention in health care and people want universal coverage. The pain point that people are feeling, the public sentiment is where we were at before the ACA.”

For years they coexisted with an oil company — until one day they couldn’t.,"Richard Hodgson rounds up cows on his New Mexico ranch. (Jerry Redfern/Capital and Main)About two months ago, a slow fall hit rock bottom for Richard Hodgson and his son Kaleb Hodgson when a white pickup truck drove through the middle of an elk hunt on their property in far northwest New Mexico. Elk scattered, their hunting clients left, and the Hodgsons realized that the oil companies that had drilled their land for decades might not be their friends after all.
“It just drives me totally insane,” Richard said.
He’s the patriarch of three generations of Hodgsons who live on a spread he started 42 years ago in the high, dry country he loves. Richard was born and grew up in nearby Farmington but always wanted to be a cowboy in the San Juan Basin, among the region’s green and tan mesas under an electric blue sky.
As a young man he bought the ranch’s initial parcel with money made from driving trucks and working as a roustabout for oil and gas companies. In lean ranching years he’d go back to the oil patch for the money, using that to buy more land.
Today the family runs around 200 mother and calf pairs on the 5,600 acres it owns and roughly 32,000 it leases from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. And everywhere you look on that land, there’s an oil or gas well — the family doesn’t know how many. “I don’t know if we really want to know,” said Kaleb, Richard’s eldest son. “It’s kind of overwhelming, honestly.”
Kaleb said a movie crew came to the ranch a few years ago to shoot scenes for a film and loved the place — but won’t be back. Crew members told him it cost too much to digitally remove all the wells that appeared in the background.
Father and son think they have room enough to run another 60 to 100 cow-calf pairs, but recent droughts have shriveled the forage and dried up the natural watering holes. The oil and gas that come out of the ground in the San Juan Basin contribute to the changing climate that’s drying the region. This summer, the dust was so thick on the grass that it wore down the cows’ teeth. “It takes years off their life,” Kaleb said.
“Everything’s an uphill battle out here,” Richard said. “All I ask for is respect.”

Kaleb Hodgson, Luke Whitley and Richard Hodgson stand in a pasture on the Hodgson ranch. Years ago, the well tanks behind them leaked and flooded the pasture with produced water and oil.
And the family feels it isn’t getting any from its biggest neighbor, Hilcorp Energy Co. The Houston-based company is one of the largest privately held oil and gas producers in the country, with operations in nine states. In 2017 the company began a massive acquisition campaign in the San Juan Basin when it bought ConocoPhillips’ assets. In the New Mexico portion of the basin, it now operates 11,400 wells. Roughly 1,600 of them pepper the area on and around the Hodgsons’ lands.
Hilcorp and the Hodgsons are close neighbors because of a legal quirk called a split estate, under which the property rights to the surface land are separate from those of the minerals that lie beneath. The Hodgsons own the surface rights, and the federal government owns the underlying mineral rights, which, in this area, it leases primarily to Hilcorp. By law, landowners must allow subsurface rights owners to have access to those minerals. For the Hodgsons, that access takes shape in a spiderweb of roads and wells stitching their thousands of acres of pine-dotted mesas and valleys.
For years, that arrangement between the Hodgsons and Hilcorp worked —  until very recently, when it didn’t.
Hilcorp did not respond to Capital & Main’s repeated requests for comment.

Over the years, relations with oil companies were manageable, if not always great.
Richard recalled his days as a roustabout and truck driver decades ago and what he called the industry’s almost complete lack of environmental controls at the time.
One example: He said that companies used natural gas to flush out newly drilled wells, then lit the polluted mixture on fire in massive flares. “This whole country at night was orange,” he said. “It was so wasteful.”

Another example: Wastewater from oil production — often called produced water and  laden with hydrogen sulfide — was dumped in ditches and ponds throughout the region. “I done it. I was sent out to do it,” Richard said. He’s sure that all of the ground beneath waste pits near older wells are contaminated from that dumping.
Another example: A few years ago, he watched a neighbor’s cow drink from a puddle of filthy water pooled beneath a pumpjack. The cow stumbled off, bellowing, then fell in a ditch and died.
And another: On a hot summer day, before he could grab its collar, one of Richard’s dogs jumped into an open waste pit to cool off. The dog swam around and came out covered in grease, immediately got sick and went deaf. The dog lived for a couple of years before it was run over by a truck it couldn’t hear.
One more: In November, 2023, there was a spill at a well he could see from his front door. He worked for a whole day alongside a crew hired by Hilcorp to dig out 1,000 yards of petroleum soaked soil. “We got out of the hole, and everybody had a headache [from the fumes]. It was that dirty,” he said.
Richard said he left for a few hours. When he returned, the company had fenced off the pit and said their work was done. In April, 2024, Richard called the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division — the state’s primary oilfield enforcer — to get Hilcorp to remove more contaminated soil. Nothing more was removed, and two weeks later Hilcorp submitted a closure report to the Division, saying the company had finished its cleanup work. The Division closed the case the same day. The Division’s response read, in part, “Since the release occurred within an area reasonably needed for production operations (on-pad), the reclamation report will be due after the gas well has been plugged and abandoned.” That may be a while. Last year the well produced 25,500,000 cubic feet of natural gas, worth roughly $56,000.
When a previous company wanted to put a well atop the untouched mesa behind Richard’s home, he offered a spot at the base of the mesa, 500 feet from his front door. “I’d rather have that than destroy this last piece of land we got,” he said. There are now 30 active gas wells within a mile of Richard’s house.
The family coped with all of it over the years with different companies.
“We did have a good working relationship to them,” Kaleb said.

And the Hodgsons do a lot of work in their three main businesses on the ranch: raising cattle, hosting elk hunts and maintaining the maze of dirt roads connecting all the wells on the property. That maintenance happens — happened — through a long-running series of agreements with oil companies going back years.
Richard and Kaleb said that earlier this year, a new landman — the person companies hire to deal with landowners — began slowly cutting them off. They don’t know why. The landman didn’t take their calls. He said if the Hodgsons had anything to say, they could call Hilcorp’s lawyers.
The Hodgsons said Hilcorp also canceled its agreement with them to maintain the roads on the property. In addition to clearing access to the wells, that work channeled the region’s intermittent — and occasionally torrential — rains off the roads and well pads and onto surrounding grasslands. The work was good for the oil crews, good for the Hodgsons and good for the livestock and wild game. Plus, there was no way the Hodgsons could afford to do the work without the contract.
“They come up fighting like I’ve never seen an oil company do after 40 years,” Richard said. “I’ve never had a company just stomp their feet … and say, ‘We ain’t going to deal with you.’”
In September, after months of deteriorating relations with Hilcorp, a line was crossed.
The Hodgsons nurture the elk population on their land. “We take care of them all year round,” Richard said. “We provide feed, shelter and water. And then we do harvest some.” Hunters pay thousands of dollars for that privilege. But it’s not easy to track wild animals over thousands of acres, and successful hunts aren’t guaranteed. Many factors can spoil a hunt.
To keep some variables in their favor, every year Richard and Kaleb have negotiated with Hilcorp and its predecessor companies to keep trucks off certain roads in the early mornings and early evenings. That allows elk to gather in herds to eat and drink, increasing the chance that hunters can find them amid the mesas. Kaleb said he texted the landman the day before a scheduled bow hunt, asking Hilcorp to keep trucks away from specific areas, and the landman agreed.
It was 6 a.m. the next day, just before dawn. One of Kaleb’s nephews was walking slowly between pine and cedar trees in the faint light atop a mesa, leading a small group of bow hunters. They had spent the night in a camp to be ready at first light. At that point, they could see elk gathering in the valley below.
Then they heard a truck, and the elk scattered.
The nephew texted Kaleb to explain what happened, but the damage was done. The hunters hiked to the next valley over, hoping to find more elk, but didn’t.
“We’ve had these hunters for five years,” Richard said. “They’ve always paid a deposit for next year, and [this time] they didn’t pay no deposits. I don’t think they’re coming back.”
The spoiled hunt was a clarion call for the family. “It showed us that they put a bullseye on us,” Richard said.
Meanwhile, other problems grew. A week and a half after the botched hunt, water from a colossal cloudburst ran off the mesa behind their houses, washed over one of the untended roads and flooded a well pad with two and a half feet of water. The water flushed the sludge from two open-top below-ground storage tanks, creating a pond of black goo. Kaleb kept a mason jar filled with a sample, which had the consistency of old motor oil.

Several days later, while standing next to the muddy well pad, Kaleb explained how much waste Hilcorp told him was flushed from the tanks. “They say it was only 21 barrels, but it covered that whole entire berm,” he said. At two and a half feet deep, the 5,400-square-foot area inside the berm could hold roughly 2,400 barrels of liquid.
Kaleb said that much of the oil and water simply sank into the ground. As he spoke, workers from a cleanup company shoveled contaminated soil into a vacuum truck that could hold 80 barrels, the second that Kaleb had seen at the site.
“Contaminated dirt should have been dug out,” he said.
Kaleb said he sees the resulting problem as twofold. There’s the obvious groundwater contamination from the spilled sludge, and then there’s the wasted rain water. If the roads had been maintained, the runoff would have bypassed the well pad and filled a pasture the Hodgsons have nurtured over the years, turning two hundred acres of scrubby dirt to a grassland that feeds cattle and other animals.
“We wasted all that water,” Kaleb said. And the waste may have polluted the land where the family’s cattle and elk graze.

Though Hilcorp didn’t respond to requests for comment for this story, after Capital & Main visited the ranch, the Hodgsons said company representatives asked them if they had been talking with journalists. “I think we somewhat got their attention,” Richard said.
He said Hilcorp sent a new landman, who allowed the Hodgsons to fix the washed-out road near the flooded well pad so it wouldn’t flood again. Hilcorp also tested the soil there. “They did some core drilling, but I won’t accept that,” Richard said. “We’ll have to dig it out and find out what we got.”
He said Hilcorp also hired a company to take care of another spill he recently came across. After months of problems, Richard and Kaleb are skeptical of the quick about-face.
“They’re getting really worried about these spills because they know that I’m upset, and I’m going to make some noise,” Richard said.
“I’m not saying, ‘Do not drill.’ I’m just saying, ‘Do it reasonably,’” he added. “I mean, hell, the country’s making you just very, very wealthy. Why would you not put a little bit back into what you tear up?” he asked. “That’s all I want these companies to do. Just be reasonable.”
After the Hilcorp truck spoiled the elk hunt, Richard and Kaleb got in touch with their nearest neighbors, Don and Jane Schreiber, who live about 15 miles away. “There are not very many of us that live out here,” Richard said. “So anybody who can live out here and appreciate the land is a friend of mine.”
The Schreibers are known for fighting oil and gas companies that thoughtlessly drill or poorly maintain wells on their land. And like Richard, Don grew up in Farmington and harbored a dream of running a ranch. Also, like the Hodgsons, the Schreibers’ own land is split-estate.

The Schreibers bought their ranch in 1999 and over the years they have slowly sold off their cattle and leased the land to other ranchers. “I turned my back on my dream,” Don said. Instead, they spend much of their time raising awareness about how oil and gas drilling has degraded the landscape in the northwest corner of the state.
“We had two blissful years out here,” Don said of their earliest ranching days. “But then the fights started.”
He said a childhood friend who worked for an oil company explained to him what companies thought of the Schreibers’ ranch and lands like it: “Pard, I don’t want to hurt your feelings, but we’d just as soon have this S.O.B. paved.”
After a half-dozen years of contesting sporadic oil and gas well proposals on their land — which they lost — the Schreibers’ big fights with oil and gas companies began in earnest in late 2007, when a company proposed drilling 44 new wells on their property. The Schreibers thought most of those should be “twinned,” by adding the new wells to existing well sites, which would preserve untouched ranch land from more well pads and connecting roads. After an “intense fight,” the company put in just 22 new wells, all “twinned” on existing pads, Don said.
“So in the end, we did win,” he said. But, he added, “I mean, every time you drill a well, you lose a bit.”
Over the years, Don and Jane recorded each tussle, filling binders with letters, emails and documents recording the slow but relentless fights to protect their land. Don also keeps a small display with photos of nine separate incidents in which he got a company to clean up an unacknowledged mess or unnecessary well. He shows it off at public meetings and to company representatives at their first meetings. He said its message for them is clear: “I don’t know if it’s gonna take four years or 14 years — we’re gonna beat you.” In his experience, constant, determined pressure gets a company to do what you want it to do.
It’s a style of work familiar to the Hodgsons.
In late September on an afternoon spent driving to a far corner of the ranch, a thin column of diesel smoke from a distant fracking site was the only thing that marred a crisply blue sky.

Aside from their Ford dually pickup and cellphones peeking from their pockets, the three could have walked off a Western film set a century ago. Each wore a cowboy hat — Kaleb’s in black felt — as well as scuffed boots with worn spurs. Later, they donned scarred chaps to protect their pants from the sage, juniper and piñon trees. Three calm horses and a clutch of excitable ranch dogs rode in the trailer behind. The leather on the horses’ saddles was dull on the sides and polished in the seats from years of use.
As he drove, Kaleb described how he and his family trained horses — an integral part of running the ranch.
“Horses are very smart, complicated animals. But also they’re very simple,” he said. “They react off of your pressure.” Pressure from the reins, pressure through the knees. Pressure and release. Slowly pressure the horse in the direction you want it to go — then release the pressure.
“You do that a few times. And then you ask for half an inch. And then you do that a few times and you work your way up to an inch. Then you’re asking at the end of it for a foot,” he said.
Kaleb said all horses react to pressure and release in some way. “Even bucking horses,” he said. “They’ll react to pressure and release if you’re just consistent with it.”
Eventually, no matter how big or powerful the horse, careful, determined pressure gets it to do what you want it to do.
The same principle appears to be working in their relationship with Hilcorp.
After meeting with the Schreibers and calling Capital & Main, the Hodgsons said Hilcorp honored their recent late-September elk hunt hours and have been working on the spill sites. But Kaleb and Richard remain ready to apply more pressure.
“I don’t know where we’re going to go with all of it,” Richard said. “[We’re] just not letting anything lie.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/featureHodgson_Ranch_14-scaled-1-1024x674.jpg,,,2025-11-10 08:00:54.850821

It also has offered visitors as well as museum staff an opportunity to hear directly from veterans who fought in the war. That’s not a possibility for other exhibits at the museum, which has artifacts from every war South Carolinians have fought in, starting with the American Revolution.
Veterans Day marks three years since the exhibit, titled “A War with No Front Lines: South Carolina and the Vietnam War, 1965-1973,” opened inside the South Carolina Confederate Relic Room and Military Museum.
The exhibit includes the uniform once worn by retired Capt. Linda Sharp in 1967 and 1968, when she was a nurse at the 67th Evacuation Hospital in Qui Nhon. That’s been available for all visitors to see.

But she’s also talked in person about her experiences — not just about the soldiers and South Vietnamese civilians who came to her for treatment or the horrors of war but also day-to-day life for her and her fellow medics.
“She didn’t only talk about how hard it was and what they did, but what it was like: going to the (post exchange) for drinks, playing music, sometimes going out by helicopter to certain sites,” said Allen Roberson, the museum’s director.
Also on display is the pistol C.W. Bowman carried as a “tunnel rat” with the 9th Infantry, climbing into the dark narrow tunnels dug by the Vietcong.
People who heard him speak got a deeper glimpse of what he encountered in those tunnels, including booby traps full of venomous snakes and the time he fell through a trap door not knowing if he would make it back out.
He also talked about the darker mental health troubles he developed and had to overcome when he came home.
And then there’s the unofficial tiger-striped uniform worn by Lt. Andy Rice, who was part of a small unit dropped by helicopter behind enemy lines.

According to Roberson, Rice talked about spending the night neck deep in the swamp to avoid enemy patrols as well as happening across a castle-like building in the middle of the jungle inhabited by French Catholic nuns.
”You meet a fellow of a certain age inColumbia, you absolutely do not know what he might have been doing in the 1960s and what he might have had to endure,” said Joe Long, one of the museum’s tour guides.
Many of the veterans’ stories have been captured on tape by Fritz Hamer, another of the museum’s employees who conducted interviews with some 70 veterans.
Hamer said he heard over and over again from veterans about the stifling humidity and the distinct musty, oily smell that hit them as soon as they stepped off the transport plane. They’d talk about walking through the jungle with 80 pounds of equipment and ammunition on their backs. And they’d share pictures of the rice fields during the rainy season or the South Vietnamese and how they lived.
Hamer said he considers this the golden age of the Vietnam war veteran as many grow older and are more willing to talk about what it was like.

“We’ve really gotten into a part of military history that had largely been ignored until the last decade,” he said.
“It also helps people understand we are a museum that looks at all aspects of South Carolina’s military history,” Hamer added. “I see it as helping to change the minds of people about the direction this place is going.”
Founded in 1896, the Confederate Relic Room — initially housed inside the Statehouse — has been inside the State Museum building, through a separate entrance, since 2002.
The museum faced controversy it never asked for in 2015, when legislators sent the museum the last Confederate flag flown by the state on Statehouse grounds. The flag was removed — pole and all — in the wake of the June 2015 massacre at a historic Black church in Charleston by an avowed white supremacist who gunned down nine people.
Amid the debate, the number of visitors in 2015 dropped below 20,000 for the first time in a decade.
The museum worked to recover but it suffered more issues from a burst pipe in 2019 that flooded the exhibit room. Then in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced it to close.
But when the Vietnam exhibit finally did open, it was seen as a major success.
Over the exhibit’s first two years, annual attendance at the museum tucked away inside the historic Mills Building, originally a textile mill that opened in 1893, has grown to more than 41,000 annual visits.
That’s a more than 50% increase over the 27,000 visitors the museum saw between July 2022 and June 2023.
And despite being closed for six months for renovations to the building, the Relic Room still logged about 31,000 visitors between July 2024 and June 2025.
“This really brought us out,” Roberson said, reminding people that the Relic Room is not limited to its namesake war.
“All I used to hear is ‘The confederate museum? I’ve never been there. I don’t really care about the Civil War,’” said Roberson.
With the Vietnam exhibit, he added, “All of a sudden, you know us for something else.”
The exhibit was supposed to be temporary, but the end date kept getting pushed back. Now there is no timeline for replacing it.

Which is why the state needs to invest in renewable energy, the authors write. (Photo by Marga Buschbell-Steeger/Getty Images)Maryland is making bold moves. With new investments pouring into artificial intelligence and  quantum technology research, our state is positioning itself as a national leader in the industries of  tomorrow. This is an exciting and necessary step — these technologies will shape the next generation  of health care, national security, finance and countless other fields.
But as we chart this path toward a  more innovative future, it’s critical that we don’t leave one essential pillar behind: clean energy and  energy storage. For Maryland to be a hub in AI technology, it must also be a leader in the energy systems that will  power it.
The reason is both practical and moral. AI data centers, high-performance quantum  computers and advanced manufacturing hubs consume staggering amounts of electricity. As AI models grow larger and more powerful, and as quantum computers begin moving from research labs  into operational facilities, their energy needs will only surge. Without a robust, sustainable energy  infrastructure, Maryland risks creating an innovation ecosystem that is ultimately unsustainable.
Clean energy isn’t just about climate commitments —it’s about economic resilience, energy  independence and long-term competitiveness. States that lead in renewable energy and energy storage  technologies will be the states that attract future-focused industries. Already, the Department of  Energy (DOE) has highlighted energy storage as a key enabler of grid reliability and economic growth.

The Energy Storage Grand Challenge (ESGC) focuses resources from across the DOE to create a  comprehensive program to accelerate the development, commercialization and utilization of next-generation energy storage technologies and sustain American global leadership in energy storage.  Therefore, enhanced efforts are required to transition technology from the lab to the marketplace and  to facilitate manufacturing at scale. Similarly, the DOE Long Duration Storage Shot (LDS) aims to  reduce storage costs by 90% for systems that deliver 10+ hours of electricity within the decade.
Maryland has made admirable progress in clean energy, with many projects underway and aggressive  climate targets on the books. But to truly match its ambitions in AI and quantum, the state must equally  prioritize research and development in advanced energy storage, grid modernization, and clean  generation technologies. Public universities, national labs, and private companies need support to  pioneer new battery chemistries, scalable grid storage solutions and AI-driven grid optimization tools.
Imagine a Maryland where AI breakthroughs help predict energy demand spikes, where quantum  computers model new solar cell materials, and where locally developed long-duration energy storage  systems keep our power grid clean, stable, and resilient — even in the face of rising demand. This  isn’t a distant fantasy. It’s a future we can build, but only if we invest wisely today.
Maryland has seen significant successes in clean energy technology, particularly in the battery and  solar sectors. Companies like Saft and Ion Storage Systems are leading innovators in battery technology. Solar power is the state’s largest renewable energy source, with a significant installed  capacity. By the end of 2024, Maryland had installed 1,750 megawatts of solar power, making it the  largest source of renewable energy. Similarly, the POWER Act, set a target for Maryland to generate  8.5 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2031.
To date, the offshore wind supply chain has brought over $815 millionin investments to the state, which  includes millions of dollars to redevelop Baltimore County’s industrial waterfront for offshore-wind steel manufacturing and component staging, a high-voltage cable manufacturing facility in Baltimore  City, an additional $25 million in public funding to strengthen the state’s union workforce, and $11 million toward  environmental research through the University of Maryland.
It would be shortsighted to invest heavily in energy-intensive technologies without ensuring the  sustainability of the energy systems that support them. Maryland has the chance to be a model for how  to do both — to be a state where cutting-edge tech doesn’t just consume resources, but actively drives  cleaner, smarter, and fairer energy solutions.
Even in times of fiscal and budgetary challenges,  the Maryland Energy Innovation Institute (MEI2) and the Maryland Energy Innovation Accelerator  (MEIA) continue to play a key role in supporting new clean energy technologies, fostering an energy  innovation ecosystem that has launched 66 companies.
In the race for the future, it won’t be enough to lead in AI or quantum alone. The true leaders will  understand how deeply technology and energy are intertwined and build their innovation economies  with that in mind. Maryland can — and should — be one of them.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/solarwind2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-10 08:00:54.850821

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Arthur Hamlin: Compassion for SNAP beneficiaries.","Dear Editor, 


There was a time during the early 1990s recession when I lost my job (through no fault of my own) and my family unexpectedly found ourselves needing to apply for assistance.
Our son was less than two years old, and although I was eligible for unemployment benefits, it took months for them to come, in part because we had moved from another state and Vermont unemployment needed wage information from my last job in that state, even though the job I lost was in Vermont.
Because of the delay, we used up any savings we had to pay our rent and bills.  I had some shares in my parents’ company that I sold back to pay off our (only) car, and my parents also helped us a little financially.

I looked for work every day and we reduced our spending as much as possible. My wife, who had not grown up in the same income bracket, taught me about shopping at thrift and consignment shops, the “banged and dented” grocery store, and getting day-old bread from the “bread store” on the Barre-Montpelier Road. Eventually, we moved from our apartment into a more affordable mobile home.
When my unemployment was nearing an end, I started working part-time cleaning doctors’ offices at night and for a while I had three part-time jobs at the same time. My wife tried providing day care for a few neighbors’ kids and then found a job during the day so we could alternate taking care of our son. When our jobs overlapped, my mother-in-law pitched in to help.
Despite all of that, we still found ourselves needing assistance from government programs like food stamps, fuel assistance and commodities, just to make ends meet. It was not for lack of work or unnecessary spending or any of the other reasons I frequently see people using to shame our fellow Vermonters who find themselves in need of assistance to take care of their family.
The hard truth is that too many jobs simply do not pay enough and no doubt since the early 1990s it has only gotten worse.
It was hard for us. I can only imagine how much harder it is for single parents, the elderly and people with disabilities, who are the majority of SNAP recipients. As the saying goes, “there but for the grace of God go I,” and a little compassion and empathy would go a long way.

Attorney General Nick Brown has proposed new advice for locales on how to interpret state public records law, with a focus on providing records faster. The rules Brown is proposing don’t change the state’s Public Records Act. They only serve as a guide for state and local governments on how to comply.
Open government advocates support the changes. Government officials are skeptical.
One of Brown’s bigger recommendations is to triage public disclosure requests so simple asks for one document can be provided faster than complex requests seeking, for example, thousands of pages or hard-to-find records. 
Under the current system, narrower requests can sit for months, even years, while records officers deal with difficult ones first-come-first-serve. The newly proposed rules push agencies to provide records within five business days if the request is for a “single, specific, identifiable record.”
Another notable revision would raise the bar for disclosing requests to third parties named in the records. Letting people know about the requests allows them to seek a court order to prevent the information’s release.
The current criteria for notification are “information that may affect rights of others and may be exempt from disclosure.” 
The new rules would shift that to say that the trigger is disclosure of information that “may substantially and irreparably damage any person or vital governmental function.” They also add “an agency should have a reasonable belief that the records are arguably exempt from disclosure” before giving third-party notice. These notices can slow the fulfillment of requests.
“Third-party notification that a public records request has been made should be the exception of the rule,” Colette Weeks, executive director of the Washington Coalition for Open Government, said in a hearing last Thursday. “It needlessly delays the process.”
Other changes make clear agencies need to deliver records “promptly” and provide clearer guidelines for what is said in letters closing records requests, in line with a 2024 state Supreme Court decision.
Clerks who handle these requests expressed concerns, saying the rules would require more resources than agencies have. They worry the triage proposal, for example, “will create more problems than it will solve,” said Candice Bock, director of government relations at the Association of Washington Cities.
“These provisions rely on subjective, ill-defined standards, but the main problem with them is that they contradict the spirit and letter of the law they are supposed to implement by requiring the government to discriminate between requesters in new ways,” said Paul White, deputy city clerk in Lacey.
Justin Leighton, executive director of the Washington State Transit Association, called the revisions an “overreach of the administrative rulemaking process.” He argued the changes proposed should be made through legislation.
The new rules come after The Seattle Times and other news outlets asked for them to be revised to address delays journalists faced when requesting public records. The media organizations argued the current rules were vague and allowed for logjams that slowed disclosure.
“We routinely request access to government records, and we don’t do it to pester or unduly burden civil servants, but to illuminate issues of great importance,” Seattle Times Executive Editor Michele Matassa Flores said. 
“Washington state has long been cited for its high standard of government transparency, and for the most part, it lives up to that reputation,” she added. “Please help us avoid losing that distinction and approve these updated rules so our public agencies remain as transparent as the law and democracy dictate.”
Written comments will be accepted until Nov. 17, before the changes are finalized.
Rising demand
Most records held by public agencies are available via record requests. This can include not just documents but also video recordings and communications like text messages and emails.
The number of requests governments are dealing with are growing, according to a state report surveying 230 public agencies subject to the Public Records Act. The law covers at least 2,400 government entities.
The surveyed agencies received almost 438,000 requests for public records in 2023, up from 383,000 in 2019, according to the report from the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee. More and more are coming from individuals, insurers and law firms. Less than 2% come from self-identified members of the media.
Response times have been rising for years. In 2019, it took 15 days on average for agencies to provide records from the date of the request. In 2023, that was up to nearly 25 days, the audit found. Over half of the requests are closed within five days, the deadline for agencies to provide an initial response to requests.
Government agencies around the state are spending more money on public disclosure requests, with the sum rising from roughly $100 million in 2019 to nearly $137 million in 2023.
Voters approved Washington’s Public Records Act via ballot initiative in 1972. The Legislature has revised it numerous times since, adding many exemptions. 
This revision process began under then-Attorney General Bob Ferguson, now the governor. 
Brown is also creating a new unit within his office focused on public records and open government, set to be led by the agency’s first “chief transparency counsel.” At least 10 existing employees will staff the team.
The announcement of the new unit last week comes as records requests to the attorney general’s office spike, from 528 in 2014 to 1,032 last year.
“Transparency is a key part of the work we do every day to protect and support Washingtonians,” Brown said in a statement. “At a time of widespread mistrust in government, public access is as crucial as ever to let the public see our work for themselves.”
The Washington Coalition for Open Government applauded the move. 
“We look forward to working with this new unit to ensure that the public’s right to know what government is doing is not only protected but advanced,” the organization said in a statement.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/public-records-paper-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-10 07:17:49.418084

(Screenshot from livestream)Twenty minutes into the live video of the July 16 town council meeting in Lewisville, population 337, the four council members discussed what to do about two neighboring mobile homes where backyard trash is piling up and attracting rats. One of the homeowners, an older woman, also has four disabled cars parked in the driveway, two of which have expired plates, and engine parts blocking the path of meter readers.
After five minutes of discussion, including whether to mail the residents certified legal notices “to scare them a little bit,” council members decided on a kinder approach instead — email warnings with a number to call town council for assistance  —  even though some members said the elderly woman has refused help in the past.
The council moved on to other business when, 30 minutes later, an older woman photobombs the live meeting by entering a back door. She was not happy with what she saw at home on the town’s YouTube channel.
“Number one, I have never refused help,” the woman tells the council members as they turn around in their chairs to face their accuser. “I don’t have anybody’s phone number. I don’t know where anybody lives. I leave the house around 9:30, 10 o’clock in the morning. I don’t get home till midnight, one, two, three o’clock in the morning. Okay, like you said, I’m almost 67. You’re right, I’m old. I’ve got sciatic problems, I’ve got hip problems, I’ve got knee problems … ”
A calmer discussion eventually unfolded and the council agreed to a public call for volunteers to help the woman clean up her property.
Welcome to Indiana’s new livestreaming requirement for local government meetings. With nearly all 567 localities, 88 counties and 354 school districts now in compliance with a law that took effect July 1, keeping tabs on what your local officeholders are up to is as easy as sitting in front of your computer or TV screen.
“So now people are able to log on and see what their tax dollars are going for, what projects are important to their community and how to get involved if they see something that’s really important to them,” said State Rep. Ben Smaltz, R-Auburn, the chief sponsor of the bill. Seven other states have requirements for recording and archiving public meetings but, so far, only Indiana requires live access for nearly all meetings of local public officials.
Behind the benefits
Transparency and greater government accountability aren’t the only benefits of livestreamed meetings. The New York Coalition for Open Government, an upstate grassroots organization pushing their own state to adopt livestreaming requirements, has posted a list of 29, including better access for the elderly, disabled, immunocompromised, military service members abroad, “snowbirds” with more than one home, and people working long hours and evenings like the aggrieved woman in Lewisville.
Smaltz said he was inspired several years ago to initiate the proposal after talking to constituents in his district just north of Ft. Wayne. “What I learned from them was with the busy lifestyle we all seem to be living today — with kids’ activities and work, other volunteer things — that it’s really hard to be involved (in local government) and to know what’s going on.” Social media access, he decided, would certainly help.

Not all areas of Indiana, however, have access to live streaming. While Indiana received $868 million from former President Joe Biden’s infrastructure plan a year ago to expand broadband into the state’s underserved areas, 140,000 Hoosier residents — most of them in rural areas — are still waiting for service as the program is rolled out over the next four years, according to the Indiana Broadband Office. For those areas, local governments are required to record their meetings and archive them for the public. 
Local officials say the transition to livestreaming has posed a few technical challenges but, overall, it has been an inexpensive means to increase public engagement. And in cities and towns where the software permits audience interaction, it has increased participation as well. 
Some of it unwanted.
In Greenwood, a suspected local gadfly hacked into the city’s YouTube channel and posted porn videos to liven up several town hall meetings. “So now we’ve got an IT person sitting in the control room monitoring that and they’re able to shut them off real quick,” said Greenwood Mayor Mike Myers.
Myers said the city’s Zoom meetings on YouTube have increased citizen involvement, especially on “hot topics.” Remote audience members can click an icon to “raise their hand” during meetings to ask a question or post a comment.
Consultants and experts outside the city can also participate in meetings while saving on their transportation time and costs, Myers said.
“If they want to testify about or talk about an item on the agenda that they’re a part of. This way they don’t have to fly all the way to Indiana,” he said, and added jokingly, “even if they’re on the North Side (of Indianapolis). We all know how easy it is to get from the North Side to the South Side.”

Rigging up recording equipment and generating the needed numbers of online subscribers have been challenges for smaller localities, said Becca McCuaig, legal counsel for Accelerate Indiana Municipalities. “YouTube requires you to have a certain number of subscribers in order for it to be able to go live. So (town) clerk-treasurers have helped each other get enough subscribers to make sure they’re meeting those requirements.”
Smaltz says livestreaming will help keep local governments accountable and citizens connected at a time when many rural areas are losing their local news coverage. Indiana has nine counties without a local news source and 42 others with only one, according to Local News Initiative, a database kept by Northwestern University. Due to recent state and federal funding cuts, several of Indiana’s 17 public radio stations are in peril as well. The Indiana NPR network recently eliminated its statewide reporting team because of the $3.7 million in cuts.
Besides serving year-round residents, Smaltz said, “it really takes away the geographic barrier of someone who’s interested in (a locality) because maybe they have two homes. They have one home in Indianapolis and one home in southern Indiana, or their family is from southern Indiana. This is going to let them keep that community connection.”
David Bottorff, executive director of the Association of Indiana Counties, says he doesn’t know of any counties that are tracking increases in attendance or viewership since the new law took effect. But he does know one thing – some county officials are now suiting up for meetings. “I’ve had one member say, ‘Yeah, I dress a little bit nicer now that I know it’s going to be broadcast.’”",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-05-at-10.01.45 AM-e1762698193555-1024x503.jpeg,,,2025-11-10 07:17:49.418084

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer) Sid Allen did not set out on his 3D printing journey to manufacture firearm accessories in his garage.
Last year, he was printing custom Dungeons and Dragons figurines. For a decade before that, Allen, 28, was printing accessible attachments for his increasingly paralyzed father, who has since died from brain cancer: a gyroscopic mount so his cup wouldn’t fall over; stove knobs you don’t need to press to turn on; key pads for calling — “dozens, even hundreds, of things earlier on when he still had mobility.”
Allen, wearing his signature wizard hat, held his product: an AR-15 magazine speedloader, used to make reloading a firearm faster and easier, which his company, MangaBerry West, sells for $28 apiece. The speedloader is designed partly with accessibility in mind, he said, and can be used with limited hand mobility.
Allen and the other St. Cloud State University students who help with the business identify as leftists. Allen and Tarik Alduri, 23, said so discreetly at a recent St. Cloud gun show for fear of hurting business. But at home, Allen and Alduri, along with Riley Dahlberg, 20, freely discussed food stamps and taxes, President Donald Trump’s immigration policies and their gripes with the Democratic Party. Allen is the president, and Dahlberg vice president, of the St. Cloud College Democrats even though they are left of the party establishment on most issues.
When asked if they identify as Democrats, they took a lesser-of-two-evils stance and enthused about ranked-choice voting, which they said would allow for greater political diversity beyond a two-party system.
“What else are we gonna do? I’m not voting for Trump,” Alduri said.
Still, they decried Democrats’ move to make gun control a purity test, shutting the door on potential Democrats by turning “small gaps into massive issues,” especially given Republicans’ willingness to accept a wider range of views on many issues, Alduri said. “I think it’s sad that we have gotten to this point where the left thinks that they’re not allowed to own guns in order to stay aligned Democratic Party.”
Their disgruntled, arms-length acceptance of the Democrats underscores the party’s problem with young men, who left in droves in 2024.
Although Democrats had a good night during last week’s elections, the 2026 midterm will be a more significant test following 2024’s collapse: Six in 10 white men under 30 voted for Trump, while the president claimed half of young Hispanic men and one-third of under-30 Black men, according to the Associated Press.
Having lost a defining election to Trump, Democrats find themselves forced to ask how to broaden their tent — and whether that means inviting in gun rights advocates the party has largely shunned for more than a decade.

Defending the right to own assault weapons
Gov. Tim Walz embodies the Democrats massive shift on guns: His marksmanship and support for gun rights was a selling point when he ran for Congress in a rural swing district in 2006, and he earned an ‘A’ rating from the NRA. Walz was among the gun-friendly Democrats recruited and elected after the party blamed gun control for Al Gore’s loss in 2000, especially in rural America.
After Sandy Hook and especially the Parkland school shootings, Walz embraced gun control, and now he’s made it a centerpiece of his reelection campaign. He hosted a town hall in October with Gabby Giffords, his former congressional colleague who became a gun control activist after she was shot in a mass shooting; on Thursday night, First Lady Gwen Walz and DFL leaders held another town hall on gun violence.
After the mass shooting at Annunciation Church in August, which left two children dead and 21 others injured, Walz and Democrat lawmakers called for a ban on semi-automatic military-style assault weapons, defined in Minnesota law by a list of 17 firearm models and their offshoots, including AK-47s and AR-15s.
Democrats passed and Walz signed gun control laws in the 2023 legislative session, including universal background checks for all gun purchases and a “red flag” law that allows judges to confiscate guns from people who are deemed a danger to themselves or others. But they stopped short of banning assault weapons, in part from fear of election backlash, and they’re unlikely to garner the bipartisan support needed to ban assault weapons this year or next.

An assault weapons ban would “be a massive hit to our business,” Alduri said.
Allen explained the manufacturing process in the crowded detached garage that doubles as a storage space, surrounded by beakers, leftover plastic and a custom-built UV oven made from two-by-fours. He first prints the parts with a resin 3D printer and then dips those parts into an acetone-based solvent mixture before curing them in the UV oven.
Not apparent in the garage was the painstaking months-long process of perfecting the model, which included experimenting with different mixes of resin and crafting an algorithm to correct the curvature that a line of bullets make when lined up. Not counting different resins, Allen estimated he’s made 300 prototypes before the current speedloader, which allows the user to push 15 dummy rounds into an AR-15 magazine with ease.
Modifying the current model for handguns would be another obstacle.
But their devotion to gun rights — including the right to own so-called assault rifles — goes beyond self-interest, they said.
“I don’t think the issue is guns,” Alduri said, sporting a MangaBerry West cap. “It’s the fact that we just don’t care about each other, and that’s what makes it easier for somebody like Trump to come in and have ICE agents running around straight up kidnapping people.”
Alduri’s mantra, which he said at the gun show and at home, where he and Allen are roommates, is that the two best things you can do as a citizen are to bring your neighbors cookies and buy a gun.
Cookies to build community, and a gun to protect that community.
“What we see right now in the U.S. is that there’s been this destruction of community because we’re all being worked to the bone by some billionaire,” Alduri said.
Alduri studies political science and international relations and wants to go into immigration law or politics. His parents immigrated from Bosnia and Iraq — both war-stricken places.
Alduri said the current political climate gives him reason to consider self-defense.
“Am I expected to trust the American government or American cops to protect me? No, I don’t, quite frankly,” Alduri said.

Many of his fellow Democrats seem to agree; gun ownership is rising among Democrats, the Wall Street Journal reported last year.
Dahlberg’s argument mirrors what Republican gun rights advocates often said during the Obama and Biden presidencies: that guns offer protection against a tyrannical government.
Even though “there’s this idea that the US military would just crush people,” Dahlberg said, the presence of guns “has ensured that tyranny hasn’t spread, because people think it wouldn’t go very well for them as a dictator” in a country with more civilian guns than people.
Improving social services
The focus of a government should be on improving the “material concerns of the citizenry,” said Alduri, instead of banning guns and inhibiting people’s Second Amendment rights — a sentiment that the three shared.
“Democrats love to pat themselves on the back and be like, ‘We did it, guys. We banned AR-15s.’ Never mind the starving kid that’s sitting outside, or the homeless encampment,” said Alduri.
Allen said he believes that focusing on guns is an excuse for Democrats to not tackle “the really tough issues that would need a raise in taxes,” such as expanding food stamps or access to health care. He added that he prioritizes expanding social services like food stamps over gun policy, even if it meant having a gun control policy “that I really strongly disagree with and think is harmful.”
Allen, for his part, said he feels jaded about America’s capitalistic system “because of the way it abused my father.” His father, Allen said, designed inventions as a consultant for tech companies but died “in destitute poverty” after the companies gave him low disability pay and a health insurer denied his care for brain cancer.
Allen is studying patent law and also wants to go into politics in the future.

Yes to some gun restrictions
The group doesn’t take gun ownership lightly, and they do agree with Democrats on certain gun restrictions. Binary triggers, which fire one shot when the trigger is pulled down and another upon release, “are an extremely bad idea and need to be illegal,” Allen said, since it forces the shooter to have to release a second round. “It’s inherently unsafe.”
A judge struck down Minnesota’s binary trigger ban in August, which was part of a 1,400-page 2024 omnibus bill, as a violation of the state constitution’s rule that legislation be about one subject only.
They also said they support laws mandating waiting periods before purchasing a gun and safe storage laws that would require that guns be kept in a gun safe.
“We have a lack of respect for guns,” Alduri said. “Americans love guns but we don’t really respect how dangerous of a weapon that is.”
Despite being in favor of higher taxes for more robust social services, which is at the core of Democratic identity, the MangaBerry West guys said they’ve been told by Democrats that they aren’t real Democrats because of their support for gun rights.
They opt to respond with subtlety rather than rhetorical firepower.
The group hosts backyard bonfires for the St. Cloud State debate team, and the conversation naturally turns to politics — but they avoid debating their friends, some of whom hold more mainstream Democratic views. Instead, in political discussions, they focus on “providing our ideas, and if we plant that seed in them, then maybe they’ll view it with more genuine curiosity,” Dahlberg said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MG_3565-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-10 07:17:49.418084

(Getty Images)In the run-up to the 2025 legislative session, lawmakers and the governor made a clear promise to deliver property tax relief for Hoosiers. Local leaders understand that commitment and are eager to provide efficiencies and relief where it makes sense. At the same time, many cities and towns around the state are now beginning to see the other side of the ledger come into focus.
As local governments move through their first full budget cycles under Senate Enrolled Act 1, a clear trend is emerging: the law significantly restricts long-term revenue growth at the very moment cities and towns are confronting rapidly rising costs. When revenue growth is compressed and fiscal uncertainty increases, the outcome is predictable — major cuts to local services.
Because employees account for the largest share of municipal budgets, hiring freezes and the anticipated elimination of positions have been the most common responses so far. But personnel decisions are only part of the story. New public safety buildings and equipment are being shelved, neighborhood sidewalk programs are being canceled, community amenities that were expected to open in 2026 are now on hold, and some communities can no longer afford to match Community Crossings grants needed to upgrade failing infrastructure.
If SEA 1 is not adjusted, what does the next decade look like on the ground?
It looks like delayed or canceled police and fire stations, and departments that can’t field enough personnel to meet call volumes. It looks like increased response times when seconds matter.
It looks like streets and roads going longer between repaving, and recent projects deteriorating faster because basic maintenance has been pushed off.
It looks like shuttered pools, reduced hours at parks and community centers, fewer programs for kids and seniors, and less support—both financial and in-kind—for the parades, festivals, and local events that define small-town Indiana and city neighborhoods alike.
Impacts coming 
None of this happens all at once. It happens quietly over time: a delayed hire here, a project that gets “pushed to next year,” a park program that doesn’t return. By the time the impact is obvious, turning around will be far more expensive.
These fiscal pressures are not confined to a single city or one part of Indiana. Under SEA 1, local leaders are wrestling with:

A lack of reliable state revenue projections for 2026, 2027, and 2028 income tax revenues, which makes responsible long-range budgeting far more difficult.
A new annual adoption process for the income tax that introduces instability, particularly for communities under 3,500 residents that must petition their counties each year for distributions.
Technical complications with debt coverage and TIF neutralization that put infrastructure and economic development projects at risk.

To be clear, local leaders are not opposed to tax reform. They are asking for balance. Communities across the state are already stretched thin as they work to meet residents’ expectations and maintain the amenities that attract new residents and businesses. Any tax reform must be crafted in a way that supports — rather than undermines — the fiscal health of municipalities. If state and local leaders approach the 2026 session with that shared understanding, it can be productive for everyone.
Modifications, not repeal
That is exactly the spirit in which Aim, Accelerate Indiana Municipalities, is engaging on SEA 1.
We are not asking lawmakers to repeal the law or abandon their policy goals. We are asking for targeted amendments that maintain the promise of tax relief while making SEA 1 workable for the cities and towns that must live under it.
In November, Aim is convening regional roundtables — including in Mishawaka and nine other communities — to hear in detail how SEA 1 is affecting local budgets and services on the ground. Based on what we are already hearing from our members, Aim has prepared a package of technical fixes to SEA 1: improvements to the annual adoption and distribution process; clearer and more dependable revenue projections; adjustments to rate splits so municipalities are not structurally disadvantaged; greater fiscal certainty for small communities; and corrections to debt-coverage and TIF provisions so local infrastructure and economic development tools continue to function as intended.
At the same time, we took seriously the message from lawmakers in 2025 that local government must continue to modernize and pursue efficiencies. Alongside our SEA 1 proposals, Aim is advancing a series of modernization and efficiency ideas to help local governments operate at an even more effective level. A key priority is updating the state’s government modernization statute to make it easier and more flexible for units to restructure, share services, and collaborate where it benefits taxpayers. We are also exploring streamlined service-delivery approaches and better use of technology and data so communities can stretch every dollar as far as possible.
The message is simple: the General Assembly sets the fiscal framework, and local leaders want to be partners in making that framework work. Aim is coming to the table with solutions on both sides of the equation — responsible, targeted fixes to SEA 1 and serious ideas to modernize and improve local government.
If we work together in 2026, Indiana can honor its commitment to taxpayers while still ensuring that cities and towns have the tools they need to provide core services and build the quality places where Hoosiers want to live and raise their families.

So she and her longtime partner, Anthony La Pietra, decided to give up and fund the entire operation themselves, cashing in La Pietra’s retirement to build a greenhouse in Adrian, an hour outside of Kansas City. 
After two years of “blood, sweat and tears,” they finally received the state’s final approval to begin operating on Sept. 3. But just hours after the state’s email arrived, a massive storm crushed one side of the greenhouse.  
“To go from such a high to such an incredibly bottom low…” she said. “It’s been such a roller coaster.”
Despite the setback, her family rallied to fix the wall, and now their business, Bud Wizard, is expected to have its first harvest in the coming weeks.
Blum’s facility is among the 12 microbusinesses the state has approved to begin operating out of 68 total licenses issued. Two are dispensaries. The rest are wholesale licenses like Blum’s that can grow up to 250 plants and manufacture marijuana products. 
The microbusiness program — sometimes called the social-equity cannabis program — was designed to boost opportunities in the industry for people in disadvantaged communities that have been most impacted by the war on drugs. It began in 2023, after passing as part of the constitutional amendment to legalize recreational marijuana in 2022.
Cannabis regulators concerned about predatory practices in Missouri’s social equity program

Up until this summer, the state had approved only a handful licenses to commence operations – which involves meeting rigorous health standards and security protocols. But in the past few months, the microbusiness community has finally started to fill in, with the state greenlighting a surge of cultivation licensees.
Like Blum, many of these owners stopped looking for funding and finally decided to put their life savings into getting the business off the ground. Now they’ve either had their first harvest this month or are expecting one in the next few weeks. 
James Mondl, owner of Klondike Cannabis micro cultivation facility in Farmington, just watched his first harvest ship Tuesday to another licensed facility for the manufacturing phase.
“I haven’t completely exhaled, to be honest,” he said. “We’ve got a lot of time and money in this, and so to see the product leave today was as big a step – maybe a bigger one than when we brought plants in.”
Wholesalers’ products can legally only go to the two operational microbusiness dispensaries at the moment: 816 Dispensary in Platte City and Kush 21 in Poplar Bluff. The Missouri Constitution mandates that micro cultivators only sell to micro dispensaries.
Lesley Turk, chief equity officer with the Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation who oversees the program, says the success of the micro community is like a “puzzle” because it depends on enough growers and dispensaries being up and running at the same time. 
And both of them depend on the middleman – the manufacturers – or wholesalers who have gotten approval to make things like edibles and vapes.
“My excitement lies in the next six months,” Turk said.
As anticipation around more micros opening builds, so does the pressure to succeed. 
Some license owners have already hit a number of road blocks and aren’t sure how much more they can invest into getting the business off the ground. Sam Vosburg, whose cultivation facility in Aurora has been operational since March, fears he invested his retirement on a failed business. 
“We’re suffering right now,” Vosburg, owner of Ozark Mountain Gypsy LLC, told The Independent in October. “I don’t know how much longer I keep my lights on. Our electric bills are crazy, and we’re not making any money. So, yeah, it’s not looking good.”
However last week, Vosburg was approved to become one of the first two manufacturers, so he says he sees “a light at the end of the tunnel.”
Blum is the chairwoman of the Missouri Microbusiness Association, and she says her passion for the industry is a major driving force in making it through “one of the hardest things I’ve ever done in my entire life.” 
The other driver is her four daughters. 
“One day they’ll have dreams,” Blum said of her daughters, “and they’ll want to do something big, that’s insurmountable and accomplish it because they watched their mom and their dad accomplish it.”
 Winning the lottery

Jimi Poe is the owner of 816 Dispensary, which was the first micro dispensary to open its doors to the public on Aug. 16. He’s quickly become a pillar for the microbusiness community, as someone to not only buy wholesalers’ products but also offer guidance on getting started. 
“I’m not going to succeed if I can’t get wholesalers to succeed,” he said.
October was his biggest month yet, he said, with 1,500 transactions. He works closely with Blume LLC, one of the first operating wholesalers, because he says they’ve been “killing it” on their craft marijuana buds, or what the industry calls flower.
Up until now, a major challenge for Poe has been that no wholesale facility had the capability to manufacture products, such as edibles or vapes, because it can require expensive equipment. 
With the state approving Vosburg and Kansas-City area microbusiness Urban Farm to manufacture products, Poe only expects his sales to grow. Another one in the Farmington area, Levity Cannabis, has also applied for approval, according to the division. 
Nearly 20 years ago, Poe was sent to prison for 14 months on a non-violent marijuana felony – a charge that made it hard to find work or a place to live. Because the program aims to mend some of the harm marijuana prohibition has caused on people’s lives, his offense made him eligible to apply for the microbusiness program.
“When I was in prison, I was telling myself I was never going to sell cannabis again,” he said. “And now I’m legally able to sell cannabis at my own store. So it’s been a crazy journey, that is for sure.”
In 2023, Mitchell Alexander submitted one microbusiness application with his uncle, Jesse Greco, who qualifies for the program as a disabled veteran, and paid a $1,500 fee. Their application was entered into the lottery with more than 1,600 applications, and they were picked.
“He and I got together and decided to do it because we had nothing to lose,” Alexander said. “Because the lottery was: if you lose, you get your money back. If you win, you get your license.”
Alexander runs ReLeaf Dispensary in Kansas City, and he’s excited to grow in the way that he believes produces the best weed: living soil.
“No chemicals, no pesticides,” he said. “It’s literally, we’re just feeding the soil, and it’s as organic as it gets.”
For Greco, cannabis has always been something he turned to in his life for his PTSD, Alexander said. They’ve invested their own money and resources, and he’s optimistic about their first harvest that’s expected just before Christmas.

“We take so much pride in being completely independent,” he said. “We didn’t have any consulting groups help us out. We really just grassrooted this, and that’s exactly how we’re going to run this company.”
The team at Monsta Farms LLC in Sarcoxie has a similar mantra. It’s a group that includes two couples who’ve all pulled together their own money and time. They all have a “strength in the building,” said co-owner Chris Hampel, and everyone’s doing something they’re passionate about.
“I like watering the plants, for example,” Hampel said. “My wife hates watering the plants. But she’ll sit over there with dirt and pot plants all day long. And she loves that. I hate that.” 
However, they each balance their cannabis work with their fulltime jobs, including two who work as nurses. Their collective dream is to make it their fulltime jobs. 
They just had their first harvest on Monday.
Chad Sommer, an owner of Strainworx LLC in Lebanon, is also expecting his first harvest soon, he said, after two years of trying to keep “everything in check.” 
“I mean, trying to keep family in check, trying to keep my fulltime job in check, and then also wanting to try to build this out,” he said. 
His specialty is industrial automation systems, and it’s taken time to finetune that process, he said. He got into cannabis because he suffered from migraines. He realized a cannabis gummy worked a lot better at controlling them than the expensive shots he was receiving.
“So from that point, it’s held a special position in my heart,” Sommer said.
Now his migraines are gone. His team had to “hit several retirement funds,” to start up the business, but they’re optimistic.
“One thing that is a challenge is for many of the micros…starting resources,” he said. “It is a tough start. Everything is so expensive with the hope that one day you get a return.”
 Financial troubles

When Vosburg’s cultivation facility Ozark Mountain Gypsy LLC got its approval to open in March, he was feeling “very optimistic.” 
“The only thing I didn’t calculate was the delays from the state,” he said.
State marijuana rules mandate that regulators approve labels before products are sent to stores. And it took months for that approval to come back. 
“Now they’re putting all these tutorials on how to do this,” Vosburg said of the labels and packaging. “We were doing this from scratch with no help.” 
Turk said the division has worked to improve tutorials, and now each facility has a designated compliance representative who can help guide the micros through the labeling and packaging approval process. 
Another challenge for his team has been the lack of manufacturing equipment. It’s been hard to compete with the other companies that are selling only flower and pre-rolled joints. 
All together, Vosburg estimates they’ve put $500,000 of their own money into the business. And he fears they could lose it all at any moment. 
But as of last week, Vosburg was approved to manufacture products on a small scale, providing him with a way forward. 
“I could pay my electric bill if I can sell a few dabs by the end of the month,” he said.
Veteran David Huckins owns a dispensary license in Columbia with his wife, and they lead a weekly podcast to help microbusinesses share resources on a variety of topics.
But they aren’t anywhere close to being able to open, he said. 
While the cultivators can often find land to build a facility in rural areas, dispensaries need to be in places with high visibility and traffic. And that’s hard when landlords often don’t want to lease a building to dispensaries, Huckins said, and he can’t get capital to buy a building.
The Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation is not aware of any microbusinesses that have received loans from banks, a spokesperson said.
“It’s so hard for the cannabis businesses,” he said. “I don’t qualify for small business loans. So far, this has not been the blessing that I hoped it was going to be.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Brenton-e1762631157954-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-11-10 07:17:49.418084

Christopher Helali had been fascinated by Epstein and what his story said about global power and politics in today’s world. He took a chance on an eBay listing and picked up the artifact at the post office near his home in Vershire.

How did a Vershire man come to possess the address book of infamous pedophile, international financier and friend to the world’s most powerful people Jeffrey Epstein?
Why, eBay, of course. 
Five years ago, Christopher Helali saw the book for sale online and took a gamble, spending a few hundred bucks on the off chance the artifact was the real thing.
When the “little black book” filled with the contacts of the world’s most notorious sex criminal arrived in Vershire, Helali picked it up at the post office and opened it in gloves and a mask, careful not to leave fingerprints. Though at the time the veracity of the document remained in question, Helali himself was quickly convinced.
“Within a few moments, it was very much apparent that this was a legitimate item,” he recalled. He was in possession of the only known, publicly held object of its kind.
A general manager of an international law firm, a sometimes investigative journalist and the international secretary of the American Communist Party, Helali had long been interested in Epstein and what his story said about global power and politics today.
“I subscribe to the theories that there’s much more to the story than just a depraved and degenerate rapist and sexual predator,” Helali, who also serves as the elected high bailiff of Orange County, said in an interview in August.

In private life, Epstein entertained the rich and famous in his Manhattan townhouse — often called the borough’s largest — and on his private Caribbean island, Little Saint James. 
The first cracks in the billionaire’s mysterious facade appeared when police in Florida began investigating Epstein for sexually abusing underage girls in 2005. He later pleaded guilty to procuring a child for prostitution and soliciting a prostitute.
For more than a decade after, Epstein continued his life of luxury. But in 2019, he was charged federally on allegations he trafficked minors for sex, drawing international attention. He died in a New York jail cell the following month, and his death was ruled a suicide, though conspiracy theories abound about the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death. 
The little black book arrived in Vershire the year after, and Helali began contacting Epstein experts, like the Miami Herald journalist Julie K. Brown; Brace Belden, co-host of the popular leftwing podcast TrueAnon; and reporters at Business Insider. 
In 2021, Business Insider produced a documentary short on Helali’s find and their successful effort to confirm its authenticity through forensic analysis. The book was first discovered on a Manhattan street in the 1990s, according to the documentary, and the woman who picked it off the sidewalk eventually put it up for sale online around the time of Epstein’s most recent arrest. 
Another little black book dating to the early-to-mid-2000s has drawn FBI attention and was published in redacted form by Gawker in 2015. But Helali said his version contains more than 200 additional names, expanding the scope of what’s known about Epstein’s network. Among those figures are actress Morgan Fairchild, investor Carl Icahn and former New Republic publisher Martin Peretz.
As a document, the book tells a story. A picture of an inner and outer circle emerges. Some names feature 10 phone numbers, according to Helali, and the book includes codes to buildings and hand-scribbled marginalia. There’s a list within the book of masseuses, but the names are coded, he said. 
“Donald Trump’s entry in this book is enormous, for example, and his name is highlighted,” Helali said. “I think that shows a layer of relations that the current president wants to distance himself from.”

Trump has said publicly his friendship with Epstein ended some 20 years ago, before Epstein’s legal troubles began, and that the two had a falling out.
Helali plans to use the book for his own reporting. Currently, he’s focused on one name he said is within Trump’s sphere, someone whom other journalists indicate was an associate of Epstein.
“There’s some more depth to what we can uncover, and I hope that we can continue to learn more,” he said. 
Epstein has become a fixture of American political discourse and the public imagination since his arrest and death in 2019, but attention has ratcheted up since Trump took office a second time. Since then, Democrats — and even some Republicans — in Washington have pushed for release of the government’s investigatory files on the disgraced billionaire financier, which are expected to contain mention of Trump. 
But Epstein is far from a partisan issue, and his network spanned political parties and even continents — former President Bill Clinton was a known associate. Prior to Trump’s second term, some Republicans similarly called for the release of the so-called Epstein Files, and the financier’s real crimes and dealings play into the popular rightwing conspiracy theory QAnon. 
“This is not only bipartisan,” Helali said. “This is the elite of the world.”
To Helali, the importance of the Epstein case is in understanding how a web of important  political leaders, academics, economists, financiers and intellectuals found themselves in the orbit of a man engaged in such sinister crimes. That is not to say all those who knew Epstein were complicit in his criminality, he emphasized. But current and former U.S. presidents, a former Israeli prime minister, a member of the British royal family and a Saudi Arabian prince have all been connected to the disgraced billionaire. 
“These are ultimately people involved in public life who are engaged in this activity, and they should be held accountable for what’s going on,” Helali said. “We need to understand as the public: What’s going on behind these closed doors? What’s going on on a private island where young girls are being trafficked?”
Having studied and photographed the address book, Helali has tried to sell it to no avail. There’s been no shortage of interest in the artifact, which an auction house valued at $75,000 or more, but interested buyers fear the book could be seized by the government, Helali said, or that they themselves could become subject to public dissection by theorists. 
Besides a dress jacket, few other objects owned by Epstein have ever been auctioned off. 
For now, Helali remains in possession of the book. And he thinks it’s possible that makes him a target. He said he’s regularly stopped at the border while traveling, though that may be because of his political activities.
“I think that certainly it hasn’t helped my situation, and it’s added even more questions,” Helali said of owning the little black book. “But in any case, I mean, I don’t think that there’s anything necessarily wrong with or illegal about, you know, having possession of an item that helps us with our work.”
While the subject of Epstein and his connection to the halls of power has gone quiet in the daily news cycle since this summer’s fever pitch, the saga sustains a perennial appeal for Helali and others like him. They believe there’s more going on behind the scenes than what most people imagine. To them, it’s clear, as long as you pay attention: In Epstein, the most far-fetched of conspiracies crystalize — if not in verifiable fact, then at least in circumstantial evidence. 
“The vast networks of financial interests, intelligence interests, and the military aspects that intersect with the media, with powerful people who can shape narratives and can shape people’s perceptions” all join together in the Epstein tale, Helali said. “What it ultimately raises the specter of is what people sometimes refer to as the deep state.”

This is a problem for Missouri Republicans, who demonstrated last legislative session that their top priority is not the business of the state and attending to Missourians’ needs, but the reinstatement of the abortion ban that voters just rejected. 
Because they know their constituents do not want the ban back in place, they have united on a strategy of deception. They hope to tell voters that the ballot measure would protect abortion rather than recriminalize it.
This is not a new strategy. Missouri Republicans regularly seek to thwart the people’s constitutional right to enact or reject laws via citizen-led ballot measures by mischaracterizing what those measures will do. This leads to extensive and wasteful litigation when advocates are forced to sue to get accurate ballot summaries. 
Though it’s not new, it is a new level of egregiousness — they are using rape victims, incest victims and women in medical distress as bait. If they are not stopped by the court of appeals, the ballot summary will tell voters the measure would protect abortion access for these individuals when it would actually take it away.
The summary, written by lawmakers and tweaked by Secretary of State Denny Hoskins on the order of a circuit court judge, asks voters if they want to “amend the Missouri Constitution to:

         Guarantee women’s medical care for emergencies, ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages;
        Ensure women’s safety during abortions;
        Ensure parental consent for minors;
        Repeal Article I, section 36, approved in 2024; allow abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest; and
        Prohibit sex-change procedures for children?”

Almost no one knows what Article I, section 36 of the Missouri Constitution is. That term is used rather than the name of the amendment — The Reproductive Freedom Initiative — in order to hide from voters that the measure would repeal what we just approved. It would reinstate the ban, but add extremely limited and unworkable exceptions. 
Under current law, victims of rape and incest already have a right to abortion because everyone does. This measure would limit that right to 12 weeks gestation. Victims of incest are typically children. When children are impregnated by their abusers, they often do not realize they are pregnant until after 12 weeks gestation. The measure would force children to carry to term. Lying to voters about what a law will do to abused children is an unconscionable perversion of democracy.
Exceptions do not work in practice. And Republican legislators do not want them to. That is why the original ban didn’t have any exceptions for rape and incest. The measure leaves the legislature free to enact insurmountable obstacles in order to accomplish what they originally legislated  — rape victims being forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term like everyone else.
The claim to be protecting abortion access in the case of ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages is both an attempt to mislead voters into thinking they are protecting the rights of pregnant women in medical crisis, and an attempt to answer for the harm women miscarrying in Missouri experienced when abortion was banned. 
Missouri’s anti-abortion legislators have consistently denied any responsibility for the documented harm that miscarrying women experienced when the ban was in place. The felony ban that the measure would reinstate imposes criminal liability for doctors should they violate it — and what constitutes a violation is nebulous. Laws like this force doctors to prioritize avoiding legal risk over the health of the patient, predictably leading to doctors and hospital attorneys denying or delaying care to miscarrying patients.  
The carve-out for miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies is an acknowledgement that harm did occur, but it does not solve the problem. It would repeal the Reproductive Freedom Initiative’s protection for the “good faith judgment” of doctors. It instead uses a “reasonable medical judgment” standard that courts have acknowledged imperils patients. The “reasonable medical judgment” standard puts doctors at risk of having their emergency medical decisions second-guessed by prosecutors and prosecution witnesses. It is a recipe for hospital attorneys refusing doctors permission to treat patients in medical distress. 
The rest of the summary is equally misleading. “Ensure women’s safety during abortions” misleadingly implies there would be legal abortions to have, as does “ensure parental consent.” What is there to consent to if your daughter cannot have a legal abortion? 
“Prohibit sex-change procedures for children” implies that gender affirming care is currently legal for children, which it is not. And children with gender dysphoria weren’t having “procedures” when it was legal. It’s another use of children as bait.  
The measure is an abortion ban. 
The idea that the summary is a good faith attempt to communicate to voters what the law would do doesn’t pass the laugh test. This sort of gamesmanship is an attack on the democratic process that makes a joke of our court system. 
It is not the job of the legislature or the secretary of state to see how much the courts will let them get away with. Their job is to serve Missourians by carrying out their constitutional duties. 
Missouri voters are not enemies to be tricked and defeated, we are citizens with rights that our elected officials have sworn to uphold.

(Getty Images)A bipartisan bill to legalize online sports betting in Wisconsin is speeding through the state Legislature.
After being introduced in late October, the Assembly and Senate versions of the legislation received public hearings this week, and on Thursday the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Revenue voted 5-3 in favor of advancing the bill to the Senate floor. 
Under the Wisconsin Constitution, any gambling must be managed by the state’s federally recognized Native American tribes. Sports betting was first allowed in the state in 2021, but all of those bets had to be made in person at tribal casinos. The proposed new legislation would allow online sports betting using a “hub and spoke” model in which the servers running the betting websites and apps are housed on tribal land. 
The structure is similar to the state of Florida’s agreement with the Seminole tribe, which owns and operates the Hard Rock Casino brand. 
Proponents of the bill, including a bipartisan mix of legislators, representatives of the tribes and the state’s professional sports teams, say that hundreds of millions of dollars in unregulated online sports bets are already being made in Wisconsin, so legalizing the practice will kill the black market while providing tax revenue and consumer protections. 
But critics say the Legislature is rushing through a bill that could face legal hurdles and ignoring the ways in which online sports betting can be especially harmful for people with gambling addictions. 
Wisconsin’s legalization move comes seven years after the U.S. Supreme Court legalized sports betting in 2018. So far, 39 states have legalized sports betting and 32 of them have allowed online or mobile sports bets. 
Wisconsin would be the first state to legalize online sports gambling since North Carolina and Vermont did so in June 2023. Only now, Wisconsin’s legislators are doing so amid a national reassessment of the country’s relationship with sports gambling. Ads for apps such as FanDuel and DraftKings are ubiquitous. Both the National Basketball Association  and Major League Baseball are dealing with the fallout of player gambling scandals. Questions have arisen about the healthiness of frictionless sports gambling for the predominately young, male users of these apps. 
“American culture, and American sporting culture is trying to adjust to this new widely legalized moment,” Dr. Jason Lopez, a professor at UW-Madison who studies sports media and gambling, told the Wisconsin Examiner. 
If the bill is passed and signed into law, sports betting wouldn’t be immediately legalized. The state and tribes would need to renegotiate their existing gaming compacts and then those new agreements would need approval from the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
But, Rep. Tyler August (R-Walworth), said at Tuesday’s Senate hearing, the state should get moving before the illegal betting market grows too large. 
“I don’t gamble, but I think  it’s the right thing to do, based on some of the data that we’ve seen,” said August, whose district is right on the Illinois border, which residents can easily cross to place online bets. “This is an activity that’s not declining, it’s increasing. And I think that it’s appropriate for us to deal with this now before it gets even bigger.”
Jim Crawford, attorney general of the Potawatomi tribe, said an estimated $1 billion in illegal online sports bets were made by Wisconsinites last year. At the hearing, tribal representatives highlighted the services tribal governments could improve with the increased sports betting revenue. 
“While online gaming is currently the wild west in Wisconsin with no regulations or protections for consumers,” Crawford said. “It does not have to be. This bill is a first step in ensuring that consumers will be able to have a legal, regulated and protected way of participating in this extremely popular technology.”
Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green), one of the bill’s co-authors, said he doesn’t believe the bill will put gambling addicts at further risk. But Sens. Andre Jacque (R-New Franken), Rachael Cabral-Guevara (R-Appleton) and Sarah Keyeski (D-Lodi) voted against moving the bill out of committee. Jacque said at the hearing he was worried about the recent gambling scandals in professional sports and the risk of gambling addiction. 
“This would allow them to place bets by their device anywhere in the state, as opposed to going on site at a casino, at a reservation,” Jacque said. “I would say, from an opportunity standpoint, that potentially could feed more into addictive behavior.” 
Noah Henderson, the director of the sport management program at Loyola University Chicago, said the frictionless nature of online sports betting is one of its challenges. 
“Brick and mortar sports books provide a cooling-off period, when people are trying to chase losses, if they have to get in their car again and go to the sports book, they might realize halfway there that they’re acting impulsively,” Henderson said. “It’s easier for families to see the signs of gambling disorder or problem gambling when individuals have to leave the home, right? It’s a lot easier to hide problem gambling or a gambling disorder when it’s only on a mobile device, where there’s no absences, they’re not leaving the house more than they normally do.” 
Henderson said there’s not much Wisconsin’s Legislature can do about the societal acceptance of legalized sports betting and a culture that has fully absorbed the promotion of gambling. 
“It is incredibly common to see on the pre-game show, the halftime show, the best bets, the best live bets, the best parlay combinations. So I think that there’s only so much Wisconsin can do to stop that, to stop sports gambling from being the culture of young men — predominantly young men — watching sports,” he told the Examiner. 
So, according to Henderson, the state is faced with a choice between legalizing and facing the broader cultural changes head-on while getting the tax revenue or hoping that prohibition disincentivizes sports betting. 
“I think that there might be a bit of harm reduction in this public policy where, if we keep mobile sports wagering outlawed in this state, it’s not going to curtail the sweeping normalization of sports gambling that we’ve seen,” Henderson said. “That’s at a national level. So Wisconsin has two options, which is to not allow it, and hope that the lack of resources for legal sports gambling incentivizes young men and women not to partake in this. But at the end of the day, there’s still a market and a need … they would rather regulate and tax it for consumer protection and to grow a tax base off of it and not have sports gambling happening without being able to derive some tax benefit from it that can go towards gambling education, public schools, or whatever else Wisconsin’s government deems important.” 
One organization that is against the bill is the Sports Betting Alliance, which represents the major online sportsbooks. 
The bill uses the federal Indian Gaming Regulation Act as a mechanism to allow online bets in Wisconsin. That law allows tribes to license their gaming operations out to third parties so long as the tribe gets 60% of the net revenue. 
Damon Stewart, an attorney for the alliance, said at the hearing that the revenue sharing requirement would make it too expensive for the most popular apps to partner with the tribes and provide their already existing apps and infrastructure. He also said he believes the law as currently written runs afoul of federal law. 
“We support the goal of legal online sports betting in Wisconsin. We want to work with the tribes. We want to partner with them,” Stewart said. “But this bill will only result in limited choices for customers. There’s no national brands, no chance for all the tribes to actually participate in the market, no ability to make an effective dent in the illegal market that already exists and years of litigation that will hold up the implementation of the law.” 
Stewart argued in his testimony that without the name recognition of the most popular apps, the legalization effort may not effectively kill the black market. Henderson said it’s possible for the tribes to develop their own infrastructure, but it’s easier to let the bigger companies manage the administration if the revenue sharing deal can be worked out. 
“This is probably a losing endeavor for those big sports books to enter a mid-sized sports gambling market with already pretty challenging margins,” Henderson said. “Especially when sports books enter a new market for sports gambling, there’s a lot of upfront costs that come with advertising that usually these businesses and markets take several years to even become profitable with more favorable regulations in place.” 
“Legislation can be amended. It doesn’t seem like this is the only formulation of it, but I think revenue sharing can definitely happen,” he continued. “I just don’t know if the 60-40 model makes sense for retailers to want to come in. Otherwise it would just be much like Florida, where tribal governments would have to build the infrastructure on their own or purchase white light label sports gambling software and pass it off as their own.”
In his testimony, Stewart called for the Legislature to slow down the process and get it right the first time. 
“I want to be respectful. It’s just my perception that with a bill dropped last week, two hearings this week, it does seem to be, compared to a lot of legislation, a bit of a rush,” Stewart said. “And on the topic of this complexity, a topic of this importance that affects a lot of citizens of the state, I would hope it would be seen as reasonable as asking to let us have the chance to work with the tribes.” 
The tribal representatives testifying said they were prepared to move forward without the big name apps. 
“We certainly appreciate the Sports Betting Alliance’s support of the goal of this legislation,” Crawford said. “But it’s also something that is a little bit concerning to us, that they are sort of implying that we don’t have the capability of operating statewide mobile sports, which, if you’ve ever been to our facility and to our retail sports betting, you know that we do a pretty good job, and the customers are happy. And so we look forward to doing that on a statewide basis, on a regulated basis, where the consumers are protected and they are generating revenues for the state of Wisconsin that stay in the state of Wisconsin.”

Clark recently announced he’s running for Congress to represent Wisconsin’s 7th Congressional District.
Incumbent Tom Tiffany (R-Minocqua) is running for governor and two of the highest profile Republican state senators in the district — Romaine Quinn of Rice Lake and Mary Felzkowski of Tomahawk — both recently announced they will seek reelection to  the state Senate. The other candidates who have announced they are running for Tiffany’s seat,  three Republicans and one Democrat, have little districtwide name recognition. 
Clark sees an opportunity to mount a strong campaign as he tries to flip the large, Republican-leaning district, which covers much of the top half of Wisconsin, from red to blue.
“I think this is the first time in 15 years to have a truly competitive election in the 7th Congressional District,” he said. 
Clark, who is also not widely known in the 7th CD, has his work cut out for him. His background in logging, as the owner of Clark Forestry, Inc., could appeal to voters in the northwestern district, where forestry products are a critical part of the economy. He has also worked as a forestry consultant with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and as a forest ecologist for The Nature Conservancy, and was the executive director and a founding board member of Wisconsin’s Green Fire, a conservation group. 
He also has a history of building relationships with Republicans and independents, which is critical in a  district that has voted by wide margins for Republicans since 2010, starting with former U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Hayward), now Secretary of Transportation. Duffy who won the district before it was redrawn following the last Census, and then increased his winning margins in the redistricted boundaries for four more elections. Tiffany also won by wide margins.
At a meeting of Democrats in Cable on Oct. 22 at The River Eatery, a venue heavily supported by the silent sports community that tends to vote blue, Clark was asked if he would reach out to independents and Republicans in the district. He answered in the affirmative, saying his goal is to convince 40,000 voters who either did not vote or voted Republican in the last congressional election to “reevaluate” their decision.
“I’m asking a lot of people who may have voted Republican in the past to think about who’s going to represent their interest the best and who’s got the ability to work for you and will show up and listen,” he said. “People want to shake your hand and look you in the eye and believe that they share enough with you that they could trust you to represent them, even if you didn’t agree with them on everything.”
At that Oct 22 meeting, Clark criticized policy decisions in Washington he said were “hurtful and damaging and are being felt across rural America right now.”
Clark is critical of the Big Beautiful Bill passed this summer by Republicans, and of their refusal to extend Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies. More than 270,000 Wisconsinites are projected to lose health insurance because of either dropping their coverage when premiums rise or losing Medicaid under the new rules. .
Clark is also concerned there will be fewer federal dollars to support rural hospitals.
“The health care outcomes are going to be worse and the rural health care system that we all rely on is going to continue to get worse because we’re going to lose doctors and we’re going to lose specialists and we’re going to lose clinics,” he said.
Support for wood pulp sustainable fuel initiative
Hayward is in the running, along with two other sites in Michigan and Minnesota, for a large $1.5 billion sustainable aviation fuel plant using pulp wood. The Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation is offering $60 million in incentives on top of a  $150 million grant funded through the Department of Natural Resources forestry account. It could be a boon to the wood pulp industry, but there have also been environmental concerns that the operation involving chipping trees in the field would leave less timber debris that adds nutrients to the soil, helping to protect the long-term health of the forest.
As a forester, Clark  believes the project would be good for the economy. The state’s  pulp and paper industries have been in a long  decline.  Clark says chipping  can be done in a manner that doesn’t risk the forest, but he is also critical of the  state’s plan to offer  the $150 million grant.
“We need to find new uses for wood from Wisconsin forests, and it’s really important that we have those markets for wood so that people managing forest land can continue to do that and we have a strong forest-based economy,” he said. “The sustainable aviation fuel truly is an opportunity to add a new product, or forest products mix, that could be good for forest conservation and forest ownership.”
“What I’m concerned about,” he added “and I don’t think it’s a good idea, is to hand out a $150 million cash subsidy to try to get into a bidding war with other states to land this plan.” He says he prefers the idea of offering tax credits as incentives to “writing a big blank check to this company.”
Worries about privatizing forestry
Clark also supports the Good Neighbor Authority program with the U.S. Forest Service, which involves county forestry departments helping to manage federal forest harvests. U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-Madison) was instrumental in establishing the program.  
“What the Good Neighbor Authority has done is just provide some extra flexibility for the Forest Service to get important work done and to meet their timber goals,” he said. “Working through states, it can work well when it’s well managed, but the risk here is that this administration throws open the door to basically privatize most of forest management, and if you let that happen, you’re going to have people and organizations setting up these timber sales that aren’t respecting the wildlife habitat and the soil conservation and the water protection that all needs to be part of any forest management. So the training and the standards and maintaining consistency are some of the most important things that we need to do with Good Neighbor Authority, and it’s got to be well managed or it won’t be successful.”
Help for Wisconsin farmers and small business
The number of small dairy farms in Wisconsin continues to decline as giant operations grow. Clark says the solution to the scourge of farm bankruptcies is to work on returning to supply management, keeping the milk supply at a level that offers attractive prices instead of emphasizing higher production, which suppresses prices and favors larger dairy operations.
“Honestly, as long as the incentives are all toward maximizing production that’s going to continue to keep prices at a place where only the biggest producers are going to survive and we’ll continue to see the erosion of the small farms who simply can’t produce enough milk at a cost above production,” he said. “Other countries that have effective supply management programs are actually able to maintain pricing that allows everybody to stay in business, and I think that’s the conversation among milk producers and folks in Congress that needs to be had.”
Clark is also critical of Trump’s tariffs for undermining efforts in the farming community to establish overseas markets.
“We’re seeing right now the impacts of the tariff war on everything from soybean producers who [lost]  markets in China … to hardwood lumber producers here in Wisconsin, who also have depended on Canadian and other international markets that are losing those markets, to ginseng producers in Marathon County, who have now lost their single biggest customer, China, which purchases the vast majority of American ginseng,” he said.  “All those markets that took years to develop are being essentially kneecapped by this president in this crazy tariff war.”
On his platform for “rebuilding our rural economy” Clark notes the need for “long-overdue tax reform that claws back 40 years of tax giveaways to the wealthiest Americans and our most profitable corporations.”
“We need a much fairer system,” he said. “There are simply way too many gigantic tax benefits that the largest corporations are able to use in order to effectively pay almost no taxes, and in many cases, these are some of the most profitable industries in our nation. You know, the net result of that is that we’ve got a giant amount of national debt. I believe it’s over $37 trillion of national debt. That is not good for America, and we can’t balance that debt on the backs of the people who need the services of the government the most.”
Clark is advocating for targeted subsidies for small- and medium-sized businesses, which he said generate jobs in rural communities. Asked about one notable failure in the district — the millions in federal grant dollars allocated to the Park Falls mill, which failed to keep the plant operational, he said, “When you’re providing incentives to private businesses, there’s always a risk.” 
“So because the business used a subsidy and ended up failing, that doesn’t mean we failed, but it does mean to me, we’ve got to make those investments smartly,” he added. Giving a large grant to a business that might come from outside the state to build a sustainable aviation fuel plant is one plan he says needs more scrutiny.  
“If you’re trying to start a small farm or small forest products business or manufacturing business, and you go to the Small Business Development Corporation, the Small Business Administration for a loan, you’re going to be wading through paperwork tall as your arm on your desk by the time you’re done, hours and hours,” he said.  “I think we can make that easier, and I think we can make those funds more available. And what we know is that even though big employers get a lot of the attention, if you add up the scope of small businesses, that’s actually where most of the jobs are, and those owners are the people who are committed and rooted in those communities.”
One of the things Clark doesn’t directly cover in his platform is the affordable  housing crisis. 
Clark said housing may be more important in tourist areas, like the 7th District, where so many seasonal homes are used as short-term rentals (STRs) instead of long-term family housing.
“We need communities that have the ability to zone and regulate that (STRs) more effectively, and then we need to go back and figure out how to make housing affordable, which is the availability of financing,” he said.
Immigration reform
Clark acknowledges that many voters in the 7th CD supported Trump’s promise to beef up border security and deport immigrants who commit crimes, but he is critical of how the U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) law enforcement agents are operating in communities.
“We need to have a secure border and immigrants who are here illegally, and most especially immigrants associated with criminal activity — we absolutely need enforcement on that,” he said. “And those people should be deported. What we have going on right now, however, is it’s essentially a war of fear in American cities. And ICE is an agency that is really one of the only federal agencies that’s seen its budget dramatically increased. They’re hiring new ICE agents as fast as they can, with a minimal amount of training, and it’s already clear that many of these people simply don’t have the experience and the training to be doing what they’re doing. And I don’t care what party you belong to, seeing people in masks who aren’t even identifying themselves, calling citizens and legal residents out of their homes without judicial warrants, many of whom will never see a court or a judge — it’s wrong and it’s unconstitutional, and it’s not making American communities safer.”
Clark also wants Congress to fully flex its constitutional authority to “curb the abuse of emergency powers” exercised by Trump. Democrats would be able to provide that check if they win the majority of the House in 2026. He also said Democrats should hold town hall meetings, “taking the case to voters.”
“Republicans in Congress have been completely afraid to do that,” he said of in-person town hall meetings. “Congressman Tiffany hasn’t done it. And that’s talking to the people that you represent. You know that’s No. 1.”

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Current and former Oklahoma State Department of Education officials refuse to discuss who has been driving a state-owned vehicle that traveled frequently to country clubs, visited Texas, parked at stores at odd hours and consistently returned to former state Superintendent Ryan Walters’ home address.
The vehicle, a Chevrolet Suburban, was issued to Joseph Porter, an assistant in Walters’ administration who still works at the Education Department, state records show. Despite the vehicle being listed under Porter’s name, Oklahoma Voice’s analysis of state vehicle tracking data shows the SUV returned to Walters’ home in Edmond more times than any other location in 2025, leaving from there most mornings, returning at midday and regularly parking there overnight.
State-owned vehicles track every address where they stop, the length of each drive, and the time of departure and arrival, but the logs don’t contain information about the purpose of each stop — nor who was driving. Oklahoma law requires state employees to use taxpayer-funded vehicles only for their official duties.
Walters, a Republican who resigned on Sept. 30 to lead an anti-teacher-union nonprofit, said in an interview with Oklahoma Voice that multiple people used the Suburban for official agency work, but he said he didn’t want to discuss specifics. He declined to say whether he personally drove the car. 
“It would have depended on what was going on, where things were headed. So, it just depends,” Walters said. “It would depend on what the particular day (was), what the event was, where we were headed.”
Location records show the vehicle’s travel abruptly stopped after he left office.

Porter, whose name was still listed with the vehicle even after Walters’ resignation, declined to speak to Oklahoma Voice and referred all requests for comment to current state Superintendent Lindel Fields’ communications staff. The Education Department’s communications office did not return requests to interview Porter or provide a response for this story. 
Instead, the Education Department referred all questions to the Office of Management and Enterprise Services, a different agency that oversees the state fleet. 
The agency has assigned multiple vehicles to the Education Department, but it has no information about which employees use them, agency spokesperson Christa Helfrey said.
“Agencies monitor vehicle assignments and usage and can speak to their own policies and procedures,” Helfrey wrote in a message to Oklahoma Voice.
During Walters’ final weeks as state superintendent, the Education Department denied that he had a state-owned vehicle, and the agency therefore refused to provide records of his vehicle usage to Oklahoma Voice. 
After Walters left, the agency turned over documents listing all of its state-owned cars. Those records showed Porter was assigned the Chevrolet Suburban. 
Oklahoma law permits certain state employees, including elected officials, to drive taxpayer-funded vehicles while performing their official duties, including to travel between home and work. But, they are barred from using the vehicles for personal transportation, like to stores, shopping centers and golf courses, according to state rules.
Only the governor, his family and the lieutenant governor are allowed to use publicly funded vehicles for personal matters, under Oklahoma law and state Supreme Court precedent. That’s because state law requires the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety to provide them transportation and a security detail.
Location records show the Education Department’s Suburban made three school visits, which coincide with Walters’ public appearances in Tulsa at Carnegie Elementary on Jan. 30 and Unity Learning Academy on April 7 to celebrate reading initiatives, and at Drumright High School on April 11 to recognize a newly built activity center.
The vehicle made about 140 stops at the Education Department building, often leaving after a few hours.
Tracking data also showed four drives to Texas, where Walters’ campaign manager and senior adviser, Matt Langston, is based.

In a statement on Walters’ behalf, Langston said trips to Texas were made in an official capacity to meet with members of the Texas Legislature, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s office, the Texas Education Agency and the Texas State Board of Education. 
The trips also were for meetings with conservative commentator Glenn Beck, high-profile Christian nationalist David Barton, representatives from the right-wing Heritage Foundation, U.S. Department of Education officials and “numerous other key stakeholders involved in Oklahoma education,” Langston said.
The state-owned SUV made a day trip Feb. 25 to the Texas State Capitol in Austin before returning to Walters’ home address late that night, according to its tracking data. It arrived March 7 at the American Journey Experience museum in Irving next door to Beck’s production studio. On July 25, location records show it visited downtown Grapevine in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and a nearby restaurant before returning to Oklahoma. 
The vehicle was parked overnight from Sept. 8-9 in a luxury apartment complex in downtown Austin, according to the logs. Walters called into a late-night FOX News appearance Sept. 8 to discuss prayer in schools with what appeared to be the Texas Capitol behind him.
Tracking data also shows the vehicle made 17 visits to two country clubs, Oak Tree in Edmond and Hidden Trails in south Oklahoma City. Some of these visits took place on the same date as two Oklahoma State Board of Education meetings in May and June.
“Due to harassment from the press and left-wing agitators, several country clubs were used as secure meeting locations with education stakeholders,” Langston said in a statement. 
Oklahoma Voice sought an explanation from Porter for the Texas trips and country club visits, but neither he nor the Education Department returned requests for comment.
An analysis of the vehicle’s tracking records shows it traveled regularly from Walters’ home to Walmart, CVS stores, a hair salon, fast food restaurants and his neighborhood clubhouse, which features a pool, playground and gym. These visits took place at all hours of the day, but the purpose of each visit is not documented. 
Voters expect their government officials to use taxpayer-funded resources for a public benefit, said Abigail Bellows, senior policy director of anti-corruption and accountability at Common Cause, a government watchdog group.
“Whether or not there was a violation in this particular instance, this episode is an opportunity for voters and public officials at every level to affirm what the expectation is for public servants,” Bellows said. “And that voters expect public servants who will truly be acting in the public interest and not seeking to use public resources for their personal benefit.”

Legislation that would enable ranchers and large property owners to sell tags to the highest bidder passed through the Agriculture Committee and has a shot at becoming law in 2026. 
The post Wyoming to again weigh making landowner tags ‘transferable,’ a step toward pay-for-play hunting  appeared first on WyoFile .","A controversial proposal that could help Wyoming landowners make money from elk, deer and pronghorn that use their property has passed muster with a legislative committee and will be up for debate when lawmakers convene February in Cheyenne. 
At issue are reforms that would make Wyoming’s landowner licenses “transferable,” or able to be sold. Landowner licenses, which date to 1949 in Wyoming, are special hunting tags awarded for elk, deer and pronghorn if property owners possess at least 160 acres and can demonstrate certain thresholds of animal use. 
Some other western states have already made landowner licenses transferable to varying degrees. The change has led to non-residents paying top dollar for the hunt of their choice, at the expense of diminished opportunities for locals. The website Huntin’ Fool, for example, is currently marketing a $30,000 Nevada elk hunt alongside a $12,000 Colorado mule deer hunt. 
There have been previous efforts to follow suit in Wyoming, including during the last legislative session. Sen. Laura Pearson, a Kemmerer Republican, brought but then withdrew a bill that she hoped would create a new revenue stream for ranchers. Last week, she helped talk the balance of the Joint Agriculture, State and Public Lands & Water Resources Committee into sponsoring a similar proposal, arguing the bill would allow landowners to generate “a small but meaningful income stream to help offset the costs of supporting wildlife.” 
The proposition of making Wyoming landowner licenses sellable has been met with stiff resistance from public hunters each time it’s come up.

In 2022, the Wyoming Wildlife Taskforce took on the issue, aiming to address what one member described as “outright abuses,” including landowners subdividing property to acquire more tags. No changes were agreed to then. Related reforms considered by the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission were also unpopular with landowners and pulled back. Attempts at making some landowner licenses transferable, meanwhile, have met overwhelming public opposition since at least 1998. 
“Those were some of the most contentious meetings that we had in the last 25 years, when we started talking about landowner licenses,” Wyoming Game and Fish Department Chief Warden Dan Smith told members of the Agriculture Committee. “When they presented that idea, they got over 2,100 comments from the public that were adamantly opposed to having transferable licenses.” 
Judging by some recent public comments, sentiments haven’t changed much. 
Sabrina King, a lobbyist for the Wyoming chapter of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, asked members of the committee what public hunters stood to gain from the proposal. In Wyoming’s complicated hunting license lottery system, landowner tags are distributed first, leaving rank-and-file sportspeople vying for a diminished pool of opportunities. 
“There is nothing about creating this kind of a program, the way this bill is written, that generates good feelings between hunters and private landowners,” King told the committee. “This is not a solution. This is going to create a pay-for-play system that is going to hurt the public hunter.”
Game and Fish Director Angi Bruce also expressed concern that creating a private market for Wyoming licenses could diminish opportunities and hurt hunter recruitment. Currently, many landowners don’t hunt, she said, and therefore don’t apply for a landowners license — about 3,600 are issued annually.  
“We anticipate that number going up,” Bruce said. “If they are able to transfer or sell a hunting license, we think that there will be more interest.”

Lawmakers also heard testimony from landowners eager to sell licenses. 
Jason Thornock, who farms in the Cokeville area, complained about elk and deer numbers on his land, which he claimed eat $60,000 in alfalfa each year. He called landowner coupons that yield him cash for hunter-killed animals on his land “an insult” and the state’s damage program “a joke.” 
“If you allow us to transfer these tags and get some compensation for them, yeah, use is going to go up,” Thornock said. “But so what? Let me get something out of that $60,000 that I’m putting into the wildlife.” 
Members of the Agriculture committee voted seven to five to sponsor the bill. 
Ayes included Pearson, Cowley Republican Rep. Dalton Banks, Cheyenne Republican Rep. Steve Johnson, Riverton Republican Rep. Pepper Ottman, Douglas Republican Rep. Tomi Strock, Thermopolis Republican Rep. John Winter and Casper Republican Sen. Bob Ide. 
Opposing were Buffalo Republican Sen. Barry Crago, Cheyenne Republican Sen. Taft Love, La Barge Republican Rep. Mike Schmid, Baggs Republican Rep. Bob Davis and Laramie Democrat Rep. Karlee Provenza. 
The Legislature’s 2026 budget session convenes on Feb. 9. 
Lawmakers will also consider two other competing bills — one from the Agriculture Committee, another from the Travel, Recreation, Wildlife and Cultural Resources Committee — that concern caps on landowner licenses. Currently, Game and Fish doesn’t have the statutory authority to impose a cap.

(Getty Images)(This image cannot be republished unless you have a subscription to Getty.)When I moved to Oklahoma over a decade ago, I had no idea that state laws here give the upper hand to bad landlords and give tenants struggling with catastrophic issues — think raccoon infestations, flooding and mold — little recourse if repairs aren’t made.
But then I watched my then-boyfriend wage an unsuccessful campaign against an Oklahoma City metro apartment complex after an odd, smelly black substance began to grow around a ventilation shaft in his bathroom and air conditioning unit. Property management refused to treat it and told him he could fork out hundreds of dollars in his own money to identify whether the substance was indeed mold.
Naively, I encouraged him to call the county health department because I thought this apparent fungal growth was a public health issue. But the health department said it was not within their purview to police apartment mold infestation. I could not find any other governmental entity that might regulate it. Shortly after that, the complex’s management coincidentally had his second vehicle towed without notice while he was away at work. That was despite his lease agreement allowing him to park two vehicles on the premises. He had to pay hundreds of dollars to get it out of impound, and the complex refused to give him a break on his rent to rectify the error.
But the icing on the cake was when he arrived home not long after and found a supply line on his toilet had ruptured, flooding his apartment so much that the carpet was floating inches above the floor. There was so much water, it seeped through the walls into his neighbor’s apartment. His neighbor apparently thought the deluge was from flood waters that frequently seeped into their apartment after heavy rain.
Management refused to replace the ruined carpet and the waterlogged drywall. They told him he had to file a renter’s insurance claim to replace his destroyed furniture. And if he didn’t like it, they told him, he could move out.
So he did. But as a final middle-finger salute, the landlord required a month’s rent as compensation for not giving at least 30 days notice. He had to threaten to take them to court to get the remainder of his security deposit back.
All of that seems unfair and wrong, but that doesn’t mean what the property managers did was illegal.
That’s because state law leaves tenants with little recourse. 
Oklahoma law does not allow tenants to withhold their rent as leverage to get things fixed. If a tenant withholds rent in an attempt to pressure a landlord to fix the premises, they face automatic eviction. And any eviction makes it even harder for renters to get subsequent housing.
Oklahoma is inexplicably only one of six states where tenants don’t have antiretaliation protections, Oklahoma Watch reported last week. That means tenants largely have little recourse if landlords refuse to repair things like standing sewage and holes in a roof. Instead, landlords have all the power. They can retaliate by increasing rent, ending leases, adding new fees or even evicting people for complaining about untenable living conditions, the nonprofit reported.
Legal Aid Services Oklahoma reported that 60% of their clients are struggling with repairs not being made.
State law does allow tenants to pay for the repairs on their landlord’s property. If they keep good records, they can then attempt to deduct those from their rent as long as the repairs don’t exceed a full month’s rent.
But making repairs should be the responsibility of a landlord, not a tenant. And frankly, it’s a really bad idea to allow anybody to make structural repairs to a property they don’t own.
Oklahoma Watch’s reporter spoke with two women facing eviction in Oklahoma County for refusing to pay rent to landlords who wouldn’t repair what appear to be catastrophic issues.
One woman’s apartment routinely floods to the point that she had to buy a shop vac to dry things out. The woman said she told the landlord she wasn’t going to pay rent until they made her apartment liveable, so they evicted her.
The second woman had a raccoon fall through a hole in her daughter’s ceiling at 2 a.m. while the 6-year-old girl slept. The woman had pictures documenting the hole in the ceiling, apparently caused by a water stain, progressively getting larger and larger each week. The raccoon destroyed the room as it tried to escape and terrified the little girl.
The woman had also gone to the landlord in September to complain about possible mold.
Her landlord filed to evict her because she didn’t pay her rent.
Even if a landlord is negligent, Oklahoma Watch reported state law gives court judges little option but to evict.
That’s completely outrageous. 
I don’t blame the judges. I blame our Legislature for inexplicably refusing to properly regulate the rental industry and pass laws that also ensure the safety of tenants.
Pretty much every other state has stronger protections and those have not caused their rental markets to collapse.
But the sad truth is landlords have more financial resources and a stronger lobbying power than their renters. Those with money tend to make the rules.
I have always been lucky enough to have responsive landlords who do the right thing and promptly make fixes. But obviously there are bad  landlords who just want to pocket the rent.
That’s not how this is supposed to work. Those who rent properties should have a legal and moral obligation to adequately maintain them.
It’s time for lawmakers to set up a system that gives tenants some power to force neglectful landlords to make repairs. Tenants should have the power to withhold rent, and judges should have the discretion to not evict someone if a landlord legitimately has refused to make repairs.
And if a landlord doesn’t like it, tough. They probably shouldn’t be in this business.
Because that’s how we wind up with slum lords.

Nonprofit social-service organizations struggle to meet spiking demand amidst federal cuts, the government shutdown and shrinking resources.
The post ‘It sucks so bad’: Social workers scramble to meet surging needs in wake of shutdown appeared first on WyoFile .","A caller who recently reached out to the Wyoming 211 help line had a stark message for the person on the other end of the line: If I pay my utility bill to avoid a disconnect, I’ll have to eat cat food this month.
Others in a desperate situation aren’t hiding their frustration about needing help at all — a cultural shame in Wyoming — or their stress navigating a perplexing, ever-changing and shrinking network of social services.
“Our call center has had — I don’t think I would use the word aggressive, but — more unpleasant interactions in the last month, really since probably July, than we have had in a long time,” Wyoming 211 Executive Director Ann Clement told WyoFile. The desperation, she added, “is palpable. It’s absolutely unbelievable.”
Wyoming’s most vulnerable, along with those who have been teetering on the edge, are feeling a culmination of pressures, from the high cost of living to cuts to the social-service safety net. Some cutbacks, like the suspension of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits and low-income heating assistance due to the government shutdown, are presumably temporary. 
Those pains are exacerbated by federal employee layoffs and furloughs, deep spending cuts, rising electric utility rates and increasingly inaccessible health care and rising health insurance costs, according to several front-line social-service workers who spoke to WyoFile.

The compounding hardships are happening as local nonprofits scramble to do more with less.
“It fucking sucks. It sucks so bad,” Gillette’s Council of Community Services Executive Director Mikel Scott said. The council’s own employees, as they scramble to meet a surge in needs, face skyrocketing health insurance premiums and the prospect of not having health insurance at all, she added. “You don’t know what’s going to happen next. You don’t know what money they’re going to take from you next. And it was never enough to begin with.”
Some federal programs that people have relied on for decades don’t seem to be functioning well, Scott added. The council was in line for a $177,000 Housing and Urban Development grant to provide rental assistance to those seeking refuge from domestic violence, but the agency reneged on the money, Scott said. She alleges the grant was denied based on changes to the council’s application that were edited by HUD itself. 
“We lost $177,000 for our community that would have gone to help victims of domestic violence,” Scott said.
Both Scott and Clement noted that when families are stressed for basic needs, there’s typically an increase in abuse.
“That’s what starts to bubble over into other spaces that people don’t necessarily think about, when there’s a stressor at home,” Clement said.
Scrambling to help
Gov. Mark Gordon recently declared a public welfare emergency that will allow him to spend up to $10 million to help cover suspended SNAP benefits, while lawmakers have applied for $800 million in federal money to stabilize hospitals, bolster preventative health and grow the workforce. 
Churches, neighbors and local businesses are stepping up to help, Clement and Scott say, but those efforts simply can’t match the level of federal government dollars and social service infrastructure necessary to meet even typical needs in rural Wyoming, let alone the surge in hardships Wyomingites are facing today and might face in coming months.

“We’re already pretty used to having to tell people ‘no’ or ‘we ran out’ or ‘we can’t help with that,'” Scott said. “It’s going to be worse when tons of people get kicked off of health insurance. I mean, forget actually lifting anyone out of poverty. At this point, the goal feels like trying to keep someone from becoming homeless, to keep them fed, trying to keep them from freezing to death in their home because they can’t pay their utilities.”
In addition to providing meals, there’s an emphasis among both government and nonprofits to keep people from losing their homes or apartments. Tenants can get evicted for not paying utilities, so help like rental assistance and the Low Income Energy Assistance Program go a long way to prevent homelessness, which is extremely unsafe and one of the most costly public health-and-safety challenges for any community to address, according to Scott.
“They’re either going into shelters or they’re going onto the street,” she said. “Either way, it’s costing a lot more money than if we just helped supplement a utility payment.”
LIEAP also helps qualified applicants weatherize their homes and fix heating units, which not only saves money but avoids dangerous attempts to stay warm.
“Our crews have seen very dangerous situations,” Scott said, “like people heating their home with a barbecue grill or just opening a gas oven.”
Food assistance

SNAP was suspended Nov. 1 due to the federal government shutdown, putting at risk more than 28,000 Wyomingites who rely on the program, according to Food Bank of Wyoming. Of those, 44% are children and 13% are people over age 65.
Food Bank of Wyoming has been working overtime to distribute the governor’s $10 million emergency aid while determining how to get the money to food pantries and those in need without using the federal SNAP infrastructure. The organization is “directing the funding in the form of credits to order food for free from Food Bank of Wyoming and in direct payments to keep money circulating in the local economy by allowing partners to purchase food from grocers in their community,” according to a Friday email update from Executive Director Danica Sveda.
Despite an efficient statewide network to collect and distribute food, there are challenges, including trying to replicate the scale of the federal SNAP program in Wyoming. SNAP, via direct distribution to individual recipients, injects about $5 million into Wyoming’s economy each month, according to Sveda.
“For every meal that a food bank can provide, SNAP provides nine,” Sveda wrote. “Even if SNAP benefits are reinstated this month, there is a chance people will not receive a full back-payment for November. This disruption in SNAP benefits is and will continue to be devastating for our neighbors facing hunger.”
The increase in demand at food centers and mobile food pantries is significant, Sveda told WyoFile in a Friday phone interview.
“What I’m hearing from all of our pantries is that they are seeing a lot of people that they have never seen before,” Sveda said. That’s because SNAP recipients typically take their SNAP debit card to the grocery store, she added. “So now they’re having to go to a food pantry for the first time.”
Sveda suspects that there are also a lot of federal workers who have been laid off and are relying on food pantries for the first time. “So we’ve been increasing the amount of food that we normally send out to our mobile pantries.”
Even when the SNAP program is restored, it’s unclear whether Congress will fully fund the program. Congress, in the Big Beautiful Bill, made several changes to the program, including expanded work-reporting requirements for young adults and requiring states to match a portion of the cost to manage the program.
To find a local food bank near you, go to the Food Bank of Wyoming website. Go to the same website to learn how to help.Because there are so many different social service organizations in each Wyoming town, one of the best ways to find help or to learn how to help is to visit the Wyoming 211 website or dial 2-1-1. The call center can connect you to services and organizations in your community.

The former vice president advocated for a powerful executive branch, then watched as a president he abhorred used it to his advantage, writes former WyoFile board member Geoff O’Gara.
The post The tragic arc of Dick Cheney appeared first on WyoFile .","Ten years ago, I spent some time with Dick Cheney while working on a documentary for Wyoming PBS titled “Dick Cheney: A Heartbeat Away.” I can confirm what many of Cheney’s friends will say — away from the camera, he could be charming, wryly witty and more honest and direct than any politician outside of his sometime friend, the late Al Simpson.

Opinion

Cheney’s vaunted role in American governance for almost half a century, and his tight-lipped public persona, were often mitigated with Wyoming journalists — I got to know him, just a bit, over sandwiches and fly rods. But neither of us would say we were friends — we were rarely in touch after the documentary came out — and I am not betraying a friend’s confidence when I write about him now. 
The former vice president was a man of few words, but skillful with the ones he dispensed. Before cameras were involved he told me a jaw-dropping story over lunch that felt like a national security scoop — but later, knowing better how he operated, seemed more a calculated way of tossing a tasty elk steak in front of a hungry journalist. 
(The story he told — during our first lunch together, in 2013 — was about 9/11. Following the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, then-Vice President Cheney was in a command center in the White House basement, while President George W. Bush remained in the air. Another plane commandeered by terrorists was headed toward Washington, likely targeting the Capitol or the White House. Military brass came to Cheney in the bunker: Should we shoot it down? Unhesitatingly, he said yes. But when the military planes went up to intercept the incoming threat, they discovered while in the air that their armaments were not engaged — they could not fire. As we all know, courageous passengers on that plane fought the terrorists, leading to a crash in a Pennsylvania cornfield.)
In hours of interviews, Cheney was an able story-teller, frank and often funny about his Ivy League failure, his beer-soaked years as a roughneck and his relationship with Lynne Vincent, which many credit with righting his wayward ship. In 2014, as a former vice president with no security detail, he obligingly jumped alone behind the wheel of a Ford Mustang I’d borrowed in Casper so we could recreate his campaign drives on Wyoming’s lonely backroads in his first run for the House of Representatives. He allowed us to talk to the doctors at George Washington University who had performed his heart transplant. And if he didn’t like a question — like when I asked how he answered critics who faulted him as secretary of defense (he served in that role from 1989 to 1993) for not having served in the military — he’d say, “No, Geoff, nobody cares about that.”
When you have the forceful temperament, intellect, persistence and good fortune to land a pivotal role in the modern history of the world’s most powerful country, you must submit, during your life and long after, to the judgment of history. 
I am no historian, but I know as a journalist that these anecdotes and insights will not play large in those judgments. Rather, it will be his role as secretary of defense for the elder George Bush, vice president for George W. Bush, the military interventions in the Middle East that he advocated and led, and the harsh interrogations — some would say torture — of suspected terrorists that he felt were justified and legal.

In these controversial events, Cheney trusted his close circle of aides and felt little need to seek approval outside the White House. From his earliest years in government — starting in the beleaguered administration of Richard Nixon — Cheney advocated for concentrating power in the executive branch, a constitutional theory later dubbed the “unitary executive.” 
Then, after retirement, a heart transplant and the attack on the Capitol in 2021, Dick Cheney became a forceful critic of Donald Trump, calling him “a threat to our republic (who) tried to steal the last election using lies and violence.” He even voted for the Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. But I cannot find, reading news reports of that time, that he made any connection between Trump’s authoritarian, if erratic, behavior, and his own earlier assertion of broad executive authority.
Which brings me back to the personal. Cheney was intensely loyal. He found people of quality to work with, and he stuck by them. His attacks against Trump focus on the president’s undermining of democratic processes, rather than Trump’s attempt to concentrate power in a White House without guardrails.
The powerful executive branch that Cheney pushed for depends on leaders of high character, because it diminishes checks and balances. Even many of those who felt Cheney over-reached (remembering the “weapons of mass destruction” justification for the Iraq War) would grudgingly acknowledge his patriotism and character. But there is an element of tragedy in the way Cheney’s overweaning assertion of executive power  now emboldens a president he opposed so forcefully. And for all the vehemence of Cheney’s opposition to Trump, it had little impact on the outcomes of the 2024 election. 
I’m pretty sure, though, that if I’d suggested to Cheney that his life had the arc of tragedy, he would have looked at me with something between a smile and a snarl, and said, “No, Geoff, nobody cares about that.”

Nov. 7, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Members of the Ukrainian community in Nebraska honored dozens of neighbors at an appreciation event Friday that spotlighted support for Ukraine during the nearly four years since Russia invaded.
House of Prayer lead pastor Oleg Stepanyuk, who is from Lviv in western Ukraine, near the Polish border, estimated that about 90% of displaced Ukrainians in Nebraska passed through the church. 
He said the house of worship in north Lincoln “lived up to the challenge of embracing and helping and making the community stronger.”
“But it would have been impossible without you, without your kind hearts, without your support, prayers and everything,” Stepanyuk told about 100 people attending the three-hour event.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Among those honored were Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, Lt. Gov. Joe Kelly, former State Sen. Tom Brewer, U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., and University of Nebraska President Jeffrey Gold. 
Many Nebraskans who traveled to Ukraine or Poland or supported displaced Ukrainians relocated to the Cornhusker State since the February 2022 invasion also were honored.
“We noticed every help, every gesture, every public release, and we are very proud to have the leaders that we have in this state,” Stepanyuk said. “This state truly lived up to its name: ‘Good Life State.’”
The event featured photos of the war and life in Ukraine from Howard Buffett, the son of Warren Buffett. Earlier this year, he published a nearly 400-page book, “Courage of a Nation: Three Years of War,” which was gifted to honorees.
Some honorees also received one-of-a-kind gifts — Bacon received an original map of Ukraine that includes Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014 but many countries still recognize as Ukrainian. Pillen received a bulava, a ceremonial mace and traditional symbol of Ukrainian authority.
State Sens. Bob Andersen, Rob Clements, Stan Clouse, Barry DeKay, Rob Dover, Rick Holdcroft, Kathleen Kauth, Dave Murman and Merv Riepe attended, too, as did former State Sen. Anna Wishart.
‘We fight for survival’
A Ukrainian brigadier general, speaking virtually from the warfront, at about 3 a.m. where he was fighting, expressed gratitude to join a celebration of a Ukrainian community that, along with Americans, “break bread together during our mutual defense of freedom and liberty.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
He said he had seen up close the heroism and honors that American servicemen brought to the battlefield and said it was a privilege to serve with those who “truly make the world proud in the fight against the Kremlin evil.”
“War is not something any of us ask for or want, and every day we fight for survival and eventual victory,” the Ukrainian brigadier general said.
“We fight for freedom,” he said. “We fight for existence of our nation. We fight for future of our children.”
Gold, who worked with Brewer on how the university system could help, said Ukrainians were fighting to protect freedom and democracy locally but also “for the rest of the world.”
“For those that may not think that’s in question, rest assured, that’s exactly what’s in question and why this is so important,” Gold said. “Not just for the people of Ukraine, but for all of us that are here tonight.”
‘You are Nebraskans now’
Bacon, a retired Air Force brigadier general who served during the Cold War, has been among the most vocal members of Congress in defending Ukraine and its right to exist. He said the “bully” Russia can’t be appeased, that victory can’t mean Ukraine loses territory and that Russian leaders want to dominate and enslave those they see as “little Russians.”

He told the crowd he keeps speaking out “because it’s right,” not out of bravery or courage.
“They want their independence. They want free markets. They want to be part of the West,” Bacon said of Ukraine. “And we should embrace that with open arms.”
Stepanyuk said Ukrainians praying in support of their home country have cited Bacon’s congressional speeches and have looked to him as a “hero” and an example of a “true man.”
Pillen said the people of Ukraine touch his heart deeply and that Nebraskans can’t fathom what Ukrainians have been through or the courage many have shown in starting a new life. 
“All of us from Nebraska want to simply say: ‘Welcome,’ because you are Nebraskans now,” Pillen said.

Brewer worked closely with Pillen in 2023 to pass a new law that allowed Ukrainian refugees and other migrants legally in the state to get driver’s licenses. Pillen and Stepanyuk credited and honored Rhonda Lahm, director of the Nebraska Department of Motor Vehicles, for the speedy rollout of that law.
When Brewer reached out to Gold for help, Gold said he responded, “Immediately, yes. Just tell me how.” Gold was the chancellor of the University of Nebraska Medical Center when the war began and became NU president in July 2024. Gold helped coordinate ag sector conversations, secured medical scholarships and opened up work on bioprosthetics in Omaha research labs.
“We are here to reach out our arms and to embrace others who need help and to be sure that we do it right, we do it with humility,” Gold said. “We’re grateful for the opportunity to do so.”
‘Thank you for the sacrifice’
Brewer, a two-time Purple Heart recipient, said that when he first went to Ukraine after the war began, he didn’t know what he was getting into. On one of his first trips, he helped move supplies from secure areas to villages with many elderly Ukrainians between the front lines of an evolving war.

The colonel said he didn’t expect the mission to change how he saw the world after eight combat tours, but now, wherever he goes in Ukraine, no matter the town size, little old ladies come up, hug him and say, “Thank you.”
“As a soldier, that’s really all you want, is just to say, ‘Thank you for the sacrifice,’” Brewer said, choking up.
“The sheer volume of death that was happening over there would break the spirit of most folks, but they figured out how to survive and how to live in this terrible situation that they have.”
Stepanyuk said Brewer, the “lionheart,” is a household name for many Ukrainians and said Brewer became a “brother in arms,” not just a friend, when he joined the war trenches.

Joining the “lionheart” on recent missions to Ukraine has been a farmer, Don Hutchens, the former executive director of the Nebraska Corn Board, who had been to Ukraine before the war, and a storyteller, John Grinvalds, a reporter with KETV. 
Grinvalds documented the most recent mission in a five-part “Wounds of War” series published via KETV earlier this year. Grinvalds said the “wounds of war” can be seen globally and through many Nebraskans, neighbors who will carry the damage of war forever.
“I think for a fairer future, a brighter future, it’s time for us to look at how we can heal the wounds of war in our own backyard,” Grinvalds said.
A story of hope
Brewer recalled one of his early missions moving supplies, during which he was rushed to a potato cellar with about 20 people, mostly soldiers, as artillery shells landed above ground. Dirt fell from the ceiling as everything shook.
Ukrainian soldiers sat around making tea, Brewer said, with “no fear whatsoever. It’s just another day for them.”

He recalled a young soldier asking if Brewer wanted tea, and Brewer responded, “You betcha,” and quipped to the Friday crowd, “Vodka would have been better.”
Brewer didn’t know the group had run out of water. The young soldier opened the cellar door, darted into the courtyard and pumped a bucket of water from a hand-cranked well. He returned as more artillery rounds landed.
“I felt so terrible, because he just risked his life to get me a glass of tea, but that’s what I ran into in the way of love from these people,” Brewer said.
Starting a new life
The Protez Foundation in Minnesota is one U.S.-based nonprofit that has worked to give wounded Ukrainians who have lost limbs, for instance, a new start.

Among the more than 1,000 Ukrainians who have received care or are in steps to receive care are Dmitry, a 31-year-old former member of Ukraine’s 3rd Assault Brigade who lost both of his arms while fighting this year and teenager Alex, a native of Mariupol, which was among the earliest targets in the war. He lost his left leg in the first weeks of the war, at the age of 12.
Yuriy Gula, a representative of the foundation, translated the stories on behalf of Dmitry and Alex and thanked Nebraska and others for supporting Ukraine.
Dmitry did not know if it was a grenade or something else that injured him, but his arms were wrapped in tourniquets for 19 hours. A medical team could not reach him in time. Alex walked out of his house and a rocket fell near him. He lost a lot of blood and medical providers couldn’t save his leg.
‘Stay the course’
Pillen described the war as “totally unjust, should never have taken place.” He said Ukrainians and Nebraskans together are brothers and sisters, joining Brewer and Hutchens in highlighting the similarities Nebraska has with Ukraine, such as both being “bread baskets” of the world. Pillen said he hopes there will soon be peace.

Brewer intends to return to Ukraine with Hutchens and Grinvalds in December for about two weeks. The next mission will focus on uplifting Ukraine’s ag sector and orphanages. Brewer said he and Hutchens will stay closer to the country’s capital of Kyiv, working with country leaders and orphanages, while Grinvalds will be closer to the front.
Stepanyuk said people in his home country need Americans to “have Ukrainians in your heart.”
“There will be a day when this war is over and Ukraine will build back to what it was,” Brewer echoed. “I hope that Europe and the United States stay the course and are there to help them rebuild.”

A steady stream of visitors arrived at the El-Ada Community Action Partnership food pantry in Garden City from when it opened Thursday morning through the afternoon. 
Behind the open garage door where clients receive their food boxes, the stacks of canned food were not as high as they usually are, Pantry Manager James Thompson said.  
Thompson said the food bank location has been so busy, staff hasn’t had a chance to count how many people are visiting, but he estimated it’s up at least 50% with as many brand-new clients showing up as there are returning. 
Food banks and pantries across the state are reporting the same increase in demand since the federal government shut down in October and it was announced that food benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, would dry up in November. 
“There’s a lot of people out there that are really, really struggling,” said Steve Small, food bank manager at the Community Action Partnership in Lewiston. “When it became certain that SNAP would be delayed or eliminated for this month, we had at least half a dozen people in here in tears, just in tears, saying, ‘I don’t know how I’m going to feed my family. I don’t know what I’m going to do.’” 
US Supreme Court temporarily blocks November SNAP payments

Through multiple court orders and conflicting information coming from the White House and U.S. Department of Agriculture, which runs the food benefit program, the people who rely on the funding for groceries were left confused and concerned about where their next meal will come from. On Friday, the USDA said it would release full funding for November, States Newsroom reported.
However, the U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocked on Friday night a lower court’s order that the Trump administration pay for a full month of food benefits, hours after some states began loading nutrition assistance funds on payment cards held by the 42 million Americans who use the program, States Newsroom reported.
In a two-page filing, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson accepted the government’s request to pause a Thursday order from Rhode Island Chief U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell while a lower appeals court hears the case.
 Local food banks say their supply is down as government shutdown, economic uncertainty continues

More than 130,200 Idahoans use SNAP to purchase food. The amount of money provided each month varies depending on household size, expenses, and income, but the average Idahoan receives $178 per month per household member, according to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. 
One of the visitors to Garden City food pantry said she only received about $30 a month from SNAP, but with her limited Social Security income of $1,350 a month, that extra money was critical to purchase more expensive grocery items, like meat. 
“You can get a lot of ground beef for $30,” said Maria Frolik, who lives in Boise. 
Food banks also say their supply is down, driven by a combination of canceled orders from the federal government and fewer donations amid economic uncertainty. 
As Thanksgiving approaches — the time of year when food banks see the highest demand — managers say they feel confident that the community will come together to meet the need, but they are increasingly concerned about their ability to feed their communities. 
“We will always find a way to give food to people, but it makes it more and more challenging,” Small said. “We don’t ever intend in the future to send anyone away without food, but it just gets more and more difficult all the time.”

  SNAP uncertainty prompts concern from recipients

After Congress failed to vote to extend federal funding by the end of the fiscal year, the federal government largely shut down starting Oct. 1. By Oct. 22, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare announced that the state would stop distributing funds.
The announcement left people in a lurch, suddenly without food assistance for November. 
“There wasn’t a lot of time to plan how they were going to kind of navigate through that,” said Ariel Jackson, executive director of the Community Food Basket in Idaho Falls. “… A lot of them that we’re seeing are families that were stable with their SNAP benefits, and when those suddenly disappear, and you weren’t really prepared for it, that becomes a crisis.” 
Jackson said the Idaho Falls food pantry served 100% more families every day in the past two weeks than it has on average. Typically, around 50 to 60 families a day would visit the pantry. Every day the past week, there were 100 to 120 families each day, Jackson said on Thursday.

In Lewiston, the food bank usually provides around 35 to 40 boxes each day, Small said. On Monday, the food bank distributed 75 boxes and more perishable items “rescued” from local grocery stores. 
“Seventy-five food boxes is a lot for our one location here in Lewiston any given day,” Small said. “Those are food boxes that average probably 50 to 55 pounds a piece. So we’re looking at right around 4,000 pounds of food in one day just through our pantry here.” 
Thompson, of the Garden City food pantry, said some of his clients are visiting multiple food banks to try and stock up enough to feed their families. 
Food banks are seeing a lot of new faces, as households who were able to make their finances pencil increasingly struggle to do so. Inflation on groceries and rising housing costs were already making it hard for many families to work, so the SNAP disruption sent some over the edge. 
“Just with EBT you had, people who are just getting by,” Thomson said. “And now you take that away, you’re forcing them to come to food banks.” 
 Federal court orders USDA to provide full benefit 

It’s unclear when SNAP recipients might get their cards used to pay for certain grocery items, called EBT cards, refilled. 
The original guidance in October was that there was no money appropriated for the program. After court challenges, a federal judge had told the USDA it had to use available contingency funds for SNAP. The federal agency responded in court filings that it intended to pay about 50% of the benefit. The USDA later said it miscalculated how to adjust the payment, and the cut would be closer to 35% instead. 
President Donald Trump on Tuesday, after the court order, wrote that no SNAP benefits would be provided until the government was reopened. 
When the USDA failed to release the benefits by the court’s Wednesday deadline, the federal judge ruled Thursday the agency had to pay the full amount recipients usually receive. 
The USDA announced Friday it would comply with the order, and provide the full funding available to the 42 million Americans who use the program, States Newsroom reported. Then later that day, the U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocked the November payments.
It’s unclear when households will have access to those funds. Federal officials previously said it may take weeks or months before the money lands in accounts of recipients, NPR reported. 
Idaho Department of Health and Welfare spokesperson AJ McWhorter told the Sun Nov. 3 the agency hadn’t received formal guidance from the USDA on how SNAP would be distributed. The agency couldn’t be reached after follow-up requests for comment on Wednesday and Friday.

 Idaho food banks are facing supply challenges amid heightened demand 

The food banks in the Treasure Valley, Lewiston and Idaho Falls said they had scheduled truckloads of food deliveries canceled this year by the federal government. 
The orders from American farmers and producers would have totaled an estimated more than 370,000 pounds for Idaho food banks, the Sun previously reported. 
Through what’s called the “bonus commodities” program within The Emergency Food Assistance Program, food banks can get American-produced products like meat, dairy and produce above and beyond what they typically get for assistance. 
“It was unexpected, and it created a shortage, and we weren’t really happy about it,” Small said. “But we carried on, and did the best we could with the other commodities that were available.” 
The El-Ada Community Action Partnership had six 18-wheeler trucks-worth of food canceled recently, Thompson said. The deliveries would’ve included cheese, pork, chicken and milk. 
Jackson, from the Idaho Falls food bank, said her organization doesn’t rely much on federal funding but had made orders through the bonus food program. The canceled orders included boxed milk, tomato sauce, canned fruit, and other shelf-stable staples. 
“We’ve had to buy more food this year than we have in our 45-year history,” Jackson said. 
Around Thanksgiving, many food banks arrange special food boxes centered around the holiday. In past years, this may have included turkeys, but high expenses and lower donations mean that’s out of reach for some organizations this year.  
Thompson said the Mountain Home food pantry location would host a turkey drive in a partnership with the Mountain Home Air Force Base, but it wouldn’t happen in other locations. 
In Idaho Falls, the Community Food Basket will still provide turkeys in its special holiday boxes, but with limitations, Jackson said. 
“I’m a little worried about having to potentially turn families away, because we do have to have a cap,” she said. 
Losing SNAP could mean more pregnancy complications as food insecurity grows

In the past, the organization has provided 300 households with turkey in Thanksgiving boxes, but she has to cap it at 150 families this year because of lack of supplies and rising costs. 
In Lewiston, the food bank used to distribute between 800 and 900 turkeys to households. Last year, the large donors that had paid for the turkeys stopped doing so. 
“We can’t really justify using our limited food budget to go out and buy 900 turkeys,” Small said. “That’s just a huge expenditure that we could use for other foods.”
“I think turkeys are incredibly important for families at Thanksgiving (for) food insecure families and low-income families. It’s just incredible, because it’s more than a meal. It’s actual participation in our community, in a sense. And so, I would love it if we could give away turkey, but last year, we couldn’t do it, and we’re probably not going to be able to do it this year either.” 
Individual donations have been dipping all year, Small said, while demand has been picking up. 
“Those two lines have converged, and it’s just really, really difficult right now,” Small said. 
The best way for the community to help, the food bank leaders told the Sun, is monetary donations. Food drives can help but many turn up with expired items or less-nutritious canned goods. With financial support, food bank staff can fill gaps and stretch the donation further. 
“We love food drives,” Jackson said. “They might bring in 300 boxes of cereal, but we need 2,000 a month … We have the ability to really stretch those dollars and make more of an impact.”

(Photo: Getty Images)Tennessee’s economic development leaders are nudging their focus toward attracting research and development business as job growth slows in manufacturing, one of the state’s largest industries.
Manufacturing sector employment in the United States has fallen sharply in the last 40 years, dropping from about 21% of total U.S. employment in 1980 to about 8% by the end of 2024, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. While job shrinkage in Tennessee has been less drastic, the trend is similar.
“This industry is growing in terms of production, but it’s shrinking in terms of employment,” Celeste Carruthers, professor of labor economics at the University of Tennessee Haslam College of Business, told The Tennessee Lookout. Those patterns can be chalked up to advancements in technology, automation and robotics, in addition to offshoring manufacturing labor, she said.
Manufacturing had the highest gross domestic product of any industry in Tennessee in 2024, bringing in more than $68 billion. The industry employed 364,400 Tennesseans that year, federal data shows — a modest increase from the state’s pre-pandemic high of 355,600 manufacturing employees in 2019.


An annual state economic outlook report presented to Gov. Bill Lee by the University of Tennessee’s Boyd Center for Business and Economic Research projected that Tennessee manufacturing jobs will “remain flat or see modest increases” in the long term, while nationwide manufacturing jobs continue to shrink.
The rising number of “advanced manufacturing” businesses choosing to locate in Tennessee translates to more capital investments, but not as many jobs, Deputy Governor and Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development Commissioner Stuart McWhorter said at a policy forum hosted by nonprofit think tank ThinkTennessee in October.
“Advanced manufacturing is a lot of things to a lot of people, but for us, it means companies that are investing in their equipment, in their automation, (and) making things using fewer people,” McWhorter said. 
Since 2019, Tennessee recorded a 61% increase in those types of projects and facilities.

“We’ve just seen this sort of decline in the number of jobs at new job projects that we’ve announced, and this (capital expenditure) number that’s just continuing to grow at a pretty exponential rate,” McWhorter said.
McWhorter is now asking companies who express interest in Tennessee to consider the state as a hub for their research and development operations as well. He cites the state’s universities, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Chattanooga’s quantum technology center, Arnold Air Force Base and logistics innovation in Memphis as examples of Tennessee’s research and development assets. 
Gov. Bill Lee spotlighted innovation as an investment priority in his seventh State of the State Address in January, proposing more funding for trade schools and nuclear energy. 
“If you look at 10 states that we typically compare ourselves to, we’re at the bottom, or near the bottom, in terms of R&D spend in our state, and we can do better than that,” McWhorter said. “We’ve just got to make sure that we lean in on that and make sure the industry understands it.”
State emphasizes technical college investments, research and development potential
Tennessee has poured hundreds of millions of grant dollars into attracting and expanding manufacturing businesses over the last decade.
From 2017 to 2024, Tennessee spent nearly $276 million to provide state job creation tax credits to businesses, more than half of which supported the creation of 33,409 manufacturing jobs, according to a report on Tennessee’s economy released in September by ThinkTennessee.
Automotive manufacturing has become one of the state’s highest priority industries for economic development, and its footprint in Tennessee grew from 264 establishments in 2019 to 305 establishments in 2022, according to ThinkTennessee’s report.
State leaders have particularly celebrated manufacturing investments as employment opportunities in rural communities. The announcement of more than 5,800 promised jobs at Ford and SK On’s new BlueOval City electric vehicle manufacturing plant in 2021 was heralded as a game-changer for rural communities in West Tennessee, though Ford has since delayed vehicle production at the plant until 2028.
Matt Kisber served as a Democratic state representative and was commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development under former Gov. Phil Bredesen before moving to his current private sector position as co-founder and CEO of solar energy company Silicon Ranch Corporation.
He and Bredesen took a trip to Wolfsburg, Germany to visit Volkswagen’s global headquarters when the company announced their Chattanooga plant.
“We’re going through this hall, they call it the Ghost Hall, and you don’t see a single person,” Kisber recalled. “It is where the undercarriage and the body of the vehicle are married, and it’s bolted and welded, and it’s all done by robotics.”
Kisber said company leaders told them that technical degrees are required to work in the Ghost Hall. 
Advanced manufacturing jobs that are coming to Tennessee will require that higher skill level — the ability to problem solve, communicate with teams and work with the robotics that are actually doing the work of production, he said.

Tennessee leaders have emphasized efforts to prepare Tennesseans for these opportunities for the last several years, including expanding technical college options.
The Tennessee College of Applied Technology opened an extension campus down the road from the BlueOval City campus in Stanton in 2024, for example.
McWhorter said the state is continuously working to identify and narrow skill gaps in the state’s workforce. The state launched TNWorks, a “central hub” to connect employers to workforce development services and provide data, this year.
Tennessee Department of Labor and Workforce Development Commissioner Deniece Thomas said innovative manufacturing processes will still require a “human in the loop” to oversee automated systems.
Advanced manufacturing skills are useful outside of the manufacturing industry, she added.
“It’ll be disruptive, but some of those disruptions will be healthy,” Thomas said.

Edmund Fitzgerald, the 729-foot freighter that sank on Lake Superior on Nov. 10, 1975 on its way from Wisconsin to Detroit, memorials around Michigan and the Great Lakes paid homage to the 29 lives lost on the ship. 
So why is the ship’s wreck still a piece of Michigan’s identity, half a century later? There are a number of factors — the Edmund Fitzgerald was the last commercial shipwreck on the Great Lakes, and for most of its life, was the largest ship on the Great Lakes. 
But Gordon Lightfoot’s ballad, “The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,” released the year after the ship’s sinking, is a key part of why it has remained a part of the state’s culture for so long, according to Victoria Stewart, the assistant director of the Humanities Center at Wayne State University.

From Gordon Lightfoot’s “The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald”
“With a load of iron ore, twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early”




“It was the one that stuck because of the song and because it became embedded in memories further than just those in the community,” Stewart said. 
Lightfoot’s song — a six-minute ode to the ship and its crew — brought national attention to the sheer magnitude of the Great Lakes, and the dangers that those who worked on ships on the lakes faced every day, Stewart added. 
“It’s been almost 50 years now, since the song came out, and it was a number two hit on the Billboard charts when it came out, and that’s quite a feat for such a long ballad,” she said. “Across the United States and Canada, there are more people who have an understanding, at least a glimmer of the idea of the dangers that workers on the Great Lakes face every day during the season, when they go up and down the lake to provide the raw materials that we need to live.”



“Superior, they said, never gives up her dead
When the gales of November come early”

But the song, while a key piece of the sticking power of the shipwreck in the collective memory, as Stewart explains, is not the only way that the anniversary is being remembered. 
The gales of November felt as though they came early again on the day prior to the anniversary of the sinking, as snow fell on Detroit early Sunday — but that did not stop families of the deceased sailors and community members from showing up to remember the lives lost.
In a memorial service hosted at the Mariners’ Church of Detroit, the church’s Octorara and Brotherhood Bells tolled 30 times — 29 for each member of the crew who died, and one final toll for all sailors who have died on the Great Lakes.

Those bells have rung every year since the wreck, and are too immortalized in Lightfoot’s song. 



“In a musty old hall in Detroit, they prayed
In the Maritime Sailors’ Cathedral
The church bell chimed ’til it rang twenty-nine times
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald”



Many of the bell-ringers were family members of the crew members of the ship, and pastor of the Mariners’ Church Rev. Todd A. Meyer noted that many of the families are passing the practice of ringing the bell onto the next generation — families in attendance ranged from older adults to toddlers.

In his homily, Meyer referenced Lightfoot’s song as well. 
“Does anyone know where the love of God goes, when the waves turn the minutes to hours?” he quoted, calling the ship’s history a story about suffering. 
“Our role today is we want to honor those who died on the Edmund Fitzgerald,. We want to remember their sacrifice, remember that for you, their families,” Meyer said. “You have joined with us in the stewardship of remembering and never forgetting the sacrifice that these 29 men made, but also the sacrifice that the maritime community makes every single day. Many of these men who died, and their families, as I’ve gotten to know them, lean on God.”
“One of the things about people whose lives are lost in disasters like this is that they can be remembered in a heroic way. They were just doing their job,” Stewart noted. “To recognize them is a way of honoring them, and of honoring their labor and all the hard work that they put in to our way of life as Americans.”
And while Lightfoot’s song has certainly contributed to the staying power of the Edmund Fitzgerald in American culture, the story also holds significance to the identity of many in the Great Lakes region, especially those with ties to the shipping industry. 
“They have this pride in the toughness that those folks had, and in the fact that our region has to be so tough in order to contribute to the rest of the world,” Stewart said.

Events to commemorate the anniversary are being held throughout the region, including at the National Museum of the Great Lakes in Toledo, Ohio, the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum in Whitefish Point, Mich., and the Split Rock Lighthouse in Two Harbors, Minn. More permanent memorials can be found throughout Detroit, including at the Dossin Great Lakes Museum, where the ship’s anchor lives. 
“As long as we have things like that out in our world that are telling that story, it’s going to force people to think about it,” Stewart said.

[…]","Cattle made their way around the show ring at the Kist Livestock Auction in Mandan on Nov. 5, 2025. (Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota rancher August Heupel has yet to sell any of the beef calves he has raised this year, so far avoiding the recent drop in prices that was fueled in part by comments from President Donald Trump on importing beef. 
Heupel is hopeful that prices will stabilize and the industry can continue to grow.
“Fundamentally, things have not changed one bit,” Heupel said. “There’s still strong demand, and there’s still low cattle numbers.”  
Cattle prices had been at record highs in October when Trump signaled he was in favor of beef imports from Argentina to lower beef prices for consumers.  That sent cattle futures markets tumbling, in turn taking down live cattle prices at sale barns in North Dakota and elsewhere. 
“It feels like the sky is done falling,” said Heupel, who ranches near Medina and is vice president of the Independent Beef Association of North Dakota. 
The cattle futures market is set at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Futures prices for next spring are based on what traders think the value of a beef cow will be.

Meanwhile, ranchers are looking to sell calves born earlier in the year. The calves will likely go to another cattle feeding operation until they are up to market weight — when they are ready to be processed into cuts of beef for consumers. 
The expected price on the futures market is one of many factors that goes into determining what a buyer will offer for a crop of calves, said Tim Petry, an associate professor and livestock economist at North Dakota State University. 
“The futures market always overreacts to everything,” Petry said, whether that news is good or bad for the market. “So a lot of volatility there, and probably that is going to continue until all these tariff issues and stuff get out of the way.” 
Trump’s proposal would loosen tariffs on Argentinian beef, allowing more to come into the country. 
U.S. Department of Agriculture weekly reports on sales at North Dakota’s three largest livestock auction barns in Dickinson, Mandan and Napoleon show the effect of Trump’s comments.  
The first week after Trump spoke, prices for calves were down $20 to $30 per 100 pounds. The next week’s prices were down another $15 to $30 pounds per hundredweight. A 500-pound steer calf might have sold for an extra $300 before prices started to fall. 
Sellers often bring in several hundred cattle at a time known as the fall run. 
As pastures dry up in the fall, ranchers may have little choice but to sell.
A long fall has extended the grazing season for some ranchers. But Petry noted that grazing leases on federal land usually require grazing to end by mid-October. 
“It’s difficult for producers to really change their marketing pattern,” Petry said
While Heupel said the talk of imports threw the market “out of whack,” he expects it to calm down. 
“There’s going to be some level-headedness from every side and both sides of the aisle, including producers and politicians,” he said.

North Dakota U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak was among a group of House members asking the Trump administration for more information on the Trump administration import policy. 
Fedorchak, a Republican, followed up with a meeting of people involved in the North Dakota beef industry, including Heupel and Petry. 
After the meeting Fedorchak said ranchers “just need consistent, commonsense policies that let them do what they do best.” 
Heupel said the meeting included a good discussion of multiple issues affecting the beef industry. 
For example, Heupel said he would like to see tighter limits on how much the cattle futures market can rise or fall in a single day. The market fell the allowable limit on multiple days after Trump’s import comments. 
Chad Berger, a fifth-generation cattle rancher in Mandan, said people want to blame Trump for the prices fluctuating recently, but he credits Trump’s tariffs with helping drive up prices.

“If we can hold these prices where they are today, the rancher, the feeder, and everybody can make a little money and keep this thing going,” Berger said at Kist Livestock Auction in Mandan on Wednesday. 
Despite the recent volatility, Petry noted that live cattle prices are still well above what they were a year ago. 
Heupel agreed that it is still a good time for beef producers. 
“The cash market is still exceptionally good for the cattle producers right now,” Heupel said. “I think we’re going to be OK.”

They also hung in the windows of residential homes, outside of garages and off the side of the road on the main street between the two tourist-heavy towns. Parked outside the businesses in both towns, multiple cars were embellished with yellow, rectangular bumper stickers reading “I [heart] TUCKER COUNTY MORE THAN CHATGPT.”

“I think it’s safe to say we’re in a bit of a battle right now,” said Angie Downs, who owns the Adventure Guild Game Shop in downtown Thomas with her husband, Jason Downs. “We all want to know more about what’s coming into our backyard. We want to know how it will affect us. We want to know what’s going to change.”
All the signage around the towns is targeted toward Fundamental Data, a Virginia-based company planning to construct an off-the-grid natural gas power plant between Thomas and Davis to, eventually, power an enormous data center.
The state Department of Environmental Protection granted Fundamental Data an air permit earlier this year for the project. 
Now, residents — represented by the law firm Appalachian Mountain Advocates — are attempting to appeal the permit and stop the construction as soon as possible.
At the root of their resistance to the proposed development is fear over the unknowns, anger over the lack of respect and involvement, and concern over what unintended consequences such a facility could bring to the region.
“I think a lot of people feel this whole thing was done without our involvement on purpose. It was shady,” said Frank Gebhard, a biologist and photographer who lives in Thomas. “The fact that they [Fundamental Data] aren’t even willing to answer any of our questions about the pollution or water usage or anything else — well why would I want someone like that as my neighbor?”

‘We live out here for a reason’: Residents concerned over potential harms to tourism
In a heavily redacted permit application, Fundamental Data says the proposed power plant would use gas-fueled turbines with heat recovery steam generators. Diesel would be kept on site in three 10 million gallon storage tanks as a backup power source in case of gas line interruptions. Those tanks would be 66 feet tall and 180 feet in diameter. Leaks from pumps and valves, among other pieces of equipment, are to be expected per the application. Operations for the facility should begin by 2028.
Annually, the facility would have the potential to annually emit 99 tons of nitrogen oxides, 56 tons of carbon monoxide and 44 tons of volatile organic compounds.
And aside from the emissions, the complex — once completed — could take up more than 10,000 acres between the rural, mountain communities that depend on outdoors tourism to support their economy.
Polly Deely moved to the Canaan Valley earlier this year for the area’s skiing. She works at BLOOM, an arthouse and gallery in downtown Thomas.
“This decision to put a [natural gas] power plant in the middle of a tourism hotspot — it’s so tone deaf, it makes no sense to me,” Deely said. “I’m very concerned about how this will change the climate around the Canaan Valley, if we’ll see as many people coming here for the wilderness, if it will affect the air quality and make people not want to ski or hike when they can probably go somewhere else with cleaner air.”
Gebhard, who works at a boutique in Thomas in addition to his work as a biologist and photographer, said he believes a power plant and data center will ruin the area for dark skies photography.
Many people come out to the valley for night time shots. It’s the perfect place due to the lack of light pollution. Light from a data center and emissions from the power plant, he said, could change all of that.
“This just kind of really sucks. A lot of us, we live out here for a reason. We depend on other people coming out here for similar reasons — the clean air, the wilderness, the dark skies,” Gebhard said. “All that light, that noise, it’s going to ruin something really special.”
Not everyone in downtown Thomas and Davis spoken to for this story was against the development. Four individuals said they support the power plant and data center due to the need for Tucker County to increase its revenues, however they would not agree to be quoted or have their names used for this article.
Downs said she understands that need for more income, as well, and wants to see it herself. This past year, the Tucker County Commission enacted a 2% Special Emergency Ambulance Service Fee for recreational purchases and rentals to help support the cash-strapped EMS services, demonstrating the need for more funds.
Downs is unsure, however, that the current proposal is the kind of industry or income the region should rely on. And if it doesn’t go as planned and does negatively affect tourism, she and other business owners stand to lose. She said between 70-80% of her monthly sales — of graphic novels, board games, novelty dice and more — come from individuals visiting the town.
“We are reliant on people coming here to be in nature,” Downs said. “I don’t know if that same volume will exist when that nature is overtaken by diesel drums and smoke. How will they protect us?”
On that first Saturday of November, there were nearly two dozen cars parked outside businesses in both Thomas and Davis with license plates from several different places — some as far away as Arizona, Canada and Vermont, and others from neighboring states, like Ohio, Kentucky and Pennsylvania.
For decades, tourism has been central to life in Thomas and Davis. In 2023, according to the state Department of Tourism, more than $85 million was spent in Tucker County by tourists who come to hike, ski, snowshoe and more.
If the power plant and data center is built, it’s likely that all but 70% of the property taxes paid on the complex would be sent to the state. That’s due to the passage of House Bill 2014, which was meant to incentivize data centers to locate in the state by stripping localities of their right to pass or enforce any zoning ordinances to regulate their placement or activity. The legislation also set up a special tax structure that has half of all property taxes paid going to the state’s personal income tax reduction fund.

“So we don’t even get really all the money we should be owed and we have no say, no control, over how [this facility] would operate?” Deely questioned. “That’s not right and it’s not fair.”
Last week, according to Country Roads News, state Senate President Randy Smith, R-Preston, told some Tucker County residents that there will be “a lot of changes” to HB 2014 over coming years. He specifically referenced the local control portion of the code being revisited.
But Deely said she already felt disrespected by members of the Legislature who she said “sold out” her and her neighbor’s rights to protect themselves against the development. Across the country, local governments have had success stopping data centers from being constructed due to their local zoning ordinances. 
“I want to live in a place that’s healthy — the air, the land, the people — and where I feel respected,” Deely said. “This certainly has changed the way I feel about being here. I understand why people love this place so much, I love it too. Loving it makes it harder to accept this very bad thing happening. It makes it harder to look forward to the future here.”
‘So many of us are angry’: Residents lament their lack of power, consent
Downs and her husband are in the process of moving. The home they’ve lived in since locating here in 2022 sits just half a mile from the proposed site for the power plant.
“So yeah, we’re packing it all up and we’re relocating outside of Thomas, farther away from the development,” Downs said. “It’s unfortunate that it came to that, and I wonder if more people are going to sell their homes because of this.”
Already, housing costs in Tucker County — specifically in Thomas and Davis — are some of the highest in the state. That’s in part due to AirBNBs pricing out people who live in the region full-time.
“Pretty soon, I worry that this is going to be nothing but an Airbnb community,” Downs said. “I think [the power plant] could accelerate that if more people sell, and I wonder what it will look like on the other side, if it is built.”

In nearby Davis, Sarah Stonesifer bought her home not long after Angie and Jason Downs moved to the area.
Stonesifer has lived in the region full time for nearly two decades. Growing up, she would visit regularly with her family. She remembers falling in love with the place and being excited to move there for good in 2009, when she was pregnant with her son, now-15-year-old Orion.
“This is the only place that has ever felt like home to me. This is the only place that has ever really spoken to me in a way that I listened, and I feel grateful that I was able to raise my kids here,” Stonesifer said. “This land is special. This community, these people are special. I am worried and afraid for what could come next.”
Stonesifer has worked in the area for two decades — in restaurants, art galleries, rental properties and more — to become a homeowner. When it came time two years ago to decide where she wanted to own, she was intentional about her choice.
She wanted her family to be in nature. Both her kids — Orion and 12-year-old Mena — love the outdoors. Her husband has been in the area for about nine years himself, she said. They both ended up there because of a love of nature.
“We love to be outdoors as much as we possibly can. Our whole family does,” Stonesifer said. “It adds so much to all of our lives.”
But there’s another reason a mountainside home among the trees appealed so deeply to her: Mena lives with cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease that affects mucus membranes, often clogging the lungs and impacting the digestive system along with other organs. 
Almost a teenager, Mena is thriving despite her cystic fibrosis. She’s been able to put on and keep weight — a struggle for many children with the disease — and is growing at a rate comparable to her peers.
Her lung function, Stonesifer said, is exceeding 100%. Her doctors are amazed by her progress.
“She’s basically functioning like any other kid her age,” Stonesifer said. “That’s all we’ve ever wanted for her, and I am so grateful everyday to see how healthy she is living.”
Mena’s success comes in large part to a strict and robust medical routine, Stonesifer said. There are numerous medications and therapies practiced morning and night to ensure Mena’s lungs and other organs are functioning correctly. 
Though it’s impossible to prove, Stonesifer also credits her daughter’s health to the fresh air and nature that surrounds them. 
People who have cystic fibrosis can be more vulnerable to complications caused by air pollutants, like nitrogen oxide and particulate matter that can irritate even healthy lungs. If a power plant were to open down the way and emit the exact pollutants known to affect kids like Mena, Stonesifer worries that her daughter’s health could suffer.
“If they’re burning diesel up there — that’s the dirtiest fuel there is. That’s going to change everything. No one, not even those of us [without cystic fibrosis] are used to that kind of pollution in the air up here,” Stonesifer said. “It scares me of what that will do to Mena, to anyone else who is at-risk. What are we supposed to do?”
The answers aren’t easy: they’re buried in a mortgage on a home she’s dreamed of owning. When they purchased it, she said, they never considered a power plant would come so close to home.
“I came here on purpose. I bought this home. I lived in this community. Now, everything around us — all of us — is being threatened without our consent. The only chance we have to pass something or stop this locally was taken away by the Legislature. I’m angry, so many of us are angry,” Stonesifer said. “The reality is this is going to happen all over our state because [Gov. Patrick] Morrisey and our [state Legislature] wants it to. They don’t care about us or what we want and need. This is just the beginning and I hope the rest of West Virginia is watching.

(Photo by Lynne Terry/Oregon Capital Chronicle)A state task force studying the pros and cons of natural psychedelics recommended that state lawmakers take steps toward decriminalizing natural psychedelics for medical and recreational use in the near future.
The Maryland Task Force on Responsible Use of Natural Psychedelic Substances, in a report released last week, says that with interest in the medicinal and therapeutic use of natural psychedelics on the rise, Maryland is “well positioned to be among the first states to expand access to psychedelic substances.”
But even as new research shows promising results for use of natural psychedelics to treat challenging mental health conditions, such as post-traumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder, public health advocates urge caution as state lawmakers consider future decriminalization efforts and health policy.
“It’s a big deal and we need to take it seriously,” said Gene Ransom, CEO for MedChi, the Maryland State Medical Society.
“We’re not saying we shouldn’t learn about it and learn new things … But we need to make sure that we first do no harm,” he said. “We need to be very careful and very thoughtful”
The task force was created by 2024 legislation sponsored by Sen. Brian J. Feldman (D-Montgomery) and Del. Pam Lanman Guzzone (D-Howard) to study and make recommendations for “safe, equitable, and evidence-informed statewide approach to natural psychedelic substances such as psilocybin, dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and mescaline excluding peyote” according to the report.
Advocates welcome cannabis pardons, but urge Moore to continue justice reform efforts

“I was really interested in it particularly for the research that’s out there on its effectiveness … for a good number of people, on things like PTSD, traumatic brain injury, treatment-resistance depression,” Guzzone said.
She also noted that nearby areas like Washington, D.C., have a “gray market” on natural psychedelics, meaning Marylanders may still access them even if there are not currently legal avenues to acquire it in the state.
“If we’re going to have this out there, we need to be safe and really understand it,” Guzzone said.
The report released last week recommended that Maryland lawmakers first build regulations focusing on psilocybin, the substance found in “magic mushrooms,” before moving on to other natural psychedelics.
The topic of natural psychedelics is an evolving research and legislative field. Twelve other states have enacted legislation to study psychedelics or create a task force similar to the one in Maryland to recommend policies. A couple of states have already moved to decriminalize the substance for recreational use and therapeutic uses.
And even though the federal Food and Drug Administration currently classifies psilocybin as a Schedule 1 drug, the FDA gave it a “breakthrough therapy designation” in recent years for conditions like treatment-resistant depression and major depressive disorder.
That said, the state task force recognizes potential health and safety challenges in this newer landscape of public health.
“In this rapidly evolving landscape, policy choices carry real consequences: they can open access to potentially life-saving treatments, or inadvertently create public health risks,” the report says. “They can protect Indigenous and religious traditions, or unintentionally erode them. Effective policy requires not only scientific rigor, but cultural humility, ethical foresight, and a commitment to public safety.”
Phased approach
The task force recommends multi-step approach that would start with greater access to psilocybin for medical and therapeutic uses, later expanding to possible recreational use and commercial sales.
The first phase would build a regulatory framework around psilocybin, which would include creating safety protocols, data monitoring, public education campaigns, law enforcement training and “immediate” restorative justice measures.










“There will be a lot of work to do, and I don’t think anyone needs to panic that come the end of session we’re suddenly going to have full-blown psilocybin availability. My guess is that this will take several years.”


– Del. Pam Lanman Guzzone (D-Howard)


The policy recommendation would include “deprioritization with civil penalties with expungement,” meaning that law enforcement would “would treat personal possession and cultivation as lowest priority.” The task force also encourages expungement for those previously convicted for simple possession.
Phase two would launch the introduction of psilocybin with medical oversight in clinical settings. Phase three  would usher in “full operation and expansion” of psilocybin, which would activate commercial sales and evaluate readiness to expand out to other natural psychedelic substances outside of psilocybin.
An independent report conducted by Johns Hopkins University researchers included in the task force’s study noted while research for therapeutic uses have been promising, there are still potential harms that come with use of natural psychedelics if not handled properly.
This is especially the case when natural psychedelics are used without professional guidance, which can result in adverse psychological reactions, dangerous substance interactions, or acute toxicity, according to the Hopkins report.
“Even though serotonergic psychedelics appear to have low abuse potential, their risks outside carefully controlled trials are not well understood,” it says. “As recreational use has increased, adult emergency department visits related to psychedelic use and poison control centers related to psychedelic use by both adolescents and adults have also increased.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The state task force also acknowledges those challenges, but called research on natural psychedelics “one of the most rapidly evolving areas of modern medicine.”
“Results are highly promising, but still preliminary, with a strong focus on addressing conditions that are resistant to conventional treatments,” it says.
But even supporters like Guzzone believe that recreational use of psilocybin and other natural psychedelics is a long ways off. Even creating policy around medical and therapeutic use will take time and it’s important to “not jump the gun.”
The state must “Make sure everybody is on board in a bunch of different ways, including with regard to education, of the public establishment of procedures and guidelines on the sort of more standard medical side,” she said. “But also be respectful of traditional uses of this, because from a Native American point, these substances have been used for hundreds of years.
“There will be a lot of work to do, and I don’t think anyone needs to panic that come the end of session we’re suddenly going to have full blown psilocybin availability,” she said. “My guess is that this will take several years.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout) As an off-cycle special election, turnout in the special election primary for Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District race was down significantly compared to the 2024 General Election. 
Across both parties’ primaries, around 67,000 votes were cast last month compared to almost 330,000 in 2024, when now-retired U.S. Rep. Mark Green, a Clarksville Republican, beat Democrat Megan Barry by a nearly 20-percentage point margin. 
But in a glimmer of hope for Democrats, their primary turnout of 31,000 nearly matched that of Republicans with 36,000. The Democratic Party hasn’t won Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District in over 40 years, and in 2022 the district was redrawn as part of a Republican gerrymander.

Republican former General Services Commissioner Matt Van Epps will face Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn in the general election to replace Green on Dec. 2. The Cook Political Report classifies the district 7 seat as a “Solid Republican,” but internal polling by Behn’s campaign shows she trails 52% to 44%. 
Republican turnout in the primary was down by more than 80% in many Nashville precincts but also in much of Clarksville and its surrounding rural areas, according to precinct data analyzed by the Lookout. In terms of raw votes, Republicans saw turnout drop by almost 2,000 voters in some precincts in Cheatham and Williamson counties. 
For several election cycles, Democrats in the 7th district have received a large share of their support from the two urban centers of Clarksville and Nashville. During the 2025 special election, almost no voters in rural counties like Hickman and Wayne voted for Democrats, and in Nashville, the drop-off in voter turnout wasn’t nearly as steep for the party as it was for Republicans in their strongholds.
What’s the focus of the race
In acknowledgement that he can’t cruise to victory, Van Epps’ campaign has attacked Behn over her support for abortion rights and the protests she participated in during Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in Nashville in May.

Republicans hold a 4-seat majority in the U.S. House, meaning the 7th district can’t change the party in power, but after a strong 2025 election showing in the governor’s races for Virginia and New Jersey, national Democrats turned to the Tennessee race as they are looking for another avenue to prove that they’re beating or closing the margins in areas where Republicans typically dominate. 
Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin was in Middle Tennessee on Saturday to canvass with Behn, the first public sign of support from the national party.
During the primary, Van Epps raised significantly more money than hismoney his Republican opponents and benefited from nearly $2 million in outside political action committee (PAC) spending. These independent groups touted Van Epps’s military career, labeling him a “MAGA Warrior,” while a pro-school voucher group attacked his top opponent for not supporting Trump enough in 2016. 
Behn raised around $150,000, narrowly winning her primary through a voter-turnout strategy. Her message to Democrats was that she had the best shot at winning the special election because of her progressive messaging on campaign finance reform, and taxing the wealthy could boost turnout. 
Early voting for the general election starts on Nov. 12.

Ford/Maryland Matters)A Maryland commission is recommending that the state do away with its practice of automatically charging youth as adults for certain crimes, saying it doesn’t improve public safety and can harm the youth.
The nine-page, heavily footnoted report from a workgroup of the Commission on Juvenile Justice Reform and Emerging and Best Practices is the first recommendation, since the commission was overhauled last year.
“This practice fails to protect communities. Instead, it disproportionately impacts children of color, diverts resources away from critical services for children and families, places children in dangerous environments that more often result in subsequent violent or general criminal behavior,” says the report, which was approved by the commission Oct. 23. “The problem is not one of minor procedural adjustments; it is structural.”
The report, prepared by the commission’s Processes and System Coordination Workgroup, says the state needs to replace the “automatic charging with a system where all cases begin in juvenile court, with judicial discretion to waive youth into adult court when warranted. This reform reflects national best practice and aligns Maryland with federal law.”
Sen. William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery), one of four state lawmakers on the 26-member commission, said he plans to reintroduce a bill dealing with the issue.
Lawmakers vow to reclaim, redeem forgotten cemetery for Black youth

The bill he proposed during the 2025 General Assembly session would have raised the age at which a youth would be tried as an adult, from 14 to 16. It also would have made those 16 and younger eligible to go to juvenile court if they were charged with crimes, such as first-degree assault, third-degree sex offense and certain offenses involving machine guns.
The commission report found that the state is “significantly” out of compliance with guidelines from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. That office provides states and local jurisdictions with money to fund reentry initiatives for youth who have been incarcerated, treatment for those who may have been abused and other community service programs.
One of the four core requirements to receive funding is “removal of juveniles from adult jails and lockups.”
In fiscal 2024, Maryland youth spent 90 to 180 days in adult jails before being transferred to juvenile court, the report said. OJJDP guidelines say youth must not be held in adult facilities for more than six hours “unless a court finds it is in the interest of justice based on a seven-factor test.” Those factors are age, mental state, charge severity, delinquency history, facility capacity, public safety and any other relevant factors.
In fiscal 2023, the state’s detention rate at adult facilities was 93.2 per 100,000 children, more than six times the federal standard of about 14.7 per 100,000. The following fiscal year, the state’s detention rate rose to 119.5, a 28% increase.
“With the state’s 2024 rate of children detained in adult facilities going far beyond the federal threshold, Maryland stands to lose $350,000 in federal formula grant funding over the next two years due to these violations,” the report said.
‘Kids should be treated like kids’
Meanwhile, the Governor’s Office of Crime Prevention and Policy separately submitted a 39-page report to the governor and presiding legislative officers last month. Besides the commission’s process work group, it has four other groups – public education and narrative change; fatality review; prevention; and youth rehabilitation services.
Some of the work conducted by the commission included panel discussions with law enforcement officials and public defenders, research on rehabilitation and mental health services and the lack of dedicated funding for various initiatives and programs.

“As we continue forward, we must never lose sight of the foundational truth I shared in those opening remarks: justice-involved children need what all children need, only more of it, more consistently, and with more compassion,” wrote Andre Davis, chair of the commission and a retired judge of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. “They need healing, not handcuffing. Support, not surveillance. Opportunity, not obstacles. And they need us to lead with both urgency and care.”
As for Smith, he’s scheduled to participate in a juvenile justice discussion Thursday at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy. The event is entitled “National Roundtable on Prosecuting Youth As Adults: Policy, Research & Practice.”
Also on the panel will be Marc Schindler, former assistant secretary and chief of staff with the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services. Although the discussion is open to the public, people are asked to register here.
“Young people are experiencing tremendous challenges and accessing opportunity, services and supports,” said Liz Ryan, a former administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention during the Biden administration and co-host of the roundtable, during an interview Friday.
“We need to make sure that young people are getting what they need to grow and thrive,” she said. “Kids should be treated like kids.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sen.-William-C.-Smith-Jr.-4-5-2025-newsletter-1024x770.jpg,,,2025-11-10 06:17:34.345272

HALIFAX COUNTY, N.C. — When Ivy McFarland first traveled from her native Honduras to teach elementary Spanish in North Carolina, she spent a week in Chapel Hill for orientation. By the end of that week, McFarland realized the college town on the outskirts of Raleigh was nowhere near where she’d actually be teaching.
On the car ride to her school district, the city faded into the suburbs. Those suburbs turned into farmland. The farmland stretched into more farmland, until, two hours later, she made it to her new home in rural Halifax County.
“I was like, ‘Oh my God, this is far,’” McFarland said. “It was shocking when I got here, and then I felt like I wanted to go back home.”
Nine years later, she’s come to think of Halifax County as home.
In this stretch of rural North Carolina, teachers hail from around the globe: Jamaica, the Philippines, Honduras, Guyana. Of the 17 teachers who work at Everetts Elementary School in the Halifax County school district, two are from the United States.
In this rural school district surrounded by rural school districts, recruiting teachers has become a nearly impossible task. With few educators applying for jobs, schools like Everetts Elementary have relied on international teachers to fill the void. Districtwide, 101 of 156 educators are international.

“We’ve tried recruiting locally, and it just has not worked for us,” said Carolyn Mitchell, executive director of human resources in the eastern North Carolina district of about 2,100 students. “Halifax is a rural area, and a lot of people just don’t want to work in rural areas. If they’re not people who are from here and want to return, it’s challenging.”
Around the country, many rural schools are contending with a shortage of teacher applicants that has ballooned into a crisis in recent years. Fewer students are enrolling in teacher training programs, leading to a shrinking pipeline that’s made filling vacancies one of the most challenging problems for school leaders to solve in districts with smaller tax bases and fewer resources than their suburban and urban peers. In certain grade levels and subject areas — like math and special education positions — the challenge is particularly acute. Now, some of the levers rural schools have used to boost their teacher recruitment efforts are also disappearing.
This spring, the federal Department of Education eliminated teacher residency and training grants for rural schools. In September, President Donald Trump announced a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications — visas hundreds of schools like Everetts Elementary use to hire international teachers for hard-to-staff positions — saying industries were using the visas to replace American workers with “lower-paid, lower-skilled labor.” A lawsuit filed by a coalition of education, union, nonprofit and other groups is challenging the fee, citing teacher shortages. Rural schools are also bracing for more cuts to federal funding next year.
“We’re not only talking about a recruitment and retention problem. We’re talking about the collapse of the rural teacher workforce,” said Melissa Sadorf, executive director of the National Rural Education Association.

Most of Halifax’s international teachers arrive on H-1B visas, which allow them to work in the U.S. for about five years with the possibility of a green card at the end of that period. About one-third of the district’s international teachers have J-1 visas, which let them work in the country for three years with the possibility of renewing it for two more. At the end of those five years, educators on J-1 visas are required to return to their home countries.
A few years ago, Halifax County Schools decided to shift from hiring teachers on J-1 visas in favor of H-1B, hoping it would reduce teacher turnover and keep educators in their classrooms for longer. The results have been mixed, Mitchell said, because within a few years, some of their teachers ended up transferring to bigger, higher-paying districts anyway.
There are trade-offs for the teachers, too. Mishcah Knight came to the U.S. from Jamaica both to expand her skills and increase her pay as an educator. In the rural North Carolina county, finding transportation has been the biggest challenge for Knight, who teaches second grade.
She lacks a credit history needed to buy a car, leaving her reliant on carpooling to work. A single taxi driver serves the area, which doesn’t have public transit, Uber or Lyft. “Sometimes, he’s in Virginia,” Knight said. “It’s lucky when we actually get him to take us somewhere.”
Being away from family also takes its toll on teachers. Nar Bell Dizon, who has taught music at Everetts Elementary since 2023, had to leave his wife and son back home in the Philippines. He visits in the summer, but during the school year, he sees them only through video calls.
“This is what life is — not everything is smooth,” Dizon said. “There will always be struggles and sacrifices.”
Dizon’s first year in Everetts Elementary School was hard — it took time adapting to a different teaching style and classroom management. Now that he’s in his third year, he feels like he’s gotten his feet beneath him.
“When you can build a rapport with your students, things become easier,” Dizon said.
When her international teachers are able to stay for longer, the students perform better, said Chastity Kinsey, principal of Everetts Elementary. “I know the benefit the teachers bring to the classroom,” Kinsey said. “After the first year or two, they normally take off like rock stars.”

Related: Trump’s cuts to teacher training leave rural school districts, aspiring educators in the lurch 
Trump’s new fee does not address any of the challenges the Halifax district had with the H-1B visa, and it effectively slams the door on future hires. Now, the district will have to rely on J-1 visas to recruit new international teachers, meaning the educators will have to leave just as they’ve acclimated to their classrooms.
“We just can’t afford to,” Mitchell said of paying the $100,000 fee. Other districts, she said, might turn to waivers allowing them to increase class sizes and hire fewer teachers, among other strategies.
Since the applicant pool began drying up about a decade ago, the make-up of the district’s teaching staff has slowly shifted to international teachers.
At the heart of the problem is that when a position opens up, few, if any, citizens apply, said Katina Lynch, principal of Aurelian Springs Institute of Global Learning, an elementary school in Halifax County.
When Lynch had to hire a new fourth grade teacher this summer, she received three applications: Only one was a licensed teacher from the U.S.
Nationally, about 1 in 8 teaching positions are either vacant or filled by teachers who are not certified for the position, according to data from the nonprofit Learning Policy Institute, published in July. In addition to fewer college students graduating with degrees in education, diminished public perception of the teaching profession and political polarization of schools are to blame, school leaders said. In some states, the growth of charter and private school options has made competing for teachers even harder. On top of a widening pay gap between rural and urban districts, it’s a perfect storm for schools in more remote parts of the country, said Sadorf.

Districts are experimenting with different strategies to help, she said, including introducing students to teacher training pathways starting in high school, building “grow-your-own” programs to train local people for teaching jobs, and offering loan forgiveness and housing support.
Sadorf’s organization is in favor of creating an educator-specific visa track that would allow international teachers to be in communities for longer. The group is also in favor of exempting schools from the $100,000 H-1B fee. “Stabilizing federal support is something that really needs to be focused on at the federal level,” Sadorf said.
At Everetts Elementary in Halifax County, McFarland, the educator from Honduras, is among the most senior teachers in the school. She has adapted to the rural community, where she met and fell in love with her now-husband. She gets asked sometimes why she hasn’t moved to a bigger city.
“Education has taken me places I’ve never expected,” McFarland said. “For me, being here, there’s a reason for it. I see the difference I can make.”

More than 60,000 West Virginians received notices that their health insurance premiums will be skyrocketing on January 1, 2026, given ongoing uncertainty around whether Congress will extend tax subsidies that make ACA Marketplace plans affordable for people who do not receive health coverage through their jobs. And the only hospital in Greenbrier County just announced it will no longer provide labor and delivery services.
What do these concerning developments have in common? They are all part of the fallout from the passage of Congress’ “Big Beautiful Bill” enacted earlier this summer, which all four of West Virginia’s members of Congress voted for.
That legislation contained the largest cuts to SNAP and Medicaid in the nation’s history, which will result in tens of thousands fewer West Virginians having access to these programs. It includes the new restrictions that will take food assistance away from parents and veterans in the coming months. For the households impacted, health care and groceries will become even more difficult to afford, as they already grapple with rising costs and a slowing economy.
But that’s not all. The bill also slashed Medicaid and SNAP by shifting federal program costs onto state budgets, and lawmakers will now have to come up with tens of millions of state dollars in upcoming years to plug holes in Medicaid and SNAP.  
Other components of the legislation impact reimbursements and funding streams for health care providers, which is why some hospitals and clinics across the country are trimming services and even consolidating or closing their doors in anticipation of lower reimbursements and a higher volume of uncompensated care when more patients are uninsured. 
While officials at the Greenbrier Valley Medical Center didn’t explicitly blame the federal legislation, they noted the reorganization would give them access to a higher level of reimbursement in order to make the hospital more sustainable. Our elected leaders should be working to expand health care access in rural parts of the state, not rubber-stamping policies that result in less accessible care. Now families in Greenbrier County and surrounding towns will have to travel farther for treatment and staff may lose their jobs or be forced to transfer farther away for work.
What the legislation shockingly did not contain, despite the prioritization of windfall tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy (80% of the tax benefits go to the top 10% richest households), was an extension of the tax credits that help hardworking West Virginians — mainly self-employed, small business owners and their employees, and retirees — afford health coverage on the marketplace. That explains the sticker shock many are experiencing now while shopping for health coverage for January.
These are all the very real results of the Big Beautiful Bill, despite assertions from the legislation’s supporters that the impacts are delayed or that band-aid provisions like the Rural Health Transformation Program will dampen the harms.
While some of the effects are already here, there is much more pain to come in the form of deep cuts to Medicaid both via eligibility restrictions and more federal cost shifts onto states, higher costs for West Virginians with student loan debt, and higher energy prices due to the repeal of affordable, clean energy programs. These changes don’t only hurt the West Virginians who directly utilize these programs, but also the rest of us when our community hospitals reduce services, job losses in the health care and energy industries weaken our economy, and more of our community members experience hunger and suffering.
It’s not too late for West Virginia’s members of Congress to say enough is enough and address the affordability and economic crises created as a result of the Big Beautiful Bill. They can still roll back these harmful changes — but they must acknowledge that the harm is here. For many of us, it’s already undeniable.

(Getty Images)If you smoke and want to quit, call the national quit line at 1-800-784-8669 to speak with a confidential coach. 
Despite a robust screening system, Kentucky is the worst state in the nation for new lung cancer cases, a report shows. 
The American Lung Association’s State of Lung Cancer report, released Wednesday, shows lung cancer is the commonwealth’s leading cause of death. Kentucky has the second-highest rate of smoking in the nation — behind only West Virginia. 
Shannon Baker, the advocacy director for the Lung Association in Kentucky, said the state’s return to second-worst smoking rates (a decline from the previous ranking of fourth in the nation) is “a threat to the progress that we’ve made” to combat lung cancer.

Kentucky is screening lung cancer at higher rates than the national average, and has a law on the books requiring insurance to cover biomarker testing. Biomarker testing “is a way to look for genes, proteins and other substances (called biomarkers or tumor markers) that can provide information about cancer,” according to the National Cancer Institute. 
Despite this work, cancer cases remain high. 
Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, and Kentucky “has a long history with tobacco and tobacco use being generational,” Baker said. 
“We know nicotine is incredibly addictive, and so even those who want to quit have a tough road ahead of them,” she said. 
Other factors making Kentucky a high-risk state for lung cancer include its high rates of radon, an odorless gas that can cause lung cancer, and the prevalence of vaping. 
“While the science continues to collect around (vaping), we can all say, from just a common sense perspective, that inhaling aerosol and carcinogens and chemicals and fine particles deep into our lungs isn’t likely to be good in the long run, is it?” Baker said. 
Barriers to convincing youth not to vape persist, she said. Even the name implies that “it’s a harmless water vapor — and that is a misnomer, but it’s not an accidental one.” 
“Think of the tutti frutti flavors, and think of the social media advertising and the influencers and the ‘super cool’ — tongue firmly in cheek — devices,” Baker said. “Our youth have been targeted. They have been lured with flavors, targeted with media … and addicted to incredibly and increasingly high levels of nicotine.” 
During the 2025 session, the Kentucky General Assembly passed a law to license all retailers who sell tobacco and vape products, giving the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) inspection and enforcement powers over them, similar to those it exercises over alcohol retailers. 
This move, Baker said, is “helping to better protect our kids” but “we have ground to gain.” 
By the numbers 
Kentucky is not doing enough to prevent smoking and vaping, says annual report

Other findings from the 2025 report show:

The 2022 smoking rate in Kentucky was 17.4%, higher than the 2023 national rate of 11.4%.
The rate of new lung cancer cases in Kentucky is 84.1, significantly higher than the national rate of 52.8.
Over the last five years, the rate of new cases in Kentucky improved by 9%.
The percent of people alive five years after being diagnosed with lung cancer in Kentucky is 25.5%, lower than the national rate of 29.7%.
Over the last five years, the survival rate in Kentucky improved by 32%.
In Kentucky, 27.3% of cases are caught at an early stage, lower than the national rate of 28.1%.
Over the last five years, the early diagnosis rate in Kentucky improved by 12%.
Over the last five years, the percent of cases receiving no treatment in Kentucky increased by 36%.
In Kentucky, 36.9% of radon tests results were at or above the action level recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 

Radon testing — either professional or through a do-it-yourself kit — shows radon levels in the home, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People should test their home if it’s never been tested, before buying or selling and before and after renovations, according to the CDC. 
Looking to 2026 
During the 2026 legislative session — during which lawmakers will pass a two-year state budget — Baker said the Lung Association will ask for an additional $2 million for the Tobacco Prevention and Cessation program, which works to end youth smoking, among other work. If granted, the money would double the program’s budget. 
The Lung Association will also continue pushing for JUUL settlement dollars to be moved from the state’s general fund into the Tobacco Prevention and Cessation Program. Juul, an e-cigarette company, has to pay Kentucky more than $14 million dollars following a lawsuit over marketing practices aimed at youth. JUUL’s next payment to Kentucky is around $2 million and due in December 2025. 
Advocates pushed for this in 2024, but “this is a budget session,” Baker said, “and so it’s more appropriately timed this year.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)After receiving a record number of applications, the University of Rhode Island exceeded its enrollment target for the incoming freshman class this fall.
The academic caliber of students on the Kingston campus is also on the rise with new students having arrived with strong grade point averages coming out of high school and some college credits already earned, Dean Libutti, the school’s associate vice president for enrollment management and student success said.
A total of 28,036 first-year applications were received in 2025, Libutti told the university’s Board of Trustees during a presentation Friday.
Ultimately, 3,431 of those students enrolled — a number above both the school’s original and revised goals for the size of its incoming freshman class, Libutti said. Last year, URI received 26,800  applications.
“That happens at a time when we are seeing declining high school demographics, so [it’s] really exciting to see,” Libutti said. “Our superpower is that our recruitment is actually a team sport by all divisions and people on campus.”
Overall, URI had 17,471 students this fall semester, made up of 15,045 undergrads and 2,426 grad students. 
But a lack of housing on campus may cap further growth, Libutti warned. “We are at capacity at the undergraduate traditional level,” Libutti said.
The university announced Thursday that it had finalized a partnership with construction firm Gilbane to begin building three new residence halls which will increase the number of on-campus beds by more than 2,000. Construction is set to begin later in November, and the first residence hall could open in fall 2027.
In the meantime, however, graduate students living in the Graduate Village Apartments will need to be relocated, as the building is being torn down before its eventual replacement can be built, the Good Five Cent Cigar reported recently.
“Housing is so critical, as we obviously are planning for when we grow capacity, but we have to grow it in a responsible way,” said the board’s Chair Margo Cook during Friday’s meeting.

Ahead of the fall semester’s conclusion next month, Libutti gave his routine update on how the school’s admissions department is doing. URI had upped its undergraduate admissions target from 3,275 to 3,385 because of two factors — all in all, “a terrific year recruiting new undergraduate students,” Libutti said.
First, Libutti said, the university did not have to contend with the disastrous rollout of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) like it did in 2024. The standardized, federal financial form was plagued with technical errors in 2024, and wrought chaos in admissions departments nationwide as schools and families alike depend on concrete financial aid offers to make enrollment decisions.
The second reason URI could exceed its initial hopes was because this year’s pool of applicants was particularly strong, Libutti said. He noted that the average GPA of the incoming freshman — which URI recalculates to account for differences among high schools — was 3.69 this year.
“When I started presenting this many years ago, that was actually a 3.08,” Libutti said. “Over one in two of our students starting this fall are bringing in earned college credit from high school. It shows their quality. It shows their commitment.” 
Over 12% of students are graduating in less than four years, Libutti said, and 52% of students arrived on campus with existing college credit this year. The trend has been seen in other states like Connecticut and Georgia. 
The school managed to reduce “summer melt” this year, a trend where students decide not to attend a school in the fall after initially signing on. 
“Years ago, people would say they were coming to URI, but the number who would then no longer come used to be 12 and 13%,” Libutti said. “Our summer melt, thanks to a great team effort with academic affairs, student affairs and so many, was actually sitting just under 8%.” 
Traditional applicant pool shrinking in Northeast
URI’s gains come amid an ongoing dearth of local high school graduates, Libutti said. 
According to a 2024 report from the state’s Office of the Postsecondary Commissioner, Rhode Island is expected to see a 12% drop in public high school graduates between academic years 2018–19 and 2031–32. That statistic is matched by an 18.9% increase since 2017 in residents aged 60 to 74, and the report notes that the “population appears to be shifting toward older adults.”
Birth rates have also fallen in Rhode Island in recent decades, by about 18% between 2002 and 2022, according to the 2024 Rhode Island KIDS COUNT Factbook.
Another 2024 projection from the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education predicts an average 17% decline in high school graduates for northeastern states, including New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire. “Only New Jersey will remain largely unaffected,” the report reads.
“We have just under 10,000 high school graduates,” Libutti said, citing the average number of Rhode Islanders who graduate high school in recent years. “Not all go on to college. We also know New England is a challenge based on the number of high school graduates and demographics.” 
URI continues to attract more out-of-staters than Rhode Islanders, a trend that reliably held and rose across the 2010s. In 2009, only 38% of undergrad students were from out of state. While the balance seemed to tip ever so slightly this year, with Rhode Islanders comprising 50.1% of the entire student body, Libutti said over 60% of first-year students come from out-of-state. Midyear transfer students, mostly coming from within Rhode Island, skew the numbers in the opposite direction.   
This year, Libutti’s presentation noted growth above 20% in applications from students in Maryland, Georgia, Tennessee, Illinois, Ohio, Colorado and Washington, D.C. 
Still, the Ocean State’s flagship university is missing a few states from its nationwide portfolio of applicants. Last year, Libutti told the trustees that applications came from students from 47 states. Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota were the only states missing from the pool. 
This year, Libutti told the trustees he’s still in search of a complete set. “I have to keep saying my joke, because someone has to help me with it: Anyone here with North or South Dakota connections, please see me afterwards. I’d love to hit the 50 next year,” he said.

Murphy’s plan to keep NJ parole violators out of prison stalled,Dana DiFilippo,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/11/10/nj-parole-violations-prison/,"Gov. Phil Murphy's plan to keep technical parole violators out of prison has yet to advance, but he remains hopeful it can become law.","Gov. Phil Murphy, talking with his successor, Mikie Sherrill, in the Statehouse on Nov. 5, 2025, has just eight weeks to see some of his unfinished policy priorities through before the current legislative session ends in January. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Almost a year ago, Gov. Phil Murphy announced a plan to stop reincarcerating thousands of people for violating the conditions of their parole, a change meant to help them better reenter society and enable the state to close an entire prison.
But a bill was never introduced and the proposal lost momentum, with critics predicting it would endanger public safety and legislators loath to push any controversial measures forward when all 80 Assembly seats were on the ballot.
As his second term winds down, Murphy, a Democrat, says the proposal to avoid reincarcerating technical parole violators remains a priority for him. These are parolees who miss curfew, fail a drug test, move without permission, or otherwise defy their parole conditions.
“That’s something that we’ve wanted to do,” he said. “We want to get it right.”
There are only about 10 weeks left in the current legislative session, though, a tight timeline for turning the proposal into law.
Assemblywoman Shanique Speight (D-Essex), the plan’s biggest legislative champion, declined to comment. Shadaya Bennett, her chief of staff, told the New Jersey Monitor that Speight will introduce legislation within the coming weeks and is working to tweak the text to satisfy critics’ concerns.
About 10% of people in New Jersey’s prisons on any given day are there for technical parole violations, costing the state about $90 million a year.
When Murphy pitched his plan during his annual address to the Legislature in January, he framed it as both a budget issue and a matter of mercy.
Keeping technical parole violators in the community would allow the state to close East Jersey State Prison, he said, with budget documents projecting $30 million in savings this fiscal year and annualized savings totaling $50 million by fiscal year 2027. Returning technical parole violators to prison, Murphy added, does nothing to address the root causes that can land these parolees back behind bars, like addiction, unemployment, poverty, and housing insecurity.
The plan met fierce pushback. Sen. Douglas Steinhardt (R-Warren) grilled parole officials about it during budget hearings in the spring.
Steinhardt told the New Jersey Monitor he fears the plan “rewards repeat offenders” by minimizing the transgressions that result in parole revocation.

“The statutory standard for parole is persistent and serious violations. You can’t revoke a person’s parole unless the violations have been persistent and serious,” Steinhardt said. “By the time somebody’s violated, they’ve been given countless chances to comply along the way.”
New Jersey’s parole revocation rate of about 7% in recent years already falls below the national average of 11%, Steinhardt added. He accused Murphy of being motivated more by money than compassion, pointing to the prison closure savings.
“This isn’t about public safety. This isn’t about prison reform. It’s not about prisoners’ rights. This is a bill about bad government, bad fiscal policy, and at the end of the day, greed,” Steinhardt said. “They take an easy term to hang their hat on — ‘technical violations’ — and tell people that people are being violated for missing appointments or not reporting addresses. But that’s absolutely untrue.”
Steinhardt said he has met with Murphy and his staff to hash out their differences and would support the bill if it resolves his concerns.
“The system can always use tweaks. Society evolves. The criminal justice system evolves,” Steinhardt said. “It’s going to come down to what the text of the bill says, and hopefully the governor’s office really rolled up their sleeves and worked a little harder at coming up with something that is designed to serve its stated purpose, which is to help people on reentry.”
The plan’s supporters said they will continue to advocate for it, in hopes that it will pass before a new legislative session begins in January.
“There is a process for reincarcerating people who commit new crimes if they are truly a public safety threat,” said Amol Sinha, who heads the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey. “But simply violating a condition of parole, which may be as simple as missing a day of work or missing a meeting with a probation or parole officer — those are things that are not a threat to public safety, and so people shouldn’t be punished as if they committed new crimes.”
New Jersey Public Defender Jennifer Sellitti said any legislators still leery of acting should consider Democrats’ sweeping successes in Tuesday’s general election, when the party won the governor’s mansion and flipped a handful of Assembly seats now held by Republicans. The outcome was a “resounding mandate for common-sense policy,” Sellitti said.
 “When we reincarcerate someone, we’re spending $75,000 a year to house them, to then send them back out into a community with the same problems that they had when they went in. If we can fix those problems while someone is in community with their family, with the guidance of parole officers who want to help people succeed, that’s how we make community safer,” she said.
It’s unclear if Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill (D) would champion the cause if legislation doesn’t pass before the current session ends in mid-January. Her spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment.

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)Goochland County, home to just over 28,000 residents and more than two hours south of Northern Virginia’s “Data Center Alley,” is the latest locality to face intense community pushback over plans to lure data center development to the area.
“Not planning to grow, planning to preserve,” Board of Supervisors member Neil Spoonhower told a packed Thursday hearing of frustrated residents while defending his support for creating a technology overlay district (TOD).
The TOD stretches from Interstate 64 about five miles down Route 288 to Patterson Ave. It’s designed to attract data centers and other energy-intensive projects by offering incentives that country leaders say will bring new  tax revenue and jobs. 
Most of the area is already zoned industrial, though some agricultural parcels would require additional permitting. Companies using the incentives would be subject to limits on building size, noise ordinances and setbacks from nearby homes.
After a six hour meeting, the board voted 4-1 to approve the district. More than 80 residents from Goochland and surrounding counties spoke in opposition. With data center development expanding beyond Northern Virginia, nearby localities such as Hanover and Henrico are also balancing community concerns with the economic upside. Goochland officials noted the county has spent years recovering from past financial instability. 
“Our county’s financial portfolio needs to be more balanced in order to meet the needs of our community,” said board chair Tim Winfree. 
Many Virginia localities already have similar overlay zones to guide where tech and manufacturing facilities can be located. Supervisor Jonathan Lyle argued Goochland is late to the game.
“If you want economic development, and technology is where development is happening, what can we do to be more prominent and visible for technology companies? So a technology overlay district was seen as a tool, not the tool, but a tool, that would help us attract more industry,” Lyle said.
Several changes were made to the original proposal, and Lyle unsuccessfully pushed for a one-year delay to address community concerns and study potential impacts. His motion failed to receive a second.
Ahead of the vote, community members held their own rally to learn more about data centers and their effects on nearby neighborhoods. The Sierra Club gave a presentation on noise, diesel generator use, and other environmental issues that left many in the audience grumbling and upset.
“They haven’t done any testing, they have absolutely no knowledge… of the results of putting something like that so close to us and so they’re not educated enough to make these kinds of decisions, and it’s really going to be detrimental to all of us. We’re all pretty much retired citizens,” said Karen Fortuna, who lives in a neighborhood bordering the new district. 
Under the final rules, data centers outside the western portion of the TOD would not need additional votes and public hearings. However, energy production facilities — such as gas peaker plants or small modular reactors — would now acquire conditional use permits with full board approval. 
Some residents said they felt blindsided by the proposal. Goochland resident Steve Fram said he heard about it over dinner with a neighbor. Others who recently moved to the county and now find themselves near the district fear they may have to relocate. Fortuna said she isn’t opposed to economic development, but believes the county should protect neighborhoods.
“If they want to do data centers, it’s not that we’re opposed to it, but it needs to be miles away rather than feet,” she said.
Goochland’s fight reflects a growing statewide backlash as data centers move beyond their traditional Northern Virginia cluster. In Louisa County, residents recently halted an Amazon data center proposal. The debate is increasingly tied to a broader question facing Virginia: how to meet soaring energy demand from the data centers – and who bears the cost.

Their concerns come as the State Board of Education prepares to continue its discussions on the proposed accountability changes, a debate that has been underway since the summer.
According to the Virginia Social Studies Leaders Consortium, or VSSLC, about 63 of the state’s 132 school divisions already use locally awarded verified credit through alternative assessments. The consortium is worried revisions could upend that process, which currently includes a portfolio of student work and inquiry-based state tasks.
“What our organization was hoping for was local flexibility,” said Danyael Graham, VSSLC president.
Under the federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, or ESEA, any state — including Virginia —must update its Consolidated State Plan and secure approval from the U.S. Department of Education. That process is significantly faster than going through the Virginia Administrative Process Act, which can take months or years.
ESSA only requires ​​states to assess students in reading, math and science. Adding history and social science to the state accountability model is optional, not federally mandated.
The proposed changes stem from Virginia’s recent overhaul of its accountability system and are intended to allow the state to submit data from the first year of that redesign. They also incorporate feedback from stakeholders, including community members and educators such as Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henricod, who urged the board in a June 2 letter to add U.S. History or Civics in the state accountability system.
VanValkenburg signed the letter alongside representatives from the American Historical Association, National Council for the Social Studies, Virginia Social Science Association, Virginia Council for the Social Studies, iCivics, the CivXNow Coalition and Virginia Civics. The letter argued that although Virginia is “stronger than many other states in emphasizing social studies education,” the subject still has been “de-prioritized” in recent years.
The groups asked the board to join other states in adding social studies as “a measure of school quality and incorporating it into Virginia’s accountability structure.” 
They added that such move is critical “not just for the sake of social studies knowledge and skills, but because when students have deeper content knowledge and vocabulary, it bolsters their reading proficiency, their ability to make sense of the world around them, and their confidence in navigating our public democratic institutions.”
The VSSLC declined to sign the letter, citing a lack of guarantees that inquiry-based assessments remain in place. Members also said the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE) didn’t consult them before last month’s board discussions.
VanValkenburg said he made the request because he believes “one of the most important parts of public education is to foster civic knowledge and civic understanding so that people can be good citizens.”
Last August, the board approved a split accreditation model — one system to determine whether schools meet legal and regulatory requirements, and another to provide “timely and transparent information on student and school performance.”
The regulations are tied to the board’s stated goals of high expectations and learning recovery following pandemic-era losses. 
 Conflict claims

Social studies leaders argue the proposed revisions create several conflicts including one tied to whether teachers can develop their own instructional resources. They also claim the proposal clashes with legislation that supports “permissive local alternative assessment” — the backbone of the locally awarded verified credit option — instead of Standards of Learning (SOL) multiple choice exams in non-federally mandated subjects. 
That language was included in House Bill 1957, sponsored by Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, earlier this year to strengthen how statewide tests are administered and evaluated. VanValkenburg sponsored a similar bill that failed last session.
VanValkenburg said the legislation was intended to place “guardrails” on local assessments to ensure they are “done well” and “meet a certain quality,”noting that some are rigorous while others fall short.
Virginia overhauls SOL testing to boost student achievement

Graham said educators “were excited to move” toward local assessments in social studies because they shifted testing from “quiz bowl style testing” to “document-based questions and inquiry, where students are answering questions using sources.”
Beau Dickenson, a consortium board member recently named the 2025 National Social Studies Leader of the Year by the National Social Studies Leaders Association, said the move toward locally designed assessments was meant to replace older methods focused on rote memorization.
“It’s really innovative, it’s the future of the discipline and I would say it’s more rigorous than discrete facts and can bubble in a scantron sheet,” Dickenson said.
He added that educators aren’t rejecting accountability — they are asking the board to find consistency and balance across the commonwealth, because reverting to content-heavy tests would mean “taking several steps backwards.”
Consortium members also say the revisions contradict prior VDOE assurances that teachers could develop their own instructional and resources.
“It doesn’t seem that this (plan) provides that, (and) it was also something that was promised to us in our standards,” Graham said.
Social studies leaders say they are unsure whether locally developed assessments will count toward accountability and whether changes would be implemented mid-school year or in 2026-2027.
A VDOE presentation published last month shows the board will review numerous elements of the Consolidated State Plan on Thursday, including how the state measures success, which courses qualify as “advanced,” and how struggling schools receive support.
A final review is scheduled for Dec. 11 before the plan is submitted to the U.S. Department of Education.
Kenita Williams, a VDOE spokeswoman, said no final decisions have been made about history and social science because the agency is still gathering stakeholder input.
“We look forward to continued collaboration with our educators and families to prepare students to be civically engaged citizens and ready for success in college, career, and military pathways,” Williams said. “Their input is essential as we work to increase expectations and continue aligning with research-based practices.”

(Photo by Karolina Wojtasik/HBO)We’ve all heard the word “resilient” tossed around when talking about strong economies. But in Rhode Island, it’s not just a buzzword, it’s a reality. Our tourism economy has bounced back from the COVID pandemic with impressive strength, and that’s great news for local businesses, workers and taxpayers.
A new economic impact study by Tourism Economics reveals that a record 29.4 million visitors came to the Ocean State in 2024, a 3.5% increase over the previous year. These visitors spent a whopping $6 billion, generating a total economic impact of $8.8 billion and supporting 88,509 jobs. That’s not just resilience. It’s Rhode Island showing off.
This kind of economic activity ripples through every corner of our state. It supports restaurants, hotels, B&Bs, boutiques, hair salons, retail shops, tour operators and kayak rentals down by the cove. It’s a rising tide that truly lifts all boats.
And let’s not forget the hotel and meal taxes paid by these visitors. They help fund state and local budgets, giving Rhode Island taxpayers a bit of breathing room. That’s a win-win if ever there was one.
Despite challenges — like the loss of Canadian group tours to Newport this year — the tourism sector continues to thrive. At The Preservation Society of Newport County, we’ve seen this firsthand. In 2024, the Newport Mansions welcomed 871,683 visitors, up from 797,750 in 2023. And the first nine months of 2025? Even stronger than the same period in the previous two years.
Our niche, heritage tourism, is booming across the state. Travelers today aren’t just looking for beaches, stuffies and lobster rolls (though we have plenty of them). They want to connect with history, culture and stories that endure. A 2018  economic impact report put the value of heritage tourism in Rhode Island at nearly $1.4 billion. That’s proof: Preservation is good business, and good for Rhode Island.
Preservation, it turns out, isn’t just about saving old buildings. It’s about investing in our economy, our identity and our future. Add in Rhode Island’s compact size, natural beauty, endless charm and countless recreational opportunities on and off the water, and you’ve got a destination that’s hard to beat.
But let’s not get too comfortable. The success of our tourism industry didn’t happen overnight. The Preservation Society was founded 80 years ago by a visionary group of women and men who saw the potential of heritage tourism and rolled up their sleeves to make it happen. It took decades of collaboration across the state to build tourism into the powerhouse it is today. And it will take continued effort to keep it thriving.










In 2024, the Newport Mansions welcomed 871,683 visitors, up from 797,750 in 2023. And the first nine months of 2025? Even stronger than the same period in the previous two years.


Recent policies like the film and television tax credits have helped showcase our state’s beauty to the world. Just look at HBO’s “The Gilded Age.” When fans discover that some of their favorite scenes were filmed at the Newport Mansions, they pack their bags and head our way. Strengthening these credits is one way the General Assembly has supported this vital sector and will, we believe, continue to do so.
Another thing we can do is reform the Historic Tax Credit program, as advocated by Preserve Rhode Island, Grow Smart Rhode Island and the Preservation Society. This program doesn’t just preserve buildings, it creates housing. In fact, about 20% of all new housing in Rhode Island comes through this program, including 20% of affordable housing. That’s preservation with purpose.
It’s also time to ask voters to approve a new historic preservation bond to fund grants through the Rhode Island Historical Preservation & Heritage Commission. The last bond, in 2021, supported 18 projects in 12 towns and cities, including several at the Preservation Society.
Of course, tourism brings challenges. No place feels that more acutely than Newport, where traffic congestion, strained infrastructure and the soaring cost of housing are daily realities. But these aren’t unsolvable problems, they are calls to action.
We need smart investment in public transit and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure to ease congestion and reduce environmental impact. We need housing policies that prioritize affordability for the workers who make our tourism economy thrive. And we need state and local governments to reinvest a larger portion of tourism-generated revenue directly into the communities that host these millions of visitors.
Let’s treat tourism not just as an economic engine, but as an investment in our future by preserving our past. Because resilience isn’t just about bouncing back, it’s about building forward, together.

(Photo by Gerville/Getty Images)The data center boom has catapulted Virginia into a serious energy crunch. We have more data centers here than in any other state, by far, and four times as many more are expected in the next few years. Virginia utilities don’t generate enough electricity to serve them all; fully half of our power is imported from the regional grid. But now the regional grid is also running low on reserve power thanks to all the data center growth, according to grid operator PJM. 
Most proposed solutions focus on the supply side: generating more power by building new solar, wind, gas and battery storage; keeping aging power plants running that were previously scheduled for closure; and even reopening Three Mile Island, shuttered three and a half decades ago following the worst nuclear accident in US history. 
More nuanced solutions involve managing the existing generation better. Research shows that the grid could handle more data centers right now if operators ratcheted back consumption at peak times, either through installing batteries or through shifting some operations to non-peak times.
All of these approaches involve generating more power for the grid, or shifting use around to relieve grid stress at peak demand times. But there is another way to make room for new data centers: remove some existing loads. 
A national advocacy organization, Rewiring America, recently released an intriguing proposal to free up grid capacity by retrofitting homes with high-efficiency heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, solar panels and energy storage. The cumulative effect would be to reduce total demand in the residential sector, making capacity available to data centers sooner, while also saving the participating residential consumers thousands of dollars on their electricity bills.  
Oh, and the tech companies are going to pay for it. 
I am reminded of a delightful sign I once saw announcing the coming of the best dog park ever, to be paid for by cats, itself a satire of a certain president’s pledge to build a border wall paid for by Mexico. But, I notice, neither the cats nor Mexico have sent checks yet. Will Big Tech?
Rewiring America thinks so, if the policies are in place to aggregate and verify the household energy savings into a marketable package, and if buying the package means a data center can come online faster and more cheaply. Upgraded appliances and rooftop solar can be installed in a matter of weeks, compared to the many years that may be required to permit and build new generation and transmission. 
Note that the proposed program would not include households that replace gas, propane or oil furnaces with heat pumps. That kind of upgrade results in greater, not less, residential electricity demand, making it counterproductive when the point is to shrink residential electricity usage. 
Replacing electric furnaces with heat pumps would also mainly address the grid’s winter peak, not its summer peak, though the Department of Energy maintains that heat pumps use less energy for cooling than stand-alone air conditioners.
Researchers focused on replacing electric resistance heat with heat pumps because that one swap produces the biggest efficiency bang for the buck. An electric furnace is cheap to install but expensive to use; the reverse is true of a high-efficiency heat pump. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) estimates that the conversion would save the average family $1,170 per year on its electricity bill. NREL calculates that heat pumps are cost-effective enough to pay for themselves in under 5 years.
According to Rewiring America, “If hyperscalers paid for 50 percent of the upfront cost of installing heat pumps in homes with electric resistance heating, they could get capacity on the grid at a price of about $344/kW-year — a similar cost to building and operating a new gas power plant, which currently costs about $315/kW-year.” (By my math, it’s an extra 10%, which might be acceptable to a power-hungry tech customer as a sort of rush fee.)
The report repeats the calculations for other technologies. Ductless heat pumps would replace baseboard electric heat. Heat pump water heaters would replace conventional electric water heaters. Solar panels paired with battery storage could displace electricity the home would otherwise draw from the grid.
Further capacity could come from home batteries. The report posits, “If every single-family household in the U.S. installed a home battery, and those with a suitable roof installed a 5 kW solar system (about 11 solar panels), they could collectively generate 109 GW of increased capacity on the grid. We assume that households charge the battery off-peak, either from the grid or from rooftop solar, and they discharge the battery during peak periods to reduce the household’s contribution to peak demand.” 
The researchers estimate that a mass purchasing program could squeeze costs of solar and storage down by 40%, primarily through reduced customer acquisition costs and cheaper permitting. Then the data center operators would pay 30% of this lower cost. By buying solar and storage at this now much-reduced price, households would get electricity at about a 30% discount off utility rates, while the tech companies would be able to buy capacity at a cost comparable to that of building a new gas plant. 
You’ll notice the proposal assumes tech companies pay only a portion of the costs for the residential upgrades, so residents still face upfront costs – 50% of the cost of heat pumps, 70% of a hopefully-lowered price for solar and batteries. Rewiring America calculates that residents will come out ahead under all scenarios, while the data centers will pay only a little more than they would otherwise have to pay, buying capacity they might not otherwise be able to get. 
Because Virginia has so many more data centers than anywhere else on earth, Rewiring America calculates that all of these investments would meet only 25% of our projected new data center demand. Other states could do much better, fully meeting projected new demand across most of the country and even exceeding it in about half the states. Virginia would presumably stand to benefit from surplus capacity in other PJM states. 
Obviously, these calculations describe a best-case scenario, and I have my doubts about whether the uptake would be anywhere near what they believe is possible. Still, even capturing just a portion of the efficiency potential Rewiring America believes is there would relieve some of the pressure on the grid. 
But is there really that much low-hanging efficiency fruit in Virginia? If the NREL data that the researchers use is correct, more than 300,000 single family homes in Virginia have electric furnaces. Yet electric furnaces are notoriously inefficient and expensive to operate, and heat pumps have been around for decades. Our utilities have been running energy efficiency programs for years that are supposed to help residents save energy. Can there really be that many single-family homes that have not converted to heat pumps yet?
I consulted Andrew Grigsby, a home energy efficiency expert who is currently the energy services director at Viridiant, a nonprofit focused on sustainable buildings. Grigsby shared my doubts about the accuracy of NREL’s estimate of the number of homes with electric resistance heat, saying it was at odds with his experience. He also felt that an efficiency program would save more energy at less cost by targeting improvements to the needs of each home, instead of supplying a blanket solution.
But he also refuted my assumption that most of the low-hanging fruit should have been picked by now. “Virginia has 100,000 homes (at least) where three hours work and $50 in materials would reduce heating/cooling costs by 25%  — via fixing the obvious, massive duct leakage,” he said in an email.
This doesn’t mean Rewiring America’s approach wouldn’t save energy; rather, it supports the conclusion that there is a massive opportunity for energy efficiency savings that Virginia hasn’t fully tapped into. 
Legislators have tried. The VCEA set efficiency targets for Dominion and APCo, and the SCC followed up with further targets. APCo has consistently met its goals, Dominion has not. A review of Dominion’s sad little list of programs available to homeowners suggests that the problem is a lack of ambition, not a lack of opportunity.
An aggressive, third-party operated efficiency program would complement the Virtual Power Plant (VPP) pilot program that Dominion is developing in accordance with legislation passed in the 2025 session. The VPP’s goal is to shift some consumption to off-peak times, while the Rewiring America proposal would reduce overall consumption. 
Both seek to achieve time-shifting through incentivizing residents to invest in home batteries, their only area of overlap. But whereas the VPP legislation set only 15 MW as its baseline target for home batteries, the Rewiring America proposal could incentivize much more, along with the solar systems to charge them.
The problem remains how to get tech companies to pay for it. My contact at Rewiring America, senior director of communications Alex Amend, pointed me to approaches being undertaken in other states. Minnesota legislation requires data centers to contribute between $2 million and $5 million annually toward energy conservation programs that benefit low-income households. Georgia Power is expected to file a large load tariff that, says Amend, includes pathways for off-site, behind-the-meter solutions.
Here in Virginia, though, both APCo and Dominion, as well as some co-ops, have already submitted large-load tariff proposals to the SCC as part of their rate cases. None of the proposals include incentives for demand reductions anywhere, much less the residential sector. Indeed, given Dominion’s track record on efficiency, the SCC would have to take the initiative to meld a large load tariff for data centers with the VPP program and aggressive home efficiency investments. 
The SCC has announced plans to hold a technical conference on Dec. 12 to examine data center load flexibility. Rewiring America hopes to participate to lay out its proposal in more detail. 
Then maybe we’ll see if the cats will pay for the dog park.

He served as Chancellor of the Knoxville campus of the University of Tennessee from 1992 to 1999. In fact, he was chancellor when I was hired there, but became a friend because he lived in my neighborhood, and even served as treasurer for my successful 2006 […]","William T. ""Bill"" Snyder, former chancellor at the University of Tennessee - Knoxville, served as the house organist at the Tennessee Theater in Knoxville for years. (Photo: Mark Harmon for Tennessee Lookout)Readers may have heard of William T. “Bill” Snyder. He served as Chancellor of the Knoxville campus of the University of Tennessee from 1992 to 1999. In fact, he was chancellor when I was hired there, but became a friend because he lived in my neighborhood, and even served as treasurer for my successful 2006 campaign to become a Knox County commissioner.
I am, however, but a bit player in this story of a great man whose life influenced many Tennesseans through education and music, and whose life story may have some lessons worth highlighting. I recently attended a celebration of Snyder’s life, following his death at age 93 on Sept. 23, held at the Tennessee Theater, a beautifully restored performance hall in downtown Knoxville.
Bill Snyder was a Knoxville native and 1954 UT engineering graduate. Returning to UT, he steadily rose from engineering professor to department head to college dean and eventually to chancellor, where he became known as “the students’ chancellor,” for his willingness to talk to students at all hours. He and wife, Margaret (he called her Margi), raised three daughters and later delighted in the arrival of seven grandchildren. Snyder had a quick and impish smile, loved dogs and the occasional stiff drink and cigar, and during one unusual period could be seen tooling about our neighborhood on a Segway. His intellectual curiosity and humility mixed with a strong sense of kindness.

Snyder didn’t so much retire when he left UT as shift his attention to another great love of his life, the Tennessee Theater, where he had been the volunteer organist since 1979. One could see the intense look on Snyder’s face as the 1928 Mighty Wurlitzer returned from major repairs in 2001-2002. A restoration of the entire theatre in the mid-2000s led to a grand reopening in January 2005, and Snyder’s devotion to the Tennessee Theatre and that organ was total. 
He gave tours, raised money and established free mid-day concerts on Mondays. R. Jelani Eddington, an acclaimed theater organ performer who played at Snyder’s memorial, declared, “As long as this Wurlitzer plays here, there’s a way that a piece of Bill plays here.”
When it came time for a Rocky Horror Picture Show warm up, Bill Snyder and the organ rose from the orchestra pit with Bill as his drag persona, Wilhelmina, complete with fishnet stockings. Listening to Eddington play a Gershwin medley, “Over the Rainbow,” and other songs at Snyder’s memorial, made me remember all the joy that Bill Snyder exuded, never more so than when he was at those pedals, buttons and keys.
When  campaign finance reports were due, Snyder and I had a routine. We’d meet in the theatre office, have lunch somewhere, go over the numbers and sign the documents —usually with a waiter or waitress serving as the required signature witness. The more important part of the lunch, however, was to swap stories of everything from national politics, to my incredible adventure in local politics, to the latest changes at  UT. I’m sure many a patron would wonder what we both were chuckling about. 
He and Margi had been married 69 years when Snyder died surrounded by love and family and listening to music. Snyder himself planned the celebration of life. It had opening and closing remarks from his pastor, including a note from Snyder in which he consoled us, “I had a good and meaningful life.”  Snyder’s successor on the organ, Freddie Brabson, played “Tennessee Waltz” as the service ended. It was during Eddington’s performance, however, that I looked around to see the hundreds of people bathed in the red, green, blue, and purple colors in the otherwise darkened hall, colors that seemed to dance as the sounds ricocheted off the rafters and corners of the theater. What a perfect way to be remembered, and for a community to say thank you.
We can be fooled into looking for greatness only in distant places and power centers. I found greatness just blocks away in my own neighborhood in the form of a good man who consistently lived a life of grace, dedication, intelligence, family and good humor. Perhaps there is someone in your neighborhood like that. If so, tell that person, smile, and share a funny story.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)When Missouri Republican lawmakers approved a new district map in September to help their party in Congress, progressive activist Richard von Glahn was ready. Hours after the state legislature passed the gerrymandered map, von Glahn had submitted a proposed ballot petition to put it to the voters.
It would be more than a month before the Republican-controlled secretary of state’s office approved the petition, squeezing the number of days in which Glahn’s group, People Not Politicians, has to gather signatures.
Missouri Republican Secretary of State Denny Hoskins argued the group couldn’t begin collecting signatures until the governor signed the map into law, two weeks after its legislative passage.
People Not Politicians is now suing Hoskins over the fate of some 90,000 signatures collected after lawmakers approved the map on Sept. 12 and before the secretary of state approved the petition on Oct. 14. The group faces a mid-December deadline to gather roughly 106,000 signatures.
A year out from the 2026 midterm elections, such legal fights and procedural maneuvering over ballot measures and referendums are already well underway in states across the country. The disputes will go a long way in determining not only what ballot measures and referendums are put before voters, but also how those questions are summarized on ballots and other official documents.
Some ballot measure campaigns argue that partisan state officials, such as secretaries of state and attorneys general, have put their thumb on the scale with misleading or inflammatory official summaries and have used arcane procedures to slow them down. More and more, campaigners say, their planning anticipates extensive litigation.
Legal challenges have also been launched against new state laws regulating citizen-led ballot measures. Critics of the regulations argue that in many cases they’re effectively restrictions, while proponents claim the rules are necessary for election integrity and to combat abuses of the ballot measure process.


Between 2018 and 2024, more than 200 lawsuits involving ballot measures were filed in state and federal courts


“Missourians have had this constitutional right for 150 years, and if the [secretary of state’s] logic holds Missourians of today and tomorrow will not have the same rights as their parents did to petition their neighbors for redress of government overreach,” von Glahn, speaking about the referendum process, told Stateline in a statement.
While many states have allowed voters to place issues on the ballot for decades, those elections have attracted significant attention in the past few years as states vote on abortion rights and other divisive issues. Between 2018 and 2024, more than 200 lawsuits involving ballot measures were filed in state and federal courts, according to data gathered by the State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin Law School.
Even in states without a citizen-led process, state legislatures have often referred controversial measures to voters. Mid-decade congressional redistricting is emerging as the latest flash point, with California voters last week approving a ballot measure referred by state lawmakers that allows a Democratic gerrymander of the state to take effect.
Twenty-four states — including every Western state except New Mexico and Hawaii — have a citizen-led ballot measure process, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, with 17 fairly described as Republican-leaning or swing states. Several are currently the site of pitched legal and political battles over the ballot measure process.
In Montana, the state attorney general has rewritten summaries — the language voters see on ballot measures — for proposals aimed at ensuring nonpartisan courts, prompting a lawsuit that’s pending before the state Supreme Court. Arkansas civic and campaign groups have sued to block a series of new ballot measure rules, including a requirement that canvassers ask potential petition signers for a photo ID.
Florida lawmakers passed a bill requiring ballot measure campaigns to turn in petition signatures more quickly. Oklahoma lawmakers imposed new geographic distribution requirements for signature collections. And in Utah, lawmakers voted to require campaigns to provide detailed information on how a proposal would be funded and whether it would require a new tax.
Democrats and other progressives expect upcoming state legislative sessions, many of which begin in January, to bring more measures aimed at the ballot measure process.
“Missouri is a good indicator of what we’re going to face in 2026,” said Chris Melody Fields Figueredo, executive director of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, which aids progressive ballot measure efforts across the country.
“And this has been true for the last several years,” she said. “One of the major tactics that those who are opposed to direct democracy — they go after the signature-gathering process to invalidate legitimate signatures, to prevent issues that voters want from getting onto the ballot.”
How do officials view their role?
Many Republicans defend their approach to ballot measures as necessary to ensure fairness in the process and prevent fraudulent signature collection. Some also voice concerns that state constitutions have become too easy to amend, as Democrats and progressives turn to ballot measures to enact policies such as minimum wage increases and abortion access that are often blocked in GOP-controlled statehouses.
Missouri’s secretary of state, Hoskins, has cast his approach to the People Not Politicians referendum petition as defending the state constitution from out-of-state actors.
While People Not Politicians is suing the secretary of state in Missouri court, Hoskins is suing the group in federal court. In a lawsuit brought jointly by Hoskins and Missouri Republican Attorney General Catherine Hanaway, Hoskins argues that under the U.S. Constitution, the power to draw congressional maps rests with the state legislature.
“Missouri’s Constitution belongs to Missourians, not to dark-money groups trying to rewrite it for their own gain,” Hoskins said in an October news release when the federal lawsuit was filed.
“It has become far too easy to mislead voters and undermine the sacred document that protects our way of life. Our job is to defend the rule of law, safeguard Missouri values, and make sure our Constitution cannot be bought or manipulated from the outside.”
One urban crossroad, 3 new districts: Kansas City braces for Missouri gerrymander

Chuck Hatfield, a Missouri attorney who has long worked on litigation related to ballot measures in the state, said secretaries of state have historically viewed their role as ministerial.
“You’re supposed to move paperwork from the left side of the desk to the right side of the desk,” he said.
“I don’t think this secretary of state sees his role that way,” said Hatfield, who is one of the lawyers representing People Not Politicians in its lawsuit against Hoskins. “I think he sees himself as more of an advocate.”
Hoskins’ more aggressive stance toward ballot measures echoes the posture of Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen, a Republican who this year has rewritten the ballot language of proposals concerning state courts despite finding the measures met legal requirements.
Montanans for Fair and Impartial Judges and Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts are both proposing similar measures to require nonpartisan judicial elections. Judicial elections have been nonpartisan in Montana since the 1930s, but the groups want to codify the practice in the state constitution.
Knudsen rewrote the ballot language of the measures to emphasize that nonpartisan elections also prohibit political party labels “including labels like independent.” The two groups say the phrase suggests independent candidates can’t run in judicial elections and have filed lawsuits challenging the rewrites.
Knudsen’s office didn’t respond to an interview request. But Amanda Braynack, Knudsen’s communications director, has previously called the lawsuits frivolous. “Liberal activists appear to be worried that Montanans will see the facts of what makes an election nonpartisan rather than their own opinion on the ballot,” Braynack told the Flathead Beacon in October.
Caitie Butler, a spokesperson for Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts, said state law does give the attorney general leeway to rewrite ballot language if it’s clearly biased or argumentative, but she emphasized that the group believes its language was neither. She called ballot language rewrites a “growing challenge” in Montana over the past couple of election cycles.
Election Reformers Network, a nonpartisan group that advocates for the impartial administration of U.S. elections, in a January 2025 report said that in 85% of states with a citizen-led ballot measure process, a single party controlled the governorship and both chambers of the state legislature — with 13 Republican trifectas and nine Democratic trifectas in those states.
In recent years, voters in both Republican- and Democratic-leaning states had approved ballot measures with policies opposed by lawmakers, the report found. Examples included a 2020 Colorado vote that lowered tax rates, a 2024 California vote increasing certain criminal penalties, a 2020 Oklahoma vote to expand Medicaid, and a 2020 Florida vote to raise the minimum wage, among others.
The report highlighted the role of partisan state officials in the ballot measure process. In every state with citizen-led ballot measures, partisan officials play a role in reviewing and drafting ballot language. In nearly 60% of states, they also play a role in signature verification.
Some Republican states resist DOJ demand for private voter data

“There are definitely elements of our system that allow for partisan manipulation of elections in very different domains than in the polling station or around mail ballots, but instead in the domains that control options voters have,” Kevin Johnson, co-founder and executive director of Election Reformers Network, said in an interview.
Tighter rules
State legislatures can also exercise significant influence over the ballot measure process by setting rules that make qualifying proposals for the ballot either more or less difficult.
Arkansas lawmakers earlier this year approved a series of measures tightening requirements surrounding ballot measure proposals and gathering signatures. Under the new laws, canvassers must inform potential signers that petition fraud is a criminal offense and request photo ID from potential signers.
Potential signers must also now read a petition’s ballot title or have it read to them. And ballot titles must not be written above an eighth grade reading level.
“These bills are not restrictive. What these bills are is they provide safeguards or guardrails, and the reason you need guardrails is because there have been plenty of accidents along the way,” Arkansas state Sen. Kim Hammer, a Republican, said during floor debate in February.
Hammer, a candidate for Arkansas secretary of state and the lead sponsor of some of the bills, didn’t respond to a request for comment. He said on the Senate floor that he rejected the idea that the measures were taking away the rights of the people, but that they are intended to address increasing “outside interference” in the ballot measure process.
The League of Women Voters of Arkansas and several ballot measure campaign groups have sued in federal court to block the new laws. A judge held a hearing in late September but hasn’t yet ruled on whether to grant a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against the requirements as the lawsuit plays out.
In Missouri, a state court trial in People Not Politicians’ lawsuit against Hoskins over its referendum petition signatures was abruptly postponed last week because the judge was ill. A new hearing is scheduled for Wednesday, though it’s not clear when the judge will rule.
People Not Politicians can almost certainly block the gerrymander for the 2026 election if the group collects enough valid signatures by a Dec. 11 deadline outlined in state law. A successful referendum petition will place the map before voters in November 2026, and Missouri would be prohibited from using the redrawn lines in the meantime.

Part II will be published on Wednesday, Nov. 12, followed by Part III on Nov. 14.

A VIDEO RECORDED at a Dunbarton care home for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities in February 2019 captured caretakers pinning Lucas Houle to the ground and slapping him repeatedly. Amid his pain and fear, Houle made a tearful plea: “I want to go home.”
Four months later, Christine Marie Bill was found dead after several hours in a hot, sealed car in Andover, according to the lawsuit filed in the wake of her death and a State Police incident report. Bill, due to her cognitive disabilities, had a history of leaving the house, and it was her caretaker’s job to check on her every 15 to 30 minutes.
In March 2023, a woman named Laurie Raymond, who has cerebral palsy and is nonverbal, was living at a residential facility in Lyme when she suffered second-degree burns to her abdomen, legs, and genital area. A registered nurse caring for Raymond placed her under scalding water and then scrubbed the burns, resulting in a $45,000 medical bill, according to a malpractice lawsuit filed by the family.

The Bulletin would like to speak with you. Please email wskipworth@newhampshirebulletin.com or send an encrypted message via Signal to WillSkipworth.80.

While every story of abuse and neglect within New Hampshire’s intellectual and developmental disability care network is unique in the harm caused, collectively they point to the state’s systemic failures in oversight and accountability. Over the past several months, the Bulletin has learned about people like Houle, Bill, Raymond, and others through court filings, law enforcement documents, state records, and conversations with lawyers, advocates, and family members. Their stories are being reported for the first time here. Each individual tragedy is illustrative of the consequences of repeated breakdowns in care — care that is paid for and overseen by the state.
According to state records obtained by the Bulletin, New Hampshire investigated 1,405 complaints of abuse, neglect, and exploitation committed against people with intellectual and developmental disabilities receiving state services from January 2023 through the first six months of 2025. Of those, 467 were deemed credible after a state investigation, according to the records. Some of those complaints include physical and sexual abuse. Eighteen of the complaints were withdrawn before the investigations were complete, and 28 complaints were ongoing investigations when the records were produced.
Additionally, state records show 119 people died in New Hampshire’s intellectual and developmental disability system from January 2023 through the first six months of 2025. Of those deaths, 79 were deemed “anticipated” by the state — state officials wouldn’t answer the Bulletin’s questions about how they defined anticipated — and at least 22 were categorized under “unknown” cause of death.

Holly Haines
Holly Haines, a Manchester attorney who represented the Bill family, said that case taught her a lot about New Hampshire’s disability care system.
“The state is hiring vendor private agencies,” she said. “The private agencies are hiring private people, and not training them or educating them adequately, and it’s ultimately the disabled individuals who are harmed.”
There is more “fingerpointing,” she said, than taking responsibility.
“I don’t think the state knows what’s actually going on in the households,” Haines said. “I’m not sure the vendor agencies even are aware.”
In a written statement issued in response to the Bulletin’s requests for an interview with Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Weaver, among other state officials, for this investigation, DHHS spokesman Jake Leon said that the department can’t comment on individual cases but “has a process in place to review and investigate complaints made against providers and vendors licensed or certified through the Department.”
The office of Gov. Kelly Ayotte shared a similar statement: “DHHS has a process in place to review and investigate complaints, and the Governor will be monitoring this issue closely.”
Daily beatings
When Lucas Houle, who has intellectual and developmental disabilities, was pinned to the ground and slapped by his caretakers, he screamed, “Please stop, please stop, don’t beat me up.”
Bikash Shrestha
The incident was captured in a video taken surreptitiously in February 2019 by an employee of Houle’s care agency and described in detail in a Dunbarton Police Department report obtained by the Bulletin. The video, according to the report, shows an obscured view of Houle’s live-in caretakers, Bikash Shrestha and Dilux Timsina, pinning Houle to the floor of their Dunbarton home while he cries. As the caretakers straddled Houle and repeatedly slapped him across the face, they advised each other on where and how to strike him in a way that wouldn’t leave bruising.
The video, as described in the police report by an officer, shows a caretaker bending Houle’s finger backward as punishment for brandishing his middle finger, ostensibly what sparked the incident. Houle cries out, “Please don’t break my finger” in response. 
Houle can be heard crying and screaming: “I won’t do it again, I won’t do it again”; “I’ll be good! I’ll be good! I promise!”; and “No, no, no, please stop.”
Dilux Timsina
At the end of the video, Shrestha tells Houle he isn’t allowed to use a toilet and that he must urinate in the living room. Timsina tells Houle he must remain on the ground. Pitambar Thapa, who recorded the video, told police the two made Houle lie in his own urine for half an hour after the video ends.
Pitambar Thapa told police the physical, verbal, and psychological abuse continued on a daily basis for at least 10 months. He told police he was initially afraid to report the abuse and provide the video to authorities out of fear of retribution.
Houle, in his 40s when the abuse happened, has the mental capacity of a child. He’s been diagnosed with intellectual disability, ADHD, mood disorder, schizophrenia, intermittent explosive disorder, and other disabilities. He has behavioral issues as a result.
He was living in and receiving care at a home operated by the care agency Summit New Hampshire at the time of the abuse. In New Hampshire, people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are entitled to receive services through the Department of Health and Human Services’ Bureau of Developmental Services, which has contracts with 10 private area agencies, each responsible for a region of the state, to coordinate care. Those area agencies sometimes subcontract with other vendor agencies to provide that care. In Houle’s case, the area agency Community Bridges hired Summit to provide care and a Vermont-based organization called Aspire Living and Learning to provide behavioral support. The care is paid for through Medicaid and other state and federal dollars.
Uttam Thapa
Pitambar Thapa told police Houle’s two caretakers — along with a third named Uttam Thapa — would regularly hit Houle with an open hand, step on his calves, and strike him in the arch of his foot. He said the three would lie about their whereabouts, pretending to be in the community when they weren’t, police records indicate.
Houle’s family sued Summit, Community Bridges, Aspire, and several officials at those organizations. The parties settled the case in July. In separate criminal cases, Shrestha and Timsina pleaded guilty to simple assault in 2020 and Uttam Thapa entered a special plea in which he accepted conviction for simple assault but didn’t admit guilt. Shrestha and Timsina were sentenced to nine months in jail while Uttam Thapa was fined $500, according to court records. Pitambar Thapa was not charged.
Houle is now living with his mother.
Kristin Ross
Kristin Ross, an attorney representing (along with her law partner Cristina Rousseau) Houle’s family and speaking on their behalf, told the Bulletin when she first heard what happened to Houle, “I was physically sick to my stomach.”
“It was incredibly difficult to listen to the video and audio and hear Lucas begging for them to stop,” she said.
There were plenty of red flags regarding Houle’s care that the state missed.
Community Bridges’ relationship with Summit was new when it hired the agency to care for Houle in 2018. Internal documents from Community Bridges made public during litigation show the formal vetting process for Summit wasn’t completed until May 2019, months after Houle was placed in its care.
Also, the caretakers were required by state regulations and the service agreement to submit reports each month detailing their activities with Houle, what progress was being made on his behavioral and developmental goals, and any incidents that occurred. Many of those reports, which were also made public as part of the litigation, are verbatim, or near verbatim, copies of one another. The language appears to be copy and pasted (with the same typos) and small, very specific details repeated. The caretakers’ supervisors and Houle’s behavioral team were required to review those reports, but no one appears to have questioned why they never changed.
Progress Notes
 
Additionally, Matthew Green, an Aspire employee, was assigned to be Houle’s behavior analyst and was responsible for his care plan. Green told police he saw the video of Houle being abused, according to the police report. While he reported it to the Bureau of Adult and Aging Services, Green and his colleagues didn’t remove Houle from his abusers until almost a month after he was made aware of the footage. Green, who was a defendant in the lawsuit but never criminally charged, didn’t respond to the Bulletin’s requests for an interview or comment, though the July settlement barred him from speaking about the case.
Under the terms of the care plan, Green was required to spend an average of six hours each month observing Houle’s care team. But billing records revealed during litigation show he spent just 2.5 hours with Houle and his team in total over the roughly eight months between the day of the video and Houle’s removal from the home. The defendants argued during litigation more time spent with Houle wouldn’t necessarily have increased the likelihood that someone would’ve discovered he was being abused and that Aspire may have failed to log all of Green’s time spent observing. They also noted he could spend less time one month and more another if it all averaged out to six hours, but no evidence brought in court shows Green provided enough hours the other months to bring the average up.
When the parties in the lawsuit settled under undisclosed terms, they were barred from speaking about the case. The Bulletin reached out before and after the settlement, but Community Bridges and Aspire didn’t respond to requests for comment, while Summit declined to comment. The Houle family’s lawyers, Ross and Rousseau, spoke to the Bulletin before the settlement, but stopped commenting on the case afterward.
Overheating in a hot car
It was a July evening when Christine Marie Bill, 46, was found unresponsive in a hot car, the doors and windows closed, in the driveway of the Andover home where she lived, according to both the lawsuit and police records. She’d been there for roughly six hours and was pronounced dead at approximately 7:10 p.m. after EMS, State Police, and a medical examiner responded.

Ten years earlier, an insulin overdose left Bill with a number of disabilities, including cognitive/memory deficit, brain dysfunction, and a seizure disorder; as a result, she had a history of leaving the house for unexplained reasons, according to the suit. Security footage from the home showed Bill leaving the house and walking toward the car that day herself unbeknownst to the caretakers, according to the police report. It was the caretakers’ job, as outlined in the care agreement, to check on Bill frequently. A wrongful death lawsuit filed by the family alleges they weren’t properly trained on what those check-ins entailed. 
For Bill’s care, Community Bridges contracted with Independent Services Network, which hired the caregivers. The care plan, created by the two organizations in collaboration with the Bill family, explicitly said, “She cannot be left alone and requires 24/7 supervision in the home with eyes-on in the community as her safety skills are minimal,” according to the suit.
The case was settled in 2023, with the defendants maintaining they weren’t negligent. The terms of the settlement are confidential and, according to Haines, the plaintiffs’ attorney, barred the parties from speaking about it. Neither Community Bridges nor Independent Services Network responded to the Bulletin’s requests for comment or an interview.
“What was very clear,” Haines, who couldn’t comment on Bill’s case but did discuss the system at large, said, “is just the complete lack of oversight that there is in the system itself. Just a complete systemic breakdown. Everyone is checking boxes to try to comply with administrative regulations, but no one is doing anything substantive.”
The biggest part of this breakdown, she said, is the lack of change after tragedies to prevent future tragedies.
“Incidents are reported because they have to be reported,” she said. “But nothing is done to do any sort of root cause analysis or investigation and change to the system. … It really doesn’t matter how many incident reports you file if no one’s doing anything in response to them.”
Burned by scalding water
Malpractice reports from January 2023 to March 2025, obtained by the Bulletin through records requests, reveal that claims of abuse, neglect, and exploitation are common. While state officials said they couldn’t say which reports were substantiated upon further investigation, citing state statues, many involve reports of physical, verbal, sexual, psychological, and emotional abuse.
One complainant reported that a resident was “kicked in the ribs” and had her “wrist broken by her aide.” Another said the caretaker “punched (the resident) in the eye and the jaw.” Another said the caretaker “grabbed her by the shirt pushed her and kicked her.” In another, “staff hit him in the face.” 
Staff were having sexual relations with those in their care, others reported. Multiple others described staff sexually assaulting residents or not preventing residents from sexually assaulting one another.
Several claimed people who require 24-hour care and supervision for their disabilities were left unattended. There were reports of staff sleeping on the job, intoxication, and drug use. Some cited concerns about unsafe living quarters, including mold in the shower, exposed live wiring, lack of running water, roaches and rodents, and feces or urine on beds and furniture.
Raymond was the subject of one of the reports. Her family ultimately filed a lawsuit. In March 2023, Raymond’s caretaker — a registered nurse from Mississippi hired by travel nursing agency TLC Nursing — allegedly put her under scalding water in the shower at her Lyme care facility, resulting in second-degree burns, according to a malpractice lawsuit filed by the family. 
The caregiver, seemingly oblivious to the damage Raymond suffered to her abdomen, legs, and genital area, saw redness on Raymond and allegedly proceeded to scrub the burned areas clean. The caretaker reportedly noted that skin peeled off during the scrubbing, but still didn’t realize she was scrubbing burn wounds, according to the lawsuit. 
Three round burns, the size and shape of the showerhead, were discovered on Raymond by another caregiver, according to the suit. Raymond was subsequently taken to Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, where she was reportedly treated in the burn unit, and incurred $45,000 in medical costs, per the lawsuit.
The facility where Raymond lived was operated by the area agency PathWays of the River Valley. Like that of Houle and Bill, Raymond’s care was overseen by the state’s Bureau of Developmental Services and paid for through state and federal dollars.
The family’s lawsuit, filed in October 2024, named PathWays, TLC Nursing, and the nurse who reportedly burned her as defendants. A settlement reached in March bars the family from speaking about the case. PathWays didn’t respond to the Bulletin’s request for an interview or comment, though they were similarly barred from speaking after the settlement.

State officials applied Oct. 31 for nearly $1 billion of the $50 billion in the Rural Health Transformation Fund, which was set aside in the federal budget reconciliation law passed in July. The state asked for $200 million per year over five years, and many of the applicants that sent their proposals to the state in October provided five-year plans for their funding requests.
All 50 states have applied for a share of the federal fund. The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said it will notify states by Dec. 31 if their applications are approved.
Arkansas requested $996.8 million to support four initiatives:

$150.5 million for Healthy Eating, Active Recreation and Transformation (HEART)
$393 million for Promoting Access, Coordination and Transformation (PACT)
$161.55 million for Recruitment, Innovation, Skills and Education for Arkansas (RISE AR)
$266.75 million for Telehealth, Health-monitoring and Response Innovation for Vital Expansion (THRIVE)

The remaining $25 million would cover administrative costs, according to the state’s application.

Arkansas-Rural-Health-Transformation-Program-Application 
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a Wednesday news release that the federal aid would “allow us to build on all we have done so far, like investing in maternal health, combatting food insecurity, and promoting better health and nutrition statewide.”
On Thursday, Republican state Sen. Missy Irvin of Mountain View praised the “robust response” to the state’s call for applications and the “excellent ideas” proposed. Irvin chairs the Senate Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee and represents a largely rural North Arkansas constituency.
The Advocate obtained the individual funding requests from the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration via a public records request. Many of the proposals pertained to at least one of the four initiatives.
For example, the Arkansas Health Care Association School of Nursing asked for more than $9.25 million to train and retain licensed nurses in rural areas. The proposal would likely fit in the RISE AR category.
“This is not simply a training program — it is a transformative career pathway model that builds capacity, strengthens communities, and ensures that every Arkansan, regardless of ZIP code, can receive quality care from a skilled and compassionate nurse,” the application states.
The AHCA represents 90% of the state’s long-term care providers, according to its website, and its nursing school offers training leading to licensure for practical nurses and certification for medication assistants. 
 Hospital systems’ applications

If Arkansas receives all the funding it requested from the Rural Health Transformation Fund, not all the applicants would get all the money they requested. Mercy Health, based in Missouri with several hospitals in Arkansas, asked for $200 million in capital funds for equipment and infrastructure upgrades. Multiple Mercy hospitals made their own funding requests, such as the Waldron location’s $794,300 request for facility renovations and the Ozark location’s $9,950 request to improve its telehealth services.
The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and Arkansas Children’s Hospital also submitted rural health funding proposals.
UAMS’ proposal included forming a “clinically integrated network” of at least 30 rural hospitals and clinics “that shares data, care teams and purchasing power” so rural health care providers “can get paid for delivering better health.” The plan would require between $100 million and $153 million “depending on Medicaid population inclusion.”

2025.10.7 FINAL RTF with Cover 
Arkansas Children’s requested $34.2 million over five years to bring specialized pediatric care to rural areas and treat chronic conditions in children.
“Effectively deploying care and resources to areas with the fewest and sickest kids proves to be a significant challenge due to current funding and workforce frameworks,” the hospital’s proposal states. “…America’s healthcare system is not built with the rural child in mind.”
Some hospitals’ funding requests sought to address specific areas of medical care. Washington Regional Hospital in Fayetteville asked for $12 million to improve its diagnostic imaging capabilities for neurological care, and Johnson Regional Medical Center in Clarksville asked for between $500,000 and $700,000 for mammography services to improve its breast cancer detection capacity.
 Other funding requests

Other applicants included small local health care providers and initiatives, such as Coleman Pharmacy of Alma. State Sen. Justin Boyd, the location’s pharmacist and a Republican from Fort Smith, submitted the pharmacy’s proposal.
“Expanding pharmacists’ prescriptive authority for hypertension and cardiovascular care would improve access, reduce hospitalizations, and save an estimated $11 billion over 30 years,” Boyd wrote.
An addiction treatment center in Berryville called 29:11 Healing and Recovery Center estimated a need for $200 million to broaden its reach via telehealth, behavioral health services, mobile health units and recruitment and retention of health care professionals in five Northwest Arkansas counties.

Rural Arkansans face long ambulance wait times, nationwide study says


In Northeast Arkansas, the Arkansas Methodist Medical Center requested $175,321.37 for a new ambulance. The Paragould hospital was among 17 rural hospitals to receive federal COVID-19 relief funds from the state between 2022 and 2024.
The Arkansas Ambulance Association also requested funding for several initiatives, including replacing outdated vehicles, training more paramedics and expanding telehealth capacity. The organization requested $88.4 million over five years.
A 2023 study found that all 75 counties in Arkansas have at least one ambulance desert, meaning it takes paramedics longer than 25 minutes to drive to some residents’ homes. Hundreds of thousands of Arkansans rely on Medicaid, particularly in rural areas, and emergency medical services professionals said this causes financial strain for rural ambulance services.
The new budget reconciliation law cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the federal-state public health insurance for low-income Americans, over the next decade to help pay for tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy. Those cuts include $155 billion less in rural Medicaid spending over 10 years, as estimated by KFF, a nonprofit health policy and research group.
Experts, hospital leaders and lawmakers from both political parties fear that Trump’s signature legislation will particularly gut rural hospitals and clinics, which see larger proportions of patients insured through Medicaid. This raises concerns that $50 billion for rural health aid might not be enough.

The analysis of credit card data was performed by WalletHub. 
It found that while 19.66% of Ohio credit card payments were overdue in the second quarter of last year, 28.65% were in 2025. 
Only Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas and South Dakota saw bigger increases.
“While some level of delinquency is unavoidable, rising delinquency rates often signal broader economic strain,” the analysis said.
On the positive side, the sustainability of Ohioans’ overall debt is much better than most states.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
A WalletHub analysis in July found that median credit card debt here was $2,476 and the median monthly payment was $263. 
At that rate, it would take 11 months and 14 days for median cardholders to pay off their balances. 
That was the 10th fastest in the United States, the analysis found.
But the rapid rise in Ohioans’ credit-card debt coincides with several other foreboding economic indicators. 
Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index was 3% in September, and the Federal Bank of Cleveland reported that President Donald Trump’s tariffs were forcing up businesses’ expenses and prices for consumers.
Meanwhile, Ohioans’ utility bills are skyrocketing as the state provides incentives to power-intensive data centers to locate here. 
The centers don’t employ many people, and one estimate said the incentives are costing Ohioans $1 million tax dollars for each job created.
Ohio again had the nation’s fifth-highest unemployment in August, despite years of spending billions on taxpayer-financed incentives to attract jobs.
The Trump administration started the year by allowing the world’s richest man to lead a group that slashed more than 250,000 federal workers, and many more have been idled as a partial government shutdown approaches its sixth week.
The news organization Reuters last Thursday reported that U.S.-based employers in October cut 150,000 jobs — the largest number in 20 years. 
Total job cuts for the year are just over 1 million, the most since the start of the pandemic in 2020. 
With lots of student loan debt and faced with a weak employment picture, credit card struggles are particularly besetting Ohio’s young people.
An analysis of Federal Reserve Data by Austin-based Upgraded Points last month found that a higher-than-average portion of Ohioans between 18 and 34 had credit cards that were more than 90 days delinquent. 
The Buckeye State ranked 16th for severe delinquency, with 17.1% of young people having that status in the first quarter of 2025.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderSix candidates have stepped forward to fill a Cherokee County legislative seat that was left empty after the death of the district’s state representative last month.
Rep. Mandi Ballinger, a Canton Republican, died in October after a long battle with cancer. Five Republicans and one Democrat  have qualified to replace her in the state House.
House District 23 was drawn to favor a Republican. The last time Ballinger had a Democratic opponent was in 2018, and she won with nearly three quarters of the vote, though the district’s borders have shifted since then.
The election is scheduled for Dec. 9 with early voting set to begin Monday, Nov. 17.
With six candidates splitting the vote, it’s likely that none of them will exceed the required 50% of the vote. In that case, a runoff is scheduled to be held Jan. 6. The House is set to gavel in for the start of the 2026 legislative session on Jan. 12.
The short timeframe to campaign combined with the Thanksgiving travel season and voter fatigue from other recent elections could all portend low turnout.
Here’s who has thrown their hat in the ring to represent part of Cherokee County including Canton, part of northern Holly Springs and the surrounding unincorporated regions, according to documents filed with the secretary of state’s office:
Bill Fincher
Fincher, a Republican former assistant district attorney, now owns an RV park. In a phone call, Fincher said his experience negotiating and trying cases is part of what makes him the best candidate for the job.
“I’m strong for law enforcement. I’m strong for election integrity, and I believe in capping the ad valorem tax to protect people so they can stay in their homes. I’m a friend of taxpayers, having paid a lot of taxes over my life, I’m pro-life, pro-Second Amendment, I’m a Christian conservative.”
Fincher said his top priorities if elected will be ensuring election integrity, capping ad valorem taxes and reducing the price of groce

Sanders, a business executive who comes from a family of educators, said his top priority if elected will be making Georgia teachers’ lives easier. He said he also hopes to focus on fully funding public services and reducing overdevelopment in rural areas.
“I’m not really thrilled with the extremes on either side,” he said in a phone call. “And, you know, this is me trying to bring normalcy and sanity and — I keep using the phrase ‘common sense –’ back to things. That’s all it really is, you know? Voters don’t have to believe in everything I believe in, I wouldn’t expect them to. But if we can agree on some of the bigger stuff, maybe there’s room to figure out smaller stuff or at least take care of the important items and make the world a better place a little bit.”

Ware, a retired microbiologist, said he decided to run in part to help children in state custody, which was also a passion of Ballinger’s.
Ware said the issue is personal for him after members of his family had children taken away in another state.
“At least I can try to do something,” he said. “And at the same time, I understand the complexities that child protective services have, and I want to work with them, not to abolish or get rid of them or anything, but to support them so that we don’t have the problems that we’ve got right now.”
Ware said he’ll be running on a tight budget and acknowledged he is at a disadvantage, but he pledged to serve with integrity and keep an eye on spending if he is elected.
“The term limits are gonna be short for me – I am 78 years old,” he said. “But I have a lot of experience in negotiating. I feel like I can represent the people here. I’m open, transparent, honest. Hopefully, I have some integrity, and I think we lack that in a lot of our politicians. And that’s what I bring to the table”

(Photo by SDI Productions via Getty Images)With child care access already considered a crisis in Ohio, the state’s Head Start locations are facing their own challenges, including closure, as the federal government shutdown continues.
Head Start is an income-based federal program with preschool programs and Early Head Start, which targets infants, toddlers, and pregnant individuals.
The program funding is delivered through local agencies who “tailor the federal program to the local needs of families in their service area, according to a federal website on the program.
In fiscal year 2024, 62 grants were distributed to Ohio, for a total of more than $440 million in funding, data from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services showed.
But that money is quickly fading away because of the stalemate in the U.S. Congress over reopening the federal government.
Funding lapses began Oct. 1 when no agreement came from Capitol Hill, with Democrats standing their ground on demands to renew Affordable Care Act premium tax credits, and Republicans digging their heels in, with leaders saying they won’t negotiate until the government is reopened.
Without action, Head Start programs across the country saw Nov. 1 go by without grant funding, affecting more than 65,000 children in 140 programs across 41 states and Puerto Rico.
Other funding aimed at community programs may also be impacted, including about 1,600 across the country.
As of 2024, the seven Head Start programs in Ohio had more than 33,000 children enrolled, with 1,741 children in foster care being served, along with 1,660 children experiencing homelessness.
The biggest age group enrolled in state Head Start is 4-year-olds, with more than 12,000 enrolled, according to federal data.

Head Start closures “represent a significant loss for Ohio’s children and workforce, and highlighting the profound impact of these shutdowns on the community,” said Jodi Norton Trimble, spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Children & Youth.
The program employs 1,335 preschool classroom teachers in Ohio at a salary of $40,013 per year, and nearly 1,000 infant and toddler classroom teachers.
Early Head Start teachers in the state are paid $36,152, the HHS data stated.
Without the return of federal funding sources, all of Ohio’s Head Start providers face the potential for closure, according to the Ohio Head Start Association, Inc.
Two Ohio programs have already closed classrooms due to the shutdown, in Scioto County and Highland County.
Allen County and Coshocton County are scheduled to close in less than two weeks, according to the association.
Highland County Community Action Organization, Inc., announced its Nov. 1 closures at the end of October, saying staff will be furloughed and classrooms would be closed until the government reopens.
Coshocton County Head Start, Inc., has been active since 1972, and has 140 children enrolled, with 57 employees.
In October, the program said with the shutdown still in place, the organization would need $220,000 to get through the month of November.
Coshocton County Head Start’s executive director, Susan Craddock, said in a statement they were “doing everything we can to keep our classrooms open because our families depend on us.”
“Parents need to work and go to school knowing their children are safe, learning and cared for,” Craddock said in October. “But we can’t sustain this without federal and local support.”
Then, in a Nov. 6 letter to families, Craddock said the community and “many individuals have rallied around us to keep our program open these last two weeks.”
“Unfortunately, due to the continued government shutdown and pause in federal funding, our program will have to temporarily close starting Nov. 14,” Craddock wrote.
The program plans to reopen after the shutdown has ended and grant funding has been received.
The state’s Head Start Association said providers “have exhausted their federal funds,” and the five remaining locations “are operating on borrowed time — cobbling together donations, community support and organizational reserves.”
“This shutdown is pulling the rug out from under working families,” said Julie Stone, executive director of the Ohio Head Start Association.
“Parents are losing child care, teachers are losing paychecks and children are losing the stable, nurturing environments that help them thrive. These are real people with real consequences — and Ohio’s youngest citizens deserve better.”
Stone told the Capital Journal that the total potential impact from the Scioto and Highland closures, along with the planned Allen and Coshocton closures impact 1,042 children, 55 classrooms and 286 staff members.
“We are hopeful the government shutdown will end soon, but not sure what a reopening will look like with reduced federal staff to support the review and awarding of grants,” Stone said.

Of the 38 school ballot issues, 23 passed and 15 failed. But there was a clear difference in the type of levy that was passed.
Renewal levies, which do not raise your taxes, passed 18 out of 20 times. While additional fund levies, which will increase your bills, failed 7 out of 10 times. This was the case for Elyria City Schools.
“It breaks my heart because I know what we do for our students and families. And any time you have to look at making cuts, no matter where the cuts are, it’s going to affect something,” Ann Schloss, the superintendent for Elyria City Schools, said.


But one of the three that succeeded was Shaker Heights City School District
“I just wanna acknowledge and commend our community for their overwhelming support of the Shaker School District, particularly in today’s day and age,” David Glasner, Shaker superintendent, said.
A day and age where Glasner and all other public school leaders are facing cuts in state funding.
Nonpartisan research group Policy Matters Ohio found that the state slashed the expected public education spending by nearly $3 billion over the next two years.
“We’re already under strain, so it would cause additional strain,” Parma Schools Superintendent Dr. Scott Hunt said about what would happen if his levy failed.
Four bond issues also failed, as well as half of the four substitute levies.
On Wednesday, OhioHouse Speaker Matt Huffman (R-Lima) was asked what he says to the schools that are asking for the state to step in and provide more financial support.
“It’s kind of this, I guess, two-sided coin when folks say ‘We want local control of our schools, but our local folks won’t approve levies. We, therefore, want the state to give us the money, even though our local folks won’t support that,'” Huffman responded.
The state is trying to deal with lowering property taxes, but Huffman added that schools need to be more fiscally responsible if their levies fail.
“An understanding that schools have to be more precise in their spending,” Huffman said. “They’re not going to be able to hire, especially on the administrative side, the people they’ve hired before.”
Districts facing failed levies argue that they have been responsible, while voters told us that the cost of living is too high to pay more.
“Why do you think Shaker was able to beat those odds?” Glasner was asked.
“I think Shaker was able to beat those odds because we have an incredible community that has historically and continues to support our public schools, and that really understands how valuable public schools are, not just to the students and families who are in them, but to the broader community as a whole and really, I would say, kind of an even bigger picture to our country and the health of our democracy,” he responded.
The City of Shaker Heights has been a district at the forefront of both state and federal political discussions.
The community not only shows up to vote, but had a turnout rate of nearly 70% during the 2024 presidential election, according to data from the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections. The city of about 30,000 voted for former VP Kamala Harris by nearly 90%.
The district being so engaged in how school funding works is a factor, Glasner added.
“The levy will play a critical role in advancing the district’s equity goals – racial, economic, ability-based, and beyond,” the Stand Up for Shaker Schools levy campaign page wrote.
“Funds will help every student access high-quality educational opportunities.”
The superintendent also acknowledged that socioeconomic factors played into the passage.
Census data shows the average Shaker Heights home is valued at around $300,000. Passing the levy will make tax bills go up more than $1,000 per year.
Throughout our coverage of levies over the past few years, schools with more affluent families typically tend to pass, while many lower-income areas struggle.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)Kansas House Speaker Dan Hawkins failed his big test for President Donald Trump on Tuesday. He couldn’t persuade two-thirds of his fellow Republicans to call a special session to gerrymander Kansas congressional seats. I suspect Hawkins knew how ineffectual he looked (I poked some fun along those lines), and he sure didn’t seem amused by his colleagues’ intransigence.
So the time has come for payback.
The hammer fell Friday. Hawkins purged holdouts from committee leadership roles. As Kansas Reflector reported, he removed “as chairmen GOP Reps. Steven Howe of Salina, Nathan Butler of Junction City and Jesse Borjon of Topeka. Hawkins also removed Rep. Clarke Sanders of Salina and Rep. Leah Howell of Derby from vice chair positions.” Further action appears likely, as these changes affect only half of the GOP representatives who refused to support the special session.
Hawkins likely felt he didn’t have any choice. After Senate President Ty Masterson easily reached the two-thirds mark in his chamber, Hawkins had to play the disciplinarian in the House.
But I can’t imagine the move helps him politically, or makes redistricting any more likely in the 2026 session.
Think about it. Hawkins will leave the House after next session. He’s running for state insurance commissioner and has a strong shot at the office. He’s therefore heading into January as a lame duck. Those he strips of chairmanships or committee seats just need to wait until Hawkins leaves the chamber. What do they have to fear from him?
In the meantime, why would any Republican publicly humiliated in such a way decide to support gerrymandering now? Surely the smarter move, if Hawkins believed the votes were there in his conference, would be to wait until the regular session and use his power then. Either the speaker allowed his temper to get the better of him or — as I suspect — he knows the votes aren’t there to split Johnson County into multiple districts.
Let me also suggest this: Among the 87 other Kansas House Republicans, at least one or two have wondered if they might make a better speaker than Hawkins.
We’ve seen what happens when Hawkins faces challenges before. He pitched a fit when Lawrence Democrat Dennis “Boog” Highberger contemplated a symbolic run for speaker. But with Hawkins on the way out, perhaps an ambitious Republican member sees a chance for advancement.
I’m just asking questions here!
Finally, the entire situation highlights a Hawkins’ tendency to mislead the public.
On Tuesday, when he gave up efforts to call the special session, the House speaker stated the following via news release: “Planning a Special Session is always going to be an uphill battle with multiple agendas, scheduling conflicts, and many other unseen factors at play.”
Three days later, in his “Majority Record” newsletter, Hawkins was singing a different tune. There, he wrote: “Unfortunately, only 78 of 88 Republican House members signed the petition calling for a November 7th special session. Once we reached the November 7th deadline, the petitions are void and the process would need to start again.”
Anyone with with a functioning brain can see what happened here.
Hawkins got the bad news out of the way with a short, obfuscatory statement. His vanilla-flavored comments about scheduling filled the first round of news stories. But when it came time to communicate at length with constituents, Hawkins described a less-flattering scenario. He didn’t just face an “uphill battle.” No, 10 of his Republican colleagues didn’t agree with the cockamamie scheme to hand another GOP seat to Trump.
I might just be old fashioned, but I prefer political leaders who tell the truth up front and don’t require an extra three days to ponder their words.
Before signing off today, let’s also note that I could be wrong. The Legislature could reconvene in January and whisk through a new congressional map, booting Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids out of Congress. Hawkins could revel in the accolades of fellow Republicans. I don’t claim to understand the ways of politicians from either party. They can be strange creatures, and please don’t feed them after midnight.
But for now, all Hawkins appears to have is a recalcitrant caucus and appetite for vengeance. What could go wrong?

(Photo by U.S. Department of Agriculture)In part of its tug-of-war game with Congress, the Trump Administration announced this week they would be cutting payments to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as “food stamp”) families as a way to pressure Congress to end the federal government shutdown.
This means 1.4 million Ohioans will have benefits reduced this month. Since the average per-person benefit is $186, that means Ohio will lose about $130 million in food support in November if the administration goes through with this threat.
While the SNAP program is ostensibly about food assistance, the program has a range of impacts.
According to at least some research, SNAP is an effective food insecurity program. Urban Institute researchers estimate SNAP recipiency reduces the chance of being food insecure by 30%. 
Researchers at the Center for Science in the Public Interest followed families that newly received SNAP, finding their food insecurity rates dropped by 11% six months into the program.
SNAP is also an income support and antipoverty program. Since families still usually spend more of their income on food than their SNAP benefits cover (try feeding even your most peckish family member for a month on $186), SNAP benefits effectively free up resources for households to make other purchases. 
Urban Institute researchers found that the 2021 update to the Thrift Food Plan used to set SNAP benefits kept 2.9 million Americans out of poverty.

On top of being a food insecurity and antipoverty program, SNAP is also an economic stimulus program. 
When low-income people receive payments, they tend to spend them, which then puts money in the pockets of workers at grocery stores, who use it to pay rent, buy their own groceries, and purchase other necessities. 
The United States Department of Agriculture estimates that every $1 spent on SNAP leads to $1.54 in increased Gross Domestic Product. 
This can be especially important during economic downturns, when SNAP acts countercyclically to pump more money into the economy when the country needs spending the most.
So if Ohio’s federal support for fighting food insecurity, poverty, and stimulating the economy is going away, are there things the state can do to pick up the slack?
One option the state of Ohio has is funding nutrition education. 
Initiatives like the SNAP-Ed program are effective tools for helping families meal plan and spend money strategically, showing in randomized controlled trials in other states to reduce food insecurity by as much as a third. 
This can be a strategy the state can use to reduce food insecurity even in the face of SNAP cuts.
To fight poverty, Ohio lawmakers can use tax credits like the earned income tax credit or the child tax credit. 
These sorts of programs put cash in the pockets of low-income workers while helping children get off on the right foot, supporting their health and income in the long-run.
To stimulate the state economy, one of the most powerful tools lawmakers have is state education spending, particularly early education spending.
Expanded access to high-quality prekindergarten education is a tool that can be as effective as well-designed economic development incentives at increasing local incomes in the long-run.
Ohio lawmakers can only do so much to control federal politics. 
But if lawmakers want their constituents to be food secure, free from poverty, and to have economic opportunities in a thriving economy, they have options to let them do that.

(Stock image from broadcastertr via Getty Images)Nebraska’s news junkies and even casual information consumers have full plates: the potential resignations of a University of Nebraska regent and a state legislator; a federal immigration detention camp that materialized on an apparent need-to-know basis in an infinitesimally narrow reading of who needs to know; and, with less than a year from 2026’s midterm elections, political campaigns are giving news and information patrons thousands of opportunities to wonder what is the truth. 
Each news cycle adds to the list, too.
Imagine a Nebraska television station’s local news broadcast — or a network’s nightly news — devoting 5-7 minutes most evenings to getting the actual truth, not simply a repackaging by one or more of the principals involved or a retelling of something gleaned from our newest “news” universe: social media. 
That’s right, what if tucked among the weather, doorbell videos funny or frightening or local officials making non-comment comments was a segment designed to sift fact from fiction among stories that affect viewers lives? 
What if the reporting — after ferreting out the fibs and fakes — also took a clear-eyed look at the reasons behind such fictions.
I found such a station, not in the Cornhusker State but in Paris. It’s called France 24. I stumbled across it while searching for something on PBS World. France 24 covers events from around the globe. Its “World Roundup” broadcast this night fell on the eve of some U.S. elections, so France 24 devoted its “Truth or Fake” segment to a number of lies and distortions regarding the New York City mayoral race.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
After the “Truth or Fake” reporter debunked a number of wild claims about the young man who would be the eventual winner, the news anchor asked her to surmise from her research and evidence what was the primary reason for all the misrepresentations. “Hypocrisy and racism,” she said. 
This was neither a YouTube video, a TikTok, an expanded Snapchat nor an Instagram post. This was a professional journalist verifying crucial details using solid evidence to refute widely viewed, wildly inaccurate social media posts, some of which legacy media had used in news broadcasts.
I was simultaneously flabbergasted and refreshed, the idea that a major news outlet would present such fact-checking as part of its evening broadcast. (France 24 is a state-owned public station in competition with French private networks such as TF1 and BFM TV.) 
Still, I was curious if “Truth or Fake” was a one off given the timing of the NYC election. Sure enough, the next night “Truth or Fake” spent another 5-7 minutes taking issue with Elon Musk’s claim that the ballot for NYC mayor was part of a scam, a hot air balloon of baloney that the reporter punctured. After some research, I found that “Truth or Fake” is a regular part of France 24’s “World Roundup” Monday through Thursday.
You’re right. Why trust “something like Truth or Fake” more than a friend on Facebook or a podcast we heard on the way to work or the dish or dirt we overheard at the coffee shop or even our local news stations or newspapers? 
The answer has a little to do with my own trusted sources of information and even less than the information itself. It has plenty to do with whether the information agrees with what I already think and, most important, my ability to believe it when it doesn’t.
The real takeaway here is that at least France 24 is trying, attempting to ascertain the truth and report it. Others are trying, too. Some … not so much. In the post-truth age, when facts carry less influence than emotions and beliefs, the news industry — and its social media competitors — must remain a force for a well-informed democracy, without fear or favor when the government or the powerful traffic in or repeat lies and other assorted disinformation. 
This force is the hope for Nebraskans when they pick up their morning papers, turn on their evening news or go online to get the latest.
Aside from nerds like me, who really pays attention to something like “Truth or Fake?” The point is that France 24 and anyone else who is pushing back on the constant lying, who is unwilling to accept evidence-free pronouncements from the government, online influencers or friends, or who is fact-checking and calling out the false is acting as if our aggregate future depends on it.
Pro tip: It does.

The chair of the Florida State University’s Board of Trustees says he’s looking forward to extending President Richard McCullough’s contract.
With his initial 2021 contract expiring Aug. 31, 2026, Chair Peter Collins told the Phoenix that McCullough, 66, is the “perfect person” for the job.

“He’s doing a great job, there’s no plans on changing that,” Collins said late last month.
Collins said he plans to take McCullough’s contract extension to the Board of Governors to approve next year.
“I don’t anticipate any problem with that,” Collins said.
BOG regulations limit university presidents to one-year contract extensions once their original terms expire.
FSU ranked #21 among public universities nationwide by U.S. News & World Report in 2025, keeping close to the top 20, when in 2021 it landed at #19.

That figure includes the University of North Florida, which is anticipated to start a presidential search if the BOG votes, to make current UNF President Moez Limayem head of the University of South Florida. Incoming BOG chair Alan Levine said he intends to support Limayem.
Collins, who was unanimously elected chair of the FSU Board of Trustees in August for a two-year term, said he doesn’t anticipate FSU becoming the ninth university with a new president.
“There’s going to be no change in leadership prior to the end of his next year. We would extend him now as a board if we could,” Collins said.

Recently-departed presidents
Some of those recently-departed SUS presidents, Kenneth Jessell at Florida International University, Ben Sasse at University of Florida, and Martha Saunders at University of West Florida, left their posts before their contracts expired and following outside pressures. 
All the while Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has been instrumental in re-engineering leadership at universities, has been hovering in the background.
DeSantis’ office guided Sasse to Gainesville, Politico reported, before he left in a shroud of spending controversy. The governor reached out to place Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez at FIU, a trustee said.
DeSantis in the spring told UWF to “buckle up” and promised changes were on the way. Those comments and DeSantis’ overhaul of the UWF Board of Trustees caused a stir among UWF stakeholders who expressed fear about gubernatorial interference.
Saunders left after DeSantis’ comments. After that, Manny Diaz, DeSantis’ top education official, eventually took the reigns of UWF as an interim president and now is interested in the permanent job.
Other recent presidential searches, shrouded in secrecy, have stirred up some alumni at Florida A&M University, UWF, New College of Florida, and FIU, who’ve cried about politically-connected people being named president.
FAMU stakeholders protested Marva Johnson being named its next president. She is a political appointee of former Gov. Rick Scott and DeSantis. New College of Florida was the first university made-over with DeSantis’ brush, when former House Speaker Richard Corcoran was put at the helm in 2023.
But Collins says he has no worries there will be any external interference with the future of FSU’s leadership.
“I have no concern on that at all for Florida State or President McCullough. He’s done a fantastic job, everybody in state government, I think, recognizes that. Certainly the BOG recognizes that. It’s a big job, right?” Collins said. “And he’s the perfect person for it right now. So I don’t anticipate any outside factors or outside influences affecting certainly our decision over the next year and certainly our decision to take him to the BOG for his one-year extension.”
McCullough, through a university spokesperson, declined to discuss his future at FSU.
The deets
McCullough in August was awarded a pay raise, now putting his salary at $1.25 million. He also was given a positive performance review  that included a $567,000 one-time bonus. His initial 2021 contract provided him a $700,000 base salary.
The president laid out his goals for the year at the Oct. 31 FSU Board of Trustees meeting, which included a focus on national rankings, research and entrepreneurial excellence, as well as athletics and community engagement.
McCullough isn’t the only university president whose contract is set to expire in 2026. Florida Gulf Coast University’s President Aysegul Timur’s contract expires June, 30 2026. That university has been among the lowest scoring SUS institution in performance based metrics in recent years.

This is not a time for celebration but a time for a solid grounding on what must be done to make the lives of the people of our nation and in our state better.
Connecticut Democrats, with their majority, could take to truly “make peoples lives better,” guided by the identified issues like affordability (housing, healthcare, childcare), economic opportunity, and equity.

Keith Denning
As often attributed to Einstein: “We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.” The goal is not to simply resist or to revert to a pre-Trump status quo, it’s to innovate a better Connecticut. A majority that fails to make lives measurably better is a majority that has failed the people.
The real crisis: affordability and opportunity. These are the things that Democrats must address solidly with their majority.
Housing is the top concern. While we are in need of almost a hundred thousand affordable housing units, the crisis isn’t just about finding a home; it’s about housing costs eating up money for groceries and medicine.
Healthcare: Democrats must hold the line to maintain and expand affordable healthcare subsidies (like the ACA enhancements), and the high number of residents still worried about medical debt. The move to a single-payer system is gaining support across the country and Connecticut should be a leader in the movement.
Childcare: Quality childcare costs is an economic blocker for both families and the state. Expensive childcare prevents skilled workers (especially women) from returning to the workforce, hurting both families and the economy.
The irony of wealth: Acknowledge Connecticut’s wealth, but point out the glaring income and wealth disparities. The status quo is only working for the privileged few. The richest 5% of households have incomes 14.1 times higher than the bottom 20% of households. Fairfield County exhibits some of the worst income inequality in the country, with average incomes in the top 1% of the country being 73.7 times higher that the bottom 99%. Increasing taxes on incomes over a million dollars would supply the financial means to address many of the concerns of our affordability crisis.
Reimagine housing and zoning. Move beyond vetoes.
The problem: Local zoning restrictions drive up costs and concentrate opportunity. The new thinking: The vetoed housing bill (HB 5002) had strong public support. The new majority must re-engage with courage. Pass state-level zoning reform that mandates a minimum density or affordable unit allocation in all towns, leveraging state resources for sewers and water and other infrastructure and provide funding for compliance rather than just punishment. Focus on allowing more housing types (like multi-family and accessory dwelling units) near transit and job centers.
Guaranteeing affordable health coverage (Expanding the safety net.)
The problem: Even with subsidies, costs for many middle-class families are crushing. The new thinking: Don’t just fight to preserve expiring federal benefits; build a sustainable state model. Aggressively pursue policies to lower prescription drug costs by pooling state agency purchasing power or creating a state-based bulk purchasing program (like the ArrayRx model). Expand the definition of emergency Medicaid coverage to bridge gaps for vulnerable populations. 
Catalytic investment in the workforce (beyond minimum wage.)
The problem: Businesses cite a lack of skilled workers, and families are squeezed by childcare costs. 
The new thinking: Connect the workforce pipeline directly to family stability. Don’t just raise the minimum wage; make a massive investment in childcare subsidies and educator wages to lower costs for parents and stabilize the childcare workforce. Simultaneously, create new incentives for trade/technical schools to train residents for Connecticut’s high-demand, high-benefit jobs, creating a clear path to the middle class.
The Democratic majority has and for many yeas has had the power it needs to make changes that matter however the leadership of the legislature and the governor has preferred to go slow and with measure. There is no longer time to make small changes. The Democrats are no longer an underdog or a reactionary force. They must be an innovative force. Failure is not just political —it means Connecticut continues to be a great state to leave for young families and a hard state to retire in.
When I ran for office and won the 42nd State House district in 2022, I was alarmed and saddened by how poorly the party used their majority to make significant changes due to concerns that they would overreach to make significant changes that would make peoples lives better in the state. They could have used the rule of ‘call the question’ (also called the nuclear option) to end debate that stymied time constraints the Republican use to stop legislation passing but never chose to. I think they forgot that the nuclear power doesn’t always blow things up but also creates energy. 
I challenge Democrats both in the legislature and in our towns and cities to use their majority to prove that the thinking that got them elected (running against chaos) is not the thinking that will define their governance but bold, tangible improvement.
They must prove a majority means actual change that puts money back in people’s pockets and makes Connecticut a genuinely affordable, opportunity-rich state for all its residents.

Soaring electricity costs have put enormous pressure on political leaders to cut costs and help justifiably angry customers. New England states routinely finish behind only Hawaii and California when it comes to the cost of electricity.
The reasons for our soaring costs are complicated. We’re not going to solve them with simplistic solutions – no matter how tempting it may be to opt for what is sold as a quick fix.
And that’s what fossil fuel advocates are doing right now – telling us all our problems will go away with one short-term fix: burning more gas. In questionable surveys, hardball Hartford lobbying, and a barrage of media stories, these advocates are pushing Connecticut leaders to build gas pipelines and use more fossil fuels.
We have to pause when paid advocates for fossil fuels call for more oil, coal, or gas. We must question the long-term overall cost and damage of what they are pushing.
Former Congressman Tim Ryan of Ohio is working in Connecticut on behalf of fossil fuel companies that want expanded gas pipelines and more fossil fuels as a solution to high energy costs. The problem? There’s a lot of evidence that Connecticut’s electricity rates are high because the region is heavily dependent on natural gas. The price of gas fluctuates with supply and demand, with war and global turmoil. It is delivered in pipelines that leak and require repair and replacement and burned in power plants that pollute our air. Those charges are all passed on to consumers.
The former Ohio congressman also cites a study paid for by fossil fuel advocates Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future (NACEF), a group funded in part by companies that build gas pipelines. The study claims popular support for more gas and pipelines. According to that survey, 80 percent of Connecticut residents want the state to burn more gas.
According to a survey not funded by the gas industry, 88 percent of Connecticut residents believe climate change is a real problem, 87 percent want more solar power, and 74 percent want more offshore wind.
To their credit, Ryan and NACEF do call on Connecticut to get more clean energy – they just want us to build more pipelines and burn more gas while that happens. Unfortunately, that risks locking us into years of higher electric bills.
A thoughtful look at the pitfalls of Connecticut increasing gas use by Kat Burnham of Advanced Energy United highlights why gas is a bad deal for our region. Connecticut ranks fourth in America for miles of old pipe needing attention. Massachusetts has had to spend $6 million a mile to replace or fix their old pipes, and the price of gas overall has doubled in the last year. New pipelines take years or even decades to pay off, and customers will have them on their bills for years. Once we have invested that much to repair, replace, expand and build gas pipelines, the industry will have a hold on us: You are paying for our pipes anyway, you should use them to burn more gas.
The worst part? That path will certainly slow down and maybe stop the near-term solution to our electricity problems – more solar, wind, and battery storage. Land-based wind and utility-scale solar are the most economical near-term options and should be prioritized.Calls to build pipelines and burn more gas are part and parcel of an agenda being driven by the Trump administration to gut renewable energy projects, kill local jobs, and slow our buildout of clean sources of power.
So why are Democrats like Tim Ryan parroting Trump’s fossil fuel propaganda? Connecticut doesn’t need more of the same tired talking points from oil-funded campaigns. We need leaders who listen to us: the people who live here, who pay the bills here, who want to power our future with energy that’s affordable and clean.
If we allow gas interests to sell us miles of new or expanded pipes, it will commit us to a future of uncertainties and soaring costs, rob us of local jobs and local energy, and pump out more pollution. There is no question that we’ll continue using gas for some time as we transition to cleaner sources of energy, but simply buying more and increasing our reliance is a false solution —today and for our future.

This included a recommitment to high-dosage tutoring, with increased funding for this Covid-recovery response.
The state also invested in more professional development for educators to implement best practice literacy plans in all districts, so that every student becomes a lifelong reader. Under the clear-eyed leadership of the Education Committee, the General Assembly crossed some important things off their to-do list. But key pieces addressing educational equity were left for another day.

Steven Hernandez
At ConnCAN, we recently launched a new, interactive map as a tool to help families, educators, policymakers, and state leaders visualize the current state of educational opportunity in Connecticut. 
Our geographical borders tell a stark story of inequitable access to learning, despite our ongoing efforts to build a more just learning landscape. For example, in Bridgeport, where 27% of students are Black and 61% are Hispanic, only 16% of students are on track according to the statewide assessment in Math. Right next door, in Fairfield, which is primarily white, 72% of students meet that benchmark. That’s just one of myriad examples of educational inequity. As our map makes clear: we have unfinished business in public education.
This week, legislators reconvene for a special session which should include several bills and promises made to students last year. These items built broad consensus, promised real impact and nearly crossed the finish line earlier in the year.
Of those items left behind, legislators should pass measures to increase language access for families navigating their children’s academic journeys. They should also open pathways for prospective educators in Connecticut, so all kids can have a qualified teacher to meet their needs. 
In 2023, advocates helped pass a Multilingual Learner Bill of Rights in Connecticut, ensuring that the rights of students and parents are protected and are shared in a families’ dominant language. Two bills that would have increased access and transparency for the families of multilingual learners stalled this year.H.B. 6477 would have required the state to make plans to translate government forms and applications into common non-English languages in Connecticut. Relatedly, H.B. 7009 would have expanded Connecticut’s public school information system to include data on the academic progress of students in bilingual education programs.
Connecticut prides itself on welcoming linguistic and cultural diversity, so families shouldn’t have to wait for these expanded protections and opportunities. Advancing these proactive measures in a special session would acknowledge the strengths that multilingual residents bring to Connecticut.
We all feel the impact of teacher shortages. S.B. 1513 would have addressed them by creating incentives for aspiring educators, making them eligible for existing teacher recruitment scholarship funds, teacher residency programs, recruitment grants, and loan reimbursements. It would have specifically expanded incentives for teacher candidates in shortage areas, or candidates who fall into underrepresented populations. Our failure to broaden eligibility keeps too many prospective Connecticut educators without a clear path to the classroom. We can fix this in a special session.
These aren’t abstract ideas. Language access helps families understand available services and opportunities, and to advocate effectively for their children. Stronger pipelines mean qualified teachers in front of students who need them most. Together with the state’s investments in high-dosage tutoring and literacy professional learning, they form a coherent approach: identify needs early, communicate clearly, support teachers, and deliver effective interventions.
While we understand that a special session is a limited opportunity to find consensus and pass legislation, we know that Connecticut students, families, and educators should not be moved off the agenda once again. Let’s use this special session to finish what we started: pass language-access and transparency for multilingual families; strengthen the teacher pipeline; and keep building a public-education system in which every student, no matter their address, has a fair shot at success.

Candidates and Democratic officials spoke Sunday about the importance of the 2026 elections at the Iowa Democratic Party’s Liberty and Justice Dinner in Des Moines. They also talked about the problems caused by the current government shutdown, which reached day 40 on Sunday.
The shutdown has largely centered on the extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits. Democrats and health care advocates have said the scheduled end of these tax credits would lead to premiums doubling for people who receive health insurance through Affordable Care Act Marketplaces.

However, some Democrats at the Iowa event criticized U.S. Senate Democrats for potentially ending their effort to extend these tax credits and pass a continuing resolution to fund the government. Nathan Sage, a Democratic U.S. Senate candidate who is a military veteran and former Knoxville chamber of commerce executive director, told the crowd he was “flustered” while giving his address because he was “just hearing that we might end this shutdown and not have a deal for those ACA tax credits.”
“Millions of Americans are going to lose their health care,” Sage said. “Millions of Americans are not going to know what to do. ”
He attributed economic concerns to Democratic wins in the Nov. 4 elections across the country. “And if anything, we learned anything from Tuesday night, it’s that people need affordability. People need a life where they can actually make it in this world. People need a life where they can actually afford the food and afford the health care they need. And it seems like we don’t have leadership that’s willing to fight for that.”
Senate Majority Leader John Thune promised Senate Democrats a vote in December on the ACA subsidies in order to end the shutdown.
Deal to end shutdown gains traction in US Senate as vote nears

Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said she thought it was “difficult” to trust Republicans in promising to hold a vote on the issue.
“I have a hard time trusting that, you know, I think that they’re going to have to have some kind of guarantees that there’s actually going to be some kind of a vote, some kind of a movement,” Hart said. “Because they’ve had a long, long time … So for them to promise things without a real, concrete way to cash in on that, I think that’s really difficult.”
State Sen. Zach Wahls, who is also running for U.S. Senate, released a statement Sunday, saying “Senate Democrats shouldn’t cave — when working families’ health care is on the line, you fight.” Wahls also brought up Senate Democratic leadership in his remarks. While he did not directly address the shutdown agreement, he said he would push back against Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other Democrats’ views on states like Iowa.
“Some of the toughest fights are about the future of our own party,” Wahls said during his speech Sunday. “I will never hesitate to challenge Democratic leaders like Chuck Schumer, who said that we should write off blue-collar voters in rural America. He was wrong, but we are the ones paying the price. And that is exactly why Iowa needs a senator who doesn’t work for Chuck Schumer, or for Donald Trump or the billionaires. We need a senator who works for us.”
State Rep. Josh Turek, also a U.S. Senate candidate, released a statement Sunday, saying “health care is worth fighting for.”
“As the cost of everything goes up, Washington Republicans have proven time and time again that they’d rather cut taxes for billionaires,” Turek said. “Without ACA subsidies, 125,000 Iowans will see their premiums double or triple. No one in the richest country on Earth should have to choose between health care and putting food on the table. No protection for health care, no deal.”
Turek said at the event that as a person born with spina bifida who uses a wheelchair, he understands the fight for health care in a “very deep and personal way.” He said he believes “health care is a human right,” and pointed to former U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin, who was in attendance at the Sunday event, as a key inspiration for his work on the Americans with Disabilities Act.
“I will tell you, it is going to be something that’s going to be beautifully poetic, that the man that is going to get Sen. Harkin’s seat back is only there because of his work on the American with Disabilities Act, and once again be a champion for the people,” Turek said.
The three Democratic candidates are competing for the seat currently held by U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, who announced in September she will not run for reelection. U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson has launched a campaign to become the Republican candidate for the seat and gained endorsements from President Donald Trump and several GOP congressional leaders.
U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat who took office in 2020, was scheduled to speak at the event, but was not able to attend. The U.S. Senate was in session Sunday, ending the day with a tentative deal to pass appropriations bills and end the government shutdown.
Kelly said in video remarks played at the event that he remained in Washington, D.C. this weekend “trying to find solutions, but it’s not easy when one chamber of Congress isn’t even here,” including Iowa’s all-Republican House delegation.
“That’s not what our leaders should be doing when millions of Americans are being hit with unaffordable increases to their health care premiums,” Kelly said. “I’m frustrated too, but that’s something we can change. We saw it start to change this week in Virginia, in New Jersey and in California, by people speaking up, not checking out, by getting loud, not giving up.”
Hart said she was sad Kelly was not able to come to Iowa, but said she was happy he was “working hard in D.C. to put an end to this shutdown.”
“As you know, Sen. Kelly’s leadership is quite different from what we’ve been seeing from Iowa’s Republican representatives, who have been on an eight-week vacation while children and families are struggling to put food on their tables,” Hart said.
The shutdown will not end with the Senate vote, as the U.S. House must still return to approve the measure. One of the largest impacts of the continued shutdown is the disruption of food benefits provided through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
While the court battle continues on whether the Trump administration must pay November SNAP benefits, U.S. Department of Agriculture officials wrote in a Saturday memo states should only fund 65% of food stamps. States that have already authorized full payments should “immediately undo” this action, the memo stated.
In addition to speaking on the impacts of cutting SNAP benefits, Democrats solicited donations for the Food Bank of Iowa at the event, raising more than $2,700. Hart also called for attendees to participate in the state Democratic Party’s day of action to support the Food Bank of Iowa later in November and thanked county Democratic parties for their advocacy and work to address food insecurity in their communities during the shutdown.
The state party was also soliciting support and funds for Democratic candidates running in 2026 Sunday. Hart joked there was not enough time to hear from all the Democratic candidates running for Iowa statewide and federal offices at the event, saying “isn’t that a great problem to have?” Videos were shown from congressional candidates, while Democratic gubernatorial candidates Rob Sand and Julie Stauch, alongside the U.S. Senate hopefuls, spoke to the crowd in person Sunday night.
Former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, another Arizona Democrat, also spoke at the event. Giffords, who survived an assassination attempt in 2011, spoke about her recovery journey and struggles with paralysis and aphasia. She said where “words, today I struggled to speak, but I’ve not lost my voice.”
“America needs all of us to speak out, even when you have to fight to find the words,” she said.

Free.,US Senate advances bill to end record-breaking government shutdown,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-advances-bill-end-record-breaking-government-shutdown,,"This report has been updated.WASHINGTON — Seven U.S. Senate Democrats and one independent joined Republicans on Sunday night in advancing legislation to reopen the government and temporarily keep it afloat until the end of January, after a record-breaking shutdown that began Oct. 1.Democratic Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Tim Kaine of Virginia, and Catherine Cortez Masto and Jackie Rosen of Nevada voted with most of the GOP to advance the stopgap measure through a 60-40 procedural vote. Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, also voted in support.  Fetterman, King and Cortez Masto had already voted with Republicans on the previous 14 votes to reopen the government. Until Sunday, Republicans who control the chamber did not have the 60 votes needed to clear the filibuster threshold.GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has consistently voted against the temporary funding measure, again cast a “no” vote.The deal would also unlock full-year funding for a vital food aid program that serves 42 million Americans and bring back federal workers fired by President Donald Trump when the government was closed.It does not include language addressing skyrocketing premiums for those enrolled in individual health insurance plans in the Affordable Care Act marketplace, a major sticking point for Democrats. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said late Sunday on the Senate floor that he commits to holding a separate vote on health insurance subsidies no later than the second week of December.

In a press conference following the vote, Rosen said Democrats have “an opportunity also to put Republicans on the record on the ACA.”“Are they committed to doing this? Are they committed leaders who said, ‘You can come to the table on health care once the government was open’? And now he must follow through. If Republicans want to join us in lowering costs for working families, they have the perfect opportunity to show the American public,” Rosen said.New text of a temporary stopgap funding deal released Sunday night proposes to keep the government open until Jan. 30. The bill would also reinstate all federal employees who were fired after the shutdown began, restoring their jobs with back pay, and prohibit any further layoffs until the temporary funding expires.As part of the agreement, three fiscal year 2026 funding bills will ride along with the package, including the appropriations bills for agriculture programs, veterans benefits, military construction and Congress.Divided DemocratsSeveral Senate Democrats left a lengthy closed-door meeting earlier Sunday night upset that the deal does not include anything to address rising health care premiums, on which the party has staked the 40-day shutdown. Subsidies for those who buy insurance on the Affordable Care Act insurance marketplace expire at the end of this year.""So far as I'm concerned, health care isn't included, so I'll be a no,"" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.Sens. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Wisconsin’s Tammy Baldwin also issued statements following the caucus meeting declaring they would vote no. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer also told reporters on his way out of the meeting that he’s opposed to the deal.Sen. Andy Kim of New Jersey said on social media he would oppose it. ”I’ve been clear that we need real action to stop the devastating health care cost increases that are hurting millions of families,” he said.Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., issued a statement expressing support for the agreement, highlighting that Senate Republicans have promised a vote on extending the health care subsidies.“This deal guarantees a vote to extend Affordable Care Act premium tax credits, which Republicans weren’t willing to do. Lawmakers know their constituents expect them to vote for it, and if they don’t, they could very well be replaced at the ballot box by someone who will,” Kaine said.Government reopening will take timeThe Sunday night vote does not mean the government will reopen right away.The legislation must make its way through Senate procedural steps and then gain approval from the U.S. House, which hasn’t been in session since Sept. 19. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, attended the Washington Commanders football game with Trump Sunday night in Landover, Maryland.Trump briefly spoke to reporters upon news of the deal after leaving the NFL game, telling them, “It looks like we’re getting very close to the shutdown ending.”Nearly a million federal workers have missed paychecks during the shutdown, and food benefits for the poorest Americans stopped flowing at the beginning of November. Air travel has also become snarled as the shutdown has dragged on, and air traffic controllers are under pressure without pay. The Federal Aviation Administration began cutting flights Friday at 40 major airports across the U.S. The cuts are set to ramp up to a 10% decrease in air traffic.SNAP fundingThe deal includes provisions that Democrats say the Trump administration sought to shrink or cut altogether, including fresh fruit and vegetable subsidies for mothers with children and monthly food boxes for low-income seniors.The legislation would direct $8.2 billion to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, otherwise known as WIC, a roughly $600 million increase over last year’s program amount.During the shutdown, the administration used $150 million from a U.S. Department of Agriculture rainy day fund to keep the program going. The bill would replenish the contingency money.The bill also fully funds the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and children’s nutrition programs, including subsidized school breakfast and lunch, and the availability of food during summer school breaks.Democrats on the Senate Committee on Appropriations say it included “key funding for SNAP and other critical nutrition programs as President Trump fights in court during the government shutdown to cut off benefits for 42 million Americans who rely on SNAP to feed their families,” according to a bill summary. The USDA directed states to begin releasing the November SNAP benefits onto recipients’ benefits debit cards after a Rhode Island federal district judge and circuit court ordered the Trump administration to do so last week. Trump appealed the order to the Supreme Court, which stayed the decision.

,DC,2025-11-10 01:18:16+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Deal to end shutdown gains traction in US Senate as vote nears,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/deal-end-shutdown-gains-traction-us-senate-vote-nears,,"WASHINGTON — A deal was within reach Sunday night to end the longest federal government shutdown in history, when it appeared enough U.S. Senate Democrats had agreed to join Republicans to temporarily keep the government afloat until the end of January.The legislation to be voted on by the Senate would also unlock full-year funding for a vital food aid program that serves 42 million Americans and bring back federal workers fired by President Donald Trump when the government was closed.It does not include language addressing skyrocketing premiums for those enrolled in individual health insurance plans in the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, a major sticking point for Democrats.  Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said late Sunday on the Senate floor that he commits to holding a separate vote on health insurance subsidies no later than the second week of December.New text of a temporary stopgap funding deal released Sunday night would keep the government open until Jan. 30. The bill would also reinstate all federal employees who were fired after the shutdown began, restoring their jobs with back pay, and prohibit any further layoffs until the temporary funding expires.As part of the agreement, three fiscal year 2026 funding bills will ride along with the package, including the appropriations bills for agriculture programs, veterans benefits, military construction and Congress.Divided DemocratsSeveral Senate Democrats left a lengthy closed-door meeting Sunday night upset that the deal does not include anything to address rising health care premiums, on which the party has staked the 40-day shutdown. Subsidies for those who buy insurance on the Affordable Care Act insurance marketplace expire at the end of this year.""So far as I'm concerned, health care isn't included, so I'll be a no,"" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.Sens. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Wisconsin’s Tammy Baldwin also issued statements following the caucus meeting declaring they would vote no. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer also told reporters on his way out of the meeting that he’s opposed to the deal.Sen. Andy Kim of New Jersey said on social media he would oppose it. ”I’ve been clear that we need real action to stop the devastating health care cost increases that are hurting millions of families,” he said.The Senate was expected to take a procedural vote to advance the deal Sunday night.Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., issued a statement expressing support for the agreement, highlighting that Senate Republicans have promised a vote on extending the health care subsidies.“This deal guarantees a vote to extend Affordable Care Act premium tax credits, which Republicans weren’t willing to do. Lawmakers know their constituents expect them to vote for it, and if they don’t, they could very well be replaced at the ballot box by someone who will,” Kaine said.Government reopening will take timeThe Sunday night deal, if senators vote to advance it, does not mean the government will reopen right away.The legislation must make its way through Senate procedural steps and then gain approval from the U.S. House, which hasn’t been in session since Sept. 19. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, attended the Washington Commanders football game with Trump Sunday night in Landover, Maryland.Trump briefly spoke to reporters upon news of the deal after leaving the NFL game, telling them, “It looks like we’re getting very close to the shutdown ending.”Nearly a million federal workers have missed paychecks during the 40-day shutdown, and food benefits for the poorest Americans stopped flowing at the beginning of November. Air travel has also become snarled as the shutdown has dragged on, and air traffic controllers are under pressure without pay. The Federal Aviation Administration began cutting flights Friday at 40 major airports across the U.S. The cuts are set to ramp up to a 10% decrease in air traffic.SNAP fundingThe deal includes provisions that Democrats say the Trump administration sought to shrink or cut altogether, including fresh fruit and vegetable subsidies for mothers with children and monthly food boxes for low-income seniors.The legislation would direct $8.2 billion to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, otherwise known as WIC, a roughly $600 million increase over last year’s program amount.During the shutdown, the administration used $150 million from a U.S. Department of Agriculture rainy day fund to keep the program going. The bill would replenish the contingency money.The bill also fully funds the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and children’s nutrition programs, including subsidized school breakfast and lunch, and the availability of food during summer school breaks.Democrats on the Senate Committee on Appropriations say it included “key funding for SNAP and other critical nutrition programs as President Trump fights in court during the government shutdown to cut off benefits for 42 million Americans who rely on SNAP to feed their families,” according to a bill summary. The USDA directed states to begin releasing the November SNAP benefits onto recipients’ benefits debit cards after a Rhode Island federal district judge and circuit court ordered the Trump administration to do so last week. Trump appealed the order to the Supreme Court, which stayed the decision.

(Photo by Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)A small crowd demonstrated at the entrance to Centennial Airport on Sunday, protesting Colorado-based Key Lime Air over its operation of detainee transport flights for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Outside the regional Arapahoe County airport where Key Lime Air is headquartered, a few dozen picketers who began gathering just after noon held signs, chanted anti-ICE slogans and heard music from “protest marching band” Notes of Dissent. The demonstration drew shouts and honks of support from passing cars.
“This is my community, and we don’t condone what’s happening, the cruelty that’s taking place,” Alejandra Correa-Weir, a Centennial resident and protest organizer, said in an interview. “Key Lime is taking a profit out of the cruelty and harm that is being done to the immigrant community.”

Key Lime’s operation of ICE flights was first reported by Newsline last month. Since mid-September, two of the airline’s planes have frequently flown routes to and from ICE detention hubs in Texas, Louisiana and elsewhere, according to a Newsline analysis of publicly available flight tracking data. That included at least nine flights in and out of Lake City, Florida — a 15-minute drive from the Everglades detention center that Republicans have branded “Alligator Alcatraz.”
Key Lime’s ICE flights involve the transportation of dozens of detainees who are loaded on and off planes in shackles, with their personal belongings apparently collected in white trash bags, according to scenes witnessed by Newsline reporters. Advocates say ICE’s pattern of moving people across the country in these “shuffle flights” can harm detainees’ mental health, family connections and access to legal services.

“Key Lime Air respects the right of all individuals to peacefully protest and share their opinions,” Cliff Honeycutt, the company’s CEO, wrote in a text message. “As a matter of policy, we are unable to discuss our charter operations. Our focus remains on conducting ALL Key Lime Air flights in accordance with the highest federally mandated safety standards.”
Key Lime, which also operates passenger flights through its subsidiary Denver Air Connection, is part of a growing network of operators participating in immigration enforcement, especially flights between ICE detention centers throughout the country.
The 83 ICE flights operated by Key Lime in September, as counted by the nonprofit Human Rights First, were among the record-high 969 domestic immigration enforcement flights compiled in its monthly ICE Flight Monitor report.
“The increase in domestic shuffle flights under the second Trump administration raises serious concerns as individuals are frequently moved far from their families and legal representation, often isolated in facilities with harsh conditions,” the report’s authors wrote.
In his second term, President Donald Trump has pledged to carry out the “largest domestic deportation operation in American history,” aiming to remove all of the estimated 12 million immigrants in the country without permanent legal status, regardless of how long they have been in the country, the legal status of their family members or whether they have criminal records.
Polls have shown that the number of Americans who approve of Trump’s handling of immigration issues has declined in 2025, amid an aggressive expansion of ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection operations in cities including Los Angeles and Chicago. Correa-Weir said the supportive shouts and honks from cars passing Sunday’s protest were a sign that growing numbers of people in communities like Centennial are “willing to stand up to what’s happening.”
“It speaks to the amount of people that are not okay with what’s happening to our immigrant community,” said Correa-Weir. “The majority of people … are with us, and they don’t want this happening at all.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Maine is going to press ahead this week with its plan to deliver full food assistance benefits for November, despite the Trump administration’s changing guidance on the program that helps feed 170,000 low income people in the state.
Late Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court paused a lower court order for the U.S. Department of Agriculture to release full funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. 
Before the high court weighed in, Gov. Janet Mills had already announced that the Maine Department of Health and Human Services would issue full November SNAP benefits to eligible households, in accordance with guidance released by the USDA before the pause.
According to the governor, DHHS then directed the state’s SNAP distribution vendor to issue full benefits on Monday, Nov. 10. 
But over the weekend, the USDA Food and Nutrition Service changed course, issuing a memo ordering states that already authorized full SNAP payments to return a portion and fund 65% of the month’s benefits.
“The Trump administration pledged full benefits, and Maine took swift action to deliver them accordingly,” said Mills in a statement Sunday. 
“That the President would then petition the highest court to deny food to hungry families and seniors is beyond belief and is callous and cruel,” she continued. “The President should not be directing states to take food out of the mouths of the hungry. He should be directing Republicans in Congress to end this needless shutdown by extending health care tax credits and reopening the government.”
The statement from the governor’s office said the Mills administration expects full benefits to be issued Monday, despite the latest SNAP guidance from the USDA, which it notes “is the sixth such conflicting change to its guidance over the past month.”

Sarah Huckabee Sanders directed a second round of funds to Arkansas food banks on Saturday as drama continued over whether federal food assistance would be distributed.
On Oct. 31, the governor announced she was splitting $500,000 among six food banks and held open the option of distributing more money each week as the federal shutdown drags on.
Federal food assistance benefits have been delayed as the Trump administration fights federal court orders mandating that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program be fully funded.
On Friday, several states began filling SNAP recipients’ electronic accounts with November’s benefits. But the Supreme Court granted a delay in enforcing a lower court order, and Saturday the U.S. Department of Agriculture ordered states that paid full benefits to “undo” the action.
About 42 million Americans receive federal food aid, among them roughly 240,000 Arkansans.
Sanders said in a press release Saturday that the latest $500,000 will be distributed Monday to the Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance, which will then distribute the funds to the six Feeding America member food banks around the state, serving the highest SNAP recipient regions first.
The funds come from the state’s Restricted Reserve account, which the chairs of the Arkansas Legislative Council approved on an emergency basis.
The food banks that will receive portions of the the funds are:

Northwest Arkansas Food Bank at Springdale
Food Bank of North Central Arkansas at Norfolk
Food Bank of Northeast Arkansas at Jonesboro

Free.,States told by Trump administration to 'undo' full SNAP benefits paid for November,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/states-told-trump-administration-undo-full-snap-benefits-paid-november,,"Following a late Friday emergency ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court, the Trump administration has instructed states that authorized full November nutrition assistance benefits to return a portion, another unprecedented reversal for a program that helps 42 million people afford groceries.A Saturday memo from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service said states should fund 65% of benefits for users of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, often called food stamps. Those that had authorized full payments in line with earlier administration guidance should “immediately undo” that action, according to the memo.“To the extent States sent full SNAP payment files for November 2025, this was unauthorized,” the memo said. “Accordingly, States must immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits for November 2025. Please advise the appropriate FNS Regional Office representative of steps taken to correct any actions taken that do not comply with this memorandum.”President Donald Trump and top administration officials have said they cannot pay full SNAP benefits during the government shutdown that began Oct. 1 and instead, under court orders, are using a contingency fund to make partial payments.Shutdown chaos surrounds SNAPSaturday’s guidance from Patrick A. Penn, the department’s deputy under secretary for food, nutrition and consumer services, marked the latest turnaround in a chaotic few days for the agency, states that administer SNAP and the millions of Americans who depend on it to afford food.Penn wrote that, in light of the Supreme Court’s order pausing lower court rulings that USDA must pay full November benefits, the administration was returning to its position that SNAP benefits should be funded at 65%. States — including Wisconsin and Kansas — that issued full benefits did so under a Friday memo, also signed by Penn, that said states should authorize full payments for SNAP, consistent with a Thursday ruling in federal court.Kansas gov expresses dismayKansas Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, in a late Friday statement expressed disappointment with the administration’s appeal to the Supreme Court and noted the state had authorized full payments earlier in the day for all eligible Kansans.“These Kansans, most of them children, seniors or people with disabilities, were struggling to put food on their plates,” she said. “Why the President would petition the highest court to deny food to hungry children is beyond me. It does nothing to advance his political agenda. It does not hurt his perceived enemies. It only hurts our most vulnerable and our reputation around the globe.”The earlier order, from U.S. District Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. in Rhode Island, told the department to use sources outside the contingency fund to make full November payments by Friday. The order was appealed to the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.But Justice Kentanji Brown Jackson, acting on behalf of the high court, granted the administration's request for an emergency stay on Friday night, speeding up the process for what Jackson said would then be an “expeditious” decision by the appeals court but also changing things yet again.No longer, for the moment, required by a court order to pay full November benefits, the administration instructed states in the Saturday memo to have the vendors that process payments to the electronic benefit transfer cards withhold part of the month's allotment.“States must not transmit full benefit issuance files to EBT processors,” Penn wrote. “Instead, States must continue to process and load the partial issuance files that reflect the 35 percent reduction of maximum allotments detailed in the November 5 guidance.”Kansas Reflector Editor in Chief Sherman Smith contributed to this report.",,,,2025-11-09 12:56:47.657597

(Photo by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Five tribes in South Dakota want their congressional delegation to help restore funding for a research project led in part by a South Dakota genetics lab.
The back-and-forth that’s played out over the past few weeks for the Data for Indigenous Implementations, Interventions, and Innovations Tribal Data Repository project is the latest twist in a funding tale that’s stretched across two presidential administrations and speaks to deep-seeded distrust — and attempts to address it — of the scientific community by Native American leaders.
At the center of those conversations is the Native BioData Consortium, a nonprofit science organization and laboratory based in Eagle Butte, on the Cheyenne River Reservation. It’s the data host and one of the lead agencies in the repository project, whose National Institutes of Health funding was cut short in March, alongside a host of other research projects related to COVID-19. 
Leaders from the Oglala, Cheyenne River, Rosebud, Lower Brule and Standing Rock Sioux tribes in South Dakota each sent letters to U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson’s office urging him to help reinstate funding for the repository.
The project was “collateral damage in a blanket cut to all COVID-19 research,” the letters say, but its goals and value were further-reaching.
The Eagle Butte lab got the largest share of the project’s $7 million in research funding, which was split among multiple teams scattered around the U.S. The lab’s team only used about a third of its approximately $3 million share before the funding was revoked this spring.
The repository project, the letters say, “is an innovative and very needed attempt to protect Tribal communities now and in all future pandemics, and also to create a bridge of diplomatic relationships with Tribes over biomedical, public health, environmental research data and beyond.” 
The tribes’ letters were sent in tandem with a similar letter from the project’s leaders.
Tribal data repository concept
One of those leaders, Joseph Yracheta, is a co-founder and executive director of the Native BioData Consortium. His lab performs genetic testing and catalogs genetic data for tribal nations, leads genetics bootcamps for Native American students each year, and hopes to one day open a large-scale genetics facility and data center on Cheyenne River tribal land.
It’s also the data archive for the multi-state, multi-partner tribal data repository project. That project’s goals include the creation of a secure, Indigenous-led and centrally located database of tribal health and genetic information that would afford tribes the ability to control the flow and terms of use for their citizens’ data in scientific research.

Yracheta, who lives in Eagle Butte, is of P’urhépecha and Rarámurì descent, tribes located in areas now part of Mexico. His wife and children are members of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe.
In addition to Yracheta, the project’s leadership team comes from the University of California-Santa Cruz, Arizona State University, the University of Wisconsin, the University of Washington and Ohio State University.
The COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affected tribal communities, but genetic data collection from tribal areas was spotty. 
Yracheta told South Dakota Searchlight that reticence to share information was in part grounded in a wariness by tribal governments to share genetic data without assurances that it wouldn’t be replicated and reused for non-COVID research without their consent.
A dispute between the Havasupai Tribe in Arizona and the Arizona Board of Regents, Yracheta said, is one of the most often-cited reasons for that reticence. In the mid-1990s, the tribe gave DNA samples to Arizona State University researchers for a study on diabetes. In 2003, a member of the tribe attending the school learned the DNA samples had been used to study things like schizophrenia, inbreeding and migration theories, which the tribe hadn’t consented to. The tribe sued, and was eventually awarded $700,000.
The data repository work, Yracheta said, would create a trusted place for tribes to share their data without fear of it being used in ways tribal members wouldn’t want.
“All we want to do is be a safe harbor,” Yracheta said.
Paper outlines strategies for improved relations
According to a recently published research letter in the journal Nature, penned by the tribal data repository project’s leaders, the scientific community has largely embraced a framework for DNA data that expects it to be free, open, harmonized and easily replicable for research purposes. 
Tribes, however, see problems with wholesale, unrestricted availability of DNA data. There are privacy concerns about mandated open data policies and concerns over the unrestricted use of data, the paper says. It cites the practice of private companies giving estimates of a person’s Native American ancestry that “undermine Tribal determinations of citizenship and override legally assured self-governance.”
“Decades of extractive and unethical practices have left Indigenous Peoples (distinct societies of Indigenous people) hesitant to engage with biomedical researchers despite remaining interested in biomedical advances,” the paper says.
There are also concerns that tribal genetic data would be used in the development of treatments that benefit primarily non-Native populations or generate profit the tribes wouldn’t see. 
The solution, the paper posits, is a framework for data sharing that creates a common access point for data, but treats tribal nations as sovereign entities and requires consultation and consent for data use.
The database framework would be useful for COVID-19 research, the paper says, but could serve as a basis for a wide range of genetic data research projects.
Battle for funds
The repository’s federal funding didn’t come easy, Yracheta said, and was threatened before President Donald Trump’s administration deprioritized COVID-related research.
The money came through a competitive bidding process in a National Institutes of Health initiative meant to build a database of basic genetic information from Native Americans for use in COVID-19 research.

The long application process included sparring with the NIH over the data ownership and access policies that would be attached to the finished product. The researchers were ultimately awarded $9 million in December of 2023 to create the repository and its associated protocols, including $2 million that went to Stanford University to serve as an administrator.
The repository work itself began in January of 2024, but Yracheta said the disputes with NIH leadership continued, in part over who would own the data and dictate its use. Within a few months of the funding announcement, the NIH shortened the project’s research timeline by a year and asked the team to wrap up by December 2025. 
Since then, the tribal data repository team has set up the storage and access system into which biological information would flow. Among the work products are 82 contract templates and related documents tribes can use when approached for genetic data, and educational materials on their data sharing options through the secure repository system. 
The team built model servers in Eagle Butte and Wisconsin and connected them to make sure there’s enough physical storage space to keep data safely out of the cloud, and developed a user interface to connect researchers with the contracts they’d need to sign with tribes to secure access to that data.
The next steps, Yracheta said, are to present the repository concept to tribes, convince leaders it’s a trustworthy place to share their information for the good of their own people and science as a whole, and to begin to fill it with data.
“We took the money and built the box, but we didn’t get to the important part, which was building those relationships,” Yracheta said. 
In June, the group presented its materials to the NIH, but was told no further funding would be available, Yracheta said, as COVID-19 related research had largely ceased.
Plea for help to Rep. Johnson, response from Sen. Rounds
The letters to Rep. Johnson, sent a little over a week ago, asked his office to work for the funding’s reinstatement. They suggested that funding a database project would serve South Dakotans as the federal government works to encourage the expansion of data centers and its residents’ expertise in database design and management. 
A spokeswoman for Johnson’s office, Kristen Blakely, told South Dakota Searchlight via email that the office is “looking into it and in contact with NIH to see why the grant was canceled.”
This week, Yracheta said, the team got some encouraging communication from the office of Sen. Mike Rounds, whose staff sent emails seeking more information about the history of the project’s funding.
Yracheta said the team hadn’t garnered any encouragement in its communications with South Dakota Republican Sen. John Thune. Neither senator got the letter sent to Johnson’s office. When asked about the letter by South Dakota Searchlight, Rounds spokeswoman Arden Koenecke said the senator had spoken about the repository in general terms with leaders of the Great Plains Tribal Leaders’ Health Board, but “didn’t get into specifics on cuts or locations.”
Rounds would be open to discussions on the issue, Koenecke said. Yracheta said the Rounds team contacted him this week.
Thune’s office did not respond to questions about the letter.

After a quarter century on the bench, Washington Supreme Court Justice Mary Yu is ready to slow down — to “sip coffee rather than gulp it,” as she puts it. The longtime jurist will retire at the end of this year, closing a trailblazing career.
From the King County Superior Court to the state’s highest bench, Yu said she found that justice often emerges from respectful clashes of perspective. “This is an adversarial process — you have to fight for how you think the law ought to be,” she told host Austin Jenkins in an “Inside Olympia“ interview on TVW. “When we differ, we are at our best.”
After 14 years on the King County Superior Court, Yu was appointed to the Washington Supreme Court by Gov. Jay Inslee in May 2014, becoming its first Asian American, Latina and openly gay justice. She went on to win elections in November 2014, 2016 and 2022, serving 12 years on the high court and 25 years on the bench overall.
Born on Chicago’s South Side to a Chinese father and a Mexican mother, Yu was the first in her family to attend college. Her path to law began at the Archdiocese of Chicago, where she joined the new Office of Peace and Justice as a secretary and later became its director. The work, focused on systemic social justice, shaped her understanding of inequality and change. “The law can bring about social change,” she said. “It creates, frankly, a cause of action if you’re discriminated against — a way to make justice real.”
Her legal outlook was further shaped by then–King County Prosecutor Norm Maleng, who hired her as his deputy chief of staff and later encouraged her sense of purpose in public service. Yu described Maleng as “the most ethical prosecutor one could ever know,” a mentor who taught her that “justice isn’t about convictions — it’s about doing what’s right.”
Yu carried that conviction from the courtroom to the Supreme Court. She pushes back against claims that the justices share a single ideological view. 
“I think we are very different in our views on a host of issues and how we approach a variety of topics, but we’re not ideologues, and that might be what some people are missing, and that, frankly, is a good thing.” she said. “Regardless of where we might be politically, personally, I can tell you that we are all over the place in that room. Those who think otherwise aren’t reading the opinions.”
Several cases stayed with her. She pointed to the case of Tarra Simmons — in which the court ruled that a past felony shouldn’t automatically bar someone from becoming a lawyer — as her favorite decision. “We said rehabilitation is real and possible,” Yu said. “There is hope for everybody who’s made a mistake.” Simmons is now a state legislator.
She also cited State v. Sum, which held that race must be considered when evaluating police stops, as an example of the court adapting to contemporary realities.
Earlier in her career, Yu became known for performing more than 1,000 same-sex adoptions and officiating one of Washington’s first same-sex marriages at the stroke of midnight when it became legal in 2012. Late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel included Yu in a 2021 segment about what he called “Perfectly Named People,” asking her whether when she officiates weddings, does she say, “I Mary Yu, marry you.” 
As she looks to retirement, Yu said she plans to volunteer, mentor young lawyers and continue “believing in the goodness of others.”
“Maybe my legacy,” she said, “is simply that I believed in the next generation.”

For Michiganders in rural communities, the realities of this disease are even more difficult because of distance, access, and limited resources.
A study from Washington State University found that rural residents often travel as much as 100 miles to see a neurologist qualified to diagnose Alzheimer’s or dementia. For families already balancing work, caregiving, and travel, these miles can mean delayed diagnoses and missed opportunities for care. As the nation faces a growing shortage of neurologists and a growing number of Alzheimer’s cases, these challenges are likely to intensify.
The need is urgent. Today, more than seven million Americans over the age of 65 are living with Alzheimer’s disease, and that number is rising quickly. Each day, an estimated 3,000 people advance beyond the stage when early treatment could help slow progression. For rural families, every mile and every month matter.
Today, care often involves lots of travel for PET scans, even spinal taps, after symptoms present – for too many patients, diagnosis comes too late. Patients too often have progressed past the window of early intervention.
Fortunately, science is opening new doors. Recent breakthroughs have led to FDA-approved therapies and detection tools for early-stages of the disease. This science could one day bring us to a reality where we identify Alzheimer’s via blood test, well before symptoms start, and then utilize a treatment that halts the disease in its tracks. Scientific advances have the potential to reduce disparities between rural and urban patients – if families can access them. And it’s a big “if.”
Right now, federal policies are creating obstacles. Medicare limits access to FDA-approved treatments through outdated “Coverage with Evidence Development” policies requiring participation in a special program called a registry. Absent action from Congress, Medicare won’t cover screening tools unless they have been recommended for coverage by the U.S.
Preventive Services Task Force – a review process that can take up to a decade or more. For rural patients, who are less likely to live near major health centers or clinical trials, these delays place needed care even further out of reach.
It doesn’t have to be this way. By modernizing coverage policies, ensuring timely access to diagnostic tests, and expanding availability of new treatments, policymakers can help families in every community benefit from today’s scientific progress.
In Michigan, rural communities form the heart of the state. Rural families deserve the same opportunity for timely diagnosis and treatment as those in urban centers. The National Association of Rural Health Clinics urges Congress and the administration to act now because when it comes to Alzheimer’s, every day of progress brings hope to millions of families, caregivers included.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/caregiver-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-09 11:17:09.813270

The Smyrna Eagles defeated Cape Henlopen, 1-0, in double overtime for the division one state championship title. The Wilmington Friends Quakers defeated Newark Charter, 2-0, in the division two championship game, November 7.
 
NEWARK — The bleachers at the University of Delaware’s Rullo Stadium were shaking with enthusiasm and cheer from fans of both Smyrna and Cape Henlopen as time dwindled down in the second overtime period. The game was a defensive battle throughout regulation and overtime. The excitement and tension from the sidelines to the stands was evident as Smyrna senior Bree Moffett dribbled the ball outside the striking circle. 
Moffett weaved her way through the Vikings’ seven on seven defense finding a bit of room in front of the goal. She took a quick peak at where the goalkeeper was and fired a back hand shot to the bottom left of the cage. The shot settled into the bottom left corner of the goal making the Eagles state champions for the second time in the last four years.
After seeing her shot go in, Moffett’s teammates ran onto the field in jubilation and the triumphant dogpile ensued.
“I think the best part was the cheering afterwards,” Moffett said postgame. “Everybody tackling you, you barely could breathe, you’re like wow oh my god. And you’re like, we did it, we earned it, and we worked hard enough to earn it.”

Moffett’s game winning goal was a bookend to an extremely balanced contest between a pair of really good teams. The defenses on both sides played well, stopping the offensive momentum of the opposition with key clears or saves. 
The Vikings generated one of the better scoring chances of the night at the end of regulation on a penalty corner from the left side of the cage. The Vikings passed it around the circle before sending a pass toward the back left of the goal, but the pass went a bit wide of the receiving player and the game went to overtime.  
In the overtime periods the defensive play reached an elite level.
With about four minutes to go in the second overtime period, the Vikings drove the ball into the striking circle trying to set up the game winning shot. The Eagles defense swarmed to the ball, but the Vikings were able to get off a shot leaving it up to junior Nora O’Connell in goal to make the save. O’Connell stepped up and booted the shot away with her right leg. Smyrna cleared the attack setting up Moffett’s game winning goal just a few minutes later. 
The Vikings’ defense made a bunch of similar plays in overtime including a chase down save by midfielder Avary Miller to break up a breakaway opportunity following Smyrna’s initial clearance. 
“It was a great [field] hockey game,” said Smyrna head coach Loveita Moffett. “And I think, you know, you can take a look at the stands and realize that people came to watch a really good game, and I think they got their money’s worth today.”
Moffett credited the evolution of the program’s culture as something she’ll remember from this group of girls and their 18-1 season. The coach said that she wanted to take their culture to the “next level” by adding aspects like gratitude, self reflection and accountability to the program’s culture. Moffett praised her team for their ability to embrace those cultural qualities. 
“That’s what I think I’ll remember, is that we had a good culture and we made it even better,” said Moffett.   
Wilmington Friends Scores Twice in State Championship Victory

NEWARK — The Quakers led by a goal as senior Molly Dolan dribbled down the left side of the field through the Patriot defense. Dolan traversed about three quarters of the field before settling inside the circle near the front left of the goal. 
The Quakers’ leading goal scorer found enough space to flip the ball past the Patriot defense and into the cage to give Friends a two goal lead before halftime. The Quakers’ defense took care of the rest. 
Wilmington Friends earned their first state championship title since 1986 with a 2-0 victory over Newark Charter, Friday, November 7. 
“This team has wanted to get that title for this program since they were freshman,” said Friends head coach Scott Clothier. “The school has a great legacy and history with field hockey and they wanted to continue that.”
The program came close to achieving the goal last year, but lost by a goal to Delmar in the championship game. This year the team relied on its defense to earn the division two state title.   
Friends’ defense was stout throughout its 14-1 regular season and its run through the playoffs. The Quakers allowed nine goals all season — three of which came in their only loss of the season to Tower Hill — and held each of their opponents scoreless in the postseason. Friends held 12 of its 18 opponents without a goal this season.  
That defensive effort was in full display throughout the championship game, especially in the second half.
Trailing by two scores, Newark Charter was aggressive on its attack working to cut the score in half. The Patriots aggressive approach led to eight penalties corners — most of them coming in the second half — providing good scoring opportunities late in the game. Friends’ defense stopped each potential scoring opportunity with contributions from the whole defense coming through in the game’s biggest moments.
“I couldn’t be more proud of them, the three defenders and our goaltender just really just executed when they needed to execute,” said Clothier.

Clothier said that the defense played with a high level of intelligence, composure and poise. They didn’t try to do too much, instead they executed how they needed to when the situation called for it. 
Goaltender Anna Weiner finished the game with six saves bringing her season total to 75. The defenders in the cage with her on the eight penalty corners were crucial in preserving the senior’s twelfth shutout of the season. 
While Friends’ seniors made tremendous impacts it was the youngest Quaker that gave them an early lead. 
With the ball on the right side of the cage, senior Cora Lohkamp fired a shot that was deflected by the Patriot defense. The deflection ricocheted right to eighth grader Peyton Galbraith. Galbraith reacted by firing a shot that turned into the first goal of the game with just over six minutes to play in the second quarter. 
The eighth grader’s 14th goal of the season combined with Dolan’s team leading 25th provided enough scoring against a tough Newark Charter defense. 
Clothier said after the game that he’s going to remember how hard the seniors worked to improve and how much they enjoyed competing in field hockey as well as their other sports. He said they set a strong example for the younger members of the team of what it means to compete. The juxtaposition of the two goal scorers showed the impact Clothier referred to.

“It was Bernie’s campaign for the presidency in 2016 that gave me the language of democratic socialism to describe my politics,” Zohran Mamdani, New York City mayor-elect, has said.

Zohran Mamdani, whose meteoric rise to winning election as New York City’s next mayor last week sent political waves across the country, has called Vermont’s independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders “the single most influential political figure in my life.”
In fact, according to Sanders, Mamdani’s campaign studied the senator’s 1981 run for mayor of Burlington, when Sanders — who, like Mamdani, is a democratic socialist — upset a more moderate opponent who’d held elected office for years. Sanders won that race by just 10 votes, though went on to win three more terms by increasingly greater margins.
“He said when he was running to be the mayor of Burlington, that Burlington is not for sale,” Mamdani told a stadium of thousands of supporters at a rally Oct. 26 featuring Sanders as a headline speaker. “It continues to be the rallying cry for working-class people across this country, and for us, it’s that New York City is not for sale.”
In last week’s election, Mamdani bested former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo with just over 50% of the vote to Cuomo’s 42%. Mamdani beat Cuomo in the Democratic primary for mayor earlier this year, too, though Cuomo ran again this fall as an independent. (The race’s Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa, finished a distant third with 7%.)
In an interview following Tuesday night’s election, Sanders said he sees the 34-year-old Mamdani, and other young elected progressive Democrats, such as New York’s Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, as the future of a political movement for which he’s long been the standard-bearer.
“We have a whole lot of people, often, very young people, who understand a couple of factors. And that is that we cannot do as the Democratic establishment has done for years, ignore the pain that the working class of this country is experiencing,” he said. 
“I don’t look to the Democratic leadership to make the changes that we need. I look at the grassroots of America. I look at people like Mamdani and Alexandria and others, people who have strong grassroots connections,” the 84-year-old senator added.

A Mamdani campaign video released in September intersperses clips of the mayor-elect talking to voters on the campaign trail with footage of Sanders interviewing Burlington residents when he was the city’s mayor. At the time, Sanders created a cable-access television program, called “Bernie Speaks with the Community,” that he used to make the case for some of his signature progressive proposals, including income tax reform.
There’s a clear line between Mamdani’s social media-centric campaign — which relied heavily, and effectively, on video to explain his campaign promises and connect with younger voters — and Sanders’ efforts, early in his own political career in Vermont, to build out messaging networks that don’t pass through the filter of traditional media.
The September video, titled “Mayor to Mayor,” also describes how Mamdani — who has represented part of Queens in the New York State Assembly — held his first campaign event for that seat at one of Sanders’ rallies for president in 2019.
“It was Bernie’s campaign for the presidency in 2016 that gave me the language of Democratic socialism to describe my politics,” Mamdani said at a town hall with Sanders in Brooklyn earlier in September, according to the magazine Jacobin. Sanders sought the Democratic nomination in both 2016 and 2020.
Both Sanders’ past platform for president, and Mamdani’s for mayor, are rooted in a fundamental concept of redistributing wealth. Sanders has long backed proposals such as Medicare for All and tuition-free college to be paid for with higher taxes on corporations and high earners; Mamdani has proposed raising taxes on New York City’s wealthiest residents to fund universal childcare and city buses that are fare-free and run faster.
“Those are not radical ideas. They are ideas that a vast majority of the American people understand to be right,” Sanders said in the post-election interview, drawing parallels between his and Mamdani’s platforms. “And to the degree that we fight for that — and (have) candidates who fight for that — I think we’re going to see some real, transformative change in America.”
It remains to be seen, of course, whether Mamdani will be able to deliver on his campaign promises, which hinge partly on support from the New York State Assembly and Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul. And it’s not clear whether a campaign based on democratic socialist principles is what Democrats need across the country, to win back one or both houses of Congress in 2026 or to recapture the White House in 2028.
Democrats enjoyed resounding success at the polls on Tuesday, winning governor’s races in New Jersey and Virginia as well as a proposal in California that will allow the state to redraw its congressional district maps ahead of the midterm elections in a way that could create as many as five new Democratic-controlled seats in the House.
But the winning gubernatorial candidates — Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey, and Abigail Spanberger in Virginia — are more politically moderate than Mamdani or Sanders, as is Gavin Newsom, the California governor who threw his political capital behind the redistricting proposal meant to neutralize a similar Republican-led effort in Texas. 
Matthew Dickinson, a political science professor at Middlebury College, said one reason Sanders found success as mayor of Burlington was that he governed as a pragmatist who was willing to compromise, while still sticking to his democratic socialist ideas. 
He pointed, for instance, to how Sanders worked with a corporate developer on plans to revitalize the city’s waterfront. It’s a project Sanders highlighted as an example of how the government can improve people’s lives when he launched his first presidential bid in 2015.

Sanders is widely popular across the country today, Dickinson noted, but he hasn’t been able to secure enough support from Democratic leaders to get key parts of his agenda into law, much less to be the party’s presidential nominee.
“I think Democrats are, rightly, cautious about what lessons nationally they should take from Mamdani, as a democratic socialist, winning a convincing victory in New York City,” Dickinson said, adding the city is far from a microcosm of the entire country. “It’s an open question whether Bernie and Mamdani are talking about the right issues.”
In Vermont last year, it was the state’s Republican party — not Democrats — who found success at the polls with a focus on lowering the cost of living, Dickinson noted. About half of all state legislative seats the GOP gained across the country in 2024 were in Vermont, dismantling Democratic supermajorities in both the state House and Senate.
Part of President Donald Trump’s campaign focused on affordability, too, in addition to major cultural flashpoints such immigration. But Sanders contended that Trump has quickly lost sight of that promise. In fact, Trump and his GOP allies in Congress are backing plans to make it harder for people to afford necessities, Sanders said to VTDigger, pointing to recent government funding plans that would let expanded Affordable Care Act subsidies expire.
“I think people all across the country are seeing that and saying to the Republicans, ‘sorry — you’re moving this country in a very wrong direction,’” Sanders said.

The fact that this national discussion is happening here, not just in Washington, D.C. or California, is a sign of real momentum.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Miro Weinberger: The next chapter in the politics of abundance in Vermont .","This commentary is by Miro Weinberger, of Burlington. He is executive chair of Let’s Build Homes, a visiting fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Taubman Center for State and Local Government, and former mayor of Burlington.


Last spring, I wrote that the national discussion sparked by “Abundance,” the new book by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, was “100% about us.” About Vermont, our housing shortage and our struggle to move from a culture of blocking to a culture of building.
Just months later, that conversation came to Vermont itself. More than 400 business leaders, policymakers, high school students and legislators gathered in late October to hear Derek Thompson, one of the co-authors of “Abundance,” speak at a Vermont Business Roundtable’s breakfast.
His message was both clear and urgent: America’s affordability crisis is fundamentally a housing crisis, driven by the legal and regulatory barriers that prevent us from building enough homes where people want and need to live.
Derek showed how housing costs rise precisely when young people are trying to start families and businesses, crowding out savings, innovation and opportunity. His argument resonates deeply with our experience in Vermont, where outdated zoning, redundant permitting systems and slow government processes have left too many people unable to find a decent, affordable place to live.
When Derek said, “If you want abundance, you have to build,” it felt like he was speaking directly to Vermonters.
The fact that this national discussion is happening here, not just in Washington, D.C. or California, is a sign of real momentum. It means Vermont is being recognized as part of the solution, not just a symptom of the national problem. The abundance agenda is taking root in our state.
At Let’s Build Homes, we see this moment as both validation and motivation. Our mission to create a Vermont of abundant housing for households of all income levels where communities thrive in harmony with our working lands, aligns perfectly with the principles of “Abundance.” The hundreds of leaders who joined the event are proof that the will to change is growing.
We’ve already seen meaningful progress. The Legislature has begun to modernize Act 250 and last year passed a bill to make it easier to finance the water, sewer, and road infrastructure that new homes depend on.
As a result of both local initiative and the Legislature’s Home Act, towns across the state are rethinking zoning to allow more housing where it’s needed most. These are exactly the kinds of steps that Abundance calls for: pragmatic, pro-building reforms that make growth possible without compromising our working lands.
Still, the work is far from done. Even as we make progress, too many families remain priced out of the communities they grew up in. Too many workers and young people still can’t find a home close to their job. Too many projects that meet our shared goals get stuck in unnecessary layers of process. The next phase of this effort must be even more ambitious. We must ensure that when a community has planned for housing in the right places, those homes can actually get built.
As Derek reminded us, America’s problem isn’t a lack of ideas, it’s a lack of permission. We’ve built political systems that make it far easier to stop something than to start it. Vermont has lived that truth for decades.
But the energy in that room told me that this is changing. We are choosing a new path. A path that recognizes that a vibrant, sustainable Vermont requires more homes, more opportunity and more people who can afford to live and work here. A path where communities grow and thrive in harmony with our working landscape.  
The politics of abundance means having the courage to say yes. Yes to smart growth, yes to new homes in the right places, yes to a future where young families and working Vermonters can thrive.
Let’s Build Homes is proud to help lead this transition. We’re building a movement that unites business and institution leaders, local officials, housing advocates and working Vermonters around one shared vision: a state that builds for its future rather than fears it.
Derek Thompson’s visit was more than a keynote. It was a milestone: a sign that Vermont’s effort to move from scarcity to abundance is being noticed, supported and strengthened by a growing national movement.
Now it’s up to us to keep building: literally and figuratively. The opportunity before us is enormous, and so is the responsibility. We’ve taken important steps, but much more lies ahead if we want to make building homes in the right places faster, simpler, and fairer for everyone.
Let’s seize this moment to ensure that every Vermonter, present and future, can find a place to call home.

Sign-making

Oct. 17, 2025. 3:35 p.m. 
I go to the woodshop,
grab some cardboard,
walk over to the weeping willows. 
Find a large stick and 
break off the uneven twigs. 
Open the door, 
plug in the “Mamma Mia” soundtrack, 
take a pencil 
and write, “Save Freedom of Speech.”
I hold my breath as I draw two outlines. 
I Sharpie everything and 
add some color. 
At 5:50 p.m., I’m done with everything:
two signs taped to a stick,
one handheld. 
I’m excited for the following day, 
when I can rise up —
and I won’t be alone.

And the line that he believes was constitutionally uncrossable was continuing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program during the government shutdown. In the president’s mind, it was a bridge too far to provide food assistance to poor people while a congressional stalemate halted most government services.
During his presidential tenure, Trump has challenged a litany of laws. He  argued he did not have to fund certain programs even though there were laws passed by Congress mandating those programs be funded.
After Congress and Mexico refused to provide money for a border wall in his first term, Trump shifted funds from other programs to begin work on the wall.
During this term, he has made himself judge, jury and executioner, killing people he said were drug dealers in international waters without providing any evidence. 
He has taken it upon himself to demolish the East Wing of the White House, though many would argue there are guidelines – even laws – he should follow in making such substantial changes to the nation’s most iconic building.
Just last week, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on whether he could usurp the constitutional authority of Congress and impose tariffs on his own.
Heck, he has even hinted at running for a third presidential term despite constitutional provisions clearly preventing such an effort.
During the shutdown that started at the beginning of October, Trump has found money to ensure that members of the military were paid, though there are questions of whether that is legal. Yet, no one challenged the paying of the troops. Most thought that was a good thing.
The list goes on and on of times when Trump, in the view of many, took actions contrary to existing laws. It should be pointed out that courts often cited his broad presidential powers in allowing him to avoid adhering to those laws.
But providing food assistance to about 43 million low-income Americans – about 40% of those being children – is the time when Trump said it would be illegal for his administration to act. He suddenly became a strict adherer of the law.
Never mind that some even argued that discontinuing the program during a government shutdown is illegal.
After all, never in the long and sordid history of government shutdowns has any other president stopped the food assistance program.
When lawsuits were filed, the Trump administration took the step of arguing in court that the program should be discontinued.
And after federal judges ruled that the program should be at least partially funded, Trump has sent mixed signals on whether his administration would follow the judicial order.
In Mississippi about 385,000 people  – 12.13% of the population – receive SNAP benefits, with about 163,000 of those recipients being children. Mississippi has the nation’s 20th highest percentage of its population receiving SNAP benefits, according to numbers provided earlier this summer by the U.S. Department of Agriculture that administers the program. It is surprising the percentage is not higher since Mississippi has the nation’s highest percentage of people living in poverty.
According to USDA numbers, 67% of the benefits in Mississippi go to families with children and 41% are distributed to families with members who are elderly or disabled.
The monthly benefit in Mississippi averages about $180 per person.
A substantial number of needy Mississippians depend on the program.
Yet, no member of the Republican leadership in Mississippi – on the state or federal level – has made a public statement to gently argue to their fellow Republican in the White House that stopping the food assistance program might not be the right course of action.
As the shutdown in the program loomed, Gov. Tate Reeves to much fanfare announced he was asking for federal permission to ban recipients from using the benefits to purchase sugary soft drinks and food. But it was crickets from the governor when it came to asking the president to continue SNAP, even as pediatricians and lawmakers called on Reeves to help hungry Mississippians.
Unlike some other states, Mississippi has taken no action to provide state funds as a substitute for the loss of federal SNAP benefits during the shutdown.
In Congress, no member of the Mississippi congressional delegation spoke up for their constituents who depend on SNAP. Mississippi U.S. Sens. Roger Wicker and Cindy Hyde-Smith were silent.
If Trump said the program could not be continued, it must be so, they reasoned.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/06145323/AP25308018522101.jpg,,,2025-11-09 07:18:12.618579

A new wave of agritech tools — from maple monitors to virtual fences — is revolutionizing how small farms manage labor, costs, and climate challenges.

Kate Kampner is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
For eleven years, Brian Kussel woke up at 2 a.m. to tend to the facilities that keep maple syrup flowing on his farm around-the-clock. But since January, that’s all changed for the Rutland producer. 
That’s thanks to Farmblox, an app-based automation system that detects farm equipment issues and productivity levels. Now, all Kussel has to do is check his phone to ensure his operation is running smoothly. Although he still has to wake up early, he can now tend to his production from the comfort of his bed. 
Peace of mind
Farmblox is one of a growing number of agrotechnology, or “agritech,” companies that promise to streamline farmwork and boost efficiency. These innovations vary from farm to farm. Some operations use sensors to manage water use, while other farms survey crop coverage with drones. 
In 2024, the global Agritech market was valued at about $24 billion, and is projected to reach $49 billion by 2030, according to ResearchandMarkets.com. Now, farmers in Vermont are taking advantage of these innovations to ease labor shortages and resist the impacts of climate change.
Kussel said installing Farmblox has greatly improved his quality of life — from more sleep to higher production. He installed the system in January after receiving a development grant from Vermont’s Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets. Since then, the system sends him alerts if syrup lines leak, animals damage machinery or sap lines freeze.
In the past, his five-person crew spent four days a week surveying his maple tapping system for damages. Now, he said, the crew only has to manually check the tubing for about three days of the entire season. 
“It’s labor savings,” said Kussel. “It’s the peace of mind.” 
Tools for farmers
Farmblox started off as an indoor-growing company, but found the cost of production too high. That changed when the company’s founders visited a maple farm in Vermont supported by a different monitor syste, said Will Brigham, a senior sales engineer for the company, 
Following that trip, they realized they had the technology to make their own, improved solution. Brigham himself is a maple producer in Vermont and uses the technology for his operations. 
The system works via wireless devices scattered throughout a farm. They gather data, such as fertilizer tank levels, equipment temperature and soil moisture levels. The collected information gets sent back to a main monitor for the farm to access.  Farmers also can attach the monitoring devices to farm equipment such as tanks, vacuums and pressure sensors and receive notifications when there’s a problem.
Farmblox is now used on 70 farms in ten states. The company’s goal is to make their technology usable for any crop. A sensor for sap level can also be used to monitor water tanks in orchards, for example.
Farmblox can also monitor carbon sequestration levels — the storing of carbon dioxide in soil — indicating soil health and showing amounts of carbon saved on a farm. “We aren’t here to tell farmers how to do things,” Brigham said. “We’re here to give them a platform and tools to allow them to build the system that they want, that is useful to them.”

Getting the word out
This influx in technology can be overwhelming for the predominantly older workforce in farming, Brigham said. One Vermont group is trying to help with the introduction.
The Agritech Institute for Small Farms, a Montpelier non-profit, provides financial, technical and monitoring support for farmers who implement the technology. Agritech tools can enable small farms to be a part of long-term climate solutions, said institute co-founder, Dan Smith. “The idea is to promote agritech tools to assist their financial and operation sustainability,” he said.
Smith understands firsthand how challenging operating a small-scale farm can be. He has owned and managed a beef farm in East Montpelier for the past 20 years. “You don’t have hired labor, so you’re dependent on yourself,” he said, “so, you look for agritech tools that will make your job easier.” 
The organization has partnered with eight Vermont farms to test a virtual fencing system called Nofence, and has plans to do additional trials over the next two years. Nofence was founded in Norway by goat farmer, Oscar Hovde, who struggled to fence in his herd in the country’s mountainous topography.
Hovde created a virtual fence using a combination of a high-pitched ringing audio as well as electric pulses to contain his herd. He put collars on his goats and trained them to associate the sounds and pulses with the fence. 
The company went fully commercial in the U.S. in early 2025 and is now used by over 400 farmers, including 15 in Vermont. 
No more walking the fence line
Matt Vermeersch, a salesperson for Nofence, said the technology has been beneficial for managing his own herd of cattle. Prior to using Nofence, Vermeersch relied on an electric fence, which required hours of management.
With a full-time job and a family to care for, he didn’t have time to worry about the fence line. Now, he doesn’t have to. Nofence offers an easier way to start rotational grazing — moving livestock between pastures to regrow grazed areas, which builds climate resilience.
Vermeersch found the fencing allowed him to quickly adapt to weather change and kept his cattle comfortable. “In the past I wasn’t really able to adapt to different things rapidly,” he said. “You’re spending all this time doing a low-value activity.”
Now with technology like NoFence and Farmblox, farmers say they can focus on higher priorities.

(Photo by FatCamera/Getty Images)For the past year, families in need of child care assistance in Indiana have been sitting on a waitlist that has ballooned from 3,000 to 30,000 kids. It’s still climbing — and no one is coming off of it.
Emily Pike, the executive director of New Hope For Families in Bloomington, which cares for children experiencing homelessness, can’t remember a time when no families were coming off the waitlist. Before this year, she said, low-income families could expect to be on the list just a few weeks before they found placement at a center that took child care vouchers, which for most brought their costs down to zero.
But now, state officials project that no kids will come off the list until at least 2027.
That isn’t the only drastic change. In September, Indiana moved to lower its child care reimbursement rates, meaning the state will pay providers 10 to 35 percent less to care for low-income kids. Centers have had to pass those costs on to parents through higher co-payments.
Already, centers have closed classrooms as a result. Workers have been fired. Parents have pulled their children out of care.
Versions of this story have quietly been playing out across the nation, including in Arkansas, Oregon, Maryland and New Jersey. The reasons appear to be the same: States used a historic infusion of COVID-19 relief funds to improve their child care systems over the past few years, and now that the money has run dry, some can no longer keep their child care reimbursement rates up. To keep funds going to families already receiving state assistance, states have stopped accepting new children into their voucher programs and implemented waitlists.
At the same time, they’re facing cuts — or upcoming ones — in federal funding.
Arkansas education department adopts most of plan to keep families, providers in child care industry

President Donald Trump’s tariff hikes are constricting budgets in states, like Indiana, that rely on international trade, and his Big Beautiful Bill spending package will dramatically cut funding for Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Scrambling to fill those new holes in their coffers, states have looked to child care.
“A lot of states are facing major budget pressures for various reasons and those are unlikely to get better, and very likely to get worse, as a result of the Big Beautiful Bill, said Elliot Haspel, a national child care expert. “In some ways it’s all the more alarming that states are doing this before they are feeling the full effects.”
In Arkansas, where the state proposed leveling reimbursement rates, the waitlist for child care vouchers is frozen.
Maryland has stopped offering new applicants child care vouchers because it has more children enrolled right now than it can financially support. The state would need more funding to shrink its waitlist, and legislators have said that is not likely to come because of cuts in federal funding.
In Oregon, the legislature has slashed the budget for its free preschool program by 10 percent due to poor economic projections for the corporate tax that funds the state’s program. The reason for those poor projections? Tariffs hitting a state economy that relies heavily on international trade. An estimated 640 kids will no longer get free preschool.
Helene Stebbins, the executive director of the Alliance for Early Success, a group that brings together early childhood advocacy at the state level, said some states “did not prepare for the very predictable end for the COVID dollars,” while others, like New Mexico and Connecticut, have instead invested more state money in child care after the funds ended.
“It’s a choice about how they collect and redistribute revenue and budget,” she said.
In 2021, child care got a $39 billion infusion after 16,000 child care centers and homes closed during the pandemic and more than 370,000 workers lost their jobs. It was money states used for a whole host of things, including paying providers more, raising wages and improving infrastructure. The last of those dollars expired in September 2024. Many advocates in 2023 warned that a child care cliff was coming. Years later, it’s now here.
In Indiana, the state said its recent changes were largely due to a projected $225 million funding gap created by “unsustainable” use of COVID relief funds by the prior governor’s administration. In 2021, the funds allowed the state to pay providers about 20 percent more to care for low-income kids and expanded the eligibility requirements, which led to more families enrolling in child care vouchers. But after the funds expired, Indiana could no longer cover those rates, even after it invested an additional $147 million in child care earlier this year.
The state declined an interview on the changes, but a spokesperson for the Office of Early Childhood and Out-of-School Learning told The 19th that Indiana is also battling lower revenue projections in part due to tariffs. Indiana is the fourth highest exporter of goods to China in the United States. Cuts to Medicaid and SNAP that will take effect in 2027 are very likely also going to affect the child care budget, a spokesperson said.
In a news release, Adam Alson, the director of Indiana’s early childhood office, said the state decided to focus its funding on the families already receiving aid. He reasoned it out like this: “There is only one pot of money — we could either protect providers or kids, and we chose kids.”
But if centers have to fire teachers, close classrooms or close entire buildings, children will also be impacted, multiple Indiana child care providers told The 19th. Most of the children on vouchers in Indiana are Black or Latinx kids from single-parent households. About 60 percent of those families are living below the poverty level and nearly all are working. If those children can’t be in care, their parents face missing out on work or losing jobs altogether.
“When policymakers decide to cut something like this, what they’re saying is, ‘Oh people will figure it out.’ I think they expect caregivers to figure it out,” Pike said. “It’s a dramatic misunderstanding of what the field does, because at the end of the day, we as a society make choices about what’s most important to us. When we choose not to fund early learning we are demonstrating real short sightedness.”
Cori Kerns, an early childhood advocate and staff consultant at Little Duckling Early Learning Schools in Indianapolis, said families there are seeing their co-pays rise from $5 to $15 a week, and even that modest increase is having a big impact. So big, in fact, that the centers had to consolidate their two buildings into one because so many parents stopped bringing their kids in after the rate hikes. The center is surviving only because the community has chipped in to cover electricity bills and rent payments.
Across Indiana, at least 36 centers have closed entirely since the start of the year, said Hanan Osman, the executive director for Indiana Association for the Education of Young Children, which is tracking closures.
Arkansas faces a similar situation: Providers were staring down as many as 400 layoffs and potential closures due to significant reimbursement rate cuts proposed by the state designed to spread the money across more kids and lower the number of children on the waitlist. The list now numbers 1,100 and has also been frozen since the start of the year.
In September, the state notified providers that it would no longer pay out higher reimbursement rates to higher-quality centers. In Arkansas, centers are rated for quality from 1 to 6 — the higher their quality rating, the more money the state puts in to cover the cost of providing that care, often because the provider is also spending more on curriculum, teacher pay and materials. The state then proposed that every provider will get a flat fee. Higher co-payments for families kicked in October 1, and the reimbursement rate change was delayed to November 1 after significant public opposition to the plan.
Last month Arkansas Secretary of Education Jacob Oliva said uncertainty around the federal government shutdown was part of it, and so was an unexpected reduction in the federal funds the state receives for child care due to a change in how state allowances are calculated. That led to a realization that the voucher program was significantly over budget, to the tune of as much as $9 million more a month, because so many more children were receiving services.
In late October, a task force of child care experts presented recommendations to the state to scale back the cuts, most of which have now been implemented. Instead of a new flat reimbursement rate, providers rated 3 to 6 in quality will still get higher rates, albeit not as high as they were previously.
It’s all been incredibly stressful for McKinley Hess, the executive director of Conway Cradle Care in Conway, Arkansas, which primarily serves teen parents. In the past, those teens had been able to bypass the waitlist because they are considered a priority population, but Arkansas removed the exception at the end of August. The center is a level 3 of 6 for quality, but under the proposed cuts she would have seen a cut of $20 less per infant per day and $16 per toddler per day. Now, the cuts will be less dramatic: $5 a day each for infants and toddlers.
Still, “it is a disaster,” Hess said bluntly. The center had been covering all costs for eight families who are sitting on the state’s waitlist for assistance and plans to continue doing so until those families come off it.
“While the new reimbursement rates are not as detrimental as the initially proposed cuts, our most pressing challenge remains the number of adolescent parents who are waitlisted and unable to receive assistance,” Hess said. “For our adolescent parents, access to child care is the bridge between continuing their education and being forced to drop out of school.”
In Mountain Home, Arkansas, Jill Wilson, the executive director of Open Arms Learning Center, was looking at a $32,000-a-month shortfall from the rate changes. Now the shortfall will be more like $3,200. Her center is accredited 5 stars out of 6, a quality level that she earned through significant investments like specialized curriculum for each class room — $4,000 each for 17 rooms.
Already, she had to cut two staff positions and combine classrooms.
“I have been here for 20 years and it’s never been like this,” Wilson said. “I feel like the rug has been pulled out from under me.”
For Pike in Indiana, the situation goes far beyond the dollars and cents of a state budget. For the families she serves, access to child care is the key to retaining a job and moving out of homelessness.
“I have seen families make devastatingly difficult decisions when they don’t have access to child care. It makes me emotional to talk about it. I have seen families choose to leave their children with someone with an active substance use problem. I’ve seen families leave little kids home with big kids. And I’m using big kids pretty loosely there — they might be 8 or 9 or 10. I have seen families lose jobs,” Pike said.
She started her center 10 years ago when she encountered a crying mom with a 4-year-old girl and an infant in the parking lot of a shelter. The little girl had been bitten by a dog at an unlicensed child care home the previous day and received 17 stitches in her neck. The mom’s boss was threatening to fire her if she missed work, and so the mother had no choice but to send her daughter back.
Pike helped the family that day and later started her center, an experience that has fueled her belief that cutting access to child care funding does not mean children no longer need care. They still have to go somewhere.
Put simply, she said: “When we take away subsidies, we are taking away low-income families’ access to safe care.”

English professor Brenda Brueggemann had driven by the memorial stone, the grassy grove and the architectural shells of the shuttered institution every day for years on her way to teach at the University of Connecticut.
The campus of the former Mansfield Training School, a state institution that, until the early 1990s, had housed people with intellectual disabilities, was now nothing more than a labyrinth of empty buildings along a stretch of Route 44, overgrown with ivy and left to rot on the inside.
Then in 2022, a student of Brueggemann’s, who was researching how individuals with disabilities were treated in university settings, started digging through UConn’s archives. The work would lead to what Brueggemann called a “dark realization” about the history that was hiding in plain sight. 
And it launched a much larger project.

For the past three years, Brueggemann and her students have been piecing together the history of the Mansfield Training School, now owned by the university and referred to as the “Depot Campus.” They’ve gone through archives, given presentations, made visits to the site and created a website outlining the history of the training school and what they’ve found in its archives. And they’ve grappled with its controversial legacy — one that aligns with the fraught history of institutions for disabled people across the U.S. 
Brueggemann has also taken on the task of piecing together an oral history of the Mansfield Training School. She’s spoken with family members of former residents and, through a Facebook group, she’s interviewed people who used to work there. Now she’s looking for a way to formally preserve it all.
“The more I found, the more I knew that we needed a memorial of some kind,” Brueggemann said. 
The student who first called Brueggemann’s attention to the vacant campus was Jess Gallagher. Then an undergraduate student in English literature, Gallagher was working on an honors thesis and had been reading about the way people with disabilities were treated in university settings. They began wondering what that history was at UConn.
Over the course of roughly 400 hours going through documents in the archives, the professor and her students unearthed a story of an institution that reflected the shifts and changes in contemporary opinions about the proper setting and treatment for people with intellectual disabilities.
The site was a hospital in the mid-1800s and a labor farm in the 1920s. By the 1960s, it was the site of psychological experimentation. In subsequent decades, treatment for the resident population transformed from restraint, seclusion and the use of heavy sedatives to more modern care — such as homier living quarters and more targeted pharmaceuticals.

Over the years, its barracks-style residences, cut off from society at large, were replaced with smaller dormitories and more integrated living — group homes — in the surrounding community. Ultimately, in 1993, shifting public opinion and legal battles put an end to the institution all together.
But Gallagher said the school’s archival records only revealed so much. The documents they’d combed through often referred to Mansfield Training School residents simply as “numbers,” she said.
The stories that truly brought life and color to the school’s history were those Gallagher found outside the archives — like one memorable 2001 profile they’d read in The Hartford Courant, which changed the way they thought about the research project.
Jimmy Lundquist, the subject of the profile, lived at Mansfield Training School for nearly two decades and tried to escape several times. He’d witnessed residents being placed in straightjackets and isolation rooms, and in the article he recounted beatings and strip searches. Eventually, after leaving the school and living in multiple group homes, he found work and became a well-known resident in his West Hartford neighborhood.
Stories like Lundquist’s — along with the oral histories Brueggemann has compiled — lend a human face to the institutional history. Gallagher said they believe that’s worth preserving.
“ During the time period of institutionalization, and even today, people have the stereotype that people with disabilities can’t live fulfilling lives or independent lives. So seeing [Lundquist] flourish and subvert that narrative, I think, was the best thing to see,” they said.

From the archives
In a timeline on the memorial website, Brueggemann and her students lay out much of the institution’s first 175 years.
It was established in 1850 by a doctor named Henry Knight, who ran it by himself for its first six years. The state of Connecticut then agreed to provide funding to the institution, which was called “Knight Hospital” and described by author and scholar James W. Trent Jr. as a place for “feeble-minded patients.” It would become the Mansfield Training School and Hospital in 1917. 
During the flu epidemic of 1918-19, an overwhelming number of residents got sick, and 30 died. 
By 1940, the Mansfield Training School had grown to nearly 1,200 residents. They were trained to cook, sew, clean and farm — but they weren’t paid for their labor. Female residents made clothes and baskets, which were sold to support the institution.
Archival records document poor conditions and overcrowding. The archives also revealed abuse, including the frequent use of restraints and isolation. Anyone who tried to run away was punished.
In one month in 1957, 39 residents spent more than half of each day in restraints. In 1972, an article in the Mansfield Chronicle revealed that employees at the training school routinely abused and beat residents. And in 1977, the Connecticut Department of Labor logged 41 pages of health violations at the facilities. 
UConn, which acquired the campus in 1969, became involved with the school years earlier, in 1963. That year, the state passed a law allocating funds for research centers, community mental health centers and teacher training for children with disabilities. Part of that funding went to UConn to build clinical facilities. University students began visiting the training school to conduct clinical work there, and professors at UConn received grants to conduct experiments on residents of the training school.
“It seems that the … residents at MTS were often used for the benefit of the institutions they inhabited,” the website timeline reads.

Telling their stories
Former workers at the school have nuanced memories of the place. 
John Ryan, an employee from 1967-1975, remembers both happy and dark moments. Ryan worked as an aide with residents who were moderately disabled and with the blind. He said he helped teach them to tie their shoes and dress themselves, and he enjoyed the work.
There were trips to the circus and to a baseball game at Fenway Park. He remembers making a float for Memorial Day and parading with students down the campus’ main road.
But Ryan said the situation was different for staff who worked in a separate building with severely disabled residents. Workers regularly called out sick, he said, and they often smelled of urine. 
“They had a huge turnover in those buildings,” Ryan said. Some of the school’s more high-functioning residents, known as the “working boys,” would help out with the more severely disabled residents, changing their clothes and cleaning up.
There was a larger societal problem, too, Ryan said — a stigma. He recalled that some parents rarely visited or took their children out for the day. 
“Back in the ’60s and ’70s, mental retardation was a dark subject,” he said. “They didn’t know as much about it.” 
Many families avoided talking about their disabled children. But over the years, some of those same relatives have gotten curious about the place their loved ones spent much of their lives. 
Gretchen Law remembers going to visit her older sister, Missy, when she lived at the Mansfield Training School. On Sundays after church, the family would drive over from their home in Granby. 
Law said she remembers the “institutional hospital smell” of the buildings “and the color on the wall. It was kind of that sort of greenish blue institutional color.”

Missy, who was nonverbal and needed help feeding herself, was sent to live at the training school in the early 1960s, when she was 8 or 9.
“ I can’t speak for my mom and my dad, but it was a decision that they made based on what was done with children like this during that time,” Law said. 
In their father’s journals, which Law discovered years later, he wrote that he believed it had been a “wise” decision and he was grateful to the staff for taking care of Missy.
But Law said that their mother never received any support or therapy to help her through the experience and that, even today, the knowledge of having placed her daughter at the Mansfield Training School “haunts her.” 
When Law was 7, her parents separated. Not long after, Missy, then 15, died from a congenital heart defect. Law said that she and her family rarely talked about Missy after that.
About 15 years ago, Law was working as a teacher in Deerfield, Mass., when she started to wonder whether her sister’s life might have been different if she’d had the kind of support now available to students with special needs. 
“ In my school, we had a program where kids were nonverbal, they were in feeding tubes, they were in wheelchairs. So I would look at these kids and just say, ‘That was my sister,’” she said.
Law said sharing the stories of people who spent time at Mansfield Training School could help family members — like herself and others like her — to find peace. 
“We should be telling these stories,” she said. “It affects someone, it came from someone’s life experience, so this is part of our culture. Let’s not ignore it.”

The end of an institution
By 1970, the Mansfield Training School’s days were numbered. Public opinion of residential institutions for the disabled was shifting. Lawsuits were being filed across the country. 
In Connecticut, an investigation by the American Association of Mental Deficiency had determined that Mansfield was overcrowded and understaffed and that residents had no privacy. 
In response to the sea change in public opinion, school leaders worked to revamp the facilities. “Cottages” were constructed to replace the large barracks-like dormitories. The school also established rules for the use of restraints and added reporting requirements and training for staff. 
Robert Tyrka, who worked at Mansfield Training School from 1978 to 1988, witnessed the change. When he first started working there — helping the residents shower, eat and get ready for activities — he said there might have been two staff members for every 20 residents. 
But as time went on, that ratio improved, he said. Negotiations with the union led to significant improvements in salaries and benefits, and over time people began thinking of the jobs less as a temporary placement and more as a career. And thanks to pharmaceutical improvements, doctors began to prescribe more targeted treatments rather than the heavy-duty drugs they relied on in the 1970s. 
But the improvements at the school didn’t save it. 
In 1978, a group of parents filed a lawsuit against what was then known as the Connecticut Department of Mental Retardation, in part to stop a plan that would have allowed the Department of Correction to use certain buildings on the Mansfield grounds to house prisoners. A consent decree that emerged from the lawsuit provided the plaintiffs with case managers tasked with finding them new homes within their communities. The decree eventually led to the closing of the Mansfield Training School.
“The stories are still there.”Ashten Vassar-Cain
The remaining residents were transferred into group homes, and the land and buildings were abandoned to decay, quietly receding from sight and from memory. 
Tyrka, who went on to work at Southbury Training School and later at group homes, said he believes the group homes were mostly an improvement over institutional settings. But he said what he perceived as near-constant news coverage of abuses at Mansfield was unfair. He said those reports didn’t portray any of the positive things that happened there until it became clear the facility was going to close. He’d like to see the full story told. 
“If it can be done in an even-handed, in a balanced way, then I think it would be worthwhile to explore the good, the bad, the ugly — all of it from Mansfield insofar as that can be encapsulated,” he said. 
In the years that have passed since the closing, the University of Connecticut has tried to find a use for the land. The school has sold part of the property to the state of Connecticut to be used for the construction of a new Windham Technical High School. Other deals to sell portions of the land have fallen through.
Brueggemann and her students are curious about the possibility that human remains might be buried at the site. Other states, including Kentucky, California and Minnesota, have made such discoveries. Last year, Brueggemann and several students sent an email to UConn President Radenka Maric and associate vice president in charge of University Planning, Design, and Construction Laura Cruickshank inquiring about conducting a survey using ground penetrating radar, a technology that can show whether human remains lie under the ground.
UConn officials responded that there were no records that would indicate a burial ground existed on the property and that they did not plan to do a survey without further evidence. 
Ashten Vassar-Cain, a former student of Brueggemann’s, said he’s planning to seek funding from the Connecticut State Historical Preservation Office to do a radar sweep of the area. But he said UConn would have to approve it. 
“Even though Mansfield Training School has been closed for over 30 years, even though the buildings are standing near rotting, and nothing has been ‘done’ with the land, the stories are still there,” Vassar-Cain said.

Restoring without ‘sanitizing’
What happened years ago at the Mansfield Training School remains a question in the minds of relatives — one that may never be fully answered. 
That was the case for Jan Doyle, whose older sister Evvie was a resident of the training school for four decades. Jan said her sister was  born prematurely and suffered brain damage. After their parents placed Evvie in Mansfield, in 1953, they never spoke about her.
“ Personally, I was very angry at my parents for years for doing that,” Jan said. “But I understand now through my own research, they were just doing what the experts told them was the best for their child.”
By the time Jan officially met her sister, they were both in their 40s. Evvie had been placed in a state-run group home after Mansfield closed, and Jan was asked to be her sister’s medical proxy. Jan said she felt compelled to step forward.
On the first day they met, Jan threw Evvie a birthday party. They began spending more time together, and Jan regularly took Evvie and her boyfriend — a fellow resident at the group home — out to lunch. She and Evvie liked to sing along to songs on the radio together. 
But when Jan asked Evvie if she remembered being at Mansfield Training School, she clammed up. “ She wouldn’t talk to me anymore for the rest of the day, and she has never been like that,” Jan said. “The experience had to be so horrible that when she was in her 70s, she still couldn’t talk about it.”

Evvie died of cancer in 2022. Since then, Jan Doyle has been working on projects that would honor her sister’s memory, including a fictional memoir and a series of quilts. She said she wants to educate family members about the value of being involved in the lives of people with special needs. 
Doyle said she’d like to see a few of the buildings at the training school be restored to the way they used to be — without it being “sanitized” — as a way to memorialize the history of the site. It could be part museum and part gathering place for families to “learn, share and support each other in a safe place,” she said.
“It could be a resource and a hub for the state and the country to share this information — where we were, which was horrible … and where we are now.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1028_SR_MTSUConn_194-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-09 05:16:32.110161

(Photo by Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)As I write there’s a calico tabby on the porch, asleep in the sun.
It’s an afternoon in early November and the temperature is 65 degrees, says our outdoor thermometer. There is no wind and the atmosphere is so clear it seems distilled by the intensity of late fall. Constitution Street has been made vivid by low sun and dry air.
Even the sky seems more blue.
I don’t know if the cat appreciates this beauty — as I understand it, the scene looks muted and blurry for her — but she lives easy on days like this. Her name is Newt. Don’t ask me how she came by that, but my wife Kim can recount the complicated backstory, as there always is with cats. I don’t know if Newt has her own secret name, as Eliot poetically declared, but today she has no time for meditation on the ineffable. Just rest.
The cat sleeps on a piece of paint-splattered cardboard, but earlier it was the lazy gray cat on the makeshift mat. His name is Geebers and he is even lazier than Newt, although his curiosity draws him inconveniently underfoot. The third cat, the white Foxy One, prefers her own company and is perched atop a plastic trash bin in the back yard.
Have I mentioned I am not a cat person?
The cats have places to sleep, store-bought beds tucked in corners of the deck and the back porch, but they prefer my old T-shirts that have become work rags or the scraps of cardboard that catch paint drips. We still have things to do, so there are brooms and brushes and buckets of stuff on the porch. But largely, the work is done for this fall. Our handyman friend and his wife have done most of it, but I’ve managed rebuilding the steps out front. The handyman’s name is Junior and that reminds me of my dead father, whose given name was Carl but who was called Junior by just about everyone who knew him. Sometimes the handyman friend will forget to bring a tool and he’ll ask to borrow one of mine. It was a level yesterday and I imagine my father would have been pleased when I produced one that he himself had used 30 or 40 years ago.
A few things are left that I can do. A bit more carpentry. Some paint. Maybe repair that leaking gutter on the big round corner of our house that’s been here well over a hundred years. All I need is a few good days and a little ambition.
But who am I kidding?
There will always be things to do. The work is never done.
And that’s OK with the cats.
The cardboard the cats prefer is dappled with the new colors of the house, porch, and deck: yellow, tan, redwood, dark brown. It didn’t occur to me during summer that we had chosen an autumn palette for the house, but it’s apparent now. There’s not much color in the trees in front of our house on Constitution Street, but a block over there’s a maple that fairly burns with red and orange. Kim came back not long ago with photos of it on her phone, an attempt to memorialize fleeting beauty in an ordinary moment. Her photos make me sad for the maple in our back yard we lost to a wind storm last year.
This is the melancholy territory when Halloween is behind us, but it’s not brisk enough to yet imagine Thanksgiving. It’s a lull in battle, a bit of rest before the harshness of winter. It feels like we didn’t have much of a summer, because of the rain, because of projects, because of 2025. The strangeness of days is not just because of the weather.
I’ve linked the personal to the public during this time before. Last year I wrote about our mind-bending cultural landscape. In 2023, I noted my brother’s death and took comfort in Thoreau. But anxiety and uncertainty still rule. We are now in the longest government shutdown in United States history, our military masses off foreign shores, more than 40 million people have already lost their food assistance, and health care for another 20 million may become unaffordable as federal tax benefits expire. There is much more to worry about, but these issues are the most pressing.
Never mind just now who is to blame. When your apartment building (or the house of democracy) is on fire, you work at saving yourself and as many others as you can first, even if you have a good idea who lit the match. If you survive, there’ll be time later to investigate how the fire started. If you don’t survive, there’s no point.
A couple of days ago Kim and I took all the loose change we could find in the house, from jars and pockets and one comically large Jack Daniels bottle, and cashed it all in. We fed the coins into one of those machines at the local grocery store and it clanged like a slot machine and counted more than 90 bucks, including a thousand pennies. We gave half of the amount to a local food bank and used the rest to buy macaroni and cheese and peanut butter and other staples to put in blessing boxes around town. We aren’t hungry, but we know it’s a thin line that separates us from those who are. Our acts are not so much charity as they are an affirmation. We’re still here, we’re mostly okay, we can afford to help others. We do it while we can.
Kim is one of those 20 million Americans who rely on the tax credits for the Affordable Care Act plans, subsidies which are set to expire at the end of the year unless Congress acts. Her premiums are expected to triple, according to this KFF (formerly Kaiser Family Foundation) calculator. She’s contemplating going without, but that risks catastrophe. Such conversations have been frequent since my job as a professor was taken away in a purge of the humanities in 2022, because Kim was on my health insurance. But many other families, from all professions, are having these discussions. The past three years have been tough, although we managed to survive and are better now. But the health care problem lingers.
The fears many of us had this time last year, in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election, have materialized into what may become life-or-death decisions. Health care or house payments? Food or rent?
I’ve always tipped too much at restaurants, and in the past the motivation was in that “Sun Also Rises” way of making people happy and getting them to like you, but now is different. I don’t care so much who likes me anymore. But I do care about those who rely on tips.
If the last few years have had any lesson for me, it’s that you can suddenly become disadvantaged by events beyond your control, even if you’ve spent years building what you thought was job security. You’re just one workforce management decision or one major illness away from having it all come crashing down. We’ve been lucky. We held onto our old and admittedly modest home on Constitution Street, but it was not without struggle. The paint and repairs represent for me a victory over the forces of career disruption and economic entropy. The place will never be a model home, but every dab of paint and each driven screw is a testament to tenacity.
The struggle to get by has reached such proportions in America that it should make us all ashamed. When I was a kid it was easier to get by because the cost of doing human business was more straightforward. You paid this much for rent, that much for food, you kept the car running and if you were lucky you had a little left over to buy gasoline and a couple of movie tickets. There are a dozen things you could name that make it more expensive to live now, from your smart phone (required if you want to stay or be employed) or your home computer and internet. We have better health care now, due to advances in technology, but prices have far outstripped general inflation. We also spend more on health care than any other large, wealthy country, but that spending doesn’t translate into better outcomes. Even if you have insurance, you might fear the cost of co-pays for a major illness.
Everybody knows, even if they won’t admit it, that health care in this country is broken. We are trapped in an upward spiral of services and premiums that cannot be sustained. There is a strong correlation between poor physical and mental health and food insecurity, so we’re really talking about different aspects of the same problem. That problem is economic inequality. The United States is experiencing a widening income gap, with an inequality chasm not see since before the stock market crash of 1929.
Will we have another Great Depression?
I don’t know. Maybe.
That’s one of those saving people from the flames first and investigating the arson later questions. We must do what we can right now to relieve the suffering of our friends, our neighbors, and especially people we don’t know. We are naturally disposed to helping family and friends, but helping strangers may be the true test of our humanity. To live in America today is to dwell in a nation of abundance in which 1 of every 8 people is in danger of going hungry.
If you are not among them, give thanks. Your good fortune might be because of your hard work or your family connections or simply good luck. If you are among the 13% who are, don’t believe those who say you’re lazy or otherwise undeserving and chalk it up instead to bad luck.
Poverty in America is a choice, but the choice isn’t made by those it afflicts, and certainly not their children. We have made the collective choice to embrace a system that resembles the worst aspects of our Gilded Age past more than the golden age of mid-century democracy. In today’s America, the only unpardonable sin is being poor.
The last few years have left many of us emotionally battered.
I am so weary as the cat sleeps on the porch that I’m not prepared for a day of sun in autumn to feel like a gift. But it is a gift, and perhaps that’s the lesson for the day. One individual can’t control sweeping cultural events any more than one can control the weather. All one can do is to enjoy the good days, prepare for the bad, and try to help those in danger of being swept away.
I stand for a long time on the porch, looking at the slanting light and the fallen leaves on the steps. I think they’re all maple but the yellow ones are from a gum tree, Kim tells me. She also says Newt’s name is a contraction of “New Cat.” Not mysterious at all, just a convenient name for the third orphaned or otherwise abandoned cat she’s adopted. I reflect for a moment on labels and ponder whether I am disappointed by politics or seriously disaffected. Then the thought passes. I should be painting or cutting lumber, but then the moment would slip away. In time the lazy gray cat ambles sleepily over from where he’d been hidden and looks up at me with wide green eyes.
I reach down and scratch him behind the ears.
Have I told you I’m allergic to cats?
I will have to wash my hands thoroughly later. For the moment, it is enough to feel the back of Geebers’ bony head beneath my fingertips as his eyes close and his tail goes slowly back and forth. The cat has no politics. For the moment, neither do I.

But there’s a lighter side to the job, as I wrote a few years ago, based on former conductor Michael Shaw’s great book, “My Rail Life” after he retired from a 36-year career on the New Haven line.  He clearly loved his job.  And he swears these stories are true.


He once told passengers on a standing-room only train: “OK, folks. We are half way to Grand Central.  It’s time for everyone who’s been seated to get up and give their seats to folks who’ve been standing.”
Asked by a passenger boarding at Grand Central, “What times does this train arrive in Stamford?” he answered candidly, “Usually about 20 minutes after the schedule says.”
On another train he announced: “Folks, I have good news and bad news.  The good news is that Metro-North fixed the air conditioning you complained about not having all summer long.  The bad news — it’s now winter.”
Honest to a fault, he turned in everything left by passengers on his train to the Metro-North Lost and Found… even an envelope containing $400 in cash. (The lost money wasn’t claimed so he got it back.)  On several occasions he’d find a lost briefcase or cell-phone and personally return it to the owner’s home the same day.


He also loved razzing his fellow railroad workers, once announcing, “If you have any railroad questions or would like to take your picture with a real railroad engineer, come to the front of the train and say hello to Jerry who loves chatting with people.”  The engineer’s name was not Jerry and the real man at the controls really didn’t like people at all.
Approaching Bridgeport, Shaw announced the connection for the Waterbury train, adding “Be sure to ask your Waterbury conductor for one of the free 100 Years Commemorative pins.”  There were no such pins.
On Friday late night trains Shaw would bet with his fellow conductors watching drunk passengers boarding at Grand Central, guessing who would be first to throw up.  Shaw immediately chose a 95-pound woman he saw staggering to the nearest car with her equally inebriated boyfriend.  Even before leaving the station his co-worker came and gave him his winnings.
Shaw always went out of his way to keep passengers informed about delays.  In the horrendous winter of 2014 when the railroad almost ground to a halt, he printed a one-page apology for the previous day’s delays and did his own seat-drop of 500 copies before the train left New Haven.  His regular passengers were so grateful for his candor they gave him a standing ovation as he entered each car to collect tickets.  His railroad bosses were not amused.
As Shaw approached an obviously “senior” citizen to collect his fare, the old timer asked he needed to show his ID to prove his age.  Shaw said that wouldn’t be necessary, The old timer asked “Are you saying I look old?” 
“No,” said Shaw. “You look honest.”
On another occasion he approached an elderly, gray-haired woman who wanted to buy a senior-discount ticket.  “Are you over 65?, he asked in a teasing voice. 
“Actually, I’m 82,” she said.  
“Well, you look marvelous!” said Shaw, asking “What’s your secret?”

(Courtesy of South Dakota Department of Corrections)An inmate died in Department of Corrections custody this week, adding another name to a list of in-custody deaths that’s higher than the state has seen in recent memory.
Travis Long Fox, 33, died Friday in a Sioux Falls hospital. He’d been there since Tuesday, when he was found unresponsive in his cell at the South Dakota State Penitentiary.
The Division of Criminal Investigation plans to look into the death. Press releases from the Department of Corrections and Division of Criminal Investigation did not disclose further details.
Three inmates die in three days at Sioux Falls penitentiary complex

This will be the fifth inmate death investigated by the DCI since February. Two people have been criminally charged for allegedly supplying the drugs that caused the overdose deaths of two inmates. In addition to the death of Long Fox, there are two other ongoing investigations into inmate deaths.
Nineteen men have died in state prison custody this calendar year, the highest number in at least a decade. At least four of those men died by suicide. At least three overdosed.
The department tracks inmate deaths by state fiscal year, which ends on June 30. The state is currently in fiscal year 2026. 
By the fiscal year measurement, 2025 was the deadliest year in South Dakota’s prisons since at least 2018, with 19 total deaths. 
The death of Long Fox brings the number for fiscal year 2026 to seven.

(Photo courtesy of USDA)One day after saying it would pay full food assistance benefits on time this month, the South Dakota Department of Social Services said Saturday it’s pausing that plan because of a U.S. Supreme Court decision.
The department is reacting to federal government shutdown-related chaos that took several twists and turns in the last few days.
The Trump administration had said the ongoing shutdown meant it could not pay November benefits for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which helps 42 million Americans afford groceries. But a federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the Trump administration Thursday to pay roughly $9 billion for a full month of benefits by Friday.
US Supreme Court temporarily blocks November SNAP payments

The U.S. Department of Agriculture told states Friday it was releasing full November funding for SNAP. The South Dakota Department of Social Services responded with an announcement of its own, saying it would pay full benefits on Monday, which is the state’s regular date (the 10th day of the month) for loading money onto SNAP payment cards.
Then, on Friday night, the U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocked the Thursday order from the lower court, which the Trump administration had appealed.
The South Dakota Department of Social Services reacted Saturday with a new announcement saying it “has paused implementation of its plan to provide full benefits to SNAP recipients by November 10.” The department said it’s awaiting further instruction from the USDA Food and Nutrition Service and will provide updates as they’re received.
It takes about $15 million of federal funding per month to pay the SNAP benefits of roughly 75,000 South Dakotans. The average South Dakota household in the program receives about $390 per month.

BURLINGTON — Vermont’s state chapter of the Republican Party narrowly reelected its current chair, Paul Dame, to another two-year term on Saturday over a challenge from a sitting state senator. Dame won the election by just three votes, 50-47, over Essex County Republican Sen. Russ Ingalls.
The vote was held during the state GOP’s biennial convention at a hotel on the Lake Champlain waterfront in Burlington. Also on Saturday, the party voted in a new vice chair — Rep. Zachary Harvey, R-Castleton — as well as a slate of other statewide officers who oversee the party’s electoral strategy and manage its finances. 
Harvey beat out two other candidates for the No. 2 job: Gregory Thayer of Rutland and William Kolb of Northfield. Dame had endorsed Kolb, over Harvey and Thayer, for the vice chair role.
The roughly 100 people who voted in Saturday’s election, which was held by secret ballot, were mostly members of county Republican committees from across the state.
Dame, who is from St. George, campaigned for what will be his third term as chair largely on the sweeping successes Vermont Republicans saw in last year’s election. The party dismantled Democratic supermajorities in both state House and Senate; national data, meanwhile, shows about half of all state legislative seats the GOP won in 2024 were in Vermont.
To be sure, the state party owed much of its success at the ballot box last fall to Republican Gov. Phil Scott, who was notably absent from Saturday’s proceedings. Republican Lt. Gov. John Rodgers was the highest-ranking state official in attendance Saturday and oversaw the chair and vice chair election.

Ingalls, meanwhile, contended in recent weeks that Dame had not done enough to raise money for the party or recruit down-ballot candidates. He wasted little time criticizing Dame during a speech pitching his candidacy to the room ahead of Saturday’s vote, charging that the state GOP was “broke” and had “no plan” to win more legislative seats.
Dame said in an interview that the party has about $18,000 on hand, while federal filings show the party had $27,000 in its accounts as of last month.
“Once Paul is paid and this event is paid for, (it’s) more than likely that there will be no money left in the till,” Ingalls said ahead of Saturday’s vote, while Dame, sitting nearby among the audience, shook his head.
In his speech, the Essex County senator also criticized a campaign missive that Dame sent out Thursday in which Dame referred to “cowards who support my opponent” who “tear us apart and trash our party to the press.”

Ingalls was formally nominated for the post on Saturday by former state GOP chair Rob Roper as well as Joe Gervais, who chairs the Bennington County GOP committee. Gervais had briefly thrown his own hat into the ring for chair last month before dropping out and endorsing Ingalls. 
Dame was nominated by Terry Burke, vice chair of the Rutland County GOP, as well as Roy Spaulding, the party chair in Windsor County.
In his pitch to the room on Saturday, Dame said he had modernized some of the party’s back-end technology in recent years and described himself as an effective communicator for the party’s message in the press. 
He took credit, during his speech, for leveraging a relationship with a Fox News journalist to, in his telling, help make controversial remarks that Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., made about immigrant labor over the summer “go viral.” 
“We are on a better path — in a better position — than we’ve been, in 20 years, and if you join me and we work together, you’ll be amazed by the change we can make with just two more years,” Dame said Saturday.
Senate Minority Leader Scott Beck, R-Caledonia, said in an interview after the vote that he agreed with Ingalls that fundraising was “a notable area of improvement” needed for the state GOP. But he indicated that he did not think either Dame, or Ingalls, would have done a substantially better job at tackling that issue than the other.
“I think either one of them would have made a great chair,” Beck said. “I think it’s always good that you have contests, instead of just appointments — or anointments.”

(Nathaniel Herz/KYUK and Northern Journal)After a remnant typhoon hammered Indigenous communities in Western Alaska last month, the state’s elected leaders have been fielding questions about how to protect the region that faces growing threats from storms as the climate warms.
At a news conference last week, Gov. Mike Dunleavy answered the question with one of his own.
“It’s a complex question to get the answers to. Not only: What do you do to make a community prepared for the future? But: Where do you get the money and how do you do that?” he said.
In fact, that question had already been answered, in a report released a year earlier.
The 200-page document was published by the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium with contributions from Dunleavy’s own administration. And it contains both detailed recommendations to boost village efforts to protect themselves, as well as a specific request for cash from U.S. Congress: filling an estimated $80 million-a-year funding gap, with money prioritized based on the severity of communities’ environmental threats.
Others have floated different ideas about where the money should come from, including a tax on Alaska’s oil companies.
But it’s clear that bigger budgets are needed to meet the need, and that the damage that occurred last month is evidence of failure by both the state and federal governments, according to Charitie Ropati, a Yup’ik climate advocate with roots in Western Alaska.
“We have incredible, capable leaders in our villages — incredible youth from those communities who have the capacity and the knowledge to lead,” said Ropatie. “The issue is that the funding needs to get into their hands.”
Scientists say Western Alaska’s villages are increasingly vulnerable to events like last month’s storm amid a changing climate, and will have to either better protect themselves against floodwaters or relocate entirely. It could cost $4.3 billion to protect infrastructure in Alaska’s threatened communities over the next half-century, according to a 2020 estimate cited in the consortium’s report.

While the damage and destruction from the recent storm were painful to experience, some advocates and community leaders are now describing them as a wakeup call — one that could help focus attention, and public money, on a problem that they say has failed to draw an adequate government response so far.
“The time for climate commissions and committees and reports and things like that has come and gone,” said Rick Steiner, an Anchorage-based advocate who’s long pushed Alaska lawmakers to take stronger action in response to climate change. “What we need is tens of millions of dollars available for these communities to do what they know they need to do — to either stay, or pick up and leave and relocate.”
State and federal policymakers have long identified coastal erosion, flooding and permafrost thaw as major problems in Alaska. U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens hosted a hearing in 2004 where tribal leaders warned of government inaction and a lack of coordination between state and federal agencies.
Two decades later, the tribal consortium’s report suggests that little has changed.
Indigenous villages along Alaska’s coasts — with tight budgets, overburdened staff and spotty internet — still struggle to access government programs for relocation or protection. Federal support remains fragmented and inadequate, the report found.
Raising the money required to relocate Newtok, a single Yup’ik village near the Bering Sea coast, required more than more than a decade of effort and more than 40 grants from 35 separate state, federal and nongovernmental sources, the report said. The cost of that project is now estimated to exceed $150 million, according to ProPublica.
Other villages have been unable to make use of government programs because of local cost-sharing requirements they can’t meet, caps on grant sizes and wariness by agencies to fund protection projects when villages are also making long-term plans to move.
“Trying to navigate all potential government programs to address environmental threats can be like trying to assemble a 10,000-piece puzzle without a picture printed on the pieces,” the report said.

None of the three members of the state’s congressional delegation agreed to an interview about the long-term outlook for protecting Western Alaska’s villages.
A spokesperson for U.S. Rep. Nick Begich declined a request.
A spokesperson for U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan pointed to a recent address the senator made at the Alaska Federation of Natives’ annual convention, where he touted tens of millions of dollars that the delegation had secured in various bills to fight environmental threats. He also endorsed an idea from a Western Alaska tribal group, the Association of Village Council Presidents, to create a regional emergency response center.
“We think this is a really good idea and we’re looking into it,” he said, while also acknowledging, “We have more work to do.”
U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, in a prepared statement, said she could understand “why many feel they were failed by their government.” She pointed to a decision by the Trump administration earlier this year to revoke a $20 million grant for erosion control for the tribal government in Kipnuk — the Western Alaska village hit hardest by the recent storm, with nearly all of its buildings destroyed.
Murkowski said she’s been working with the tribal health consortium “to ensure that any new framework truly reflects the needs of Alaska and our diverse communities, with a strong focus on mitigation and long-term resilience.” After the storm, she said she spoke on the U.S. Senate floor “to remind my colleagues that our role in Congress is to provide protection and infrastructure to communities that cannot shoulder these challenges alone.”
“Every single displaced person is an American whom we have a responsibility to support,” she said. “Not only in the aftermath of a disaster, but by ensuring that the next ‘once-in-a-generation’ storm doesn’t tear another community apart.”
‘A recipe for disaster’
Advocates point out that the low-lying locations of many Alaska villages can be traced back to  the era of early colonization. At the time, Native people were drawn from more adaptable, seasonal settlements to permanent communities near schools run by the federal government or religious missions.
That history creates an obligation for the federal government to assist threatened Indigenous communities today, said Ropati.
“There needs to be some type of monetary reparations for what we’re seeing in our region. We didn’t choose to live in these flood-prone areas,” Ropati said. “Our children were forced to go to these schools, and it leads to realities like this.”

The tribal consortium’s report says that statewide, more than 140 Alaska Native communities face “some degree of infrastructure damage” from erosion, flooding and permafrost thaw.
The settlements in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta that were pummeled last month are among the most vulnerable. The region, a flat plain at the edge of the Bering Sea, faces an array of interconnected environmental threats stemming from climate change, according to scientists.
Sea level rise alone will cause monthly flooding in the delta within a few decades, and 10 of the 18 outermost villages face relocation, according to another major scientific study published earlier this year with federal, tribal and academic contributors.
“You throw on the permafrost collapsing and reducing the height of these plateaus these villages are built on, and it’s a recipe for disaster that just can’t be ignored,” Torre Jorgenson, a Fairbanks-based landscape ecologist who worked on the study, said in an interview. But, he said: “The magnitude of the problem and the magnitude of the costs are such that our institutions just can’t adequately grapple with it.”
The tribal consortium’s report, meanwhile, lays out three basic options for threatened communities.
They can better protect infrastructure in existing locations by building up shorelines, improving drainage and elevating buildings above flood levels. Where that’s not possible, villages can build new infrastructure at nearby sites, or move existing infrastructure there, in what’s known as a “managed retreat.”

Full relocation is a last resort.
All of those options are costly, and the report contains a litany of obstacles to communities raising the necessary cash.
Villages often have a small, overworked staff that’s mismatched to the huge amount of work that goes into grant writing and community decisionmaking around relocation, the report says.
Federal programs, meanwhile, prioritize grants to communities that can show they have bigger staff capacity. Some programs won’t fund larger regional or statewide partners that typically have the technical expertise to assist smaller villages with resilience and relocation projects, the report says.
“We should not (have to) be writing grants to protect our communities,” the report quotes one Nome-based tribal leader, Melanie Bahnke, as saying.
‘We know what the science says’
Meanwhile, Steiner, the Anchorage advocate, is pushing Alaska’s state government to take a more active role in supporting communities threatened by climate change.
The state’s commitment to that task has fluctuated over the years. Following a fall storm that forced the evacuation of the Northwest Alaska village of Kivalina in 2007, former Gov. Sarah Palin created a climate change team. But the administration of her successor, Sean Parnell, disbanded a key working group that was part of that effort, the consortium’s report said.
Parnell’s successor, Bill Walker, established his own climate leadership team after more than two years in office, and his successor, Mike Dunleavy, abolished the groupin 2019.
Steiner is now calling on Alaska leaders to convene a “climate disaster summit” in the next few months, where participants could draft a five-year plan to protect the state’s communities for the next century.
“We know what the science says. We know what the forecasts are. This is going to keep happening,” Steiner said. “The real tragedy of Halong would be if we fail to look forward and apply the lessons, prepare for the next storm and the next storm.”
Steiner also wants lawmakers to levy a 20-cents-per-barrel tax on Alaska’s oil industry to help pay for needed projects — a proposal he’s been pushing for decades that could generate some $35 million a year.
State leaders haven’t formally endorsed Steiner’s ideas. But they have expressed a degree of openness to longer-term planning for storms and other natural disasters expected to hit Alaska with increasing frequency.
“We’re trying to find the money to do these sorts of things, and it’s very important,” state Senate President Gary Stevens of Kodiak said in a brief phone interview this week. But, he added, “we’ve got limited funds.”
Bryce Edgmon of Dillingham, the House speaker, said it’s premature to comment on Steiner’s specific proposals. But he added that state policymakers do need to put a greater emphasis on planning for disaster management — particularly given the increasing likelihood of damaging storms in the future.
A spokesperson for Dunleavy did not respond to questions about Steiner’s ideas.
Ropati, the Yup’ik climate advocate, said the widespread damage caused by the most recent storm is evidence the state and federal governments are “failing”  communities like hers, “and have historically failed our people,” she said.

She pointed out that some of the evacuees from the region’s hardest hit villages may be forced to permanently resettle in urban Alaska communities, severing their ties to the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta and its subsistence traditions.
Averting those kinds of outcomes will require help from outside the region, Ropati said. But the work needs to happen in a way that “upholds our rights as Indigenous people.”
“We need everyone to work together,” she said. “And to do it in a way where communities on the front lines have the autonomy to make the decisions.”

Nothing could be further from the truth.,"HOW LONG IS too long to wait for all subway lines on the MBTA to be connected?  
100 years?  
This December, it will be 101 years since the Boston Globe first reported on the idea to connect the MBTA’s Red and Blue lines, noting that riders “using either the East Boston Tunnel [the Blue Line] or the Cambridge Subway [the Red Line] could change cars at Charles St, instead of transferring at Scollay Square and Park Street, the most congested parts of the whole system … This would have a distinct tendency to remove this congestion and would therefore be a highly desirable end in itself.” 
A century later, the Globe’s description remains accurate: The Red and Blue lines remain the only two subway lines on the T that do not connect. Riders must make two zigzag transfers, using the Green or Orange lines, to travel between them. Not only is it inconvenient for riders, it also increases congestion and decreases capacity at Park Street and Government Center. These pressures on system capacity will only worsen with time.  
It’s easy to look at the short length of the proposed Red-Blue Connector – less than half a mile – and mistake it for a project with small impact. Nothing could be further from the truth. Connecting the Red Line and Blue Line is a small project with a huge impact, and the time to do it is now, as Massachusetts General Hospital is in the process of rebuilding its campus facing Cambridge Street above the proposed subway connection.  
Today, many of the region’s major job centers and key destinations, like the Longwood Medical Area, Back Bay, and Downtown Boston, can all be reached from every corner of the rapid transit network with at most a single transfer. Employers in these areas (and indeed anywhere along the Green and Orange lines) can therefore leverage excellent transit access to attract talent from across the region.  
Employers in Cambridge, however – including in Kendall Square, one of Greater Boston’s biggest job and innovation hubs – are systemically disadvantaged in this respect. Unlike their peers, these businesses, labs, and schools can’t effectively appeal to some of the densest neighborhoods in the region, in East Boston, Revere, and surrounding communities. Both employers and residents suffer from suboptimal access to transit and opportunities, due to the gap separating the Red and Blue lines. 
Many riders endure this tedious commute nevertheless, straining all other subway lines in the process. As described by the Globe a century ago, these riders have no choice but to squeeze on to already-crowded Green and Orange Line trains, and already-crowded platforms at Park Street and Downtown Crossing stations, all because of this 2,500-foot gap in our subway system. 
The Red-Blue Connector closes this gap. It balances capacity and mobility on our rapid transit network, gives Kendall employers the benefit of better access for potential employees, and gives Blue Line riders better access to jobs in Kendall and elsewhere along the Red Line. Even riders who never set foot on the Blue Line would benefit, as crowding is reduced on trains and platforms throughout downtown. 
The Red-Blue Connector also builds for the future. A total of 10,000 new units of housing are planned for Suffolk Downs, at the East Boston-Revere border: Red-Blue allows Cambridge employers to compete for those workers.  
Suffolk Downs also plans to have office space for 25,000 jobs. Red-Blue makes those jobs more readily accessible by transit to residents along the entirety of the Red Line corridor, from the South Shore, Dorchester and South Boston, to Cambridge, Somerville, Arlington, Belmont, and other communities west of Boston. Cities across Greater Boston are strengthened by connecting the Red and Blue lines. 
But Red-Blue – like all transit – isn’t just about jobs. Extending the Blue Line to the Red Line’s Charles/MGH stop provides patients and health care workers alike direct access to one of the best hospitals in the country.  
Connecting the Red and Blue lines would also cut down on vehicular traffic to Logan Airport. Many travelers using the Red Line, from the entire length of the corridor, are discouraged from seeking access to Logan Airport via the Silver Line bus from South Station as they must endure traffic in the Ted Williams Tunnel. These same travelers often opt for an Uber or Lyft to Logan today.  
With Red-Blue, they would have the benefit of a convenient and reliable two-seat ride to Logan terminal shuttles. No harbor tunnel traffic, no rideshare surge pricing, no missed flights – just convenience via transit. Reducing traffic congestion and emissions in East Boston, an environmental justice community, would be another signature benefit of this long-overdue connection.  
Red-Blue meets the MBTA’s short-term goals of increasing system capacity and resilience, and shouldn’t be thought of as a long-term project. Phil Eng, the MBTA general manager and the state’s interim transportation secretary, in a recent interview, said he supported investments “within our existing infrastructure, [to] build up more resiliency in our system.”  
A new connection at Charles/MGH unlocks additional capacity across the entire system, and enhances resilience by offering redundant transfer points, especially when the Green and Orange lines are suspended for maintenance and upgrades. Connecting the Red and Blue lines fits comfortably within Eng’s vision of supporting rider needs, regional access, and state of good repair. 
Beyond addressing the urgent needs of the present and building for the future, Red-Blue presents an unprecedented opportunity to integrate Mass. General Hospital directly with a new transit station. But Mass General Brigham, MGH’s parent entity, is moving quickly, with work on the second of the new MGH clinical care buildings on Cambridge Street likely to begin in the next 18 months – just around the corner. 
Fortunately, we are not starting from square one. Red-Blue has been well-studied for decades, including as recently as 2021, when its cost was estimated at $850 million.  
In 2018, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation released an update to the 2010 Draft Environmental Impact Report, finding that, unlike many expensive subway projects that utilize tunnel boring machines (TBMs), Red-Blue could instead leverage the cost-effective “cut-and-cover” method.  
Cambridge Street is nearly double the width of the proposed tunnel, significantly reducing utility relocation challenges and providing additional space at street level to accommodate construction. The 2018 update also found that using the top-down cut-and-cover method would enable the full restoration of the sidewalk and roadway early in the process, returning the street to normalcy while work continues underground.  
A well-designed, value-engineered Red-Blue Connector would most likely cost no more than $1 billion through completion. Its significant benefits in comparison – access to key destinations, economic growth, and reductions in emissions – make Red-Blue a low-risk, high-value proposition. 
Municipal and state leaders representing Boston and Cambridge should direct the MBTA to develop a credible plan for completion of the project by 2030. The plan should also aim for 100 percent design and preparation of construction procurement documents as soon as possible.  
Full funding for the project should come from the Commonwealth; waiting or hoping for federal funds, especially in the current political context, is unrealistic and simply a way to delay the project. The city of Boston and the MBTA also need to agree on a location for the connector’s ventilation system – a decision that remains a stubborn barrier to progress – as a matter of urgency.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-08 17:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"Top PURA attorney accuses colleagues of defamation, threatens lawsuit",John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/08/pura-general-counsel-muska-defamation-letter/,Scott Muska sent a cease and desist letter alleging PURA's executive secretary and two commissioners on the authority damaged his reputation.,"A top attorney at the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority has accused three of his colleagues, including the agency’s executive secretary, of defamation following the release of private emails in which the attorney was accused of withholding public recordings and lying under oath.
Scott Muska, who serves as general counsel for PURA, sent a cease and desist letter on Oct. 30 to Executive Secretary Jeff Gaudiosi as well as Commissioner Michael Caron and retired Commissioner Jack Betkowski alleging that all three had damaged his reputation by spreading false and malicious statements. 
The letter specifically referenced an email sent from Gaudiosi to Caron and another commissioner, David Arconti, in early October in which Gaudiosi said he no longer felt comfortable reporting to Muska and asked to be able to report directly to the commissioners, instead. 
Gaudiosi went on to accuse Muska of engaging in “behavior that is not up to the ethical standards of a state agency” by withholding documents — which Gaudiosi said had prevented him from accurately responding to records requests — and giving “misleading and false statements” about those records while under oath.
The email was later published on a blog run by former state lawmaker Kevin Rennie on Oct. 24.
“These statements and are false and were made willfully and recklessly,” Muska said, adding “their subsequent publication and intentional disclosure to media outlets constitute defamation per se.” 
The letter further calls on each of the recipients to retract any defamatory statements within 10 days, or face potential “legal remedies.” The letter also directs the recipients to preserve any relevant communications in case they are needed as evidence in a future lawsuit.
The letter is the latest in a series of controversies that have rattled PURA, which is tasked with reviewing and approving rates paid by Connecticut customers of electric, gas and water utilities. In October, former PURA Chair Marissa Gillett stepped down after facing several lawsuits from utility companies accusing her of bias and wielding unilateral control over the authority during her 6-year tenure.
Her replacement, Thomas Wiehl, was tapped by Gov. Ned Lamont along with three other new commissioners last month. Still, the lawsuits and threats of more litigation haven’t stopped.
Betkoski, who retired in February after a lengthy career at the authority, said Friday that he believed Muska’s claims had no merit and that he was not involved in any of the statements mentioned in the letter.
“I am very saddened to see the turmoil at the place I loved for 27 years,” he said in an interview with the Connecticut Mirror. “I hope with the new leadership there that this will be something they put behind us.”
Caron, who was one of the recipients of Gaudiosi’s email, told CT Mirror he had not shared the email with anyone, or made other defamatory remarks about Muska. “I’ve never done anything the letter suggests,” he said.
Neither Muska nor a spokesperson for PURA responded to requests for comment. Attempts to reach Gaudiosi for comment were unsuccessful. 
Earlier this week, the Hartford Courant reported that state Attorney General William Tong’s office had hired an outside law firm, Shipman & Goodwin, to conduct a investigation into allegations of misconduct at PURA, including examining whether employees complied with the Freedom of Information Act and court-ordered discovery requests.
That contract was signed on Oct. 31, a day after Muska’s letter was sent. 
A spokesperson for the attorney general’s office declined to comment Friday.
Shipman & Goodwin is a Hartford-based firm with a $270,000-a-year retainer to conduct outside legal work for the state. Last year, the firm was hired to conduct an investigation into the misuse of state vehicles by staffers in the governor’s office.
The attorney general’s office is currently representing PURA in a pair of active lawsuits brought by utility companies.
One of those cases is joint lawsuit by Eversource and United Illuminating’s parent company, Avangrid, alleging that Gillett overstepped her authority while leading PURA. Commissioner Caron was deposed in that case on Wednesday, during which he revealed that he had been sent Muska’s cease and desist letter, according to a transcript of the deposition.
The other case — a challenge of PURA’s denial of rate increases sought by two gas companies owned by Avangrid — has hinged on allegations that Gillett helped to write an op-ed critical of the utility companies and then covered up her involvement. Gillett has repeatedly denied the allegations. 
The judge in that case, Matthew Budzik, has been probing whether attorneys representing PURA, including Muska, withheld information from the court about Gillett’s contacts with the authors of the op-ed and the auto-delete settings on her phone.
A hearing in that case is currently scheduled for Nov. 12.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1027_SR_Pura_042-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-08 12:57:45.572241

Here's how to help.","When Hurricane Melissa hit Jamaica and other parts of the Caribbean, the destruction rippled far beyond the islands. In Connecticut, where Caribbean ties run deep, people are stepping up to help.
Across the state, churches, nonprofits, and community groups are collecting supplies, organizing fundraisers, and coordinating with relief efforts to get aid where it’s needed most. Some are sending barrels of food and clothing. Others are raising money for rebuilding and recovery.
For many here, the response is personal. Friends, family, and hometowns are among those hardest hit. 
Sen. Saud Anwar, D-South Windsor, said at a Nov. 7 press conference:
“For the United States, our responsibility is perhaps a little bit more … if you look at the total impact on the climate by the Caribbean islands, it’s negligible, but the impact on the climate by the U.S. has been very high. We have a responsibility to react … because we are, collectively as a world, responsible for what’s happening now.”
Why Connecticut is responding
Connecticut has one of the largest Caribbean populations in New England, with thousands of residents tracing roots to Jamaica, Trinidad, Haiti and other islands. Many still have family and friends directly affected by Hurricane Melissa. Because of those ties, local organizations are mobilizing with urgency.
How to help
Experts say the best way to provide help right now is to donate to organizations that already have operations on the ground. Financial donations allow these groups to quickly purchase and distribute the resources most urgently needed.

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-08 16:19:54+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mississippi is among the states where people are waiting for SNAP food aid for November,Associated Press,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/08/snap-mississippi-wait-november-food-aid/,"People in some U.S. states are able to buy groceries with federally funded SNAP benefits, while those in other states — including Mississippi — were still waiting for November food benefits that had been delayed by a protracted legal battle over the federal government shutdown.","People in some U.S. states are able to buy groceries with federally funded SNAP benefits, while those in other states — including Mississippi — are still waiting for November food aid that is delayed by a protracted legal battle over the federal government shutdown.
“If you need more food resources during this shutdown, we encourage you to reach out to the food bank that serves your local area to locate food assistance near you,” the Mississippi Department of Human Services said in an Oct. 24 press release. The department had not updated that statement on its website by Saturday.
The Trump administration initially said last month that it would not fund Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits for November because of the shutdown. The twists and turns since have exacerbated uncertainty for the nearly 1 in 8 Americans who receive monthly SNAP benefits to spend at grocery stores and farmer’s markets.
On Friday, some states began issuing full monthly SNAP benefits to people, a day after a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to provide the funds.
But Friday night, Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson temporarily paused that judicial order to allow time for an appeals court to decide whether to issue a more lasting halt. Jackson acted because she handles emergency matters from Massachusetts.
How are SNAP recipients faring?
Nearly 42 million Americans receive SNAP benefits, formerly known as food stamps, for help buying groceries. Most have incomes below the poverty line, which is about $32,000 for a family of four.

An individual can receive a monthly maximum food benefit of nearly $300 and a family of four up to nearly $1,000, although many receive less than that under a formula that takes into consideration their income.
The delay in payments has led to a surge in demand at food banks and pantries across the country, as well as long lines for free meals or drive-thru giveaways.
Some states have provided emergency funding to food banks to help them respond to the increased need. Some states also used their own dollars to fund direct payments to people while the federal benefits were in limbo.
In Mississippi, leaders of the state chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics are calling on Republican Gov. Tate Reeves to put state money toward food aid. He has not publicly responded.
“Families already struggling to make ends meet will be forced to choose between food, utilities, and medicine,” chapter President Dr. Patricia Tibbs and Vice President Dr. David Reeves wrote in a public letter to the governor in late October. “Hospitals and clinics will inevitably bear the burden of increased malnutrition and preventable illness. Our children, the future of this state, will suffer the most.”
Where have people already received benefits?
Whether SNAP beneficiaries see money on their electronic benefits transfer cards depends on where they live.
In Hawaii, Oregon and Wisconsin, officials worked quickly after a judge ordered full benefit payments Thursday to instruct their EBT providers to process the full payments.

“We moved with haste once we verified everything,” Joseph Campos II, deputy director of Hawaii’s Department of Human Services, told The Associated Press.
Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, a Democrat, said state employees “worked through the night” to issue full November benefits “to make sure every Oregon family relying on SNAP could buy groceries” over the weekend.
Officials in California, Kansas, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Washington also confirmed that some SNAP recipients were issued their full November payments on Friday.
Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, said more than 250,00 households that missed their regular monthly SNAP payment during the first week of November received their full amount on Friday. The remaining beneficiaries would receive their November funds on their regularly scheduled dates later this month — if distribution does not remain blocked by legal challenges.
The Trump administration said in a legal filing with the Supreme Court that “there is no ready mechanism for the government to recover those funds” that already have been distributed.
How long might residents elsewhere wait?
Before Jackson ordered a pause, Colorado and Massachusetts had said SNAP participants could receive their full November payments as soon as Saturday. New York had said access to full SNAP benefits should begin by Sunday. New Hampshire had said full benefits should be available over the weekend.
And Arizona, Connecticut and Minnesota all had said that full SNAP benefits should be accessible in the coming days.
Whether people actually will receive those benefits on their EBT cards remains unclear.
For peoples in some other states, the wait appears likely to extend into next week. Numerous state officials said they had been waiting for further guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP.
What has been holding up November benefits?
Because of the federal government shutdown, the Trump administration originally had said SNAP benefits would not be available in November. After two judges ruled the administration could not skip November’s benefits entirely, the administration said it would use an emergency reserve fund containing more than $4.6 billion to provide partial benefits in November.
A judge on Thursday said that wasn’t good enough, and ordered other funds to be used to make the full monthly payment. The Trump administration appealed, asking a higher court to suspend any orders that require it to spend more money than is available in the contingency fund. That is what led to Jackson’s temporary hold issued late Friday.

According to unofficial results from the Iowa Secretary of State’s Office, 18 passed, 15 had a majority in favor but not the required 60% supermajority, and 10 failed to reach 50%.

(Photo by Jeff Morrison)Forty-three Iowa school districts held bond referendums Tuesday. According to unofficial results from the Iowa Secretary of State’s Office, 18 passed, 15 had a majority in favor but not the required 60% supermajority, and 10 failed to reach 50%.
The middle category has five districts of all sizes — Cedar Rapids, Easton Valley, Hinton, Independence, and Sergeant Bluff-Luton — receiving more than 58% but less than 60% support.
The 43 districts voted on a combined $1,435,950,000 in general obligation bonds. (That includes Atlantic’s $22.5 million bond for school construction, which passed, but not its $18.5 million sales tax revenue bond for a multipurpose facility, which failed.)
Gladbrook-Reinbeck’s third try in four years to pass a bond issue to replace the century-old school in Reinbeck succeeded by fewer than 20 votes Tuesday.
The $17.3 million bond issue will go toward construction of 15 classrooms, a media center, a family and consumer sciences room, secure entrances, and HVAC and electrical systems throughout the school complex in Reinbeck. It does not replace the auditorium or secondary gymnasium, which will remain in use.

Precinct-level returns starkly illustrate the continued schism in the district. In the Grundy and Black Hawk county portions, voters were about 9-to-1 in favor. In the Tama County precinct containing Gladbrook, voters were about 9-to-1 against. The vote in the northern tier of townships in Tama County, between Gladbrook and Reinbeck, was split exactly in half.
Overall, 1,934 votes were cast in G-R, with 1,177 in favor and 757 against. That total is about 500 votes fewer than last year.

Signs opposing the bond were plentiful throughout Gladbrook. Most were small. A few were big. Many were hand-written. Half a dozen were on the street connecting downtown with G-R’s football field. One particularly biting version had six big letters — VOTE NO — against the background of a photograph of the Gladbrook school building in mid-demolition in June 2022.
The Union school district of La Porte City and Dysart, trying a reduced version of a 2024 referendum that failed by six votes, did slightly worse this time around. The $18.5 million referendum was for HVAC improvements at the high school, classroom renovations, various infrastructure repairs at both the high school and middle school, and a bus barn.
Union had 1,954 votes cast overall, with 1,098 in favor and 856 against, which is about 56% in favor and 75 votes short of a supermajority. Turnout in the off-off-year election was drastically down from last year’s bond vote in a presidential election year.

Both East Marshall and West Marshall succeeded where last year’s referendums failed. East Marshall revised its proposal to include more definitive options for the Gilman site after students are relocated to Laurel and Le Grand. The century-old part of the Gilman school will be demolished. The section of West Marshall’s elementary in State Center that is also a century old will be replaced with a two-story structure. West Marshall will build a career and technical education addition at the grades 6-12 campus as well.
A western Iowa bond issue reflected a deep divide centered around loss of a building. The IKM-Manning district is trying, yet again, to facilitate construction of classrooms at the school in Manning that would result in tiny Irwin losing its PK-3 school. The easternmost part of the district — mostly Carroll County, where Manning is — carried the bond by a 9-to-1 margin. The western two-thirds — mostly the former Irwin-Kirkman-Manilla — rejected it nearly 3-to-1.

Multiple school bonds across the state included a component similar to Aplington-Parkersburg’s “secure front entry with pass-through visitor check-in.” This goes beyond simply relocating the main office to near the entrance or even buzzing someone in after seeing video. Visitors during the school day must enter the office and check in with a staff member in person before being granted access to the building.
For the fourth time in eight years, a district submitted the largest school bond referendum in Iowa history. Des Moines’ $265 million this year topped Cedar Rapids’ $220 million in 2023, Waukee’s $205 million in 2020 and Iowa City’s $191.5 million in 2017. All passed except Cedar Rapids’.
Cedar Rapids’ $117 million bond this year, substantially reduced from 2023, improved greatly in percentage of “yes” votes but fell short of a supermajority by 165 votes, less than 1%. Dubuque’s $70 million bond to build a replacement middle school failed as well, but the district says it will be closing Jefferson Middle School at some point anyway.
A variable introduced now that bond elections are restricted to November is the state volleyball tournament. Seven school districts with bond votes had teams in the tournament in Coralville. Three — Aplington-Parkersburg, Gladbrook-Reinbeck, and Hinton — played Tuesday.
It’s worth noting, then, that 141 absentee/early votes were cast in Grundy County on the G-R bond — 130 in favor, 11 against. (Absentee ballots by mail had to be requested by Oct. 20, but there was an in-person option at the courthouse in Grundy Center.) Hinton’s bond lost by 10 votes and wasn’t even the closest margin of the night. The Sergeant Bluff-Luton bond fell eight votes short of the 60% threshold, and Easton Valley, on the opposite side of the state, saw its bond fail by six votes.

(Photo by Gregory Adams/Getty Images)Will nuclear waste travel all the way from Ontario, Canada to a site about an hour drive from Salt Lake City? 
An interstate panel may consider a resolution later this month on whether to allow EnergySolutions to import up to 1.3 million cubic yards of low-level radioactive waste from Canada, a move worrying local advocates who argue this may be the stepping stone into accepting other types of nuclear waste.
Waste that is accepted to be buried at the Clive facility is Class A, the least hazardous radioactive waste under U.S. standards. That includes items that staff working with radioactive materials wear, like gloves, shoe coverings, cleaning materials and tools. But the proposal can still be hazardous, said Carmen Valdez, senior policy associate at the Healthy Environment Alliance of Utah.

“Any level of radiation can be harmful to humans. There is no safe level, frankly,” Valdez said. “And our concern is the lack of public transparency from the company in bringing in international waste, which can lead to international security issues.”
According to EnergySolutions, the type of material being proposed for this project is identical to the low-level radioactive waste the facility has managed for over 30 years.
“While located across the nations’ northern border, these facilities in Ontario currently provide electricity to customers in the United States,” the company said in a statement.
But, environmental groups are still hesitant about the proposal since public input hasn’t been extensive. Especially with this being an unprecedented situation for the compact. 
Public comment is allowed in the special meetings where the NorthWest Interstate Compact — a group of states that cooperates on low-level radioactive waste management — is considering EnergySolutions’ petition. But, not many people from the community are keeping tabs on the body, Valdez said. It was only after learning about the discussion from a mailer sent to a former executive that Healthy Environment Alliance of Utah advocates began watching the process.
“There was no announcement, there was nothing on the Division of Waste Management and Radiation Control Board’s meetings, things like that,” Valdez said. “So it was kind of per chance that we saw this and started watching it, and have been attending that.”
A big item on the advocates’ list of concerns, Valdez said, is public safety along the transportation routes for the waste, which is set to travel via rail. 
Dave Noriega, a spokesperson for the Utah Department of Environmental Quality, said that “no significant, additional safety measures are necessary with this proposed project since EnergySolutions has extensive experience disposing of Class A waste.”
The state, he said, has robust regulations that minimize risks to the public and the Department of Environmental Quality will continue to regulate all low-level radioactive waste.
Low-level radioactivity standards
Some aspects of the draft resolution are still uncertain, Valdez said. For one, will EnergySolutions classify waste coming from Canada according to U.S. or Canadian standards?
“We’re concerned about what that type of waste is because we’re just hearing that it’s related to the nuclear fuel industry,” Valdez said. “It’s mixed waste. But there’s no clarification on that.”



Let us know what you think...


 


Noriega said the arriving waste needs to be documented as Class A before it can be shipped to Utah. 
Casey Hill, a lobbyist representing EnergySolutions, said in a legislative hearing for a bill updating waste facilities’ licensing requirements that EnergySolutions’ Clive facility takes non-concentrated amounts of depleted uranium and has since it opened. But that wouldn’t change with an expanded Clive facility.
“Class A waste, as it’s currently determined, is what we can take in this facility. This would not be able to, as of right now, due to the fact that we don’t have a license to take concentrated depleted uranium, we would not be able to take that under this legislation,” Hill said.
This year the Utah Legislature also removed its specific nuclear waste classification to instead adopt federal definitions. According to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, depleted uranium is categorized as Class A. But, currently, there’s no indication that the material will be transported from Canada.
Still, advocates worry about the legislative change, especially now that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is reviewing its rules under a White House order.
“What happens with aligning to the (Nuclear Regulatory Commission) is now what we’re hearing is that the waste will be determined at the site,” Valdez said, “and if it meets Class A then it can come into Utah, no matter what.”
Six out of 8 states that make up the NorthWest Interstate Compact have to approve the plans. Utah would have veto power, Kristen Schwab, chair of the compact said in an October meeting.
In a presentation, EnergySolutions said the state supports the company’s desire to dispose of low-level radioactive waste from Canada at the Clive site.
The Utah Legislature approved an adjustment this year that would allow the state to get up to $30 million in tax for the expansion application, which would be deposited into the Energy Research Fund, and will support Utah’s big nuclear plans.
“The governor is in favor, the Legislature is in favor, and they want this to happen,” Valdez said about the proposal, “but there’s no talk about the general public and if they want this waste coming into our country and into our state too.”

For the past year, families in need of child care assistance in Indiana have been sitting on a waitlist that has ballooned from 3,000 to 30,000 kids. It’s still climbing — and no one is coming off of it.
Emily Pike, the executive director of New Hope For Families in Bloomington, which cares for children experiencing homelessness, can’t remember a time when no families were coming off the waitlist. Before this year, she said, low-income families could expect to be on the list just a few weeks before they found placement at a center that took child care vouchers, which for most brought their costs down to zero.
But now, state officials project that no kids will come off the list until at least 2027.

That isn’t the only drastic change. In September, Indiana moved to lower its child care reimbursement rates, meaning the state will pay providers 10 to 35 percent less to care for low-income kids. Centers have had to pass those costs on to parents through higher co-payments.
Already, centers have closed classrooms as a result. Workers have been fired. Parents have pulled their children out of care.
Versions of this story have quietly been playing out across the nation, including in Arkansas, Oregon, Maryland and New Jersey. The reasons appear to be the same: States used a historic infusion of COVID-19 relief funds to improve their child care systems over the past few years, and now that the money has run dry, some can no longer keep their child care reimbursement rates up. To keep funds going to families already receiving state assistance, states have stopped accepting new children into their voucher programs and implemented waitlists.
At the same time, they’re facing cuts — or upcoming ones — in federal funding.
President Donald Trump’s tariff hikes are constricting budgets in states, like Indiana, that rely on international trade, and his Big Beautiful Bill spending package will dramatically cut funding for Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Scrambling to fill those new holes in their coffers, states have looked to child care.
“A lot of states are facing major budget pressures for various reasons and those are unlikely to get better, and very likely to get worse, as a result of the Big Beautiful Bill, said Elliot Haspel, a national child care expert. “In some ways it’s all the more alarming that states are doing this before they are feeling the full effects.”
In Arkansas, where the state proposed leveling reimbursement rates, the waitlist for child care vouchers is frozen.
Maryland has stopped offering new applicants child care vouchers because it has more children enrolled right now than it can financially support. The state would need more funding to shrink its waitlist, and legislators have said that is not likely to come because of cuts in federal funding.
In Oregon, the legislature has slashed the budget for its free preschool program by 10 percent due to poor economic projections for the corporate tax that funds the state’s program. The reason for those poor projections? Tariffs hitting a state economy that relies heavily on international trade. An estimated 640 kids will no longer get free preschool.
Helene Stebbins, the executive director of the Alliance for Early Success, a group that brings together early childhood advocacy at the state level, said some states “did not prepare for the very predictable end for the COVID dollars,” while others, like New Mexico and Connecticut, have instead invested more state money in child care after the funds ended.
“It’s a choice about how they collect and redistribute revenue and budget,” she said.
In 2021, child care got a $39 billion infusion after 16,000 child care centers and homes closed during the pandemic and more than 370,000 workers lost their jobs. It was money states used for a whole host of things, including paying providers more, raising wages and improving infrastructure. The last of those dollars expired in September 2024. Many advocates in 2023 warned that a child care cliff was coming. Years later, it’s now here.
In Indiana, the state said its recent changes were largely due to a projected $225 million funding gap created by “unsustainable” use of COVID relief funds by the prior governor’s administration. In 2021, the funds allowed the state to pay providers about 20 percent more to care for low-income kids and expanded the eligibility requirements, which led to more families enrolling in child care vouchers. But after the funds expired, Indiana could no longer cover those rates, even after it invested an additional $147 million in child care earlier this year.
The state declined an interview on the changes, but a spokesperson for the Office of Early Childhood and Out-of-School Learning told The 19th that Indiana is also battling lower revenue projections in part due to tariffs. Indiana is the fourth highest exporter of goods to China in the United States. Cuts to Medicaid and SNAP that will take effect in 2027 are very likely also going to affect the child care budget, a spokesperson said.
In a news release, Adam Alson, the director of Indiana’s early childhood office, said the state decided to focus its funding on the families already receiving aid. He reasoned it out like this: “There is only one pot of money — we could either protect providers or kids, and we chose kids.”
But if centers have to fire teachers, close classrooms or close entire buildings, children will also be impacted, multiple Indiana child care providers told The 19th. Most of the children on vouchers in Indiana are Black or Latinx kids from single-parent households. About 60 percent of those families are living below the poverty level and nearly all are working. If those children can’t be in care, their parents face missing out on work or losing jobs altogether.
“When policymakers decide to cut something like this, what they’re saying is, ‘Oh people will figure it out.’ I think they expect caregivers to figure it out,” Pike said. “It’s a dramatic misunderstanding of what the field does, because at the end of the day, we as a society make choices about what’s most important to us. When we choose not to fund early learning we are demonstrating real short sightedness.”
Cori Kerns, an early childhood advocate and staff consultant at Little Duckling Early Learning Schools in Indianapolis, said families there are seeing their co-pays rise from $5 to $15 a week, and even that modest increase is having a big impact. So big, in fact, that the centers had to consolidate their two buildings into one because so many parents stopped bringing their kids in after the rate hikes. The center is surviving only because the community has chipped in to cover electricity bills and rent payments.
Across Indiana, at least 36 centers have closed entirely since the start of the year, said Hanan Osman, the executive director for Indiana Association for the Education of Young Children, which is tracking closures.
Arkansas faces a similar situation: Providers were staring down as many as 400 layoffs and potential closures due to significant reimbursement rate cuts proposed by the state designed to spread the money across more kids and lower the number of children on the waitlist. The list now numbers 1,100 and has also been frozen since the start of the year.
In September, the state notified providers that it would no longer pay out higher reimbursement rates to higher-quality centers. In Arkansas, centers are rated for quality from 1 to 6 — the higher their quality rating, the more money the state puts in to cover the cost of providing that care, often because the provider is also spending more on curriculum, teacher pay and materials. The state then proposed that every provider will get a flat fee. Higher co-payments for families kicked in October 1, and the reimbursement rate change was delayed to November 1 after significant public opposition to the plan.
Last month Arkansas Secretary of Education Jacob Oliva said uncertainty around the federal government shutdown was part of it, and so was an unexpected reduction in the federal funds the state receives for child care due to a change in how state allowances are calculated. That led to a realization that the voucher program was significantly over budget, to the tune of as much as $9 million more a month, because so many more children were receiving services.
In late October, a task force of child care experts presented recommendations to the state to scale back the cuts, most of which have now been implemented. Instead of a new flat reimbursement rate, providers rated 3 to 6 in quality will still get higher rates, albeit not as high as they were previously.
It’s all been incredibly stressful for McKinley Hess, the executive director of Conway Cradle Care in Conway, Arkansas, which primarily serves teen parents. In the past, those teens had been able to bypass the waitlist because they are considered a priority population, but Arkansas removed the exception at the end of August. The center is a level 3 of 6 for quality, but under the proposed cuts she would have seen a cut of $20 less per infant per day and $16 per toddler per day. Now, the cuts will be less dramatic: $5 a day each for infants and toddlers.
Still, “it is a disaster,” Hess said bluntly. The center had been covering all costs for eight families who are sitting on the state’s waitlist for assistance and plans to continue doing so until those families come off it.
“While the new reimbursement rates are not as detrimental as the initially proposed cuts, our most pressing challenge remains the number of adolescent parents who are waitlisted and unable to receive assistance,” Hess said. “For our adolescent parents, access to child care is the bridge between continuing their education and being forced to drop out of school.”
In Mountain Home, Arkansas, Jill Wilson, the executive director of Open Arms Learning Center, was looking at a $32,000-a-month shortfall from the rate changes. Now the shortfall will be more like $3,200. Her center is accredited 5 stars out of 6, a quality level that she earned through significant investments like specialized curriculum for each class room — $4,000 each for 17 rooms.
Already, she had to cut two staff positions and combine classrooms.
“I have been here for 20 years and it’s never been like this,” Wilson said. “I feel like the rug has been pulled out from under me.”
For Pike in Indiana, the situation goes far beyond the dollars and cents of a state budget. For the families she serves, access to child care is the key to retaining a job and moving out of homelessness.
“I have seen families make devastatingly difficult decisions when they don’t have access to child care. It makes me emotional to talk about it. I have seen families choose to leave their children with someone with an active substance use problem. I’ve seen families leave little kids home with big kids. And I’m using big kids pretty loosely there — they might be 8 or 9 or 10. I have seen families lose jobs,” Pike said.
She started her center 10 years ago when she encountered a crying mom with a 4-year-old girl and an infant in the parking lot of a shelter. The little girl had been bitten by a dog at an unlicensed child care home the previous day and received 17 stitches in her neck. The mom’s boss was threatening to fire her if she missed work, and so the mother had no choice but to send her daughter back.
Pike helped the family that day and later started her center, an experience that has fueled her belief that cutting access to child care funding does not mean children no longer need care. They still have to go somewhere.
Put simply, she said: “When we take away subsidies, we are taking away low-income families’ access to safe care.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Childcare-crisis-Indiana-for-Nov-8-2025-story-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-08 08:16:40.904957

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Let’s posit, just for the sake of argument, that a South Dakota police officer shot and killed a person merely suspected of transporting illegal narcotics from, say, Sioux Falls to Rapid City. No arrest, no indictment, no due process, no Miranda Rights, no nothing. Just suspicion.
Would that be OK, legally?
Of course not.
In the United States, people theoretically have inviolable rights, including the right not to be killed if they’re not immediately threatening anyone with lethal harm.
So, I ask, respectfully, how are suspected boat-borne alien drug traffickers on the high seas somehow not covered by that core American constitutional right when identified, targeted and killed by U.S. military aircraft packing deadly missiles? From Sept. 2 to this month, the U.S. military blew up 17 boats and one submarine carrying suspected drug smugglers in international waters of the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea in the vicinity of the Americas, killing 70 people aboard, according to news reports. Overall, two suspects survived, but instead of being charged and prosecuted, they were, very curiously, repatriated to their home countries scot-free.
US Senate fails to pass war powers resolution blocking Trump attacks on Venezuela

Simple logic tells us that all of these suspects, living and dead, should have been considered innocent until found guilty in a U.S. court of law. Still, no evidence of their guilt has been presented by the administration, and only Republican members of Congress — pointedly no Democrats — have been selectively briefed on these attacks. Mystery abounds.
Apparently, South Dakota’s all-Republican congressional delegation, with the possible exception of Rep. Dusty Johnson, hasn’t gotten very exercised about this very questionable Trump grab of congressional power. Declaring and authorizing war is Congress’s constitutional authority, not the president’s, and it’s hard to imagine that attacking boats of sovereign nations and arbitrarily murdering their citizens are not overt acts of war.
I sent online queries to each of our state’s federal legislators — Rep. Johnson, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Sen. Mike Rounds — asking them why they had not strongly and publicly condemned these extrajudicial (that means without legal due process) killings of foreign nationals and the destruction of their boats by the American military. They responded cautiously in the main, despite Congress’ authority being blatantly and unconstitutionally usurped.
Sure, the administration has tried to justify its war-like behavior with convoluted, specious arguments that make common sense mainly to those trying to make them. At least Rep. Johnson expressed “concern” about the attacks in an emailed response to my question. No such concern was seconded by Sens. Thune and Rounds, who’ve both voted against resolutions to stop Trump’s deadly strikes.
Rep. Johnson wrote in a brief reply, “Thank you for contacting me about the United States’ actions against Venezuelan drug smugglers via boat. I am concerned with the precedent of these actions by the administration. I will continue to monitor the situation as we learn more.”
Sen. Thune’s office responded with a long recitation of administration talking points justifying the attacks and denigrating any congressional attempts to stop them. He wrote, in part:
“While much progress has been made, dangerous cartels continue to traffic narcotics into the United States.  In response, President Trump has designated certain international cartels and other organizations as foreign terrorist organizations. The president is authorized by Article II of the U.S. Constitution to defend against threats as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Consistent with this authority, President Trump has ordered strikes against drug smuggling vessels transiting international waters toward the United States.”

For one thing, no evidence has been posited that any of these boats was bound for the U.S. or was carrying fentanyl, the main narcotic bugbear in the U.S., which mainly enters our country from Mexico. Also, President Trump simply labeling a group as “terrorists,” who he presumably believes can be killed on sight by the American military, doesn’t make it legally so. Drug cartels and their proxies are not “armed combatants” in any formal war sense.
Sen. Rounds didn’t respond to my query but told NBC News on Oct. 29 only that it was “unfortunate” congressional Democrats were not briefed along with Republicans about the administration’s continuing U.S. military airstrikes on suspected drug-running watercraft. He did not talk about the questionable legality of the attacks.

(Photo courtesy of the state Department of Children, Youth and Families.)Deaths and near-fatalities among children in Washington’s child welfare system have slowed, but are still expected to hit a record level in 2025.
Through the first nine months of the year, Washington saw 15 deaths and 30 near-deaths among these children, many of them infants and toddlers, according to state data shared Friday. There were 49 total such incidents all of last year, and 51 in 2023. 
Over half of this year’s incidents have been tied to opioids, especially highly potent fentanyl, according to the Department of Children, Youth and Families, the sprawling state agency that handles child welfare in Washington. At least some of the deaths and injuries involve parents repeatedly flagged over child welfare concerns.
The latest figures show improvement from the first three months of the year, which saw 22 of these incidents, the department said. In the second quarter, 14 were reported. And preliminarily, there were nine in the third quarter.
“Although the numbers have moderated, thankfully, quite a bit since quarter one of 2025, we do anticipate that 2025 will be a record year,” Vickie Ybarra, an assistant secretary at the agency, told reporters Friday. “We do not expect it to be double or triple, which was a concern in the first quarter.”
Declines in opioid overdoses could be helping the problem as the year goes on, according to the Department of Children, Youth and Families. 
State child welfare officials recently held listening sessions with staff to help identify roadblocks to working with families with substance use issues.
“The goal of our innovation is always to support families to be able to safely parent their children,” said Assistant Secretary of Child Welfare Natalie Green. 
The slowing rate of deaths and injuries hasn’t tamped down calls for changes to a state law that some say has contributed to the crisis.
The children most likely to be hurt are between the ages of 0 and 3. 
In one case, caseworkers received 85 reports over the course of a dozen years about the family of a six-month-old child who died in May, according to a child fatality review the Department of Children, Youth and Families conducted. 
The allegations included drug use, neglect, physical abuse, unsafe living conditions and sex trafficking. The child had three older siblings. 
Investigations found no proof of abuse or neglect, or evidence of imminent physical harm worthy of removing the baby from the home. 
The case is an example of the increase in families who are chronically enmeshed in the child welfare system. 
The data only covers cases believed to be related to maltreatment and that the agency had been involved in within the past year. A state ombuds office examines a wider range of cases, including those not directly related to maltreatment.
Over the summer, the ombuds reported at least 92 children had died or nearly died through June. The difference between that figure and the state agency’s has state Rep. Travis Couture, R-Allyn, skeptical. 
“Even if you took DCYF’s revised numbers at face value, they’re still incredibly high,” Couture said Friday.
Republicans like Couture have blamed a 2021 state law for keeping children in unsafe homes.
The Keeping Families Together Act raised the standard for separating children from their parents, and aimed to keep them with other relatives instead of foster care. The goal was to stop poverty from being used as a reason to take kids away from their parents, and to avoid inflicting the trauma of being separated from family. 
“What we’re doing right now, leaving them together and crossing our fingers and hoping for the best, is insane to me,” Couture said. “This hurts me on almost a personal level. I have to fix this.”
Some Democrats, including the chair of the state House committee that tackles these issues, have acknowledged the law may need to be further revised.
Rep. Steve Bergquist, who leads the House Early Learning and Human Services Committee, said he doesn’t “think we need to make wholesale changes this session, but look at opportunities to make it better.” These changes, for example, could focus on improving programs, like peer mentorship, to help parents.
The number of children entering out-of-home care fell after the law took effect, from nearly 4,200 in fiscal year 2021 to just over 2,800 in 2024. 
That figure is climbing back up after lawmakers tweaked the Keeping Families Together Act to instruct courts to give “great weight” to the presence of opioids in determining when children should be placed in foster care away from their parents.
Bergquist has urged colleagues in the Legislature to allow time for this change to play out before attempting any drastic overhaul of the law.

The U.S. Billion Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters database was previously managed by a team at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA. Since 1980, the program has been responsible for analyzing wildfires, tornadoes, winter storms and other disasters that cause at least $1 billion in damage. But it was retired in May, one among several NOAA products and services to get shuttered by President Donald Trump’s administration this year. 
Now, a nonprofit called Climate Central, which communicates climate change science and solutions, has hired the scientist who led the project at NOAA, Adam Smith, and has taken on the responsibility of compiling and releasing the latest data.
In the first six months of 2025, there were 14 disasters with damages costing just over $101 billion in total. Many of them occurred throughout the Mississippi River Basin. Mississippi, where storms have caused $1.8 billion in damage, Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas and Tennessee were among the hardest hit by severe storms and tornadoes, which caused just over $40 billion in damage. 
The January wildfires in Los Angeles resulted in approximately $60 billion in damages — making it the most expensive wildfire on record. 
Zachary Labe, a climate scientist at Climate Central, said they brought back the database because they “were hearing from every single sector how important this data is for decision-making and understanding areas that are increasingly at risk for billion-dollar disasters.” 
Among those who have typically relied on the database are policy makers, researchers, and local communities. It’s especially important for planning disaster relief and emergency management efforts “because they can focus resources on areas that are seeing big trends in the number of billion-dollars disasters,” Labe said.
Bryan Koon, president and chief executive officer of the consulting firm Innovative Emergency Management, said the analysis is helpful. His company works with government agencies and other organizations to help with disaster preparedness, response and recovery. 
“These kinds of data sets are very important in the broad scope, at least from my perspective, for trend analysis,” Koon said. 
In states like Missouri, for example, he said his company and other interest groups can analyze previous billion-dollar disaster data on tornadoes and their frequency over the past decade or two. That information can be used to inform how insurance companies write their policies, how buildings are designed and how notification systems are structured.
“I want to make sure that we, as a nation, wrap our arms around as much information about these things as we can so that we communicate the threat of future disasters for Americans,” Koon said.

The Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative — a cooperative of more than 100 communities between Minnesota and Louisiana — pushed the Trump administration to keep the database open, according to executive director Colin Wellenkamp.
“It was a critical database that showed us where costs associated with disasters were most impactful. What sectors of the economy were hit the hardest by a disaster? Whether it be intense heat, flooding, drought, forest fire, named storm event or otherwise,” Wellenkamp said.
From a cost-benefit analysis standpoint, said Wellenkamp, the database can tell cities, counties and states how to spend resources on mitigation to avoid incurring similar costs from future disasters. But industries like manufacturing, construction and agriculture also want to see the data, he said. That’s because the database’s financial impact analysis includes physical damage to commercial and residential property, losses associated with business interruption and crop destruction, damage to electrical infrastructure and more.
Other stakeholders that see the value of the database are both the insurance and re-insurance industries.
Franklin Nutter is the president of the Reinsurance Association of America, one of the largest trade groups in the country. The goal of reinsurance is to provide insurance for the insurance companies, stabilizing the industry and playing a role in “the financial management of natural disaster losses,” according to the association’s website. 
“It’s like an iceberg: the public is made aware of the impact of extreme weather by seeing the graphics (the tip of the iceberg) but most commercial users value the underlying data (the body of the iceberg),” said Nutter by email.
While the billion-dollar disaster data is valuable to financial stakeholders, Nutter said he believes its greatest value comes from providing “public awareness of the increasing extreme weather risk.”
There are many factors that come together to make a billion-dollar disaster — such as weather, infrastructure, population and location. Labe said that the number of events has been increasing since 1980. 
“It’s very likely that 2025 will not be the costliest year on record when we look at the statistics, but it definitely falls into this long-term increasing trend,” he said.
Climate Central is not the only organization trying to pick up the pieces of a resource that was shut down by the federal government or is at risk. 
Last month, amid growing concerns over the future of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative announced it would be partnering with a nonprofit called Convoy of Hope to provide aid within 72 hours of disasters for communities along the Mississippi River. 
But Wellenkamp said  there aren’t many states that can afford the response and recovery efforts from a billion-dollar disaster.
“These (initiatives) are not meant to be permanent solutions,” Wellenkamp said. “These are not meant to replace federal capacity. They are meant to put our cities in a relatively secure position until the federal questions are answered. And the sooner that those answers come, the better.”
For many, the answers will require data. 
“Just because the federal government decided they’re not going to do it anymore doesn’t mean it’s not worth doing,” Koon said.

The jail’s so-called “sanctuary”[...]","Razor wire and fencing surround the Orleans Parish Justice Center jail. (Richard A. Webster/Verite News)NEW ORLEANS – A federal judge ruled Friday the state of Louisiana will be allowed to file a legal challenge to the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office’s longstanding immigration policy, which prohibits jail staff from honoring federal requests to detain people suspected of being in the country illegally past their release dates.
The jail’s so-called “sanctuary” policy, adopted more than a decade ago, resulted from a settlement in a federal civil rights lawsuit filed by two construction workers, Mario Cacho and Antonio Ocampo, who were picked up by New Orleans police on minor charges in 2009 and 2010, respectively, and sentenced to jail time.
Friday’s order, by federal Magistrate Judge Janis van Meerveld, the state as a named party, which will in turn allow state Attorney General Liz Murrill to pursue a motion to dissolve the settlement.
“It’s clear that the consent judgment in this case should be dissolved on its own terms, among other reasons,” Murrill said in a statement on Friday. “I look forward to ending it and encourage the Sheriff to adopt a policy that does not obstruct ICE or conflict with State and federal law.”
Following the lead of President Donald Trump, Louisiana Republicans, including Murrill and Gov. Jeff Landry, have targeted such sanctuary policies in New Orleans for years. During Trump’s first term, Landry, when he was attorney general, challenged a similar policy adopted by the New Orleans Police Department as part of its long-running federal consent decree, saying the limits it places on officers working with federal immigration authorities compelled the city to “violate federal law.”
The police policy is also likely in jeopardy now that the federal judge overseeing the NOPD consent decree has said she will allow the department to exit federal oversight earlier than expected.
In the 2010 lawsuit that led to the sheriff’s office policy, Cacho and Ocampo alleged that they were illegally held by the sheriff’s office for months past the completion of their sentences. The two were held on a hold request — also known as an immigration detainer — from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Such requests are only legally valid for 48 hours.
Attorneys for Cacho and Ocampo did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the order.
In 2013, then-Sheriff Marlin Gusman settled by agreeing to adopt a new policy placing restrictions on immigration investigations inside the jail. The resulting policy blocked the agency from investigating immigration violations and from detaining immigrants for ICE without a court order, except in certain cases where they are facing charges for a small number of serious violent crimes.
Murrill filed a challenge to the policy earlier this year, arguing that it conflicts with a new state law, passed in 2024, that prohibits local law enforcement agencies from prohibiting their employees from fully cooperating with ICE investigations.
Van Meerveld’s Friday order said the state has a right to pursue that challenge because it has demonstrated that the state has an interest in enforcing its laws.
Though the sheriff’s office is a political subdivision of the state, Sheriff Susan Hutson, van Meerveld added, has shown that she will not adequately represent the state’s interests in the case. The judge pointed to a provision of the 2013 settlement that allows the policy to be adjusted in the event of a change to state or federal law that applies to immigration detainers.
But despite the new state law, van Meerveld wrote in her opinion, the sheriff’s office “has undertaken no action to modify or rescind the policy.”
“Here, it has become obvious that the OPSO cannot represent the State’s interest.”
Hutson, who has previously maintained that the sheriff’s office has not hindered the work of federal immigration authorities, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday’s order. Sheriff-elect Michelle Woodfork also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Morsa Images/DigitalVision via Getty Images)We’ve all been there: You wait 45 minutes in the exam room when the doctor finally walks in.
They seem rushed. A few questions, a quick exam, a glance at the clock and then a rapid-fire plan with little time for discussion — and you leave feeling unheard, hurried and frustrated.
And what if you’re hospitalized? You may face a similar experience.
More than half of U.S. adults say their doctors have ignored or dismissed their concerns, or not taken their symptoms seriously, according to a December 2022 national poll.
It’s easy to blame the doctor. But the reality is, most doctors would like to sit down and have an in-depth conversation with patients and their families. Instead, your unpleasant visit may be the result of productivity pressures and administrative burdens, often shaped by health care systems, payment models and policy decisions that influence how care is delivered.
Patients are increasingly experiencing what’s known as administrative harm — those unintended but very real consequences arising from administrative decisions, made far upstream, that directly influence how doctors practice. Ultimately, these types of interactions affect the care patients receive and their outcomes.
As a doctor and researcher who specializes in business and health care delivery, I’ve studied how organizational decisions have ripple effects, shaping patients’ relationships with their doctor and the quality of care they receive. Patients may be unaware of these upstream administrative decisions, but they affect everything from time allotted for an appointment to the number of patients the doctor has to see and whether a visit is covered by insurance.
 
A look behind the scenes
Increasingly, health care organizations and physician groups face intense financial pressures. Many doctors can no longer sustain their private practice due to declining reimbursements, rising costs and increasing administrative burdens; instead, they’ve become employees of larger health care systems. In some cases, their practices have been acquired by private equity groups.
With this shift, doctors have less control over their workloads and the time they get with their patients. More and more, payment models fail to cover the true cost of care. The default solution is often for doctors to see more patients with less time for each, and to squeeze in additional work after hours.
But that approach comes with costs, among them the time needed to build meaningful connections with patients. That negative, impolite tone you may have experienced might be because the doctor has many patients waiting and a full evening ahead just to catch up on writing visit notes, reviewing medical records and completing other required documentation. During the work day, they’re often fielding over 100 messages and alerts daily, including referrals and coordinating care, all while trying to focus on the patient in front of them.
But the consequences go beyond their bedside manner. Research makes clear that doctors’ performance and the quality of care patients receive are affected by their workload. A similar pattern is true with nurses: Their higher workloads are associated with higher death rates among hospitalized patients.
Suppose you’re hospitalized for pneumonia, but because your doctor is caring for too many patients, your hospital stay is longer, which increases your risks of infection, muscle loss and other adverse outcomes. In the doctor’s office, a rushed visit can mean delayed or missed diagnoses and even prescription errors.
About half of U.S. doctors report feelings of burnout, and about one-third are considering leaving their current job, with 60% of those likely to leave clinical practice entirely.
Long work hours also brings higher risks of heart disease, stroke and other health problems for health care professionals. In the U.S., 40% of doctors work 55 hours per week or more, compared with less than 10% of workers in other fields.
 
A better way

The administrative harms stemming from upstream decisions are not inevitable. In large part, they are preventable. Overhauling the health care system may seem daunting, but patients and doctors are not powerless.
Patients and their families must advocate for themselves. Ask questions and be direct. This phrase: “I am still really worried about … ” will quickly get your doctor’s attention. If your visit seems rushed, share it with patient representatives or through patient surveys. These insights help administrative leaders recognize when systems are falling short.
Doctors and care teams should not normalize unsustainable work conditions. Health systems need structured, transparent mechanisms that make it easy and safe for doctors and care team members to report when workloads, staffing or administrative decisions may be harming patients.
Even more powerful is when patients and their doctors speak up together. Collective voices can drive meaningful change — such as lobbying for adequate time, staffing or policies to support high-quality, patient-centered care. It is also important for administrative leaders and policymakers to take responsibility for how decisions affect both patients and the care team.
More research is needed to define what safe, realistic work standards look like and how care teams should be structured. For example, when does it make sense for a doctor to provide care, or a physician assistant or nurse practitioner? At the same time, health systems have the opportunity to think creatively about new care models that address clinician shortages.
But research shows that the medical profession can’t afford to wait for perfect data to act on what’s already clear. Overworked and understaffed teams hurt both patients and their doctors.
Yet when doctors do have enough time, the interactions feel different — warmer, more patient and more attentive. And as research shows, patient outcomes improve as well.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner) OMAHA — Former President Joe Biden highlighted harsh economic realities facing American families under President Donald Trump. And Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear pitched a recipe for helping Democrats win in deep-red states. 
Both headliners for the Nebraska Democrats’ top annual fundraiser Friday rallied a downtown Hilton crowd of more than 600 people headed into next year’s midterm elections, in which the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District could play a crucial role.
Friday was Biden’s first public speaking event since dropping out of the 2024 presidential campaign under fire from some in the party about his electability following a shaky debate performance against Trump.

He criticized Trump on a variety of issues, from cutting Medicare in the “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill to Trump’s handling of the “strong economy” Biden said he left him. He said Trump had taken a wrecking ball to the Constitution.
“Folks, look, this isn’t a golden age,” Biden said. “The fact of the matter is that it is a very, very dark moment … But we’re in a situation where we had something very special happen just last Tuesday.”
The fundraiser followed strong national elections for Democrats on Tuesday. The party won most of its high-profile contests nationally, including the Governor’s Office in Virginia and the mayor’s race in New York. Some political observers have said the tone and mood of the electorate might hint at what’s possible in the midterms, when the party out of power typically gains seats.
Much of Biden’s speech focused on helping Democrats send a message to his successor: “You work for us, Mr. President. We don’t work for you. You work for us, not just billionaires and millionaires.”

Biden also touted some of his accomplishments as president, including working with Congress to pass the largest modern investment in American infrastructure, a bipartisan bill he passed with help from retiring Nebraska Republican U.S. Rep. Don Bacon and others.
Beshear, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential hopeful, spoke about how his approach to politics focuses on working for all Kentuckians, not just those who share his party. He said he governs in a way that can serve as a model for Democrats to win in deeply red, Republican states. 
Beshear’s approach tries to bring party members and others together — including progressives, union members, centrists and some Republicans — over economic concerns, which lets him sidestep many of the social issues distracting other campaigns.
“We’ve got to get back to the work of showing people that we are spending all day, every day, trying to make their life a little bit better and a little bit easier,”  Beshear said.
He visited Nebraska after having headed to South Carolina earlier this year to test the water for a potential bid. He also visited neighboring Iowa in 2024 to speak at a Democratic fundraiser.

Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr. set much of the evening’s tone when he warmed up the crowd by putting on a blue and white “Make America Humane Again” hat — poking fun at Trump’s bright red “Make America Great Again” hats. 
“Let’s make America humane again,” he said after being introduced as the first Democrat to lead Nebraska’s largest city in a dozen years.

Jane Kleeb, chair of the state party, said Friday that the blue “wave” Democrats want in 2026 started in May 2025 in Nebraska, with Ewing’s win over three-term Republican incumbent Mayor Jean Stothert.
Ewing criticized Trump’s handling of immigration policy and the ICE raids happening across the U.S. He mentioned the administration’s bulldozing of homeless encampments and sending the National Guard into cities. Democrats gathered as pro-Palestinian protesters demonstrated outside of the hotel. 
“We are going to stand with our immigrants when the national state is trying to create chaos,” Ewing said. “We are going to build a space and a city and an economy that works for everybody, not just the rich.”
Republicans took notice of the Biden and Beshear visits. U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts’ GOP campaign sent a truck with a digital ad on it driving through downtown Omaha during the fundraiser, attacking his registered nonpartisan opponent Dan Osborn by labeling him on it as the “future of the Democratic Party.”

The Nebraska Republican Party, in a statement, said, “If Nebraska Democrats think the presence of the former president will make people forget about the radical Democrats’ policies, inflation, open borders and out-of-control spending, they’re wrong.”
But local Democrats paid no mind, as many spoke in positive tones about the Democrats’ chances in future elections — especially in the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District. 
The Omaha-based district was the only swing district nationally to side with Democrats in 2024, when Trump won every contested swing state and won the presidency, except for the stray Electoral College vote that Nebraska allows its congressional districts to syphon off. 
Omaha, along with the rest of the 2nd Congressional District, voted for Biden in 2020 and sided with former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024.

And this year’s version of the 2nd District U.S. House race is shaping up to be another charged one, with a crowded Democratic primary vying to replace Republican U.S. Rep Don Bacon, who decided to retire early this year. Political experts view the seat as a possible pickup for Democrats. 
That 2nd District slice of the 2026 midterm elections is emerging as crucial for the state and national Democratic Party as it tries to find a path toward retaking the House from Republicans. Mid-decade redistricting efforts, including one being discussed in Nebraska, have made that effort more complex.
Nebraska Democrats have said they have designs on winning beyond the 2nd District, especially in legislative races that could spell the difference between the ability to filibuster conservative legislation or not.
The Nebraska Democratic Party’s top annual fundraising event has a history of drawing major headliners, including former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a former vice presidential candidate. One reason: Kleeb, the state party chair, serves as a vice chair of the party at the national level. 
The event is named for Ben Nelson, a former Nebraska governor and U.S. senator who cast a critical vote to help the party pass the Affordable Care Act under former President Barack Obama. His former vice president encouraged Democrats and others not to despair but to work.
“The American experiment is not going to end on our watch,” said Biden.

A press release earlier Friday from California Gov. Gavin Newsom said some Californians had begun to see full benefits on their cards, following an order from a lower court.High court challenge In a Friday evening brief to the Supreme Court that followed a day of conflicting messages from the administration, U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the high court should step in to protect the executive branch’s power from what he characterized as unprecedented overreach by McConnell.By demanding that the USDA transfer money from a $23 billion fund for child nutrition programs to pay for November SNAP benefits, McConnell substituted his judgment for the agency’s, a violation of the constitutional separation-of-powers doctrine, Sauer argued. The department’s decision to pay for partial November benefits, by using the roughly $5 billion remaining in a contingency fund, rather than by paying about $9 billion for a full month of benefits, was its decision to make and not reviewable by courts, Sauer said.“USDA reasonably determined that the best course was to combine partial SNAP payments with stable funding for Child Nutrition Programs—versus jeopardize the latter to guarantee full payments with the former,” Sauer wrote. “The district court would have done otherwise. But it had no legal basis to ‘substitute its own policy judgment for that of the agency.’”Confusion in states The lower court order — as well a midday Friday letter from the USDA to state SNAP administrators — had also led to confusion among states who started to demand SNAP funds in a way Sauer compared to a bank run.Several states announced full funding would be available and began sending money to beneficiaries.Immediately after McConnell’s order was published, Wisconsin demanded “100% of SNAP benefits,” Sauer wrote. Even though the USDA system rejected the file, the private-sector processor of the payment moved forward, moved forward, resulting in Wisconsin currently overdrawing its letter of credit by $20 million,” he said.Kansas made a similar move. And some California SNAP users received their full benefits, according to Sauer’s brief.16 million children on SNAPMcConnell on Thursday had ruled the department’s decision to withhold SNAP benefits arbitrary and capricious — the standard for judicial review of an executive branch action. The $23 billion fund could spare the $4 billion needed to make November SNAP benefits whole and still maintain its intended purpose well beyond the month, so there was no need to maintain that fund at that level, he wrote.Instead, the decision “predictably magnifies harm and undermines the very purpose of the program it administers,” McConnell wrote.While federal agencies are due discretion from courts, such a “poor” use of decision-making power must be remedied, he said.“Contrary to what the Defendants claim, 29 million children who participate in the Child Nutrition Program are not at risk of immediately going hungry in the event of a transfer,” he said. “Instead, SNAP recipients—16 million of whom are children—will go hungry if they do not receive their SNAP benefits this month.”‘Starve Peter to feed Paul’But Sauer responded that was not McConnell’s call to make. The trial judge’s ruling improperly assumed that Congress would eventually replenish the child nutrition program fund, but the USDA was within its right to take a more cautious approach toward protecting the child nutrition funding, said the solicitor general.“It obviously was not unlawful for the agency to see things differently—and refuse to starve Peter to feed Paul, by gambling school lunches tomorrow in exchange for more SNAP money today,” he wrote. “Indeed, that sort of hard tradeoff is precisely the sort of decision that Congress committed to agency discretion and placed beyond the reach of judges.”While the USDA had not denied that it was able to move money to different priorities after Congress had appropriated it, the government did not have to do so, Sauer said.Allowing McConnell’s ruling to stand would invite a stampede to litigation, the government maintained.“If allowed to stand, this decision will metastasize and sow further shutdown chaos,” Sauer said. “Every beneficiary of a federal program could run into court, point to an agency’s general discretion to prioritize funding, and claim that failing to prioritizetheir chosen program was arbitrary and capricious.”Trump social media postSauer also said McConnell read too much into Trump’s social media post this week that threatened to withhold SNAP funding for the duration of the shutdowns.McConnell cited in his order the post, in which Trump said SNAP benefits would “be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!” showed the true purpose of the USDA move was political leverage.Sauer said that was improper.“The court below had no basis to transfer of billions of dollars from school lunches to its preferred program based on its tendentious view of ‘the administration’s true motivations.’”In a statement, Skye Perryman, the president and CEO of Democracy Forward, an advocacy group that is leading the litigation to force SNAP payments, said the group would continue to work to “secure benefits for the American people”“The Trump-Vance administration continues to attempt — over and over — to take food out of the hands of families, seniors, workers, and children,” Perryman said. “And every time they tried, the courts told them what the law already makes clear: they cannot. American families should not be used as political props in a shutdown that this White House manufactured.”",,,,2025-11-07 22:16:51.473823

(Legislative Support Services)Eight Democratic state lawmakers in Washington retained their seats in this week’s election, with a ninth on the cusp of winning.
State Rep. Edwin Obras inched closer to success Friday in the tightest House contest. Sen. Deb Krishnadasan declared victory a day earlier in the year’s most expensive duel among a stack of special elections for legislative seats.
Obras led Kevin Schilling, a fellow Democrat, by a margin of 50.6% to 47.7% in the 33rd Legislative District. More votes will be counted in the days ahead. Located south of Seattle, the district includes Burien, Normandy Park, Des Moines, SeaTac and much of Kent.
Competing in his first general election, Obras trailed Schilling, the mayor of Burien, in early rounds of ballot counting. But the SeaTac lawmaker edged in front by 205 votes Thursday and increased his lead to 641 in Friday’s count.
“If the trends continue and Edwin is victorious, congratulations to him,” Schilling said Friday.
Meanwhile, Krishnadasan, of Gig Harbor, beat Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier in the 26th District that covers part of Kitsap and Pierce counties. Caldier, who is in her sixth term in the House, conceded Thursday. 
“I’m excited to continue working together in the year ahead to deliver practical, bipartisan solutions that make life more affordable, strengthen our schools, and protect access to quality health care,” Krishnadasan said in a statement.
This was the closest-watched legislative race of the year and, as of Election Day, had attracted roughly $4 million in combined spending by candidates and outside interest groups. Nearly one-third of those dollars were spent by independent committees opposing Krishnadasan.
Her win means Democrats will hold their 30-19 seat advantage in the state Senate heading into 2026. 
“The voters have spoken. While I’m disappointed in the outcome, I’m incredibly grateful for everyone who stood with me in this campaign to bring balance back to Olympia,” Caldier, a Gig Harbor resident, wrote in a statement.
In King County, Sen. Victoria Hunt defeated Republican Chad Magendanz of Issaquah, a former state lawmaker. This was the other contest GOP leaders viewed as an opportunity to slim Democrats’ advantage in the Senate. 
Hunt, also of Issaquah, was elected to the state House last year and appointed to the Senate following the unexpected death of Sen. Bill Ramos in April. The district covers Issaquah, Black Diamond, Covington, and part of Snoqualmie.
“I’m honored to have defended this seat and continue in the footsteps of my mentor and beloved friend of so many,” Hunt wrote on Facebook.
Also in King County, Sen. Vandana Slatter, of Bellevue, easily overcame the challenge of a fellow Democrat, state Rep. Amy Walen of Kirkland, in the 48th District. The two previously served together in the House. Walen was the race’s moderate, Slatter more progressive.
“The foundation of this win is community and this community showed up,” Slatter posted on social media. “We faced well-funded opposition, but we had something far more powerful: you.”
This contest, like the all-Democrat match-up in the 33rd District, vented the philosophical tensions between the party’s progressive and centrist forces. A  political committee, whose donors include campaign arms of House and Senate Democrats and labor unions, spent money opposing Walen and Schilling.
“Unfortunately, this election didn’t go our way,” Walen wrote on Facebook. She pledged to keep pushing for policies she campaigned on — increasing affordable housing, improving access to health care and making communities safer.
Like Caldier, she’ll continue serving in the House.
“While I didn’t win this election, I still have another year in my term,” she wrote.
Five other Democrats in safe western Washington seats sailed to re-election. 
Rep. Janice Zahn, D-Bellevue, trounced Republican John Whitney of Bellevue in the 41st District and Rep. Osman Salahuddin, D-Redmond, captured more than twice as many votes as Republican Dennis Ellis of Redmond in the 48th District.

Critics say he's playing political games, but Brown says he's merely protecting the rights of Maryland and its residents.","Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown in a conference room at his office in Baltimore on Oct. 22. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)When Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) walked to the podium Thursday to announce a lawsuit against the Trump administration’s plans to keep the new FBI headquarters out of Maryland, he might have had a sense of déjà vu.
Since President Donald Trump (R returned to office on Jan. 20, Brown has walked up to a lot of podiums to announce a lot of legal actions against the administration.
In less than 10 months, Brown’s office has filed or joined other Democrat-led states, in 43 lawsuits against administration actions and has filed or joined in about 70 legal briefs in support of lawsuits by others challenging administration policies — including one on Friday, when Maryland joined 25 states challenging an administration plan to cut food assistance during the government shutdow..
That’s more in less than a year than the 95 lawsuits that former Attorney General Brian Frosh (D) led or joined during fur years of the first Trump term, from 2017 to 2021.
“It’s voluminous. There’s no doubt about that,” Brown said during an interview last month in his Baltimore office.
“I committed to Marylanders I would only bring actions that I think directly impact their rights, their privileges, their benefits, their well-being, and that I would protect the sovereignty of Maryland when challenged by the administration,” he said.
Apparently, he sees a lot of those challenges.
The lawsuits started coming the day after Trump’s inauguration, when Maryland joined New Jersey and 16 other states to block Trump’s executive order ending birthright citizenship. The latest was an Oct. 1 lawsuit challenging a policy that would have denied victim assistance funds to anyone who cannot prove their citizenship status.
Maryland sues Trump administration for ‘illegal’ action to keep FBI headquarters in D.C.

They have continued in between, sometimes at a pace of several per week, with lawsuits that challenge the White House’s efforts to rescind previously approved money for schools, to share personal health care informaton with the Department of Homeland Security and to deploy National Guard troops in Illinois.
Maryland has been a supporting player in many of the actions, but he led in others, including lawsuits to restore funding for the AmeriCorps program and to block the mass layoffs of probationary federal workers, and a brief in support of other groups seeking to protect transgender rights.
Brown stresses that his office is not “attacking the president. We’re challenging the actions that he takes.” For instance, he pointed to a suit in May against the U.S. Department of Transportation and Secretary Sean Duffy who wanted to withhold funds from states that don’t comply with White House immigration policy.
“When the president says that he’s going to attach conditions to transportation funding that could jeopardize important projects like the Key Bridge, like the completion of the Purple Line … he’s tying conditions entirely unrelated to transportation, but pursuing his own agenda,” Brown said. “I think Marylanders recognize that their attorney general ought to, and we are in fact, stepping up to defend the interests of the state.
“I invite anyone to come and point out to me something that this [a legal action] is nothing more than a political attack. I think you’d be hard pressed to find one.”
Not everyone agrees.
Del. Lauren Arikan (R-Harford) said the actions of the attorney general’s office against the Trump administration are “politically motivated more than policy motivated.”
“We’ve dumped a lot of extra money into the AG’s office for all kinds of things. And what is the taxpayer seeing for it?” she asked. “We’re getting higher taxes. Housing crisis, an energy crisis. We’re not seeing the fruits of our taxpayer dollars being used efficiently,.
“Suing the Trump administration over and over again is a total waste of Maryland taxpayer money,” Arikan said Oct. 23.
‘Constitutional revolution’
Mark Graber, a constitutional law professor at the University of Maryland’s Francis King Carey Law School in Baltimore, said the lawsuits are political in the sense that only Democratic attorneys general are suing the Trump administration. On the other hand, Graber said those prosecutors are opposing certain actions by the administration.

Graber said some decisions in lower federal courts have favored the Democratic prosecutors in cases heard by judges appointed by Republican presidents. Some federal judges “are supporting these lawsuits in the sense that they’re finding the lawsuits are valid, have solid grounds,” he said.
He said the U.S. Supreme Court has been much more supportive of the president so far. “It’s rather interesting that the Supreme Court appears to be more partisan than the lower federal courts,” Graber said.
He cited the “Just Security” website, a  litigation tracker of legal challenges to the Trump administration, maintained by the Reiss Center on Law and Security at New York University School of Law. As of Friday, Just Security was tracking 515 cases pending against the administration..
“It’s clear the Trump administration is pushing on the borders of the existing understandings of constitutionalism. It is attempting a constitutional revolution every bit as revolutionary as the revolution that led to the New Deal and the post-Civil War amendments,” Graber said. “It simply has a very different understanding of the Constitution than has existed previously.”
When asked what can be done to ensure the constitution is adhered to, Graber summarized three actions: file lawsuits, hold peaceful protests “in the streets” and “most importantly, when the time comes, vote.”
‘Political publication’
Not all of the opposition to federal policy has come in the form of a lawsuit or a brief. The attorney general’s office, for example, released a guidance memo Oct. 15 to remind Maryland law enforcement agencies that they must adhere to state law when working with federal authorities.
The guidance was required in legislation approved on the last day of the 2025 General Assembly session dealing with immigration enforcement. Part of the law requires the attorney general to “develop and publish guidance that informs the public and relevant state agencies” about immigration enforcement.
The 11-page document lists what local police “must do, may do and must not do” in a range of interactions with federal authorities, from simple backup to formal joint task force agreements. More specifically, it states Maryland officers “may not enforce civil immigration laws or assist federal agents in enforcing such laws.”
Maryland leads multistate brief calling Trump deployment of Guard ‘unlawful’

The memo highlights the 287(g) agreements that some Maryland sheriff’s department have made with Immigration and Customs Enforcement that let the local law enforcement officials take on certain immigration enforcement abilities. In Maryland, those agreements are largely restricted to the jail-based model of the agreement, where jails can execute administrative immigration warrants on people already in their custody.
But the guidance from the attorney general’s office cautions that “prohibitions on participating in civil immigration enforcement apply even when Maryland officers are operating under an agreement with federal authorities, including an agreement with ICE under Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.”
Del. J. Sandy Bartlett (D-Anne Arundel), vice chair of the House Judiciary Committee, said the guidance was “well written” and “well researched,” and will not only benefit law enforcement agencies, but the immigrant community as well.
“I think that is exactly why we [General Assembly] asked for such guidance,” she said. “I’m very glad that the attorney general has been so explicit in explaining to us, or to the officers, and giving them the guidance that they need.”
But Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler, whose department has participated in a 287(g) agreement since 2016, called the attorney general’s guidance “more of a political publication tied to the national immigration debate than a practical law enforcement directive.”
“My concern is that it could be misinterpreted in a way that discourages law enforcement from sending aid to federal partners during real criminal emergencies, such as the assaults on federal officers and other acts of violence we have witnessed across the United States,” Gahelr said in a statement last month. “I hope that was not the intent, because the Harford County Sheriff’s Office will always respond when a crime is being committed or when anyone, to include local, state, or federal law enforcement, is under attack while doing their job.”
Brown said the guidance is nothing more than what it claims to be: A guide to help law enforcement agencies and to remind them of what the restrictions are, even with 287(g) programs.
“If you’re undocumented and you are a violent offender, you should be held accountable. And if that accountability means removal from this country, then that’s what it means,” he said. “What I don’t think is prudent with limited law enforcement resources available to any agency is to begin focusing on the enforcement of immigration law.”
On the question of politics vs. policy in the actions the attorney general chooses to take, Sen. Chris West (R-Baltimore County and Carroll), agrees with Arikan that at times it does “seem like a broken record, just day after day” suing the Trump administration.
But West, an attorney, said last month the Democratic attorneys general are not the only ones who play that game. He would like to see attorneys general, both Democratic and Republican, focus more on their constituents and less on the politics.
“Are they really spending their time and the money and the resources at their disposal effectively to represent their constituents? Or are they engaging in efforts which will benefit them politically, but won’t have much real impact on the people of their states?” he asked. “My feeling is what’s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. My message to both groups is stop it.”

(U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee video screenshot)The Alaska Supreme Court has disbarred former U.S. District Court Judge Josh Kindred, banning him from practicing law in the state, “effective immediately.”
The court’s decision was announced Friday, a little over three months after the Alaska Bar Association recommended the action.
Kindred, recommended by Alaska Republican Sens. Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski, was appointed by President Donald Trump to the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska in 2019 and confirmed to the office in 2020.
He resigned last year after investigators found that he had a “sexualized relationship” with a clerk who became a prosecutor and lied about it to a senior judge and investigators, and maintained a hostile workplace for law clerks.
Since his resignation, the outcome of dozens of criminal and civil cases has been called into question because of the relationship between Kindred and the prosecutor, and one conviction has already been tossed out.
After Kindred’s resignation, an attorney filed a complaint with the Alaska Bar Association, which regulates attorneys in the state. 
The association ordered an investigation that concluded Kindred’s actions had caused “grievous harm” to the practice of law in the state, and it voted to recommend that he be stripped of his license.
In Alaska, such an action requires approval by the Alaska Supreme Court.
Two of the court’s five justices — Jennifer Henderson and Aimee Oravec — recused themselves from the proceedings in order to avoid the appearance of impropriety. 
According to a court official, Henderson’s husband was friends with Kindred before his resignation, and Oravec’s husband was Kindred’s coworker for a time.
The remaining three justices — Chief Justice Susan Carney, Justice Dario Borghesan, and Justice Jude Pate — voted unanimously to “adopt the findings and conclusions of the disciplinary board.”
They ordered Kindred be “disbarred from the practice of law in Alaska, effective immediately.”
Kindred must also pay $1,000 in costs and attorney fees to the Alaska Bar Association within 60 days.
If he seeks to have his law license restored, he must undergo training “in the area of ethics, law office management, and management of law office accounts” as well as pay restitution in relevant matters.
Kindred did not appear before the Supreme Court or participate in its discussions; he also did not participate in the Bar Association’s investigation.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)The Trump administration told states Friday that it would be releasing funds to support federal food assistance during the government shutdown — just hours before winning a Supreme Court stay of lower court orders, apparently putting the payments on hold again.
It is just the latest example of the on-again, off-again policy changes that have left benefit recipients guessing on their status, and states, counties and local food aid organizations riding the policy “roller coaster”that has federal support for food assistance here one moment, gone the next.
It has also made it “difficult to know what to communicate” to recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, for the state and county officials who administer the program.
“I think the roller coaster is really with the federal government,” said Heather Bois Bruskin, director of the Office of Food Systems Resilience in Montgomery County. “First it was that the November benefits won’t be coming. Then with the court action, they were directed to release the funds that are set aside for SNAP benefits in situations just like this.
“At this moment, it is very uncertain when and how and in what amount the federal government will be contributing to SNAP benefits for November.”
Meanwhile, state and some county officials are moving funds around in an effort to mitigate the damage, regardless of how things shake out at the federal level.
Anne Arundel, Montgomery, Baltimore counties and the city of Baltimore have allocated additional dollars to support local meal assistance networks and help provide meals for families who may be struggling to put food on the table.
US Supreme Court temporarily blocks November SNAP payments

For example, Bruskin said that Montgomery County plans to move an additional $3.5 million next week for the local food network, adding on to county dollars already earmarked to help food banks and pantries.
Gov. Wes Moore (D) last week declared a state of emergency that allowed him to allocate $10 million for food pantries around the state. He followed that on Tuesday with the announcement that the state would budget $62 million under the same emergency order directly to SNAP recipients in the state for their November benefits.
Maryland officials said Friday that the $62 million earmarked in that executive order will still go out, paying for about half of the monthly SNAP benefits for the more than 680,000 Marylanders in the program. Those funds will be loaded into electronic benefit transfer accounts on Monday night and will be available Tuesday for those whose benefits have already lapsed.
“Maryland families shouldn’t have to suffer because the federal government chose to pause vital benefits,” Maryland Human Services Secretary Rafael López in a written statement. “We will move urgently to get Marylanders the SNAP benefits their families depend on to put food on the table.”
Since Nov. 4, an average of 30,000 Marylanders a day have seen benefits lapse as funds that would have refreshed their accounts were tied up in court and in policy fights,  That means that approximately 120,000 Marylanders this week have been waiting for their electronic benefit cards to be refilled.
“It’s tragic for those families,” Del. Emily Shetty (D-Montgomery) said. “We’ve heard anecdotally of families who have gone to the grocery store and found out subsequently that they didn’t have money on their cards.”
Shetty, who chairs the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees social services, said she grew up in poverty. She said that the days of uncertainty about the availability of federal SNAP funds is “problematic” for families that need the extra help.
“This is a life I am very familiar with,” she said. “Poverty is something that is often forced upon families, and this is why I feel so passionate that poor people cannot be pawns in these broader political games.”
SNAP mishaps
On Friday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture told states that it was working toward releasing total funding for SNAP benefits in November. That was a reversal from the outlook from just days before, when it was uncertain if funds would come down at all following recent court challenges and social media statements from President Donald Trump (R) threatening to withhold payments to punish Democrats.
Maryland commits $62 million to fund share of November SNAP benefits USDA won’t pay for

Even the Friday USDA letter that told states the agency was working to fill November SNAP benefits coincided with the Trump Administration’s effort to challenge its court-ordered requirement to fund SNAP.
The last twist in the saga came late Friday, when Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson granted the government’s request to temporarily block lower courts that had ordered the USDA to immediately fund 100% of SNAP benefits for the month. It was unclear what effect that would have on the government’s promise earlier in the day to start delivering the funds to states.
“It’s not something that is helpful to the communities that we serve to continue this back and forth, and to continue panicking the entire community that relies on hunger relief and hunger benefits,” Shetty said. “We were receiving an increase in constituent calls, not just from individuals who benefit from those programs. But also from our retailers and local food banks and shelters that were really concerned about the impact on the folks they were serving.
“This continued back and forth is par for the course for the administration, but it actually has a real effect on the people who are living in poverty,” Shetty said. “And we cannot continue using poor people as pawns in this political game at the national level. It’s just immoral.”

(Photo by Nicole Pilsbury/Maryland Matters)Todd Morman moved to Baltimore two years ago from North Carolina — a state he said Republicans “redistricted the hell” out of while he was there.
He thinks Maryland Democrats may now have a chance to counter what North Carolina Republicans did two years ago, but he is worried that Senate President Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) will stand in the way.
“I’ve seen this with politicians before — they get entrenched,” Morman said. “They fail to see the seriousness of the threat against the people at the bottom.”
Morman was one of dozens of people gathered on the first floor of the Maryland State House on Friday to call for Democrats to redraw the state’s congressional districts to counter partisan redistricting in GOP-led states — and specifically to rally against Ferguson’s opposition to redistricting.
Democrats in Maryland, as in other states, have been talking about the possibility of redrawing their congressional districts since this summer, when Republicans in Texas, at President Donald Trump’s urging, redistricted the state in a way that is expected to pick up five GOP seats.
But in an Oct. 28 letter, Ferguson said Senate Democrats would not be taking up redistricting in Maryland, where Democrats already hold seven of the state’s eight congressional seats. The letter said that redistricting mid-cycle could backfire on Democrats and end up costing them seats in the House for a variety of reasons.

Days later, Gov. Wes Moore (D) said he was leaning toward creating a commission to study redistricting in Maryland. He did just that on Nov. 4, the same day that California voters approved a redistricting that is expected to balance Texas’ plan.
That left Ferguson as the face of the opposition to redistricting, and the target of Friday’s State House rally.
“The abuse of power we are seeing is insane, and that starts with what we are seeing in Texas,” said Amar Mukunda, a rally attendant. “We cannot allow Trump to have a single additional vote in Congress.”
Protesters also raised concerns about the 287(g) program, which delegates Immigration and Customs Enforcement duties to local and state law enforcement officials. Sheriffs in eight Maryland counties currently participate in the program.
Volunteers from the protesting group read a letter to Ferguson that was organized by the Indivisible Maryland Coalition, the state chapeter of a national anti-authoritarianism protest group, that outlined their demand: a special session to redistrict Maryland and to eliminate the 287(g) program.
“Because of Maryland’s participation in the 287(g) program, ICE doesn’t pay for enforcement — local communities do,” one volunteer read from the letter.
Ferguson was not in Annapolis Friday. The protesters were met by his chief of staff, Sally McMillan Robb, who responded to their comments and questions about the two topics at hand.
“I think that what we heard from Sen. Ferguson’s representative — she was very gracious and very nice — but I think those were excuses,” Morman said. “His representative can say he really cares about that [threat of not redistricting], but he’s blocking the most important thing that we can do to get an extra vote in the House of Representatives.”
Robb explained that one reason for concern is that during the last redistricting, in 2022, a Dcmocratic plan was struck down by an Anne Arundel Circuit Court judge for “extreme partisan gerrymandering,” leading to the current 7-1 map that favors Democrats. If a new map landed back in court, the 2022 ruling could overturn it and, potentially, the current map, she said.
“A very real reality is with 31.5% of Marylanders registered [as Republicans], we are potentially turning it over for them, not only to strike down a new map, but to strike down the current map,” Robb said.

Protesters did not appear to be convinced, responding to Robb’s statement with comments about the power the Senate president holds and how the decisions should be debated, rather than blocked by Ferguson.
“I think it’s important, before any decisions are made, that he hears from constituents and allows constituents to have their say in public — a larger public forum would be wonderful,” said Theresa Delin, a Baltimore City resident at the rally. “Let the state senators discuss and vote rather than shutting down a conversation before it even starts.”
Dr. Margaret Winters, a Baltimore City resident and Indivisible Maryland Coalition member, helped to organize the event in hopes of letting Ferguson know that people are passionately opposed to his arguments.
“It [the rally] will give people the opportunity to go lobby their own senators in their own districts so that we can then pressure Sen. Ferguson from his peers,” Winters said. “When the people roar, the elected need to listen.”

Mohammed Rashid walked free on Friday for the first time since he arrived in the U.S. as a stowaway in July 2024, after fleeing Gaza to escape Hamas.
Judge Natalie Smith in Chelmsford Immigration Court, in Massachusetts, granted Rashid a $20,000 bond Thursday after the 29-year-old Palestinian man had been detained for more than 15 months. Most recently, he was held at Northwest State Correctional Facility in Saint Albans, Vermont.
Rashid never expected he would be detained for so long. Now, Rashid said he can’t wait to reunite with his relatives, who are driving from Ohio to reach him.

“Fifteen months, it’s been long time, and I lost a lot of things there: family, (a house), everything, friends,” Rashid said in an interview, referring to what he lost since the Israel-Hamas war started.  
What he most looks forward to doing now is talking with his mom. 
“I didn’t speak to her since I was locked up,” he said.
Rashid received asylum only four months after his arrival, but U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement appealed the judge’s decision, and Rashid remained detained. His case has been pending for more than 10 months with the Board of Immigration Appeals.

At the end of August, he was transferred to Vermont, and a group of lawyers with the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project found out about him during one of their regular legal orientations to inform people held in ICE detention of their rights. 
Andy Pelcher, one of Rashid’s attorneys, said he and his colleague, Emma Matters-Wood, were so shocked by Rashid’s story that they decided to take up the case with Nathan Virag, an attorney with the Association of Africans Living in Vermont.
The lawyers filed a habeas corpus petition to challenge the legitimacy of Rashid’s detention and went through two bond hearings in immigration court before ultimately obtaining his release on bond.
Going into Thursday’s hearing, Rashid said he was optimistic because he trusted his lawyers, but he was still nervous. He cried when the judge granted him bond.
Rashid said he hardly slept the night after the hearing. 
“I was like, ‘I’m waiting for the ICE decision to release me,’” Rashid said. “‘I can’t wait. I want to just be out. It’s America. Like, it’s a dream.’” 
After ICE processed the bond, Pelcher and Virag went to Northwest State Correctional Facility and waited for Rashid to be released on Friday.
“He went to hug Andy, and then he went to hug me,” Virag said. “No words even describe the moment. He just kept saying over and over that he’s free.”
Now, he’s ready to start his new life. 
“I actually want to look for a fashion job, model job, because it’s a dream for me to do this work. And I want to live in peace,” Rashid said. “I’m looking for this since I left my country, and I guess I’m gonna find it here.”

(Photo by Mike Clark for the Daily Montanan)The Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services anticipates the state will receive funding for a $1 billion Rural Health Transformation Program proposal it submitted to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, according to an agency official.
Montana submitted a five-year plan aimed at developing the rural workforce, stabilizing facility finances, expanding innovation, and increasing prevention, according to a presentation and news release this week from Gov. Greg Gianforte and health department Director Charlie Brereton.
The state anticipates it will learn whether Montana has been awarded funds in late December, although state officials said they are expecting success.
“The Rural Health Transformation Program is a historic investment in Montana’s future,” Gianforte said in a statement. “Since taking office, we’ve led on fixing what’s broken, making investments to improve access to quality health care. With the Rural Health Transformation Program, we will continue delivering better outcomes for families across Montana.”
The federal program is authorized to provide up to $50 billion nationally to participating states through 2030, according to the news release. The funding is specifically earmarked for stabilizing, transforming, and restructuring rural hospitals and other essential health care providers.
At a committee meeting this week, legislators asked questions about the proposal, including how much money would stay with the department versus be deployed, and raised concerns, such as that the funds are meant to appease people worried about federal cuts to Medicaid.
Sen. Cora Neumann, D-Bozeman, said she appreciates the amount of time DPHHS spent reaching out to stakeholders. She also questioned the program, although she said her skepticism was unrelated to the health department’s efforts.
“This is a Band-Aid coming from the federal government,” Neumann said. ” … This feels like a consolation prize to the states because we may lose a huge amount of funding, Medicaid funding.”
Neumann, who works in health care, said sustainable rural health care systems require investment, especially given the potential for rural hospital closures in Montana, and she wanted to know if the state planned to make investments.
At the Children, Families, Health and Human Services Committee meeting Wednesday, Brereton confirmed the plan includes direct funding to rural health systems.
He said specific ideas came from in-depth discussions with local health care providers, such as a roundtable in Glasgow with 30 law enforcement and local health care leaders.
“There will be money provided to critical access hospitals, other rural health care settings, in addition to quite a bit of purchasing,” Brereton said.
A DPHHS official said the state developed the plan with public input, including from a webinar with nearly 900 people, tribal consultation, 20 stakeholder groups, and other state agencies.
Brereton said spending details were laid out in “a very complex budget narrative document.” Neumann requested the information be shared, and Brereton said he would do so if CMS granted permission.
Rep. SJ Howell, D-Missoula, wanted to know what portion of funds would stay with DPHHS and what portion would go to stakeholders. Brereton said DPHHS has estimates, which he did not have immediately available but said he would provide.
One program that caught the attention of Rep. Jodee Etchart, R-Billings, was supporting emergency medical services in rural areas.
The program includes empowering EMS to “treat in place,” or deliver on-site care when feasible to reduce emergency room admissions. Money would go toward upgrading ambulances and other emergency equipment.
Etchart said one difficulty for EMS is some patients know that they can get help, but if they don’t get transported, they don’t end up getting billed, so they purposefully refuse transport. In the meantime, Etchart said, the company has to cover the costs of the staffing and products.
Rebecca de Camara, with DPHHS, said she doesn’t know whether people are intentionally declining transport to avoid billing, but she said it is the way the system is set up, and a need exists for treatment on site.
“The goal of this initiative is to expand the reimbursement that they can get,” de Camara said of EMS, noting that preventing unnecessary emergency department visits would save money.
The state submitted its plan to CMS on Wednesday, and de Camara said DPHHS believes it has a competitive application and will start working on next steps.
“We’ll continue our planning so that we are ready to go once the money starts rolling into the state,” de Camara said.
The news release said funding for the program will be allocated to states based on a formula: “50% divided equally among all approved states, 25% based on states’ rurality, and 25% based on how well each state’s proposed plan aligns with CMS criteria.”

Montana’s Rural Health Transformation Plan
Montana’s plan outlines five core initiatives, all designed to address the unique challenges of rural health care delivery in a sustainable manner:

Workforce Development: Focuses on increasing recruitment, expanding clinical training, and retaining various levels of rural health care providers in strong partnership with the Montana Department of Labor and Industry.
Sustainable Access: Stabilizes rural facility finances through restructuring recommendations and increased clinical and administrative partnerships. This component includes funding for the expansion of telehealth services, linking rural hospitals with statewide specialists and providing one-time-only awards for necessary telehealth equipment.
Innovative Care Models: Strengthens and expands value-based payment models and better leverages EMS and pharmacy services, with an emphasis on reducing emergency room admissions and other high-cost care interventions.
Community Health and Prevention: Provides for infrastructure upgrades and initiatives that incentivize healthy lifestyles, including expanding primary, behavioral, and dental health services in schools through partnerships with Federally Qualified Health Centers and other providers.
Technology Innovation: Focuses on using technology to increase access and improve data quality and sharing. This component includes funding for rural providers to modernize their Electronic Health Record systems.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/230426-CapitolStockPhotos09-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-07 19:56:33.497121

Through October, Kipp Bovey and her fellow nurse midwives closely tracked the patients whose due dates would come close to the Nov. 1 closure of the birthing center at Copley Hospital in Morrisville. They wondered who might be the one to see the final baby born before the center shuttered. When the last mother began her labor, it was only fitting that Bovey, as the nurse midwife who had worked there the longest, was the one to deliver the baby. 
“That was a blessing, and also tragic. And in the way that birth can be, it was so beautiful,” Bovey said, overcome with emotion at the significance of the moment.
Then, she immersed herself in the work as the birthing began. “The emotional piece of it got lost, because we were doing the work, and we were keeping people safe and healthy, and then it was done.”

When that last birth ended, so too did the nearly 100-year history of birthing at Copley Hospital after months of debate and efforts to preserve the beloved program.
As of Nov.1, not only has birthing ended at Copley, but so too has any prenatal and postpartum care, despite its statements made as recently as mid-October that those services would continue locally. On Nov. 7, a representative from Copley confirmed that at least for now the care is no longer available. 
The hospital said it has laid off the equivalent of 14 full-time staffers, including its three full-time nurse midwives, the part-time nurse midwife staff and its two obstetricians. The labor and delivery nurses have left for other hospitals, retired or been reassigned elsewhere in the hospital. The on-call pediatrician, too, is no longer retained, the hospital confirmed, meaning that person will no longer be able to consult on cases involving newborns and infants who come to the ER.
In June, the hospital’s leadership announced its decision to close the birthing center, citing low birth rates and high costs of keeping the service. A report produced by an independent consultant informed the hospital’s final decision. Birthing, which is widely considered an unprofitable “loss-leader” for hospitals, was costing the hospital an estimated $3.7 million a year, or $15,000–$30,000 per birth, according to the hospital.
Already, at least one other Vermont hospital, Northeastern Medical Center, in St. Albans, has confirmed that it is also looking at changes to its obstetric services due to a tight budget. The hospital’s board is considering a task force’s recommendation that NMC partner with an external organization to continue births and provide OB/GYN services at the hospital, the hospital’s spokesperson Kate Laddison confirmed to VTDigger. 
The fact that not very many babies are born at Copley, or in Lamoille County in general, has remained one of the hospital’s primary reasons for explaining the decision to close. For the 10 months of 2025 before the birthing center’s closing, Copley had 127 births. Since 2018, the hospital had seen around 160 births a year. Fewer than 50% of the births that happen in Lamoille County occur at Copley, the hospital cites.
Still, many feel that volume should not be the determining factor for something they feel is essential care to provide at a community hospital.
“Obstetrical care is, like, the one [part of] health care everyone uses at least once in their life. If that’s not essential health care, I don’t know what that is,” said April Vanderveer, one of the nurse midwives who had worked at Copley. 
‘Magical thinking’
Since the June announcement, Copley Hospital’s executives have engaged in a terse back and forth with the state’s health care regulator, the Green Mountain Care Board.
During their September budget decision, care board members requested more information from the Copley administration about the closure decision, and noted the hospital’s inability to comply. The transparency of the consultant’s report became a particular point of contention, with Copley agreeing to share it with the regulator only under the condition of confidentiality.
Ultimately, the hospital submitted responses to the care board’s August questions in a letter dated Oct. 17. Yet the report itself still remains inaccessible.
In the unsigned October letter, Copley writes that it “is collaborating with nearby hospital(s) to continue to provide prenatal and postpartum care locally along with continuing to provide care for their current gynecology services while providing navigation for birthing families to deliver at partnering hospitals.”
Carole Ferrante, Copley’s interim chief operating officer, confirmed to VTDigger that the hospital is not currently providing those services. However, staff have been in “close communication” with University of Vermont Medical Center, in Burlington, and Central Vermont Medical Center, in Berlin, about having a satellite pre- and post-natal clinic at the Morrisville hospital. 
Such a program is still in its nascent stages. “Those talks are just ongoing with them. They have their own challenges they are working through,” Ferrante said in a Nov. 7 interview. “They are just trying to work through the details to see if they can make a program like that viable.”
Former birth center staff have doubts. 
“There is no prenatal care happening or any plan to provide prenatal care in Lamoille County at this time,” Vanderveer said. “They can say that they want it to happen, but that’s magical thinking, because no one is doing that.”
Ferrante also added that though the hospital contacted Northeastern Vermont Regional Hospital, in St. Johnsbury and North Country Hospital, in Newport, neither community hospital was interested or able to take on a satellite service at Copley.
At Copley, both the hospital and the midwives, who collected patient data, expect nearly 40% of Copley’s patients will move their care to the University of Vermont Medical Center, while about 20% will go to Central Vermont Medical Center. Another 10% is likely to go to Gifford Medical Center, in Randolph, and another one-tenth will go to Northeastern. 
On average, patients will see a nearly 20-minute increase in drive times to reach care at any of these other hospitals. 
“What that means is people who are well-resourced and can drive to Burlington or Montpelier or St. Johnsbury, will for prenatal care,” said Vanderveer. 
She worries about the people who can’t take the time out of their work schedules to drive long distances for frequent prenatal appointments. 
“They’re not going to get adequate prenatal care. They are going to have higher risk pregnancies that are going to have complications that are going to be further along,” she explained. “If they get diabetes in pregnancy or high blood pressure, they’re not going to know about it until it’s extremely complex and that there is real risk involved.” 
A maternity care desert
With Copley’s closure and the 2022 closure of the Planned Parenthood clinic in Hyde Park, Lamoille County has become a maternity care desert, with no hospitals or birth centers offering obstetric care. 
Two gynecologists will remain at Copley, though Vanderveer adds that their responsibilities should encompass more complex reproductive care needs, rather than the day-to-day primary care that the midwives provided. In addition to birthing, nurse midwives’ services span a broad scope of reproductive health care: They insert IUDs, screen for STDs, help patients navigate menopause and more.
“It’s a huge loss that I don’t think people even realize goes beyond just the birth piece,” she said.
In an August study published in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology, researchers found that living in a maternal care desert, which they define as a county without obstetric care, was significantly associated with higher maternal mortality and pregnancy-related death, after analyzing more than 14 million live births between 2018 and 2021. 
“Ninety-five percent of the time [child birth] is totally straightforward, and you don’t need us [clinicians], but the 5% of the time you do, then it’s life saving,” Vanderveer said. “People do die in childbirth, and babies die.”
Copley’s own report to the Green Mountain Care Board cited three studies assessing distance from hospitals and maternal outcomes. A Pennsylvania-based study, also published in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology, was “the most applicable” out of the three, Copley wrote in its letter. They say that the study found a “statistically significant relative risk of maternal and newborn adverse outcomes when travel distances exceeded 50 miles.” In fact, the study actually found adverse impacts became more likely at distances starting at 37 miles, becoming an increasing risk factor at 49 miles.
The two other studies cited specifically in the letter both detail more risk found for both mothers and babies with increased driving time and distance. Copley’s letter notes one study found no associated risk, but which one is not clear.
In reference to the Pennsylvania study, Copley calculated that about 12 patients each year will have to travel more than 50 miles to the next closest hospital to deliver their babies. They did not specify the number of patients who would need to travel those shorter distances. 
“The decision was extremely difficult, and it is sad for the community. We recognize that it’s sad for us as well to have to let go of a service like this,” Ferrante told VTDigger. “It is a very difficult thing to do when you’re looking at the future of the hospital and maintaining its presence in the community.” 
Birth in the ER
In 2024, the state commissioned the consulting firm Oliver Wyman (as part of the 2022 state law Act 167) to report on the financial sustainability of Vermont’s hospitals. That report tackles the issue of low-volume care that rural hospitals all across the state are dealing with, in birthing and beyond. It outlines a vision for consolidating lower-volume care into regional “centers of excellence.”
The Oliver Wyman report suggested that Copley either scale up its birthing or shift it to other hospitals, as part of its “solutions for (a) long-term period,” in 2028 or beyond. In its response to the care board’s request for understanding the hospital rationale, Copley pointed to this report. 
In its mid-October analysis to the care board, Copley estimated that births would decrease in 2025 (to 115 or 120, though by the end of October, births already totaled 127). It also estimates that revenue loss with each birth averages to $16,885. Using those estimates of 2025 birth volume, the hospital found it would lose $776,000–$861,000 this year (though, at the time of report’s publication, it had already exceeded those low volume estimates). 
The letter also included financial estimates of what scaling up birthing services would cost the hospital — the other pathway outlined by the Oliver Wyman report. The hospital said a consultant estimated “cosmetic renovations” of the birthing center would be over $2 million and that the cost of building a satellite OB/GYN clinic would be $675,000 and the annual operating costs would come to $260,000 a year.
“Somehow we live in a world where, if it makes financial sense, that’s all you need to justify a completely unethical decision,” Erinn Mandeville, a former nurse midwife at Copley, said. 
Many former staff are frustrated about the speed of the closure and the fact that it occurred before the hospital had begun implementing that shift of birthing care to other hospitals the report outlined. Ferrante was unable to comment on why the hospital had felt the need to shutter the service so quickly.
“I understand if we can’t keep every little hospital delivering babies, but we need a creative way to offer prenatal care in the community. We need to have a good system where we work with our colleagues,” Vanderveer said. 
To help cover some of the gaps the loss of this service will leave, Copley’s emergency room staff and local EMTs have been preparing to deliver more babies. The ER doctors have undergone training with practitioners from UVM Health, as well as from the nurse midwives. 
“The ER is not a place where anyone wants to have a baby,” Bovey, the nurse midwife who delivered the last baby, said. She was involved in helping transition and train emergency room staff on birthing. “[The ER staff] are working really hard. This is not their choice. This is not what they feel comfortable doing.”
Also, without the birthing center, the hospital will no longer have some of the tools and resources that could be helpful in assessing a newborn who needs to come into the hospital. 
Health care for the people by the people
A group of midwives have also begun efforts to open a free-standing birthing clinic, in an effort to try to restore some of the services Copley had provided. 
However, “it 100% does not replace hospital births,” said Mandeville, who is also the founder and president of the Green Mountain Birth Center group. 
“It is basically home births, but at somebody else’s home,” she said, explaining that only extremely low-risk pregnancies are eligible for birthing center births. Copley, too, did not take high risk births. “[A birth center] doesn’t have anesthesia; it doesn’t have [pediatric] coverage. You can’t do a C-section; you can only do totally straightforward, low-risk births. So it’s not going to fix this problem.”
The group involved in creating the center is eying Waterbury for a potential location, so that they can quickly transport patients to CVMC in case they need labor induced or an epidural, or in case a baby needs emergency support. Locating closer to Morristown and transporting to Copley is not an option without the birthing center, Mandeville said.
Last year, the Legislature approved a law that would make it possible to open these freestanding birthing centers in Vermont. The Green Mountain Birthing Center would be the state’s first.
But, right now, the new center is in its very early stages, explained Mary Lou Kopas, another former Copley nurse midwife involved in getting the center off the ground. The group is still working to establish itself as a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization and is collecting donations small and large through the American Association of Birth Centers Foundation.  
Kopas estimates that buying a space and then building it out will cost upwards of $1.5 million. From there, she suspects that it will be able to pay for itself, since midwife-led births with low interventions are such inexpensive care. 
“My grand vision is that we’re kind of like the village midwives, and that it’s health care for the people by the people. I’m not interested in an administrative-heavy [enterprise]. This is not a money making venture,” Mandeville said. “We want to build it for the community. We want to keep the lights on and pay people fairly, and build a beautiful facility that provides amazing care.”
She and Kopas hope that someday, they could scale to have some sort of a satellite clinic that could offer pre- and postnatal care in Morrisville, or a mobile clinic to reach people up in the Northeast Kingdom or elsewhere in the Copley service area. Kopas envisions, eventually, being able to provide more “wrap-around services,” like childbirth education, lactation support and  parenting groups.
“We’re hoping that something good could come out of this. This is our phoenix rising out of the ashes,” Kopas said. 
But, for now, she will be working on a per-diem basis at Northern Vermont Regional Hospital and at Gifford Hospital, in Randolph, a nearly 90-minute commute for her. She will stay overnight at the hospital for her 56-hour on-call shifts. 
Her former colleagues are finding similar ways to piecemeal their schedules to other Vermont hospitals. Much like the patients they once served, the nurse midwives will now too need to drive over an hour to serve the community at the next nearest hospital.

While many state governments provided additional funding to food banks and local pantries, Vermont’s is only one of a few providing direct replacement benefits.

State funds for the first 15 days of monthly food assistance went out Friday to 36,000 Vermont households who participate in the federal program, the Department of Children and Families announced in a press release.
“We are deeply grateful for the commitment and teamwork that brought this complex process to completion,” said Miranda Gray, economic services deputy commissioner. “And most importantly, Vermonters can buy food today.”
Vermont is one of just a few states, including New Mexico and Virginia, where the state government moved quickly to provide direct replacement benefits for households enrolled in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also called SNAP.

November payments in the program, called 3SquaresVT, have been paused since Saturday due to the federal government shutdown, now in its fifth week, leaving local food shelves struggling to fill the gap. Most other state governments have focused on directing additional funding to statewide food banks and other social services organizations. (Vermont leaders authorized $250,000 for the Vermont Food Bank to distribute to meet the additional demand this week.)
Vermont’s department delivered roughly $6 million in benefits — approved by the state’s Emergency Board on Oct. 29 — as the Trump administration sent more mixed messages on when the federal government would provide partial emergency funding for the program required by orders issued by different judges in two federal court cases. 
The U.S. Department of Justice appealed an order a federal judge in Rhode Island District Court handed down Thursday demanding that the USDA fully fund November food benefits. A federal appeals  court denied that appeal late Friday and upheld the lower court’s order.
Later Friday, Politico and other outlets reported that the USDA had told states that it was working to comply with the order to fully fund the program, and that it would make the necessary financial shifts “later today.”
By early evening, the Trump administration had not appealed another order requiring at least partial payment, in Massachusetts District Court, that came as part of a multistate lawsuit joined last week by Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark.
The Vermont Emergency Board is expected to reconvene on or before Nov. 13 to determine whether further state action is needed.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The number of people approved for discretionary parole by the Alaska State Board of Parole has dropped significantly in recent years, and advocates are asking the board for explanations.
Last year, the board denied 59% of applicants for discretionary parole. In 2023, it denied 58% of applicants. In 2022, it denied 70%. An analysis by the Prison Policy Initiative, a non-profit research group, found that from 2019 to 2022, Alaska reduced the number of people released through discretionary parole by 79% — the largest percent change nationwide. 
In years prior, the grant rate was much higher: Only 25% of applicants were denied parole in 2015, and 30% in 2016. 	
Alaska inmates may be eligible for parole if the Parole Board determines a reasonable probability exist that:
1. the prisoner will live and remain at liberty without violating
any laws or conditions imposed by the board;
2. the prisoner’s rehabilitation and reintegration into society
will be furthered by release on parole;
3. the prisoner will not pose a threat of harm to the public if
released on parole; and
4. the release of the prisoner on parole would not diminish the
seriousness of the crime.


The five-member Parole Board is appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Legislature to serve five-year terms. They make decisions about parole and set conditions for release. Under law, they must consider four criteria when determining if Alaska inmates are eligible for parole, including evaluating whether the individual will pose a threat to public safety. For discretionary parole, applicants must have completed part of their sentence, be in good standing and have a plan for employment, housing and continued treatment, if needed, when they are released. 
How the board weighs these factors has been a focal point for advocates in recent years. Advocates want to help inmates better prepare for parole and reduce recidivism, or prevent people from re-offending and returning to prison. 
Advocates raised the issue again at the Parole Board’s annual public meeting on Wednesday. 
“Discretionary parole numbers, they’re going down… why do you think that is?” asked Christina Shadura, a coordinator for the Anchorage Reentry Coalition, part of a statewide network to support people exiting prison and connect with housing, community services and jobs. 
“Are people coming to you without a plan? Are folks coming to you not ready, not getting it, not taking it seriously? I guess I’m looking for a little advice here on the community side about how we can help further prepare folks,” she said. “If there’s one thing you could lock down for us to help support, what do you think it would be?”
Jason Wilson, a board member representing Southeast Alaska and the state coordinator for Village Public Safety Organizations with the Department of Public Safety, responded that many people don’t seem prepared. 
“I mean, there’s a lot of people that come before us that don’t even know what discretionary parole is, but yet they’re applying for discretionary parole,” Wilson said. 
“Having the proper programming, having the proper release plan, that’s going to help them to succeed,” he said. He suggested parole applicants consider community programs, like for addiction treatment, counselors and sponsors. 
Other board members did not respond to questions. Through board staff after the meeting, the board declined to say why parole rates are so low, or to name factors that would increase successful applications. 
In the meeting, Board Chair Leitoni Tupou said the board does not make public comments. 
“I think this board, as far as in my experience, we are just focusing on the week or two weeks out of the month on (parole) hearings,” Tupou said.

Tupou said he only provides public comment when called to testify by the Legislature. For example, he said eligibility for medical parole, or the release of an individual with severe illness, is very strict. “We are obligated to follow that law,” he said. “If we feel there has to be a change that has to come through the law. From our perspective…our hands are tied,” he said. 
Mike Garvey, policy director of the ACLU of Alaska, called the absence of responses from the board at the public meeting an illustration of the continued lack of transparency from the parole board. “Which we’ve long known is a problem,” he said.  
In a 2024 review by the Alaska Division of Legislative Audit, state auditors also found “the board was unable to provide specific reasons why its parole approval rate decreased.”
In an interview following the meeting, Garvey said the ACLU is continuing to call for more transparency. 
“It’s not about getting more people out (of prison), we want people to be successful when they are released,” he said. “We don’t want arbitrary denials, and so having more transparency from the board would help not just explain the denials. It can help explain the releases too.”
The ACLU has also pointed to the cost to the state of keeping people incarcerated, which is estimated to be $202 per person per day in Alaska, compared to an estimated $13 per day on parole. 
According to the Alaska Department of Corrections, the daily average prison population was estimated at 4,322 in 2024. There were 3,213 people under probation or parole supervision last year.
Alaska’s prison population is also aging significantly. The number of people 55 and over has increased by 50% over the last decade, according to data from DOC. Many may be eligible for geriatric or medical parole. 
Shadura, as a re-entry coordinator, conducts what she calls “in-reach” to jails and prisons to help inmates apply for parole or prepare to be released. She estimated 80% of people she works with have questions about parole, and they have a hard time getting them answered. 
“How do I fill out my parole packet? My probation officer hasn’t returned my communication for whatever reason,” she said, in an interview following the meeting. “I was denied, what do I do next? You know, that’s a big thing I come across for pretty much every institution I do in-reach at.” 
She said the parole application process is not within inmates’ own responsibility or control, but largely an internal process by DOC. Inmates also face challenges in preparing for parole because they may lack space or program opportunities for things like addiction treatment, counseling, life skills or other education programs that show an effort towards rehabilitation. She said the programs that are available vary widely by each of Alaska’s 13 prison facilities across the state.  
Successful re-entry into society is also a challenge. Alaska’s rate of recidivism is defined as when someone is paroled and then violates the terms of parole or commits a crime again. Almost half returned to prison over the last three years, or 47% of discretionary parolees and 67% of mandatory parolees.
Shadura said she understands privacy and safety concerns, and the gravity of decisions put before board members. But she hopes more insights from the board might better prepare inmates to apply for parole, and to be more successful once paroled. 
“It also seems like we’re doing a disservice to everybody, including the parole process, when we’re not allowing folks to at least have a basic understanding about how to go about qualifying for it, what steps you need to achieve to get there,” she said. “It makes people feel hopeless.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Nearly 40 fruit trees have taken root at Drake Park in what is the start of a community orchard in Des Moines.  
Once established, organizers hope the orchard will serve as another place in Des Moines to build up the city’s local food infrastructure. 
Chelsea Krist, chair of the steering committee for Iowa Food System Coalition, said community orchards create spaces, not only for food access, but also for communities to gather and connect over food. 
“It’s a really important and accessible way to literally change the landscape and the environment where people can interact with food more directly,” Krist said. 
She said spaces like a community orchard create a “touchpoint” for people to see food growing in their region. Grabbing an apple off the tree in a local park, or while on a neighborhood walk, could cause a “ripple effect” for community members to notice the nearby pollinators, talk to someone else who is harvesting from the tree, or become more interested in other local food sources.
That ripple effect toward local food procurement, and sense of community around food, can also be helpful during times of crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic, or the current government shutdown that led to suspended federal nutrition programming.
“The more spaces that we can create for people to connect with each other and food, the better,” Krist said.

City-led orchard 
Krist said while there are a lot of community groups that start community orchards and gardens, she said a lot of recent efforts have been led by municipalities across the state. 
This is the case for the project in Des Moines. Breann Bye, economic development project manager with the City of Des Moines, said the project in Drake Park shows that public spaces can fulfill “multiple objectives.” 
“It’s a park, so families can come there and play, there’s a splash pad, there’s a shelter you can rent, there are basketball hoops, but also it can be a great place for neighborhood residents to take a walk, collect some apples — when they’re ready for harvest — cherries, apricots, peaches, all that,” Bye said.

An orchard project had already been started in Drake Park, according to Bye, with fruit trees in various stages of development. The city approved a measure in May to plant more trees and reinvigorate the community orchard at the park, and by late October, a group of around 30 volunteers showed up to plant the fruit trees.
It will take a couple of years before the trees are mature enough to bear significant amounts of fruit. By the time that happens, Bye said the city hopes to have signage up explaining the types of fruit, when they’re ripe and maybe even QR codes that link to recipes. 
She said surrounding communities, like the Drake neighborhood and Sherman Hill neighborhood, have already shown interest in the orchard, but the city plans to continue public outreach to create a “community of care” around the orchard. 
“So that people understand the asset that is this orchard and then want to help care for it — hopefully they then feel a sense of ownership and connection,” Bye said. 
The city will work with the local Trees Forever group and volunteers to maintain the orchard. 
Dubuque also got a community orchard this year on city property, in an initiative led by the local Trees Forever group. 
Tom Kramer, president of Dubuque Trees Forever, said the group planted fruit trees this spring in a city-owned spot he said was previously a mostly unused green space. 
Trees Forever partnered with the city, exchanging maintenance of the area for the ability to plant fruit trees and establish some perennial beds. Kramer said it was a “win-win” situation. 
Now, he said the community will be able to enjoy the beauty of a blooming orchard in the spring, “versus just an empty lot with grass on it.” And later in the summer, they can stop by to pick some cherries, plums and apples. Plus, he said, the pollinators will enjoy the orchard too. 
Part of the local food ‘puzzle’
Krist said she sees more and more support for projects like community orchards, gardens and local food procurement. These projects, she said are being adopted as community leaders care more about the benefits, like providing fresh local food, than some of the downsides, like tree maintenance. 
An orchard, she said, is a “piece of a very complicated puzzle” that makes up a sustainable local food system.
Kathy Byrnes and Ed Fallon, of Birds & Bees Urban Farm in Des Moines, have been pushing for a city-led community orchard for years, as step toward their dream for Des Moines to be the “local food capital of the U.S.” 
They were among the volunteers planting trees in Drake Park. 
“It’s a good start, but we’ve got a long ways to go to accomplish the level of food security that we need,” Fallon said. 
In terms of fruit procurement, Fallon and Byrnes said they hope to see the city of Des Moines establish other community orchards and use edible fruit-bearing trees like serviceberries in lieu of plastic snow fences. 
Already, Fallon said, the city is moving in the right direction.
What does a community with 20 years of watershed work look like?  

Following building renovations several years ago, the city planted strawberry plants as groundcover surrounding City Hall. Each June when the fruit ripens, the plants are picked clean by citizens who stop by the massive patch. 
“We need more strawberries everywhere,” Fallon said. “There’s plenty of places where the city could plant strawberries.” 
Byrnes said local food is more than just vegetables and fruits. She said it’s about pollination, bees, backyard chickens, goats and “all the ways that people feed themselves.” 
Des Moines, Byrnes said, has some of the best local ordinances in terms of allowing backyard poultry and gardening, which also fits as a piece of the local food system. 
Once people start growing and producing their own food, she said, it also opens up opportunities for community, which is a “real benefit to a city.”
“People always want to look at what you’re growing, come in and talk about it,” Byrnes said. “You meet your neighbors, then you find ways that you can not just exist together, but help each other and just grow that connection.”
Fallon said another element to a food system is permanently dedicated land for food production within the city. He suggested the city identify land and then work with local farmers who are “getting out of corn and beans” and want to grow food for sale.
“We have so much opportunity for local consumption,” Fallon said.
According to Bye, conversations about these initiatives are happening at the city. 
She said the city plans to identify other sites around the city where it makes sense to establish more community orchards. As the city works orchards into its plans, “people are more aware about it as an asset” which could create a bridge for using more food-producing plants in other landscaping projects.
“Joy matters in our urban spaces,” Bye said.  “When we can work on projects that not only address food security and education around food production and sustainability, but also just make people smile and make people happy – that’s a good thing.” 
Bye said a core focus in her job is to support small businesses and entrepreneurs, and she hopes the city can do that by thinking differently about some of its land. 
That might mean dedicating land to urban agricultural production and bringing farmers in to make use of land that can’t be vertically developed. Bye said she also wants the city to think about using land in a way that can bring people together. 
“Being the capital city in Iowa, where (there’s) so much conversation around agriculture and food production, Des Moines has a real opportunity to, I think, enact those values and strengthen our residents’ connection to their food system,” Bye said. “We have an opportunity here for kids to grow up seeing food-producing plants right in their neighborhoods and have that connection and understanding about the environment and that desire to care for it.”

(Photo courtesy of University of Iowa)Business professor Kristina Gavin Bigsby says it’s harder now to be a student at the University of Iowa than when she was completing her own degree programs — four of them — at the university.
Costs are rising and students have more worries than ever, she said, and it’s not uncommon for Bigsby, director of undergraduate studies and associate professor in the Tippie College of Business, to get harried emails from students struggling to add coursework to what they’re already juggling.
Despite these issues, more and more students are turning to a UI education, with the university welcoming its second-largest incoming class ever of 5,561 undergraduate students this fall. Applications to the UI were also record-breaking, totaling more than 31,000.
When enrollment grows, class sizes — and the number of offered course sections — grow with it. While some departments might not be feeling the full brunt of the strain yet, faculty and graduate students say it’s getting harder to balance all of the work on their plates.

“We are going to do everything possible in our power to create value for students, because that is really our job,” Bigsby said. “But I think some people are starting to get burnt out, and I can’t blame them.”
Preparing for growth
Retention has grown alongside enrollment, with a 90.9% first-year retention rate representing a 5-percentage-point increase over the past five years, according to Tanya Uden-Holman, UI associate provost for undergraduate education and dean of the University College.
Uden-Holman said in an emailed statement that many university instructors, both faculty and graduate teachers, are using “evidence-based teaching practices proven to improve learning and engagement in large lecture settings.”
The UI’s Enrollment Management data team created “predictive dashboards” a few years ago, Uden-Holman said in her statement, that have helped the university prepare for enrollment growth by “anticipat(ing) student interest” and planning out staffing, course sections and classroom space.
“Guided by our institutional strategic plan, the University of Iowa has taken a proactive, data-informed approach to supporting student success in large-enrollment courses. This work includes advancements in predictive analytics, instructional planning, and faculty development to ensure that growing student demand is met with high-quality learning experiences,” Uden-Holman said. “We are deeply grateful to our faculty and graduate instructors, whose dedication ensures academic excellence across all course sizes.”
Support for both teachers and students is available through university programs like the Center for Teaching and Office of Teaching, Learning and Technology as well as supplemental instruction, Uden-Holman said, which are group study sessions led by students who already found success in the course before helping others.
Seeing student needs no matter the numbers
After Bigsby started as a full employee of the university in 2018, she taught a database management course with cohorts of between 100-150 students that is “pushing closer to the higher end of that range,” she said.
The Foundations of Business Analytics course Bigsby now teaches has just over 900 enrolled students — an increase of 300 students in just two years. No matter what struggles classroom leaders are going through, Bigsby said her first priority is to the students she’s teaching, whether there are nine or 900 of them in the course.
“How do I, even with 900 students, see them as individuals and see them as humans, and not just, you know, numbers that I have to get through the class,” Bigsby said. “Even in a quantitative field, I don’t see my students as just numbers and statistics.”
The differences between small and large courses are fewer than one would think, Bigsby said. She still approaches the course with the mindset of treating students how she wanted to be treated as a student, with flexibility and transparency. Overcommunicating with students about expectations, deadlines, course policies and the reasoning behind the concepts and skills she teaches them prevents panicked emails and other issues in the future.
Bigsby also makes all of the materials for the course, from instructional slides and presentations to data sets, practice problems and test questions.
Bigsby works with 10 teaching assistants for her Foundations of Business Analytics class, on whom she is “really reliant.” While no one teaches the teachers how to be managers when they have so many teaching assistants, Bigsby said she tries to make things as easy as she can.
In order to ensure there is consistency across the 20 discussion sections of the course, Bigsby started this semester filming herself going through the discussion topics for the assistants to reference or follow along with in their sections if need be.
“I try to lay out everything clearly for them the same way that I do for the students in the class, because at the end of the day, the teaching assistants are students as well,” Bigsby said. “This experience is a way for them to pay their tuition, but it’s also a way for them to learn and gain the skill set.”
Graduate student instructors deal with time constraints
For graduate students working as teaching assistants and in instructor roles, having more students could mean cutting back on other graduate work or working more than their allotted hours, all while many deal with financial and food insecurity, among other things.
Anne Moore, press and publicity coordinator of the Campaign to Organize Graduate Students (COGS), said the union has been hearing from its members “across the board” about increased expectations and workloads from more sections and more students. There is also the rule that most graduate workers are generally limited to 20 hours of work per week, but many employees don’t find it easy to stay within that limit.
“Part of that time is teaching, and then the rest of that time is meant to prepare for your teaching and to do grading and stuff. With these larger class sizes, people are finding that they can’t get the work done in 20 hours,” Moore said. “We’re only paid for 20 hours of work, so it’s sort of this Catch-22 for teaching assistants.”
Cary Stough, a teaching assistant in the UI rhetoric department, pointed out that graduate students are students as well as university employees and they have obligations outside of instruction in order to complete their degrees, like research or large projects.
In the rhetoric department, graduate workers teaching courses are “instructors of record,” Stough said, which means they create their own syllabi and other materials and don’t have the same relationship with overseeing faculty.
The idea of working just 20 hours a week is “kind of a joke” to graduate workers, especially those in rhetoric, as they steer more course sections and act as the first point of contact for more students, Stough said. The pay graduate workers receive is already inadequate enough to put students through financial uncertainty, Stough added.
“There’s no time to make a life, rather than make a living, outside of the university,” Stough said. “And those insecurity problems, those housing insecurity problems, those food insecurity problems, the lack of savings that we have because we’re paid so low is going to be exacerbated if the university decides to willy-nilly throw more work onto us.”
What UI instructors need to facilitate growth
As those tasked with teaching future courses brace for potentially higher enrollment in the future, Moore said she would hope that the university would grow graduate admissions alongside undergraduate, as well as raising graduate pay and hiring more faculty.
There are some “hard constraints” the UI is butting up against currently, Bigsby said, that would need to be dealt with if the university and its colleges want to keep growing.
The main one is simply space — where in the past university administration would aim for classrooms to be at around 90% capacity, now she said rooms are “busting to the gills” with students trying to find space. It’s not a problem that can be solved easily or quickly, Bigsby said, and so far everyone has been dealing with cramped conditions without issue.
In terms of offering support and resources, however, Bigsby said she’s much more interested in what would help students than what would help faculty. Bigsby said her department has used its own funds — and went over budget — to pay peer tutors to help students with certain introductory classes. It was good because it helped the students, she said, but the costs add up.
It would take thousands of dollars to offer programs like supplemental instruction and peer tutoring in every large class, but if the UI says it cares about students and wants to keep growing, Bigsby said they need to be “willing to put our money where our mouth is.”
“One thing about teaching a large class is you get ‘mean world syndrome,’ because you see a lot of problems, and it’s not that students in these classes are worse than other classes,” Bigsby said. “It’s not that they’re less prepared, it’s not that even a higher proportion of students in these classes are struggling, it’s just that there’s more students. And so if we can support the students, it helps me as the instructor, it helps everybody.”

(Capitol photo by Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner | Larsen photo courtesy of Office of Gov. Jim Pillen)LINCOLN — Gov. Jim Pillen announced Friday that Maureen Larsen, his interim director of Nebraska’s Department of Economic Development, would take over as director.
Larsen has served as interim director since July 21, after former director K.C. Belitz resigned. During that time, Larsen has focused on career opportunities for Nebraska youth, expanding international trade and strengthening public-private partnerships, the Governor’s Office said in a press release.
“Maureen has demonstrated strong leadership and a strong desire to continue supporting my cabinet as director of DED,” Pillen said in the statement. “I have been impressed with her abilities in the short time she has been serving in the interim role, and she deserves this opportunity.”
Larsen’s nomination will require confirmation by the Nebraska Legislature. Prior to her role at DED, Larsen was general counsel to the governor and deputy director of the governor’s Policy Research Office.
Also on Friday, Pillen announced the appointment of Michael Donley to succeed Larsen as his general counsel. Donley has been with the Governor’s Office in an interim capacity during Larsen’s reassignment.
Donley served as general counsel to the Nebraska Department of Administrative Services before joining the Governor’s Office.
“Michael has aptly served my office as interim general counsel,” Pillen said. “He is keenly attuned to the various legal issues requiring attention by the Governor’s Office and has worked well with partner agencies to provide sound advice when needed. I look forward to having him join the team in a permanent role.”

One incident involved pumpkins carved with Nazi swastika and SS bolts. 
The post Two antisemitic incidents at University of Wyoming prompt investigations appeared first on WyoFile .","Two recent incidents involving antisemitic language and symbols at the University of Wyoming are under investigation for potential Title VI and civil rights violations, UW President Ed Seidel said Friday.
“I am writing today concerning various incidents that have occurred on our campus recently, that have taken us some time to piece together,” Seidel wrote in a message to the campus community. “I recognize that this message comes later than some may have expected, but it remains important that I speak to these events and reaffirm our shared values, as outlined in our strategic plan.” 
Both incidents — a collection of jack-o-lanterns carved with Nazi and Ku Klux Klan imagery and a giant beachball bearing antisemitic and homophobic messages — were reported to and investigated by the University of Wyoming Police Department. They are now under review by the school’s Equal Opportunity Report and Response Unit, or EORR. 
“I want to again recognize that this event has caused significant hurt and anger for many in our community,” Seidel wrote. “I hope very much that we can come together as the supportive community that we are, that we must be, and consider how we can all do better in expressing ourselves and supporting one another.”
What we know so far
The most recent incident took place on Oct. 31, Halloween. 
Pumpkins carved with antisemitic imagery and placed at Simpsons Plaza, a high foot-traffic area outside the student union, were reported to campus police around 8:30 a.m., according to a police report. 
One pumpkin displayed a Nazi swastika and SS bolts, another “was carved with a KKK clan member in their hooded robe,” according to the police report. An additional pumpkin was carved with a jumble of profanity and apparent threats including “fuck,” “AIPAC,” the acronym for American Israel Public Affairs Committee and “Hitler.”

Police removed the pumpkins from campus and took photos before disposing of them, according to the report. Using security camera footage of the plaza, police connected the pumpkins back to a student group meeting in the Union the night before. UW redacted the name of the student group as well the individual students in the police report, citing the ongoing EORR investigation. 
“[REDACTED] said his group, [REDACTED], was not targeting any specific group of persons with the pumpkins and it was more about the concept of free speech,” the report stated.
No law enforcement action was taken, according to the report. 
The other incident occurred a week before on Oct. 24 and also involved a student organization, again at Simpson Plaza. 
“I arrived and met with [REDACTED] who is with the [REDACTED] that is doing an event where they have a very large beach ball and anyone can write anything on it that they want,” a police report stated. “He said that during this event they have had some people put some things on it that are distasteful.”
The ball included antisemetic statements and also referenced the infamous murder of gay UW student Matthew Shepard. The messages included: “Kill Jews,” “Matthew Shepard deserved it Gay Prostitute and drug dealer…Rest in Piss,” “Kill the Nazis,” “Where is Jill Kews,” and “Jews did 9/11,” according to the report. 
“I spoke to [REDACTED] about the difference between hate speech and free speech and how they need to be mindful about the difference,” the investigating officer wrote in the report. 
Response
Seidel, who is leaving the school next year, did not respond to the incidents until Friday, a day after the pumpkins had been featured in an Oil City News article. Other campus groups had weighed in earlier.
Seidel’s delayed response to the two incidents frustrated many on campus, including Jennifer Tabler, a professor. 
“When pumpkins carved with swastikas and other Nazi symbols were left in Prexy’s pasture—the most visible communal space on campus—the expectation of many was that UWPD would quietly remove the ‘abandoned property,’ but that the university would say nothing,” Tabler wrote in a letter to Seidel two hours before he made a public statement on Friday. 
“We are choosing to meet expectations, rather than rise above and display excellence in fostering a campus environment that includes all, that is committed to mutual respect,” she wrote.
In the letter, Tabler resigned from a university committee intended to help UW exceed expectations about the kind of place people would want to work, live and learn.
“While I appreciate and recognize the acknowledgements from [Associated Students of the University of Wyoming], faculty Senate and Provost [Anne] Alexander, we can do better,” Tabler wrote. “The tone is set from the top.”

Thursday morning, Faculty Senate Chair Rob Godby sent an email to faculty, informing them “current actions are underway to determine disciplinary actions both through law enforcement and also from any organizations they belong to who will also be looking at taking action.” 
“Education efforts are also underway,” he wrote. 
Godby wrote that it was an opportunity for members of campus to “remind ourselves” of several things including that “we are a community. We stand as one. We respect one another and we include all our members.” 
“This is an opportunity to express our values and to remind those who may feel threatened that we care,” Godby wrote. “I hope with some thinking, we will become better for being reminded of these values.” 
Godby also thanked campus police “for their immediate efforts to identify those responsible and to ensure there is no threat to campus.” He encouraged his colleagues to let their “constituents who may be concerned know there is no threat and also remind them that we care and support them” 
Paula Medina, president of the Associated Students of the University of Wyoming, informed the student body Thursday with an email of her own.  
“We remain deeply disappointed by this incident, recognizing the immense harm that such actions cause to our community,” Medina wrote. “The University of Wyoming should be a place where every student feels welcome. Actions like this compromise the sense of safety and respect that make learning itself possible.”
Both Medina and Godby wrote that the three campus organizations — staff, faculty and students — met with Seidel and his office on Wednesday.

(Photo by Anna Padilla for Source NM)","Approximately 460,000 New Mexico residents receive food benefits through the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. (Getty Images)While the federal government said Friday it will release food aid to states, New Mexico will still hold a special legislative session on Monday, the governor’s office confirmed to Source New Mexico.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced the special session on Thursday, amid ongoing legal wrangling about whether the United States Department would pay out Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits to the 42 million Americans—approximately 460,000 New Mexico residents—who receive them.
The state previously allocated $30 million to tide over New Mexico SNAP recipients for roughly the first 10 days of the month, which will run out Monday.
“Our responsibility is to ensure that families don’t go hungry waiting for this essential nutrition program to resume,” Health Care Authority Kari Armijo said in a statement when the session was announced. “This special session will allow us to continue serving New Mexicans while federal funding for the SNAP program remains uncertain.”
However, the USDA told states Friday it was releasing full November funding for the nation’s major food assistance program that helps 42 million people afford groceries, complying with a federal court order issued Thursday.
The governor’s deputy communications director, Jodi McGinnis Porter, confirmed to Source the state received the letter. Nonetheless, the session will continue.
“The special session is moving forward Monday because Republicans in Congress still refuse to end this needless government shut down,” a statement from McGinnis to Porter said. “While we are relieved that November benefits have been released, we are still cautious about relying on future SNAP funding being available. We’re not taking any chances with 460,000 New Mexicans’ food security.”
Democratic state leadership on Thursday praised the forthcoming special session, while their Republican counterparts criticized New Mexico’s congressional delegation—specifically U.S. Senators Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján, both Democrats—for not voting to reopen the federal government, which is now closed for the 38th day amid an impasse between parties over Democrats’ push to extend health insurance tax subsidies, among other issues.
Heinrich and Luján fired back Friday, saying via a joint statement that “Republicans control the White House, the House, and the Senate. President Trump and Congressional Republicans chose to shut down the government, chose not to lower health care costs, and chose not to use funding they already have — and were ordered by a court to disburse—for SNAP.”
New Mexico’s Republican state legislators, the statement continued, “have not called on President Trump and Congressional Republicans to comply with court orders to fund SNAP, have not called on them to work with Democrats to reopen the government and address skyrocketing health care costs, and have not condemned their party’s decision to block our legislation to keep families fed and pay service members and federal employees. Their silence speaks volumes, and their complicity in Trump’s government shutdown is infuriating.”
New Mexico Senate Republican Whip, Pat Woods (R-Broadview) responded via a statement calling “the irony from Luján and Heinrich is laughable… and predictable. President Trump doesn’t have a vote in the Senate. He can only take action when a bill comes to him. Senators in the U.S. Senate, those people have a vote. Why accuse Trump when it’s your own house that needs to get in order?”
House Republican Leader Gail Armstrong (R-Magdalena), similarly, said via statement: “The only thing blocking federal funding for SNAP, service members, and federal workers is their refusal to vote to reopen the government. Their press releases do nothing for hungry families or unpaid troops. If they are serious about helping New Mexicans, they should stop blaming others and cast the vote that ends the shutdown.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_0521-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-07 18:56:23.278486

The reductions would help ease the strain on air traffic controllers, who have been working without pay during the government shutdown that began Oct. 1. Duffy said controllers were taking second jobs to make ends meet and were experiencing fatigue and stress, leading to safety concerns. Shutdown delays in D.C., Chicago, Atlanta and moreSeven airports on the list of 40 had ground delays Friday, with staffing shortages at 18 air traffic control towers triggering delays at others, according to an FAA advisory. Departures at Washington Reagan National Airport, just outside the nation’s capital in Northern Virginia, were averaging a four-hour delay Friday afternoon, according to FAA data. The airport led the nation with 73 cancellations Friday, according to FlightAware.

Now, there could be a benefit if I can get the controllers to come back to work.”Duffy recommended Friday that travelers continue to book flights now, rather than waiting for the shutdown to end.

Minnesota officials say the benefits could go out to recipients as soon as this weekend. 
Some recipients may get their benefits earlier than usual — a step the state Department of Children, Youth and Families said it is taking to “protect Minnesotans during the uncertainty of potential future court orders.”
For many Minnesota families dealing with the SNAP stoppage during the long government shutdown, the aid can’t come soon enough. Food shelves are taxed and one that the Reformer visited this week had to send people away empty handed. Gov. Tim Walz redirected $4 million in state funding to food shelves at the end of October to help bridge the gap, but the money still fell far short of the emergency food system’s projected needs. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP, sent a letter to state agencies Friday stating that the federal government would make funds available within hours for states to distribute to recipients. 
The two-paragraph letter did not mention the elaborate new formulas USDA sent states Tuesday to provide recipients with partial benefits, apparently rendering the new mandate moot — at least for now.
The federal government shutdown left SNAP without any funding after October. Friday’s court order requires USDA to use contingency funds to cover November benefits.

The top brass at Beta Technologies saw their collective net worth jump by nearly $1.4 billion following the electric plane company’s initial stock offering on Tuesday, according to a company filing with the federal government. Big investors, including BlackRock and an Amazon fund, also saw the value of their investments in the company soar.
Beta Technologies debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday, raising more than $1 billion as it offered 34 million total shares at an initial price of $34 per share. In the following days, the South Burlington-based company’s stock price has oscillated around that figure, dipping to roughly $32 as the market closed on Friday.

Beta’s filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission details the share ownership of directors and executives. Their shares can be sold on the stock market following the expiration of a “lock-up” agreement that lasts 180 days from after Nov. 3, the October filing said.
Kyle Clark, the company’s CEO and founder, directly owns 487,100 shares in the company — an asset now worth roughly $15.5 million at Friday’s share prices. But over $235 million in stock is also held between trusts in his name and the name of his wife, Katie Clark, which do not allow for immediate access.
Clark, who was born in Huntington and traces aspects of Beta back to early engineering projects at Harvard University, said this week that he planned to keep the growing company headquartered in Vermont for now. Beta will be making further investments in its South Burlington-based production facilities in an effort to increase control of its own supply chain, Clark said.
Beta’s public offering also added to the portfolio of John Abele, a member of Beta’s board of directors reported to be Vermont’s only resident billionaire. A Shelburne resident, Abele co-founded Boston Scientific, a medical device company.
Abele directly owns roughly $1 million of Beta’s shares, but also controls roughly $550 million in further company stock via 11 other companies, at Friday’s share prices.

Chuck Davis, the chair of Beta’s board, is another top shareholder with direct or indirect ownership of nearly 15 million shares, valued at around $475 million. Davis, who grew up in Burlington, is the founding CEO of the Connecticut-based investment firm Stone Point Capital.
Five other executives and board members own more than $100 million in stock between them, and Austin Meyer, a California-based engineer and early investor in the company, holds up to nearly $400 million worth of shares.
Directors and executives also hold options to purchase a combined total of 2 million additional shares in the next two months, the SEC filing said.
Some individuals in the company’s corps of over 800 employees may be granted equity-based compensation, with over 1 million shares in this offering being reserved for a “directed share program to our current employees,” according to the filing. The value of those packages combined could be in excess of $40 million at Friday’s share prices. Those shares would not be subject to the 180 day “lock-up” agreement constraining executives and directors.
Beta’s list of major investors includes BlackRock, as well as Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund. BlackRock, a New York-based wealth management company with over $13 trillion in assets under its management, is referred to as a “cornerstone investor” in the company’s filings, and has indicated interest in purchasing up to $300 million of Beta’s stock. The Climate Pledge Fund, created to drive Amazon’s goal of net-zero carbon emissions, was also an early investor in Beta before it went public.

Nearly 700 people sheltered there for two days after ex-typhoon Halong. (Photo by Eric Stone/Alaska Public Media)On a Sunday morning last month, James Taq’ac Amik was huddled on a small bridge with his girlfriend. At 4 a.m., they had scrambled into an 18-foot aluminum motor boat, fleeing floodwaters from a massive storm surge that inundated Kipnuk, a village of 700 in the heart of western Alaska’s sprawling Kuskokwim river delta.
“I couldn’t make it up. I tried, but the wind was too strong to try and go by boat, so we ended up staying on the bridge for five hours,” Amik said. Things only grew more dramatic. “The houses started drifting away around 5:30 a.m.,” Amik said. “There was still lights in them, there was people in them.”
When they set out, the couple were heading to Kipnuk’s public school, the largest building in the Alaska Native Yup’ik village. At least that building, they hoped at the time, would be secure.
The storm that hit Alaska’s west coast in mid-October was the remnants of Typhoon Halong, which picked up momentum in a warmer-than-normal Pacific Ocean. After the wind died down and the floodwaters receded, the village lay in ruins. But while the school still stood relatively unscathed on its steel pilings more than 20 feet above the muck and wreckage, there were other problems inside. District staff had been working on much-needed upgrades to its main generator. Then the school’s backup generator sputtered. Everyone in the community, including Amik and his girlfriend, stayed for two days until local leaders decided the storm had done too much damage and organized a mass evacuation.

When disaster strikes, public school buildings are integral as safe havens in hundreds of predominantly Indigenous villages scattered across Alaska’s vast landscape. In many remote communities, schools are some of the only buildings with flush toilets and their own generators. Schools are often the only buildings that stand on pilings — important amid the rising waters of climate change — and also the only buildings large enough to house dozens if not hundreds of people for days at a time.
“It is a known fact that if you need to evacuate, you evacuate to the elementary school,” said Alaska state Sen. Löki Tobin, a Democrat and chair of the Senate Education Committee, who grew up in Nome but now represents Anchorage.
“Those are lifeboats,” said Alaska’s emergency management director, Bryan Fisher. “They’re the last place of refuge.”
Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Republican and former educator, has declared more than a dozen disasters since August 2024, and in at least half of those cases, public schools were used as emergency shelters. The state reported damage in 52 communities in October, and the impacts forced  hundreds of residents to sleep in gymnasiums and on classroom floors in rural public schools. Since 1998, Alaska has seen more than 140 state-declared disasters, and dozens of those required schools to function as shelters.
But Alaska’s rural schools have been neglected for decades. Earlier this year, ProPublica, KYUK Public Media and NPR documented a health and safety crisis inside many rural school buildings across Alaska. In some cases, the buildings that function as safe havens in times of emergency are becoming emergencies themselves.
The state is required by law to fund construction and maintenance projects in rural school districts because they serve unincorporated communities where there is no tax revenue to help fund education. In the last 28 years, Alaska’s rural school districts have made close to 1,800 requests to the state for money to maintain and repair deteriorating schools, but only 14% of those requests have been approved. And as the backlog of major maintenance projects continues to grow, the state budget has been shrinking.
“Just the maintenance that goes in every day to keep up a building, that’s really where the flaw is,” said Alaska Education Commissioner Deena Bishop. For years, her department has struggled to meet the growing need for dollars to maintain school facilities, including more than 60 owned by the state. “The crux of the situation,” she said during an interview in Juneau last year, is that “we get to an emergency because we didn’t take care of it.”
The main generator that provides power to the school in Kipnuk was not working before hundreds of residents fled there during ex-Typhoon Halong. Lower Kuskokwim School District Superintendent Hannibal Anderson said the generator “was working well enough to provide what it needed for the school.” But it was quickly overwhelmed by the sudden increase in demand for power once the school became Kipnuk’s primary emergency shelter. A smaller backup generator also couldn’t meet that demand to charge cellphones and keep the building heated after the community’s residents piled in.

The school district waited 14 years for the state to approve funding to do a major renovation in 2015, but it has not asked for funding since then. Every year, the applications school districts submit for construction and maintenance funds are ranked. Data analysis and interviews with superintendents across the state indicate that submitting an application that ranks high enough to win funding is cumbersome, and they feel pressure to include professional inspections and surveys, which can be expensive. Anderson explained that although the generator required maintenance, he believed Kipnuk’s needs wouldn’t be considered urgent enough to receive funding. “Kipnuk is a relatively new school,” he said.
In Kotlik, a village of just over 650 residents almost 220 miles north of Kipnuk, 70 people spent two nights at the school. “We have a church and a community building, but those are seldom used in evacuations,” explained Principal Cassius Brown. “That’s because the school is situated higher and it’s not as close to the river.”
Since 2018, the Lower Yukon School District has made annual requests ranging from $2 million to more than $5 million to the state’s education department to make extensive repairs to the school in Kotlik and another in a nearby village. That work remains unfunded.
In Chevak, where about 950 Alaska Native Cup’ik people live less than a dozen miles from the Bering Sea coast, school Principal Lillian Olson said 65 people spent a few nights on the gymnasium floor. “Our community is kind of dependent on the school for shelter,” Olson said. “One time two years ago, we had an electric outage in one part of town that lasted for like a week, and because the houses didn’t have electricity and no heat, we housed them.”
Olson said a test of the building’s fire sprinklers failed in September. In a phone call last spring, Kashunamiut School District Superintendent Jeanne Campbell described a host of problems related to the Chevak school’s boiler and broken water pipes that impacted the fire sprinkler system. “And that’s just inside the building,” Campbell said.
Last year, that school district made its first request to the state’s education department since 2001, asking for $32 million to update and renovate the school. The proposal was one among 114 for fiscal year 2025. The state allocated enough money for only 17 of those projects. Work at the Chevak school was not one of them.
Just over a dozen miles west, in Hooper Bay, Mayor Charlene Nukusuk said between 50 and 60 people sheltered for two nights in that community’s public school. The village’s location makes it extremely vulnerable: Over the last few decades, fall coastal storms have devoured several rows of sand dunes that used to protect the community of 1,375 people. Now, the black and frigid Bering Sea laps at the beach only a few hundred feet from the far corner of the local airport runway. Nukusuk said the school is one of the safest buildings.
Hooper Bay’s school was rebuilt after it was destroyed by fire in 2006. Since then, the district has made 29 funding requests totaling more than $8.4 million in needed repairs to the state for a range of projects on the school including roofing, emergency lighting and siding. Last year, the district received money for one of those — just under $2.3 million for “exterior repairs,” according to state data. The superintendent did not respond to questions about specific needs in Hooper Bay.
Alaska’s emergency management division does not have formal agreements with the state’s education department designating schools as emergency shelters, and neither agency has funding to help maintain schools specifically as emergency shelters. However, a division spokesperson said there are some state grants that schools could access for emergency preparedness.
“Schools are built for educational purposes — other uses are incidental or secondary to design,” education department spokesperson Bryan Zadalis wrote in an email. He said no one from the education department visits schools “to ascertain whether a facility is in condition to serve as an emergency shelter.”
“I don’t know if people necessarily correlated together that if you’re going to use schools as multipurpose facilities, that you also have to maintain them for those purposes,” said Tobin, the state senator. “They’re not just institutions of learning. They’re also institutions of after-school activities, of community gatherings, and of evacuation facilities and disaster preparedness support infrastructure,” she said. In February 2024, Tobin, who also sits on the state Senate’s Military and Veterans Affairs finance subcommittee, put the question of funding schools for emergencies to Craig Christenson, deputy commissioner of the Alaska Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, during a budget meeting.
Alaska’s emergency management division falls under Christenson’s department. “From my understanding,” Tobin said to him, “if the school wasn’t available in some of these very small, rural, remote areas, we would be paying to evacuate people, versus using an asset that we have already put resources into but have already failed to maintain. Is that accurate?”
“I can’t comment on failing to maintain them,” Christenson responded. “Our department does not maintain schools.” (The deputy commissioner declined to comment further on last year’s meeting.)
“But you do utilize them?” Tobin asked.
“We do,” Christenson said.

Gavin Newsom is also facing pressure to oust Commissioner Ricardo Lara as insurance policyholders struggle with delayed and denied claims months after the Los Angeles fires.,"In summary
California Gov. Gavin Newsom is also facing pressure to oust Commissioner Ricardo Lara as insurance policyholders struggle with delayed and denied claims months after the Los Angeles fires.


Survivors of the deadly Los Angeles County fires, some of whom have been unable to rebuild because their insurance claims have been delayed or denied, are calling for California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara to resign.
Lara, a former state lawmaker, has one year left in his second term. 
A recent New York Times article detailing loopholes the insurance industry could exploit in Lara’s plan to try to improve California insurance availability was the last straw, fire survivors said. They said it proved Lara has helped the insurance industry more than he has helped policyholders. 
Lara and others said his plan, which officially rolled out just days before the L.A.-area fires in January, is in its early stages and will take time to work.  
Jill Spivack, a State Farm policyholder whose home burned in the Palisades Fire, said during a press conference Thursday that she has been unable to rebuild.
“We feel alone, we feel forgotten,” she said. She implored Gov. Gavin Newsom to replace Lara. “Californians deserve an insurance commissioner that protects families, not the insurers doing harm,” Spivack said.
Lara — who also faces accusations of improper spending of taxpayer dollars on travel — told CalMatters in an interview that he has no plans to resign.
“I understand the anger (of fire victims),” Lara said. “I’m frustrated with the pace of recovery that involves multiple agencies, multiple levels of government.” 
He mentioned the actions he has taken in response, which include the Insurance Department’s June launch of a formal investigation into State Farm over its handling of claims from the L.A.-area fires; a legal action against the FAIR Plan, the state’s fire insurer of last resort; and a bulletin requiring insurance companies to fully investigate and pay smoke damage claims.
Lara’s efforts aren’t helping survivors quickly enough, some of them say. On a website the group recently launched calling for Lara’s resignation, the Eaton Fire Survivors Network links to surveys that say 70% of policyholders face delays and denials, and that 61% expect to lose housing coverage within months. They want the investigations sped up. They want Lara to pause  approvals of rate increases in the meantime.
Why one survivor wants Lara out
Andrew Wessels is still waiting to move back into his Altadena home, which did not burn down but was damaged. He first spoke with CalMatters in May, as he was battling State Farm over getting his home tested for toxins because he did not want to move his two children back into a potentially unhealthy environment. 
He told CalMatters on Friday that he is still waiting for more tests the insurer ordered as it decides what it wants to pay for. He expects to have to wait until next year before he and his family can actually rebuild. But he feels lucky that he, his wife and kids found semi-permanent housing after shuffling among Airbnbs since the fire. They are now three months into an 18-month lease that State Farm is paying for, and he’s breathing a little easier because he’s “not boxing up things every few weeks.” 
He is joining the call for Lara’s resignation. He said the state’s insurance department recently closed his complaint about State Farm’s handling of his claims based on the company’s word alone — without asking him first. 
“Recent information provided by the insurer states that the matter you originally brought to our attention is currently in stable condition,” the department’s Oct. 8 letter states. 
“It was particularly concerning that it was closed without talking to me,” Wessels said. “They’re supposed to represent me. I think it speaks to who the Department of Insurance actually serves.”
He appealed and asked a couple of his state lawmakers’ staff to contact the department on his behalf, and it reopened his complaint. 
“It was also concerning that ‘if State Farm says it, it must be true,’ since the department is investigating (the insurer) for illegal practices,” Wessels added. That proves a change is needed, he said. 
Newsom spokesperson Tara Gallegos and the governor’s office did not return repeated requests for comment about the calls for the governor to replace Lara.
Nicole Ganley, a spokesperson for the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, said the industry group would have no comment on the effort to oust Lara. She pointed to a letter to the editor the group sent to the New York Times, which took issue with the story about insurers reportedly exploiting loopholes in the commissioner’s new regulations by avoiding writing policies in certain areas, then turning around to request to raise their premiums anyway. 
“The reforms are recent, and their impact is still unfolding,” the letter says in part. “Suggesting failure at this stage misrepresents the facts and risks undermining public confidence in a strategy designed to stabilize coverage in high-risk areas.”
‘No magic wand’ for insurance crisis
Carmen Balber, executive director of Consumer Watchdog, the Los Angeles-based nonprofit organization that is often at odds with Lara, was also at the press conference. Throughout his tenure, her organization has questioned his insurance ties, beginning in 2019 when Lara received and returned campaign contributions from the industry. He ran for office pledging not to take money from companies he’d regulate. 
The organization is also the main intervenor in insurance rate reviews, meaning it often submits challenges to insurers’ proposed rate increases and changes. On Nov. 20, a public hearing is scheduled to discuss Lara’s proposed changes to the intervenor process, which Consumer Watchdog has characterized as the commissioner’s revenge.
“What we’ve seen happen over the past couple of years is things getting worse for consumers, not better,” Balber told CalMatters ahead of the press conference. “We need someone new in charge who will hold the industry accountable to its promises.”
But Amy Bach, executive director of San Francisco-based consumer advocacy group United Policyholders, said she is “sorry to see energy being expended in this direction.”
She said there are legal, regulatory and other efforts underway to try to improve the state’s home insurance market, and that bringing in a different commissioner isn’t likely to speed things up. “​​There is no magic wand that will solve the insurance challenges that are plaguing L.A. wildfire survivors and causing premiums to rise untenably across the state,” Bach said.
Robert Herrell, a former deputy insurance commissioner under Lara’s predecessor, also used the magic-wand analogy. As climate disasters and risks proliferate, there is no easy fix to what ails property insurance in this state, nation and the rest of the world, he said.
Yet he said survivors need a strong commissioner who stands up to the insurance industry. “This is not that commissioner,” said Herrell, who is now executive director of the nonprofit advocacy group Consumer Federation of California. “Just because he says that every time he takes action it’s for the consumers doesn’t make it true.”
Bach said Lara has had to find a way to balance competing interests: “No prior commissioner faced the marketplace conditions he’s faced, so it’s hard to say whether a heavier-handed approach would have worked any better than what he’s trying to achieve.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/091924_Ricardo-Lara_FG_CM_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-07 17:57:11.809480
,DC,2025-11-07 22:37:00+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Struggle in US Senate over government shutdown likely to drag through the weekend,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/struggle-us-senate-over-government-shutdown-likely-drag-through-weekend,,"WASHINGTON — Senators on Friday said they plan to remain in town for the weekend, a sign negotiations may be picking up to approve a stopgap spending measure and end the government shutdown, now at day 38.A vote on a package of spending bills could come either Saturday or Sunday that would partially fund the government, Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters.“Our members are going to be advised to be available if there's a need to vote,” Thune said. “We will see what happens and whether or not, over the course of the next couple of days, the Democrats can find a way to reengage again.”Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer offered a proposal from Democrats to agree to reopen the government if health care tax subsidies are continued for a year. As open enrollment begins, people who buy their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace are seeing a drastic increase in premium costs.“We’d like to offer a simple proposal,” the New York Democrat said. “To reopen the government and extend the (Affordable Care Act) tax credits simultaneously.” Republicans have maintained that any discussion on extending the health care tax credits set to expire at the end of the year will only happen after government funding resumes. House Speaker Mike Johnson this week said he would not promise a vote on the GOP-controlled House floor regarding the issue. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in September found that if lawmakers permanently extend the enhanced tax credits for certain people who buy their health insurance through the ACA Marketplace, it would cost the government $350 billion over 10 years and increase the number of those with health insurance by 3.8 million.But it was unclear how much traction Schumer would get. Several Republicans called the proposal a “non-starter,” such as Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota. Rounds also questioned if the stopgap spending bill that Democrats agreed to support is the House-passed version that would extend government funding only to Nov. 21 or another that would run longer. “It’s good that they’re recognizing that we have to open up the government,” Rounds said of Democrats. Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin called the proposal from Democrats “absurd,” and said there was no way senators could negotiate a deal on health care quickly.He added that Trump also wants to be part of the negotiations on health care.“Whatever we do as Republicans, we've got to really work close with the president,” Mullin said. “The President wants to be involved in this negotiation.”Separately, senators are expected to take a Friday vote on a bill from Wisconsin GOP Sen. Ron Johnson to pay federal workers who Friday missed their second paycheck. President Donald Trump on social media said, ""The United States Senate should not leave town until they have a Deal to end the Democrat Shutdown. If they can’t reach a Deal, the Republicans should terminate the Filibuster, IMMEDIATELY, and take care of our Great American Workers!""Flight cutbacks, food aid disruptionThe Senate has failed 14 times to move forward on approving a stopgap spending measure to fund the government until Nov. 21. As the government shutdown has dragged on for nearly seven weeks, major airports have been hit as they struggle to maintain flight schedules, with air traffic controllers now more than a month without pay.Meanwhile, federal courts have forced the Trump administration to release billions in emergency funds to provide critical food assistance to 42 million people. On Friday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it would issue full November benefits for food assistance in compliance with a court order.As the debate in Congress goes on, Democrats have refused to back the House-passed version of the GOP stopgap measure over their concerns about the expiration of health care subsidies.Democrats also want to see federal workers laid off by the Trump administration amid the shutdown rehired. Major wins across the country for Democrats in Tuesday elections in the states bolstered their resolve to reject efforts to end the government shutdown that do not include certain policy wins.  Historically, lawmakers who have forced shutdowns over policy preferences have not been successful. In 2013, the GOP tried to repeal or delay the Affordable Care Act, which did not happen, and in the 2018-2019 shutdown, Trump, in his first term, insisted on additional funding for a border wall. But that shutdown — which set a record exceeded only by the ongoing shutdown — concluded 35 days later with the same amount of money included in the original appropriations bill. Thune lamentThune told reporters Friday that he thought progress was being made on striking a deal to resume government funding, but he said after Democrats’ Thursday caucus meeting, their tune changed. “Right now, we've got to get the Democrats kind of back engaged,” Thune said.Following Thursday’s meeting, Democrats remained tight-lipped and did not seem any closer to an internal agreement on how to move forward with resolving the government shutdown.“I thought we were on a track,” Thune, a South Dakota Republican said. “We'd give them everything they wanted or had asked for.”Senate Republicans have agreed to allow a floor vote on the Affordable Care Act subsidies and have opened the door to rehiring federal workers, but have not gone further.“At some point … they have to take yes for an answer, and they were trending in that direction,” Thune said. “And then yesterday, everything kind of, the wheels came off, so to speak, but it's up to them.”Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut told reporters Thursday that voters this week made a strong showing in rebuking the Trump administration and that Democrats need to continue their fight amid the government shutdown.“On Tuesday, all of us in the caucus heard that loud and clear,” Murphy said. “We want to stay together and unified. I think everybody understands the importance of what happened on Tuesday, and wants us to move forward in a way that honors that.”Bill to pay federal workersFederal workers going without salaries for more than a month now remains a concern, and Johnson tried to pass his bill through unanimous consent that would send them paychecks. Employees are paid after the end of a shutdown, under the law.Michigan’s Gary Peters objected to Johnson’s bill over concerns that the Trump administration would not use the funds to pay federal workers, and the measure would not prevent the firing of federal workers. Peters pointed to how the Trump administration initially appealed a federal court order that compelled the U.S. Department of Agriculture to pay $9 billion in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits. Peters offered his own bill to set “guardrails” on the president's authority to ensure that the funds are used to pay federal workers and not moved around. The Trump administration has moved around billions in multi-year research funds within the Defense Department to ensure that troops are paid. “He walks over Congress all the time,” Peters said of the president while on the Senate floor. Johnson objected to Peters' bill. He argued that his bill does not expand presidential powers.“We were very careful that it wouldn't do that,” Johnson told reporters of his bill.The American Federation of Government Employees, a union that represents 800,000 federal workers, urged Democrats Friday to support Johnson’s bill.AFGE National President Everett Kelley said in a letter to senators Friday that with Thanksgiving in less than three weeks, Congress needs to come to an agreement on funding the government. “Every missed paycheck deepens the financial hole in which federal workers and their families find themselves,” Kelley said. “By the time Congress reaches a compromise, the damage will have been done to their bank accounts, their credit ratings, their health, and their dignity.”",,,,2025-11-07 17:57:11.809480

Sign up for their newsletter here.
New York environmental regulators on Friday approved a major Trump-backed underwater gas pipeline in a U-turn for state energy policy. 
The state Department of Environmental Conservation issued crucial water permits for the Northeast Supply Enhancement project, which it had rejected three times in the past. 
At the same time, the DEC announced that the even larger Constitution pipeline, slated to cross New York into New England, would not move ahead. Both pipelines were priorities for President Donald Trump, who railed against Governor Kathy Hochul on social media earlier this week for moving too slowly on the projects.
Hochul said she stood by the DEC’s decisions.
“We need to govern in reality,” she said in a statement Friday. “We are facing war against clean energy from Washington Republicans, including our New York delegation, which is why we have adopted an all-of-the-above approach that includes a continued commitment to renewables and nuclear power to ensure grid reliability and affordability.” She said that DEC’s approvals followed the review standard she had spelled out to Trump in May during talks that many credited with reviving the two pipeline projects. (Hochul has denied any quid pro quo.) 
“While I have expressed an openness to natural gas, I have also been crystal clear that all proposed projects must be reviewed impartially by the required agencies to determine compliance with state and federal laws,” Hochul said, noting that the Constitution pipeline failed to meet the bar. 
NESE is set to be New York’s first new gas pipeline in at least a decade, and by far the state’s largest expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure since passing its flagship climate law in 2019. 
Climate advocacy groups pounced on the decision, calling it a betrayal.
“Hochul has shown New Yorkers she’d prefer to do Trump’s dirty work rather than protect our waterways from pollution,” said Laura Shindell, New York state director at Food & Water Watch.  “She hasn’t kept her promises to fight against skyrocketing energy bills or the climate crisis. But New Yorkers will fight Hochul’s dirty pipeline every step of the way — alongside our communities — until it is stopped for good.”
“Governor Hochul is turning her back on the same agency scientists that determined the NESE pipeline would cause unacceptable degradation of water quality and marine life to NY waters just a few years ago,” said Roger Downs, conservation director of the Sierra Club’s Atlantic Chapter.
The DEC’s cover letter for the NESE permits did not detail how the pipeline’s construction would meet state water standards when the agency found the opposite five years ago, except noting that burying the pipeline two feet shallower than previously planned would dredge up less toxic sediment. The main permit requires Williams, the pipeline builder, to pay about $24 million to compensate for damages to fish and clam habitats. The DEC stated outright that the project is “inconsistent” with the emissions requirements of the state’s climate law, but said that mandate was overridden by energy regulators’ September finding that the pipeline was needed to maintain a reliable gas system downstate. 
The pipeline is projected to cost upwards of $2 billion, adding an extra $7.50 per month to average gas bills for National Grid customers in New York City and Long Island, the utility has estimated. 
The Independent Power Producers of New York, a power plant trade group, cheered the decision.
““New York’s energy landscape is at a pivotal moment,” said the group’s president Gavin Donohue. “I commend the DEC for recognizing that natural gas will continue to play a key role in the State’s energy future.”

(Photo by Glen Stubbe/Minnesota Reformer)The sheriff’s offices in eight Minnesota counties have agreed to assist federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement in their effort to ramp up deportations around the country, which immigrant rights advocates say creates a dangerous risk of civil rights violations, among other problems.  
The counties are Cass, Crow Wing, Freeborn, Itasca, Jackson, Kandiyohi, Mille Lacs and Sherburne, according to a list of agreements posted on the ICE website.
Freeborn, Kandiyohi and Sherburne counties have longstanding agreements with immigration authorities to detain immigrants in their county jails. 
The 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act gave ICE permission to enter into contracts with local law enforcement agencies to assist with the arrest and detention of immigrants. The contracts fall into three categories: task force model, warrant service officer and jail enforcement model. 
Sheriff’s offices with task force model agreements — Cass, Crow Wing, Itasca and Millie Lacs — can enforce immigration law on the streets or during routine police work, like traffic stops. The program was discontinued in 2012 after several controversies and a federal court finding that officers committed racial profiling.
The Trump administration revived the task force model shortly after the president’s inauguration to a second term. 
Warrant service officer contracts — signed by the sheriff’s offices of Crow Wing, Freeborn, Jackson and Kandiyohi counties — allow local officers to perform immigration arrests within jails and correctional facilities when requested, though those officers cannot independently interrogate detainees on their immigration status.
The jail enforcement model contracts, like that in Sherburne County, permit local law enforcement officers to question the immigration status of people held in the county jail, and detain them for up to 48 hours.
The Minnesota Interfaith Coalition on Immigration, or ICOM, is a member of several coalitions opposing the deputization of local law enforcement agencies to carry out federal immigration enforcement. 
“I want my law enforcement to have healthy relationships with everybody in the community, regardless of immigration status,” ICOM advocacy director Greg King said. Immigrants are less likely to report crimes or ask for help when local law enforcement officers arrest immigrants. Using local police for immigration enforcement also directs resources away from more serious crime and creates an avenue for racial profiling, King said. 
ICOM and allied organizations have backed state legislation that would bar Minnesota law enforcement agencies from entering into agreements with ICE, but that bill never passed. King said he expects it to be re-introduced in 2026; Republican House Speaker Lisa Demuth, who is also a candidate for governor, will surely block it. 
Other states have passed the opposite legislation — requiring local agencies to support ICE.

(Photo courtesy Ian Philabaum)The contract between Torrance County and federal immigration authorities to house immigrant detainees at an Estancia jail has been expired now for a week, a lapse that immigrant legal advocates say necessitates detainees’ immediate release. 
The Torrance County Detention Facility in Estancia is one of three in New Mexico that has an agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to house detainees. But that agreement expired Oct. 31 and  has not been renewed, advocates for the detainees and Torrance County Commission Chair Ryan Schwebach told Source New Mexico on Friday.
Ian Philabaum, a program director for Innovation Law Lab, said Friday that the contract’s expiration means ICE and CoreCivic, the private company that owns and operates the jail, no longer can legally hold hundreds of ICE detainees. Innovation Law Lab attorneys conduct weekly legal aid meetings with detainees and also are seeking to shut the facility down. 
Philabaum cited a section of ICE’s standard operating procedures that says a contract expiration requires the removal of all detainees and ICE equipment on or before the expiration date. 
Torrance County’s ICE detention agreement set to expire in two days amid federal shutdown

“CoreCivic and ICE are detaining people in immigration custody without the authority to do so, and because they cannot detain people at [the facility], they should all be released immediately,” he said. 
County Manager Jordan Barela did not respond to Source’s calls and emails Friday about the status of the contract. Source’s calls and emails to CoreCivic and ICE officials also were not returned Friday.
Amid the fallout of the contract expiration, Source received an email Friday from Rogelio Izquierdo, a detainee at the facility, who wrote a letter alleging that CoreCivic is continually denying detainees access to their lawyers. Six other detainees signed the letter. 
Philabaum confirmed Friday that Izquierdo is one of the nonprofit’s clients but said he wasn’t authorized to comment further about his case. He said Innovation Law Lab also received the letter and confirmed its authenticity.
CoreCivic’s alleged failure to facilitate detainees’ legal assistance denies “access to a fair defense and violate[s] the fundamental principle of equality before the law,” Izquierdo wrote. 
The most recent example occurred Thursday, according to the letter, when Izquierdo prepared to meet with his lawyers to collect “important translated documents” he needed for a final court hearing Nov. 13. But Izquierdo said he was never called to meet with his attorneys and then, around 2 p.m., officers told him that his lawyers had already left. 
What actually happened, according to Philabaum, is that Innovation Law Lab lawyers had arrived at the facility for their usual Thursday legal appointments but were ordered to leave about 30 minutes afterward.
U.S. Sen. Heinrich: Torrance ICE lockup ‘inadequate’ and ‘inappropriate’

The reason officers told them to leave, he said, is that they were “investigating” a protest the day before.
According to Philabaum, a few dozen protesters organized into a caravan that drove past the facility on Wednesday. He described it as a peaceful protest over the expired contract, and said he has no idea why CoreCivic would investigate it or use it as a reason to deny legal aid attorneys access.
“The response of ICE and Core Civic, which was clearly coordinated, was to deny access to counsel, which is extremely problematic…and a clear demonstration that it is not business as usual,” at the facility, he said. “They are continuing to ramp up their actions of impunity with respect to how they navigate immigration detention.”
In addition to citing the Thursday legal meeting that CoreCivic canceled, Izquierdo said CoreCivic often abruptly cancels meetings with lawyers without explanation, that detainees don’t have access to the legal library, phone communication does not work well and detainees have little access to pro bono attorneys.
The Estancia detention center has increasingly been at the center of statewide debates about local immigration detention amid President Donald Trump’s mass deportation push. 
U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) in June called for the center to be closed after his staff reported seeing “troubling conditions” during a visit in late May. A local advisory committee to the United States Civil Rights Commission made the same recommendation in  September.
According to the latest figures from DetentionReports, the facility now has an average daily population of about 550 detainees, which is about 150 more than earlier this year. Most of them are brought to Estancia from other states, Philabaum said, though some are from New Mexico.
Barela and other county officials have said the center provides “millions of dollars” in salaries to local residents in an otherwise depressed area.
Schwebach, the Commission chair, told Source in a phone interview that he’s growing tired of the controversy, which he said has resulted in threats against his family. He blamed out-of-town activists who he said don’t understand the importance of the facility to the community or ICE’s role in keeping people safe.
“They are not willing to look at the whole picture. And quite honestly, I’m getting tired of it,” he said. “I mean, do we not need any prisons within this country? Is that the end goal?”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_9750-1024x866.jpg,,,2025-11-07 17:57:11.809480

SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC, had been operating without official, published rules for the last few legislative sessions. That led to public disagreements between some members of the committee, and created some confusion about what it takes to pass and advance a budget out of JFAC. 
JFAC’s procedures were so confusing that at one point in March, the committee appeared to deviate from its own procedures when the committee’s two co-chairs, Sen. Scott Grow, R-Eagle, and Rep. Wendy Horman, R-Idaho Falls, did not have a written script in front of them to guide them through the process. 
Almost every other Idaho legislative committee has clear consistent rules governing how it meets, how it votes and what it takes to advance a bill. 
Everything that happens in JFAC is watched closely because the committee sets all of the budgets for every state agency and department. Whether it is money for Idaho State Police, pay and benefits for state employees or the budgets for Idaho’s K-12 public school system, it all goes through JFAC. 
 Budget committee’s co-chairs reach agreement on rules with leaders of Idaho House and Idaho Senate

On Thursday, Grow and Horman announced that they had reached agreements with House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, and Senate President Pro Tem Kelly Anthon, R-Rupert, on procedures to guide JFAC. The procedures are outlined in a letter that Grow and Horman gave the other members of JFAC and the Idaho Capital Sun on Thursday. 
Idaho DOGE Task Force shares potential list of state programs, agencies to combine or eliminate

JFAC is made up of 20 members – 10 each from the Idaho House of Representatives and Idaho Senate. 
The biggest change is that it will no longer take six votes each from the 10 House members on JFAC and the 10 Idaho Senate members on JFAC to pass a budget. 
Instead, it will take a simple majority of those members present from each legislative chamber to pass a budget. 
That’s important because in 2025 – even when members were absent during a JFAC meeting – it still took six votes from each chamber. For example, if there were seven JFAC members from the Senate present and seven JFAC members from the House present, it took six “yes” votes from each chamber to pass a budget in 2025. That gave enormous power and leverage to any JFAC members who opposed budgets or budget line items because of the high bar required to pass a budget. 
Under the new procedures unveiled Thursday, it would only take four votes from each chamber to pass a budget under a scenario where seven members are present from each chamber for a vote. 
“So that’s going to make it easier for us to get things out of JFAC,” Grow said Thursday. 
JFAC will still count votes separately between the House members and Senate members. And any budget that fails to receive a majority vote among those members present from both chambers will be considered dead. If a budget dies, it can be rewritten and brought back at a later date to be considered.
 Rules outline how the committee’s co-chairs will share leadership responsibilities during the legislative session

The new JFAC procedures also specify that chairmanship of JFAC will alternate daily between the Senate Finance chairman (Grow) one day and the House Appropriations chairwoman (Horman) the next day. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In March, Moyle told the Idaho Capital Sun that one of the reasons the Idaho House did not adopt joint rules during the organizational session leading up to the 2025 legislative session is because he disagreed with Joint Rule 11, which gave the chairmanship of joint committees like JFAC to the Senate chairman. 
“… We’re not going to give up the ability to set agendas and share the chair, basically, and that’s the problem,” Moyle said in March.
After meeting with Moyle and Anthon, Grow said “the preference” is to bring a formal joint rule forward for both chambers of the Idaho Legislature to vote on and adopt during the upcoming 2026 legislative session. 
Grow said he and Horman wanted to distribute a letter outlining procedures now because he isn’t sure when the joint rule will come forward. 
“So in the interim – because here’s the problem – we don’t want to wait because we don’t know when the joint rule will be able to come out in the session,” Grow said. “We hope it’s the first week. But in case it isn’t, this will give you a little clarification.”
Sens. Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, and Kevin Cook, R-Idaho Falls, asked Grow and Horman if JFAC could vote on accepting the new procedures outlined in the letter.
Grow responded saying he had been told just to pass the letter out and that a formal joint rule coming forward later would “solve all of our problems.” 
In the interim, Grow told Cook that the letter outlining the new procedures represents their best shot to provide some consensus.
The Idaho Legislature is not in session now, but JFAC conducted three days of budget meetings and workshops in Boise this week to prepare for the upcoming 2026 legislative session.
The 2026 legislative session is scheduled to begin Jan. 12 at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise.

Jim Runestad of White Lake, has resigned from her post, the party confirmed on Friday — and with that has come rumors that she is gearing up to run for Michigan’s soon-to-be vacant U.S. Senate seat.
Well-known Republican political consultants confirmed with Michigan Advance on Friday that the speculation over Smith resigning and seeking the Senate seat have been boiling over the past several weeks, and that she had been telling high-profile members of the GOP of her plans to seek Michigan’s U.S. Senate seat that will open up with the retirement of U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Township) next year.
Both Jason Cabel Roe, of Roe Strategic LLC, as well as Dennis Lennox, who has worked in strategic communications over the past decade, as well as for high profile party events, told the Advance that they were privy to that speculation, as well.
A message seeking comment from Smith was not immediately returned.

Runestad confirmed to Michigan Advance on Friday that Smith resigned, but could not say whether that resignation occurred on Thursday or today. 
Although the party won’t officially select a nominee until the August 2026 primary election, the Republican establishment in Michigan and abroad has been posturing as all in on Mike Rogers, a former mid-Michigan congressman and the only big name in the race. Rogers has also been endorsed by President Donald Trump.
For Smith, who is known by GOP grassroots activists throughout Michigan and was a party leader even before she was chosen by party delegates earlier this year to ascend as co-chair with Runestad, jumping into the race now may not bode well for Rogers, whose campaign has proceeded as if the nomination was secured.
Earlier buzz that U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Holland Township) would also seek the nomination ended in July, when he confirmed he would instead seek reelection to his West Michigan congressional seat.
But there have been some dissenting voices questioning whether grassroots Republicans were ready to bet on Rogers to the degree that national Republicans were.
A message was also left for the Rogers’ campaign, but has yet to be returned.
Adding fuel to the speculation is the fact that Smith’s personal website, which was used during her previous campaign for ethnic vice chair of the Michigan Republican Party and later when she ran with Runestad, has a registered cloned domain name of bernadettesmithforsenate.com.
That URL redirects to Smith’s existing website. The domain was registered on Oct. 22. 
No campaign committee information for Smith exists in the Federal Elections Commission candidate database, but new filings could be affected by the ongoing federal government shutdown.

(Photo courtesy of New Mexico Aging Services)New Mexico’s Aging and Long-Term Care Department launched its Kinship Caregiving Pilot Program this month, connecting grandparents, family members and family friends raising children not biologically theirs to services and monthly financial support.
House Bill 252 passed during the legislative session earlier this year established the pilot program to support New Mexico caregivers and children to thrive in their own homes. The bill authorized the department to create the program, establish participant eligibility and connect eligible families to monthly financial support. The program launched in Rio Arriba and San Juan counties on Nov. 1 and the department is now accepting applications.
HB252 notes that the three-year pilot will be offered in five to seven counties with up to 50 participants in each county. ALTSD Deputy Secretary Angelina Flores-Montoya told Source New Mexico that to start, the department chose two counties with some of the greatest need, and has plans to expand to more counties by spring 2025. 
According to a 2024 report by the LANL Foundation, about 36,000 children were in kinship care in 2023, though the report states that the number is likely an underestimate due to informal arrangements with families and close friends. The report also notes that the number of children in kinship care in New Mexico is much higher than the nationwide average of 3%, and is often caused by “parental alcohol and drug misuse.” 
“While grandparents and kin often play a pivotal role in raising children, offering cultural and linguistic connection, a sense of extended love, community, and support, many kinship caregivers are unexpectedly raising children due to difficult circumstances,” the report reads. “These caregivers are often unprepared emotionally, mentally, physically, financially or logistically to take on these new responsibilities.”
Kinship program will begin after rulemaking this summer

Flores-Montoya said the department is reviewing applications and starting to notify families of their status. However, the stipend for Rio Arriba and San Juan participants will not start until January 2026. Financial assistance is based on the caregiver’s household income and the needs of the child, according to the bill, and comes from private partnerships. The Los Alamos National Laboratory Foundation and the Anchorum Health Foundation will support participants in Rio Arriba County and San Juan County respectively. 
“Because this is a pilot program, we’re actually still testing sort of what our case loads will be for our case managers, but we’re going to start with 50 and we have the funding for 50 participants to receive the stipend, but anyone is eligible for the navigation services,” Flores-Montoya said. “The state will provide the navigation services, the staff, the evaluation, a number of the operational pieces, the legal services, but the private or foundational partner in that partnership will provide the financial stipend.”
She emphasized that families not chosen to participate in the pilot program and to receive financial assistance will still have access to state and local services.
“In New Mexico, we know that families take many forms,” Emily Kaltenbach, ALTSD Secretary, said in a statement. “Kinship caregivers help keep these children connected to their roots and their communities. This pilot program is about honoring that and helping provide the tools, support and stability these caregivers need to continue providing those safe and nurturing homes.”
Flores-Montoya told Source that the department is also working with school districts throughout the state, health clinics, family resource centers and other community partners “that might provide similar services to either foster families or other kinship families.”
How to apply, eligibility and how the program is going to help count among the most common questions, Flores-Montoya said. “We’re working with all of these different organizations and everyone is extremely excited that there’s just another opportunity and program that can help to support these families.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ESP06187-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-07 17:17:10.278602

Photo by Gordon Miller/Stowe Reporter
This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in the Stowe Reporter on Nov. 6, 2025.
The Skinny Pancake, a regional breakfast and brunch chain, will close its Stowe location for at least the winter season, blaming an inability to hire and retain enough staff to effectively run the restaurant.
In an open letter published on the restaurant’s website and on social media, Skinny Pancake owner Benjy Adler was unequivocal in pointing to Stowe’s housing and labor crises as the forces preventing him from keeping his Stowe location open.
Adler wrote that the entire state of Vermont, where he operates four restaurants, has a housing and labor shortage, but the problem is more acute in Stowe than anywhere else. He pointed to the long commutes employees have had to make to work at his restaurant to an inability to live nearby, a problem a July Housing Needs Assessment commissioned by the town of Stowe also identified as a primary contributor to the town’s tight labor market.
“Vermont has a very severe and different employment issue than Massachusetts or New York, and it is worse in Stowe than any of the other places we operate, by far,” Adler said.
He described an endless hiring cycle that frustrated any attempt to build a sustainable work culture, workers driving from an hour away, and a tight labor market compromising the standards he generally holds for prospective employees. He said both he and his regional manager have compromised their work-life balance just to keep the doors open on the weekends.
Adler acquired the former location of McCarthy’s, a restaurant that operated in Stowe for decades, at the end of 2019, and had managed to endure the pandemic, but has had a tougher time managing the problems created by the market forces that continued in its wake.
He also pointed to an inability to compete in Stowe’s shallow labor pool against restaurants that function more as hotel and resort amenities rather than standalone businesses, referring to them as “certain employers in town that don’t need to make money on food service.”
While he called on “town planners, community members and stakeholders to dig deep in addressing this issue in a long term and meaningful way” in his open letter, Adler admitted he has been busy trying to keep the doors open and manage his eight still-open restaurants while trying to open a new location in Albany, New York; he has not been, that is, watching the discussion and policy development currently underway in an attempt to address the town’s housing crisis.
After a short-term rental registry that went live this spring revealed that a large majority of rental owners don’t live in the town, the town has begun taking steps toward encouraging the building of more affordable housing and limiting rentals.
The Stowe Selectboard recently began drafting new policy that would place a cap on short-term rentals. The planning commission has also recommended the town hire a consultant and lawyer to draft an inclusionary zoning ordinance that could encourage the development of more affordable housing in Stowe. Other discussions indicate an interest in potentially establishing a housing reserve trust to manage funding meant to address the town’s housing issues.
The Skinny Pancake isn’t saying goodbye to Stowe quite yet, and Adler plans to take some time to reset and reconsider how the restaurant operates, including organizational structure and compensation, but the problems plaguing his restaurant and others in Stowe are unlikely to be solved in a season.
“If this town wants a sustainable tourist industry, it needs housing in town, not people driving from an hour away,” he said

Ned Lamont released a call, and an agenda, for a special session of the Connecticut General Assembly Friday afternoon after revealing a re-worked version of a housing bill that he spent months negotiating with lawmakers and municipal leaders.
In addition to taking a second bite at the apple of housing reform, Connecticut lawmakers will take up immigration, food assistance, a hospital acquisition and other issues when they convene in Hartford next week for a two-day session.
Among the most pressing issues is the ongoing federal government shutdown that threatens to cut off funding for food stamps, energy assistance and other programs that send federal money flowing into Connecticut. In addition, Democrats want to pass new protections for immigrants that would prevent their data from being shared by state agencies with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The session agenda also includes a bonding package that would provide funding to expand the UConn Health system, as well as a bill to replenish the state’s firefighter cancer relief fund with a new surcharge on monthly phone bills.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said lawmakers will take up those items through several separate bills rather than combining them into one omnibus measure.
The special session will take place over two days to pass the bills, with the House meeting on Nov. 12 followed by the Senate on Nov. 13. While Republicans are expected to voice opposition to some of items on the call, Democrats control both chambers and are expected to send the entire slate of bills to Lamont’s desk.
“It’s going to be a long day, but it should be relatively smooth,” Ritter said. 
Budget reserves
In order to prepare for the loss of federal funding due to the ongoing government shutdown — which became the longest in U.S. history this week — or other cuts that may emerge from the Trump administration, Lamont and lawmakers have agreed to direct another $500 million into the state’s rainy day fund.
That fund is currently full at it’s statutory limit of $4.3 billion, or 18% of the general fund. The special session legislation will temporarily raise that limit to $4.8 billion through the end of the fiscal year on June 30, 2026.
Lamont will have broad discretion over how to spend the additional $500 million, Ritter said, as long as it is related to the loss of federal revenues. 
In particular, lawmakers in both parties have been pushing Lamont to use the state’s ample budget reserves to prevent the loss of any federal benefits through programs such as food stamps or the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which provides provides winter heating assistance. 
“Generally I am supportive of doing something to mitigate the impact from the government shutdown, including the loss of SNAP and LIHEAP,” said House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford. 
Speaking to reporters on Friday, Lamont said that he had already authorized the Department of Social Services to fully fund SNAP benefits through the end of this month by using up to $72 million from the state’s rainy day fund. 
The announcement came after the Trump administration sought permission from a federal appeals court to only partially fund the program, then reversed course. Roughly 360,000 Connecticut residents rely on SNAP benefits to purchase food.
“This herky-jerky back and forth is driving people crazy,” Lamont said. “Let’s take care of people. We can afford to do it.”
Immigration
In response to a months-long push by Democrats and local activists, the special session will also include legislation prohibiting immigration officers from wearing masks while making arrests, and limiting when state agencies such as the Department of Motor Vehicles can share residents’ data with federal officials.
In addition, the bill is will codify a policy put in place by the Connecticut Supreme Court earlier this year preventing federal agents from making immigration related arrests within state courthouses without a warrant.
Those changes are aimed at bolstering an existing state law, the Trust Act, which generally prohibits local and state law enforcement from arresting someone solely on the basis of a request from ICE to do so. There are some exceptions, such as when ICE presents a judicial warrant, if the person is on a terrorist watch list or if they have been convicted or pleaded guilty to certain felony crimes.
The Trust Act has been the subject of intense debate in the state legislature, and changes were eventually passed that expanded the list of crimes for which police officers could hand someone over to ICE and opened an avenue for people to sue cities and towns that cooperated with ICE in violation of state law.
But in the wake of high profile detentions by ICE, including enforcement activities in the courthouse in Stamford, in downtown Danbury and at a car wash in Newington, advocates have been calling on state lawmakers to further limit federal officials’ ability to access information or enter certain facilities.
In September, 92 organizations wrote a letter to Gov. Ned Lamont asking that the state limit the amount of personal data shared between state agencies and the federal government, prohibit ICE from making arrests at courthouses and continue to offer state health insurance to unauthorized migrant children and pregnant women.
“Now is the time for our elected officials to meet this moment with the urgency it requires,” the letter said. “This moment makes it clear – Connecticut must not be complicit in the federal government’s abusive immigration enforcement tactics or its creeping authoritarianism.”
The latest bill is expected to attract pushback from Republicans, who have accused Democrats in Connecticut of hindering federal law enforcement operations. 
“By not allowing arrests in courts, and not cooperating with the federal agencies, ICE has become sort of a lone ranger,” Candelora said.
Hospital money
The legislature will vote to authorize a bonding package to fund the expansion of UConn Health. The planned expansion includes the purchase of Waterbury Hospital from bankrupt hospital operator Prospect Medical Holdings, as well as the acquisition of two other private, independent hospitals that are also struggling: Bristol Hospital and Day Kimball Hospital in Putnam.
If approved by the legislature, the state could borrow as much as $390 million to invest in the hospitals over a five-year period, according to a presentation during an Oct. 3 meeting of the University of Connecticut’s Board of Trustees and the UConn Health Board of Directors.
The debt would be added to the “UConn 2000” bonding package and go towards the acquisition of Waterbury Hospital and capital improvements projects at all three facilities. The financing to purchase Bristol and Day Kimball Hospitals would be handled separately, State Comptroller Sean Scanlon told The Connecticut Mirror last month. He said Waterbury Hospital, in particular, would need a major influx of capital funding to bring it up to the state’s standards for medical facilities.
On Friday, UConn Health submitted a $13 million offer to acquire Waterbury, including $4 million for the operating assets and $9 million for the real estate. The state will also assume a limited set of the hospital’s liabilities, bringing the deal’s total value up to $35 million, according to the terms laid out in court documents.
During a press conference, Lamont highlighted the effort it took to find a buyer for the struggling hospital.
“We had to work really hard after what Prospect did to that hospital. We’ve got a strong bidder,” Lamont said. “I want people to know Waterbury Hospital is going to thrive under new leadership.”
Firefighters and other items
The session will also include an update to recently-passed legislation imposing a 5-cent fee on monthly phone bills to provide a steady revenue stream to the Connecticut firefighters cancer relief account. The account provides wage replacementbenefits for both paid and volunteer firefighters diagnosed with cancer. 
While the fee was originally approved by lawmakers as part of budget legislation earlier this year, the language included an opt-out provision that has been difficult for the phone companies to implement, according to Todd Murphy, a spokesman for the House Democrats.
As a result, lawmakers are planning to remove the opt-out provision and delay the implementation of the fee until a later date, Murphy said. 
Republicans had voiced opposition to the fee when it was first proposed, and some may do so again when it is brought back up in the special session. The Senate Minority Leader, Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, called the firefighters fund a “noble cause,” but suggested the roughly $3 million that is expected to be collected from the fees could come from other areas.
“I’d much rather see that in the confines of the state budget than to see it off budget and collected as some kind of fee,” Harding said. 
Lawmakers will also take up a childrens’ behavior health bill that passed with bipartisan support in the House in June, only to die in the Senate. There are also smaller changes having to do with applications for the Temporary Family Assistance program as well as clarifying procedures around the creation of electoral districts.

“Plastic fields are a particularly harmful plan in a town like Hinesburg that relies on well water,” said Jennifer Decker, a self-described “clean water activist” who sits on the Hinesburg Planning Commission.

This story by Jason Starr was first published in the Williston Observer on Nov. 6, 2025.
Night games. Outdoor assemblies. Alumni events — members of the Champlain Valley Union High School community are thrilled at the possibility of adding an artificial turf field to the high school grounds in Hinesburg. 
But a group of residents tasked with protecting the town’s natural resources is coalescing in opposition to the project. 
In August, Charlotte parent Eli Lesser-Goldsmith approached the Champlain Valley School Board with an idea to privately fund a replacement of the school’s natural grass soccer-lacrosse field with synthetic turf, new bleachers and lights. Lesser-Goldsmith, CEO of Healthy Living market, is leading a fundraising group that intends to secure donations to cover the estimated $5.5 million installation cost.
Residents of the school district voted down a bond proposal to build a turf field at the high school about a decade ago. An Oct. 30 news release distributed by Lesser-Goldsmith says his plan revives “a long-held vision without burdening taxpayers.” 
But it’s not the cost that Hinesburg environmentalists are wary of. It’s the material that the turf is made from and its potential impact on natural resources, particularly the watershed. 
To PFAS, or too PFAS
During an Oct. 14 meeting of the Hinesburg Conservation Commission, members cast doubt on artificial turf manufacturers’ claims about the presence of what are known as “forever chemicals” — perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) — in their product. They expressed concern about the synthetic grass and underlying rubber pellets degrading over time and affecting groundwater, from which town residents and schools, including Champlain Valley Union, get drinking water.
A week after the meeting, commission members Meg Handler and Bill Scott sent a letter to the school board asking it to abandon the project. 
“It is widely known and well documented that artificial turf contains PFAS, as well as microplastics and numerous other chemicals that are hazardous to human health and the environment,” they wrote. “The installation of artificial turf in Hinesburg is … a very serious health and environmental issue that should worry members of the CVU community and all town residents.”
Lesser-Goldsmith said his group plans to use the same product — from the FieldTurf company based in Montreal — that has been installed in multiple municipalities throughout Vermont in recent years, including Burlington, Rutland, Middlebury and South Burlington.
“We are not reinventing the wheel,” he said. “The same product is going in at CVU that has been put in across the state. It meets the letter of the law for the State of Vermont.”
FieldTurf released a report in November 2022 addressing the question of PFAS in its turf. The detection of very low levels of a limited number of PFAS in the synthetic turf components does not represent a human health risk to those using the synthetic turf ballfields,” the report summary reads.
“We believe wholeheartedly in the safety of our products,” FieldTurf Executive Vice President Darren Gill added.
The FieldTurf report doesn’t address potential environmental and broader human health impacts, which is the main concern of Hinesburg environmentalists. 
“Plastic fields are a particularly harmful plan in a town like Hinesburg that relies on well water,” said Jennifer Decker, a self-described “clean water activist” who sits on the Hinesburg Planning Commission. “The toll of microplastics, PFAS, and carcinogens in the (turf) may not be seen for years, but will be very costly to the town schools, and will increase healthcare expenses over time.”
In the three years since FieldTurf’s PFAS tests, the State of Vermont passed Act 131, a law banning the manufacture or sale of artificial turf known to contain PFAS. The law goes into effect this January. Decker believes any future installation of FieldTurf at CVU would violate the law. 
Lesser-Goldsmith said he’s not yet sure if the project will require a permit from the Town of Hinesburg. He said a state stormwater permit will be required. Decker said that, while the change of field surface would not necessitate a town permit application, the addition of lighting above the field may require approval from the town’s Development Review Board. 
“We’re just starting our (engineering) drawings and the permitting process now,” Lesser-Goldsmith said.
Weighing the benefits
The impetus for going from grass to turf is to increase practice and game opportunities for CVU athletes. Outdoor sports teams are affected by cancellations caused by saturated fields during rainy stretches of weather. 
“When it rains, we can’t use our field, so getting turf would provide consistency and be a great way to improve the experience for players and the community that supports us,” CVU sophomore soccer player Elliana Antonucchi said in the Oct. 30 news release. “Plus, we want to have night games with all our fans cheering and having fun.”
School district leaders envision uses beyond athletics, noting that the field would be the only outdoor space large enough to host the entire student body. 
“Having one space where everyone can connect will be immensely impactful in terms of engagement and opportunity,” CVSD Superintendent Adam Bunting said in the release. “I see this as more than just a field as it will benefit so many more people than our student-athletes. It’ll be a point of pride and connection for our whole community.”

((Photo by Sam Bailey/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — After days of uncertainty about whether the federal government would release funding for food assistance, the Department for Children and Families announced Friday that it issued November benefits.
Kansans should have full access to their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits by the end of the day Friday, the state agency said on its website.
“All current Kansas beneficiaries will receive benefits on Nov. 7 instead of the typical monthly issuances that are staggered over a 10-day period according to last name,” the site said.
In a news release, Kansas Appleseed, which advocates to fight food insecurity, said “SNAP is one of the most effective tools we have to prevent hunger and strengthen local economies.”
“Every $1 spent through SNAP generates $1.50 into Kansas grocery stores, farmers markets, and small businesses, helping communities thrive while ensuring that families have access to healthy, affordable food,” the statement said.
The total November benefit distribution is more than $31.6 million to approximately 86,000 Kansas households, the DCF website said.

“This is great news for the thousands of Kansans who rely on this assistance to help put nutritious food on their tables,” said DCF Secretary Laura Howard in a news release. “I’m incredibly proud of how quickly the DCF team has been able to process multiple changes to the November benefits amount, work with our benefits processing partners to make adjustments and ultimately get this critical assistance out to Kansans as quickly as possible.”
On Oct. 28, Gov. Laura Kelly joined a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture for unlawfully suspending the SNAP program. The issuance of full November benefits comes after a federal judge on Thursday ordered USDA to full fund SNAP for November.

That’s exactly what’s already playing out as a key member of the House prepares to advance a plan to ease 2030 climate targets and cut the budget for the state’s energy efficiency program.  
Rep. Mark Cusack, co-chair of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy, told CommonWealth Beacon that he is planning to use Gov. Maura Healey’s energy affordability bill filed earlier this year as a vehicle to achieve those policy points and others. He is aiming for his redraft of Healey’s legislation to receive a floor vote before lawmakers break for the year on November 19.  
Cue the outrage. 
“We will fill the Statehouse,” said Larry Chretien, executive director at Green Energy Consumers Alliance. “This is going to be one of the bigger deals for the environmental community in a long time. We’re going to give it everything.” 
The effort is bound to divide the Democratic supermajority on Beacon Hill and test officials’ willingness to defend the state’s climate policies just as winter hits and Healey mounts a reelection bid.  
Cusack is arguing that because of a seismic crackdown on clean energy from the Trump administration, the state is likely to miss its goal to halve its emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. Keeping those short-term commitments on the books, then, is political and legal malpractice, he said, opening the state up to legal challenges. 
Plus, fury over sky-high energy bills last winter proved to Beacon Hill that officials need to do everything in their power to lower gas and electric costs, Cusack said. Those factors triggered Healey’s energy package, which aims to save ratepayers $10 billion over a decade, and pushed the state into “all-of-the-above” energy mode as the White House works to choke off new offshore wind and solar power.  
“We’re looking at the real possibility here, in the objective analysis, that we are not going to make our greenhouse reduction mandates,” Cusack said. “I have not found anyone who says that we are going to make our mandates.”  
But Chretien, who successfully sued the state a decade ago along with other groups for Massachusetts’s failure to do more to combat climate change, said Cusack’s concern over litigation is a “boogeyman.” 
“At this point, we want Massachusetts to give its best effort,” he said. “We’ve got five years to go to move the needle on emissions. It’s way too early to think about that. I’m just looking for effort. We understand what the Trump administration is doing to climate policy and that makes it harder. So talk to me seven years from now.” 
Part of the pushback, too, is rooted in pure shock. 
“I never would have thought that we would ever, ever say that we were going to, based subsequently on something that is happening federally, turn and say, ‘Oh, well, maybe we need to delay or rethink.’ People are looking to us as to what to do because we have the trifecta,” said Cabell Eames, an environmental policy consultant with Castling Strategies. “If our state decides that it’s going to delay or rethink its climate targets, that is going to send shockwaves and a ripple effect across the United States that we just do not need at this time. There’s a whole economy that’s attached to this. This just isn’t the Massachusetts that I know.” 
Cusack is also proposing to cut Mass Save’s budget by $500 million as a way to save customers money, since the program is funded by ratepayers and appears as a line item on bills.  
He couched his actions by vowing not to touch the state’s larger commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 85 percent by 2050 and not wanting to hamstring Mass Save’s substantive work, instead focusing on reigning in its advertising and administrative budget. 
But advocates warned that reducing the program’s budget will only exacerbate the state’s affordability crisis in the long run, not alleviate it. Mass Save is a collaboration among the state’s utilities to electrify and weatherize homes and install technologies like heat pumps that can significantly reduce energy bills.  
The program provided $2.8 billion in total benefits in 2024 and installed nearly 90,000 heat pumps over the past three years. 
“Massachusetts is starting to head somewhere where we should not head, which is trying to say that energy affordability and climate goals are competing goals and that we need to have either/or,” said Mary Wambui, co-chair of the Energy Efficiency Advisory Council’s energy equity working group, and a fellow at MassINC. (MassINC publishes CommonWealth Beacon.)  
Even with Mass Save’s issues – explored in a state auditor report that found that denser communities contribute more into the program but reap fewer benefits – such a cut is “penny wise and pound foolish” that would harm some of the most energy-burdened households in the state, said John Walkey, director of climate justice and waterfront initiatives at environmental justice organization GreenRoots.  
Cusack said he has House Speaker Ron Mariano’s support for his plan, though Ana Vivas, a spokesperson for Mariano, said he hasn’t yet taken an official position.  
“The speaker looks forward to reviewing the bill and discussing with his colleagues in the House,” Vivas said in a statement. 
Cusack appeared to recognize that his counterpart in the Senate, Michael Barrett of Lexington, isn’t likely to go along with the House redraft. Barrett declined to comment on the House effort, as did Senate President Karen Spilka.  
And Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Rebecca Tepper told CommonWealth Beacon last month that pushing back the state’s climate goals is “not our focus right now.”   
But in a sign of how far the pendulum has swung since the state adopted near-term climate targets just four years ago under Republican Gov. Charlie Baker, the Healey administration didn’t offer a robust defense of the clean energy commitments when asked on Friday. Karissa Hand, a spokesperson for Healey, simply said that “the governor will review the final version that reaches her desk.” 
“This is a big moment of truth” for Healey, Chretien said. 
The looming battle over the climate commitments, which could derail Healey’s energy agenda and dominate the final weeks on Beacon Hill before the new year, also shows that even deep-blue Massachusetts will have to contend with a shifting national mood around energy policy.  
Kyle Murray, Massachusetts program director at the nonprofit group Acadia Center, said in a statement that while the state must adapt to new roadblocks posed by the federal government, policymakers should “redouble efforts” to meet the climate targets. 
“Simply put, weakening targets is essentially granting the state permission to fail, and failure is not acceptable – certainly not five years before a deadline,” he said. 
While Chretien argues there’s growing public support for clean energy in general, the repercussions of Trump’s victory last year are giving officials pause. 
He said there is a real economic benefit to keeping the state’s climate targets in place given its valuable scientific and climate tech sectors that can flourish based on an economywide transition off fossil fuels that serves as the backbone of the green commitments.  
But there’s some symbolism in there, too. 
“If Massachusetts pulls back – let’s be honest, we don’t want to inflate our position in the world – but we are one of the most affluent, progressive places in the world,” Chretien said. “It sends an awful message to move the goal posts. There’s an opportunity for us to stay the course, do what we can on clean energy, and that will not happen if we backslide.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/climate-protests-2-1-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-07 17:01:24.081763

(Screenshot from livestream)The two million Pennsylvanians who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) could have their benefits restored by midnight, Gov. Josh Shapiro said Friday in a Philadelphia press conference. 
“When SNAP was taken away from our fellow Pennsylvanians, we saw an immediate impact. Folks came knocking on the doors here at Share,” said Shapiro, speaking at hunger relief organization Share Food Program. “One out of every eight of our neighbors relies on this funding, and it was taken away.”
Uncertainty over SNAP benefits hits home in Pa.’s coal region

Benefits are awarded on a rolling basis, meaning that only a fraction of residents were due to receive their SNAP dollars sometime this week. Shapiro praised the Department of Health Services for quickly processing roughly $100 million in funds awarded “within the last few hours,” saying a full accounting could be released Saturday. 
Two million Pennsylvanians, equal to more than 15% of the state’s population, receive a combined $366 million in monthly SNAP benefits. 
It was unclear late Friday afternoon when additional funding would become available for payments typically made later in the month.
“So if you’re one of those people that had a zero on your SNAP card because you were supposed to get your benefits on the first of the month, go check it out,” Shapiro said. “Those dollars are flowing. We are hoping that by this evening, maybe midnight or so, that all those individuals who were owed money over the first week or so of this month — who haven’t gotten it from the federal administration — are going to get their money.” 
 Court battle background

As the longest-ever federal government shutdown stretches into its sixth week, the billions sent out in food assistance have appeared to be at risk. Shapiro joined a lawsuit suing the Trump administration, attempting to pressure the U.S. Department of Agriculture to release the funds after the agency said it couldn’t tap contingency funds. Additionally, Shapiro earmarked $5 million in state funds for food banks and encouraged people to donate to a private sector fundraising campaign, saying $2 million had been contributed so far.
Friday’s announcement comes one day after a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to pay the full $9 billion in nutritional assistance benefits for the month of November by the end of the week in a separate case. 
Initially, the court ordered the Trump administration to make partial November payments, which would have required recalculating benefits through a formula and could have delayed delivery, by Wednesday. After failing to meet that deadline, the judge ordered full payments.
Shapiro pinned the blame on President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, saying “we’ve got an administration in Washington, (D.C.) that doesn’t give a damn about their neighbors in need.” 

He noted that the administration had filed an appeal in an attempt to reverse the judge’s order. 
“We stood together as Pennsylvanians, donating money, donating time (and) donating canned good to be able to be in a position to love thy neighbor, as is commanded in our Bible,” said Shapiro. “And my appeal to the Trump administration is just do the right thing. Give up. You’re going to lose again in court. And the only thing you’re fighting for — think about this — the only thing you’re fighting for is to make Americans hungry.”
Shapiro, who’s rumored to be exploring a presidential campaign in 2028, continued to criticize both Trump and Vance — calling the latter a “total phony.” At one point, Shapiro got emotional, invoking scripture as his impetus for aiding Pennsylvania’s hungry.
“I’m sorry that the federal government has held you captive; I’m sorry the federal government has quite literally taken food out of your children’s mouths,” said Shapiro, when asked what he’d say to SNAP recipients. “We’re going to do everything we can here in Pennsylvania to love thy neighbor.”

A trio of court clerks voluntarily dismissed their lawsuit Thursday, three days after Richmond Circuit Court Judge Tracy Thorne-Begland said they lacked standing to block the redistricting process as it currently stands. 
And in a separate case in Tazewell County, Republican lawmakers dropped a portion of their lawsuit aimed at thwarting Democrats’ redistricting push after Judge Jack Hurley Jr. similarly declined to interfere in legislative proceedings.
Republicans have remained tight-lipped about their next steps in court. But University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias said lawyers could regroup after the rush of pre-election legal challenges, which he said may have also been directed at persuading voters.
“They may try other judges, or they may try other theories, or there may be a way to to live a fight another day,” Tobias said.
Top Democrats in the General Assembly surprised their GOP colleagues last month by calling an 11th-hour, pre-election special session with the goal of advancing a proposed amendment to the Virginia Constitution. The amendment would allow the legislature to redraw the state’s Congressional seats in the middle of the decade in response to similar actions by other states.
Democrats said they made the move reluctantly, to counter gerrymandering in Texas and other GOP-led states done at the behest of President Donald Trump.
While the state Senate approved the proposal on Oct. 31, the process is far from over. Lawmakers will need to approve it again when they meet in January before sending the amendment for final consideration by voters, likely in the spring of 2026.
The two lawsuits sought to block the process before it could make it that far. In both complaints, attorneys argued the special session itself had not been properly called. 
The trio of circuit court clerks who filed the Richmond case — Heidi Barshinger of Henrico County, Christalyn Jett of Spotsylvania County and Gordon Erby of Lunenburg County — also argued Democrats had failed to follow the procedure laid out for constitutional amendments by holding their first vote on the proposal in the midst of early voting in the House of Delegates election. 
The clerks claimed lawmakers had put them in a bind by failing to provide copies of the proposed amendment 90 days before an election, as required by a section of state code Democrats argued is antiquated. 
On Oct. 29, midway through the special session, Hurley declined to issue the emergency injunction sought by Republican lawmakers.
The second lawsuit, filed minutes after the state Senate gavelled out on Oct. 31, got an emergency hearing on Nov. 3. 
But in a ruling from the bench and later written opinion, Thorne-Begland denied the clerks’ emergency restraining order and preliminary injunction, writing that any harm they might face was “entirely speculative,” given the General Assembly clerks had yet to pass them copies of the proposed amendment to post at courthouses. 
Thorne-Begland also said it was not the judiciary’s place to interfere in constitutional amendments under consideration by the General Assembly. At the Nov. 3 hearing, he seemed pained that the redistricting wars had arrived in Virginia.
“This is just another symptom of how strained our democracy is becoming,” he said.
A trio of Republicans who are plaintiffs in the Tazewell case — Sen. Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin, and Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott — did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment. 
Attorney Brad Marrs, who represented the clerks, and Del. Tom Garrett, R-Buckingham, House Republicans’ point-person for the legal battles, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. 
John Lichtenstein, an attorney representing the clerks of the House and Senate in both Tazewell and Richmond cases, praised Thorne-Begland’s decision.
“We are pleased the Courts denied the attempt to interrupt that constitutional legislative process, which now has the chance to move through its proper stages,” Lichtenstein said in an email.

Kelly Ayotte’s decision to veto similar legislation earlier this year.
The House Education Policy and Administration Committee voted, 10-8, Wednesday to recommend an amended version of Senate Bill 33, which would require school boards to adopt policies allowing parent challenges to books and other materials. 
But unlike the vetoed bill, the new proposed bill does not allow parents to appeal decisions over book removals to the State Board of Education, a significant concession. 
And the newly amended bill has removed explicit mention of penalties against school districts that don’t comply; the previous bill had allowed the state attorney general, Department of Education, or any aggrieved parent to file a lawsuit against a district that violated the required policies. The new bill also does not include potential disciplinary actions against teachers deemed to violate the proposed obscenity law.
Republicans said the legislation will allow for quicker removal of content they say is obscene and pornographic. 
Democrats say the move will override school boards’ ability to set their own curricula, and could unfairly allow a small group of parents to remove books for all students. 
Under the bill, school boards would be required to install a complaint resolution process that would allow parents to raise objections to material deemed obscene. After receiving a complaint, the school principal would be required to conduct an investigation and make a determination whether the content should be removed within 15 days. 
At that point, the parent could appeal any decision to the local school board, which would make the final decision. That is a departure from House Bill 324, which allowed the State Board of Education, whose members are appointed by the Governor and Executive Council, to override school boards’ determinations over content removal.
The bill defines obscene materials as those depicting nudity, sexual content, sadomasochistic abuse, or sexual excitement, in a manner “patently offensive” to prevailing attitudes over what is appropriate to minors. To be eligible for removal, the material would also need to predominantly appeal “to the prurient, shameful, or morbid interest of minors,” lack “serious literary, scientific, medical, artistic, or political value to minors,” and be “inappropriate to the age of the minors to whom it is being made available or presented.”
Ayotte vetoed HB 324 in June, arguing that it was unnecessary because state law already allows parents to opt their own children out of instructional material they disagree with as long as they provide an agreed-upon alternative. 
The House committee’s change would address some critics’ concerns about the loss of local control in HB 324, including the New Hampshire School Boards Association. 
And by removing HB 324’s explicit language allowing civil action against schools, the new version of the bill appears to resolve an objection listed by Ayotte in her veto message of HB 324.  
But the amended version of SB 33 may not address all of the governor’s concerns. In her veto message, Ayotte wrote that because parents have an opt-out option specific to their child, “I do not believe the State of New Hampshire needs to, nor should it, engage in the role of addressing questions of literary value and appropriateness” of school materials, she wrote.
Speaking in the committee Wednesday, Democrats urged their Republican colleagues to follow the governor’s position, and said the state should not make it easier for parents to remove books from all students. 
“I completely oppose banning books in any form, and so I cannot possibly support something that suppresses free speech,” said Rep. Loren Selig, of Durham.
Republicans countered that they have presented passages from books and materials that they said should not be allowed in schools. 
“Nobody wants to look at some of the samples that we have tried to provide,” said Rep. Kristin Noble, of Bedford. “Looking at that, it is unbelievable to me that anyone could think that that material was good for minors.” 
The veto of HB 324 will be taken up by the House in Dec. 17, and will need a two-thirds majority vote in both the House and Senate to be overridden. 
SB 33, meanwhile, will come before the House on Jan. 7.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/booksbanningnh-1024x717.jpg,,,2025-11-07 17:01:24.081763

(Tyler Kaufman for Ørsted)President Donald Trump’s anti-wind energy agenda is harming Louisiana businesses that form the backbone of America’s offshore oil and gas industry, which stands to lose billions if the president fulfills his campaign promise to end construction of offshore wind turbines.
In recent years, offshore leases have opened in state and federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico for offshore wind farms to be built. Wind technology has advanced, allowing for taller turbines to capture more of the Gulf region’s wind power higher up in the air. A trained workforce, built off the back of oil and gas, provided a wide base of support for the industry to expand. 
On his first day back in the White House, Trump signed an executive order halting construction on all offshore wind projects. The president has long expressed a dislike of wind turbines, sometimes making dubious claims that they “destroy everything,” are the “most expensive energy there is” and that they produce noise that causes cancer.
These actions and statements have slowed supply chain investments and threatened the jobs of blue-collar workers in Louisiana and nationwide, all while electricity demand is growing, in large part because of increasing numbers of large, power-hungry data centers.

There are no offshore wind projects under construction off Louisiana’s coast, but the state is deeply entwined with developments in other parts of the country. Most of the businesses working on offshore wind farms on the East Coast come from the oil and gas sector in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Even without a single industrial-scale wind turbine generating electricity in Louisiana, offshore wind has so far spurred over $500 million worth of supply chain investments in the state, according to Oceantic, an offshore energy trade association with about 400 members worldwide. Almost all of Oceantic’s members work in both the wind and fossil fuel sectors, spokeswoman Stephanie Fracoeur said.
It’s the same across the Gulf South. The offshore wind sector has spurred roughly $14 billion in investments into U.S. supply chain and manufacturing companies, with nearly two-thirds coming from businesses in Republican congressional districts, according to Oceantic. 
But those investments have grown risky as many offshore wind projects that were planned have been paused or scrapped altogether. 
“Oil and gas hasn’t been exceptionally busy over the last decade, so offshore wind was helping keep many of these companies in business,” Francoeur said. “Unfortunately, these policy changes have put a pause on things … The federal actions have been crippling for hundreds of American businesses that were planning on this work.”
State Rep. Joe Orgeron, R-Golden Meadow, represents an area of the state that has invested and made a lot of money in the wind industry. Lafourche Parish is home to shipbuilders, metal fabricators, ocean crane operators and many other companies in the offshore energy sector. Having once built and serviced the oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, these businesses on the bayou were called on to do the same thing for offshore wind farms along the East Coast, Orgeron said.
Orgeron, a former Nicholls State University professor with a doctorate in experimental physics, once managed his family’s offshore vessel business and helped it expand into the wind sector. Like other companies, they didn’t abandon oil and gas; they expanded into wind energy because it offered a stable revenue stream to offset volatile fossil fuel commodity prices, he said. While an abundant oil supply and low fuel costs are good for consumers, Louisiana’s energy service sector hits the doldrums when profit margins lead exploration companies to press pause on their Gulf drilling plans.
“For 60 years, we went through economic booms and busts, and it’s just so nice to know there’s an alternative market where your identical expertise is required and appreciated,” Orgeron said. “I really don’t wanna see one of our down-the-bayou operators lose an alternative revenue stream that’s not tied to the price of oil.”
A handful of offshore wind projects are still in progress on the East Coast, where dozens of Louisiana oil-and-gas service companies are now working. 
Jake Cheramie is the general manager of Encore Group, a company in Houma that provides cooks, cleaners, crane operators and other personnel to offshore work sites. Just a few years ago, all of Encore’s clientele were in the oil and gas sector, but Cheramie said Encore gravitated to East Coast wind energy development in 2021. It now encompasses roughly 20% of their business, he said. 
“Most of the major vessels in lower Lafourche are up in the Northeast working now, and that’s cool to see,” Cheramie said. “It’s been good to us. I certainly don’t wanna see offshore wind go away.” 
Oceantic categorizes Encore as one of many auxiliary services businesses that work for one of Louisiana’s 42 offshore energy companies that currently hold active wind contracts.
Much of the work has gone to shipyards that build vessels that specialize in offshore construction. For instance, Edison Chouest Offshore in Cut Off spearheaded construction of the $97 million Eco Edison vessel for Revolution Wind, a wind farm project off the Rhode Island coast, and other East Coast projects. That single contract, one among several others like it, employed nearly 600 Edison Chouest workers across multiple states. 
About a year ago, Encore opened an office in Rhode Island to support its personnel working on the Revolution Wind project. That wind farm made headlines Aug. 22 when the Trump administration rescinded its federal permit and issued a stop-work order, citing vague national security concerns. Scheduled to come online in early 2026, the $5 billion project was about 80% complete at that time.
Revolution Wind sued the Trump administration, and a federal judge sided with the company a month later, ruling the government’s actions “arbitrary and capricious” and unsupported by any evidence of national security concerns. 
The judge’s temporary injunction allowed the company to resume work for the time being, but the order is temporary and could change if the Trump administration succeeds on appeal. The setback  has already cost Revolution Wind $77 million, according to company officials who also blamed Trump’s anti-wind policies and tariffs for increasing the cost of steel and other construction materials.
It’s a new reality that Encore and other businesses are having to grapple with. The part of their business model that was the most stable just a year ago has suddenly become shaky. 
“Louisiana is going to be one of the hardest-hit areas,” Francoeur said. “Once the current projects are completed, some of those companies will have idle shipyards or idle vessels.”

Cheramie said Encore is working on other offshore wind projects in New Jersey and Virginia but worries about losing them if the Trump administration continues to target the industry. If things stay on track, Encore should have steady work for another two to three years, he said, admitting new contracts for future jobs are now hard to come by. 
“There’s been quite a few projects that aren’t being permitted or may be canceled,” Cheramie said. 
The pause is largely due to Trump’s executive orders, pausing all wind leases and permitting. He has followed those up with actions that have made business particularly difficult for wind and solar companies, including directing his Commerce Department to investigate the wind sector for any national security implications and directing his Interior Department to block the nation’s largest solar project, which was planned for federal land in Nevada.  
“Things are likely not to move forward in the next couple of years because of the actions by the Trump administration to essentially put a pause on federal permitting for offshore projects,” said Madelyn Smith with the renewable energy industry group Southeastern Wind Coalition. 
One example is RWE Wind, a German company that held the first federal wind lease off the coast of Louisiana in addition to leases on the East and West coasts. It scrapped all three projects this year and laid off 73 of its U.S. employees after Trump started his assault on the wind sector, according to a Reuters report. The company said it is focusing on onshore wind and solar for the time being while still holding onto its offshore leases.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Many Louisiana-based offshore energy businesses with wind interests refused to speak on the record for this report. The same was true for some trade groups, including the National Ocean Industries Association, which represents members in the offshore wind and fossil fuels sectors. 
Orgeron said he has noticed the same pattern among some of his constituents who prefer to not say or do anything that draws attention from the White House.
“I have friends who know they’re in the crosshairs of the Trump administration,” he said. “They’re kinda in a holding pattern.”
There is one active lease in Louisiana state waters for a wind farm, according to the state Department of Energy and Conservation. The Cajun Wind project is proposed by the North American arm of Vestas, a Denmark-based renewable energy company. It’s planned off the coast of Cameron Parish and would generate enough electricity to power 144,000 Louisiana homes at peak output, according to the project’s webpage. It’s unclear when or if Vestas plans to start construction. The company didn’t respond to a request for comment. 
Diamond Offshore Wind, backed by the Mitsubishi Corp., initially planned to build a wind farm in Louisiana waters. It abandoned its lease at the beginning of 2025 but terminated its operating agreement in March. 
Offshore wind farms are “enormous infrastructure projects,” Smith said. Such projects can take eight to 13 years and millions of dollars to build. Any permitting delay, political uncertainty or disruption in supply can be significant enough to chase off investors, she added. 
“It has definitely given some developers pause that there have been so many changes,” she said “They are going to be looking for more stability and clarity in the federal regulatory landscape in order to move forward.”
Simon Mahan, executive director of the Southern Renewable Energy Association, said he doesn’t expect much expansion in offshore wind over the next few years unless the Trump administration’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which has paused offshore wind leases, reverses its current stance. 
That could be detrimental for other industries that need new sources of energy to operate, such as artificial intelligence. The AI sector has been building data centers across the country that require massive amounts of power to operate, such as Meta’s proposed facility in North Louisiana. Data centers will need an estimated 22% more electricity by the end of this year and nearly three times as much in 2030, according to a report by S&P Global.  
“We are facing a pretty severe energy crunch, not just in Louisiana, but nationally,” Mahan said. “Any sort of delay that we’re seeing, that is only going to hamper our energy dominance agenda.”
For the time being, many of those in Louisiana’s offshore energy sector are counting the days until the next presidential election, Orgeron said. 
“Everybody’s just waiting it out until Trump leaves office,” he said. “I just hope that the president I voted for doesn’t, because of his little idiosyncrasies, destroy it completely.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-07 21:25:06+00:00,CT Mirror,Lamont pledges to restart SNAP benefits in days – even if CT pays,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/07/ct-snap-benefits/,"SNAP benefits will be available in next few days with CT funds, possibly by Saturday, but the USDA also plans to restart payments soon.","Thousands of Connecticut households will see their SNAP benefits restored within the next few days, possibly as early as Saturday, Gov. Ned Lamont’s office announced Friday.
The governor, who has been reluctant to spend state funds on the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also pledged to keep the program running for the next three weeks, even if federal funding stalls again during that period.
The governor addressed reporters following an 11:30 a.m. press conference in East Hartford on housing issues and said that he’s directed the state Department of Social Services, which administers the nutrition assistance program, “to fully fund SNAP through the end of November.”
“Stop dragging it out,” a frustrated Lamont said Friday, referring to President Donald Trump’s administration and its freeze of SNAP benefits since the partial federal government shutdown entered its second month on Nov. 1. 
“They’ve been on again, off again, on again, off again, on, snapping it in partial payment, a full payment. I just authorized our department. We’re going to fully fund SNAP through the end of November. We’ll see what happens from there.”
It was unclear later Friday afternoon, though, how much state funding, if any, would be needed to cover the $72 million in SNAP benefits normally distributed here each month.
About 90 minutes after Lamont committed Connecticut funds, if needed, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service notified states it would begin the process of again funding benefits with federal dollars.
“Later today, FNS will complete the processes necessary to make funds available to support your subsequent transmission of full” benefits, it wrote in a memorandum.
But that memo is just part of a confusing stream of often contradictory signals from the Trump administration over the past week when it comes to funding nutrition assistance.
FNS told a federal district judge on Monday it would comply with a court order and utilize SNAP contingency funds. These would be sufficient to fund partial benefits for one month.
Then the Trump administration indicated it would pay full benefits, which would exhaust the contingency sooner, at some point in the future — while simultaneously challenging the district court ruling in a federal appeals court.
A decision on that appeal was expected late Friday afternoon. But even if the Trump administration loses there, it could appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Lamont spokesman Rob Blanchard said the governor is committed to restarting full SNAP benefits in Connecticut and keeping them in place at least through the end of November, regardless of whether the Trump administration follows through the federal funding.
“Ensuring that those who count on SNAP will receive their full benefits was a priority for the governor, and he was growing impatient by the lack of action by the federal government,” Blanchard said.
Lamont has been criticized over the past two weeks both by his fellow Democrats in the General Assembly’s majority and by Republicans who said he did too little to safeguard the roughly 360,000 Connecticut residents who normally receive SNAP benefits.
The governor did contribute $3 million from state funds to Connecticut Foodshare, a nonprofit that distributes surplus groceries from the food industry to pantries, meal programs and other related services across the state. But Foodshare’s president and CEO, Jason Jakubowski, said on Connecticut Public Radio this week that the state’s network of food pantries is equipped to cover roughly one-eighth of the need created by the suspension of SNAP benefits.
The average Connecticut household receives an average of $324 per month from SNAP, according to social services officials.
The General Assembly will meet in special session next week to reserve $500 million from last fiscal year’s $2.5 billion state budget surplus to bolster SNAP and other federal human service programs facing funding restrictions related to the ongoing government shutdown.
And some state legislators were frustrated to hear that measure would not mandate the use of state funds to bolster these programs — rather, it only would reserve them and leave the decision whether to spend them up to Lamont.
The governor, a fiscal moderate, has traditionally objected to using state funds to supplement programs normally funded by the federal government.
But Lamont won praise Friday for committing state funds to combat hunger, especially given the uncertainty of federal funding.
“I think its welcome [news] for the residents of the state, for my neighbors, who have been without food for a week in some cases,” said state Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, co-chairman of the Human Services Committee and one of the lawmakers who argued Lamont’s original response to the crisis was too modest.
“It’s a very good sign and unfortunately very necessary because of the volatility of the responses from the Trump administration,” said Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven.
“Relief for vulnerable Connecticut families is what matters most,” said Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding. “We must prioritize people, not politics.”
CT For All, a progressive coalition of more than 60 faith, labor and other civic groups, often has charged Lamont with refusing to tap Connecticut’s great wealth to better fund human services, education, health care and other core programs.
Besides the $500 million left from last fiscal year’s surplus, Connecticut has $4.3 billion in its rainy day fund, one of the larger emergency reserves of any state. Analysts also are projecting another big surplus, almost $1.8 billion, this fiscal year.
CT For All’s director, Norma Martinez HoSang, said Friday that “Gov. Lamont is finally listening to the thousands of phone calls, emails, and visits to his office. And while we applaud the decision to fund SNAP for 30 days, the 7 extra days it took the Governor to come to this decision represented a week of unnecessary anxiety to CT families. “",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/LAMONT-WIND-0825-CANNON-113-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-07 17:01:24.081763

UCHCFC Waterbury Hospital Corp., a corporation sponsored by UConn Health, will serve as the “stalking horse bidder” for the hospital in the court-supervised sale auction, according to court documents filed Friday morning. The “stalking horse” serves as the first bidder in a bankruptcy auction whose offer serves as the minimum bid. 
“We are pleased to have reached this important milestone in our sale process through a stalking horse agreement with UCHCFC Waterbury Health Corp., a Connecticut nonprofit sponsored by UConn Health. We look forward to completing the process efficiently and to the future partnership ahead,” Deborah Weymouth, CEO of Waterbury Health, stated in emailed comments.
The $13 million cash offer includes $4 million for the operating assets and $9 million for the real estate. The state will also assume a limited set of the hospital’s liabilities, bringing the deal’s total value up to $35 million, according to the terms laid out in court documents.
Other bidders can submit offers through November 14. A sale hearing, where the bankruptcy court judge will approve the sale, is scheduled for November 17. 
During a press conference on Friday, Gov. Ned Lamont highlighted the effort it took to find a buyer for the struggling hospital.
“We had to work really hard after what Prospect did to that hospital. We’ve got a strong bidder,” Lamont said. “I want people to know Waterbury Hospital is going to thrive under new leadership.”
In a series of unannounced visits over the last two years, state health inspectors found deteriorating conditions at Waterbury Hospital, including a nurse staffing crisis, rusting equipment in operating rooms and alleged patient abuse.
The purchase of Waterbury Hospital by the state is part of a broader plan to expand the footprint of UConn Health and make it more competitive with other academic medical institutions around the country. The state is also in talks to acquire two more private, independent hospitals that are also struggling: Bristol Hospital and Day Kimball Hospital in Putnam.
Prospect originally paid $31.8 million to acquire Waterbury Hospital in 2016. While the state is purchasing Waterbury for less than half of what it was worth almost a decade ago, the facility will require deep investments to address significant quality issues, State Comptroller Sean Scanlon told The Connecticut Mirror last month.
“There are significant capital expenditure needs to maintain what I would say is the level of public health care that our citizens deserve and expect. And, frankly, that’s not possible in the condition that this hospital is in right now,” Scanlon said.
During a special session of the state legislature, scheduled for next week, lawmakers will vote to approve a bonding package to fund capital improvements at Waterbury, Bristol and Day Kimball Hospitals.
If approved by the legislature, the state could borrow as much as $390 million to invest in the hospitals over a five-year period, according to a presentation during an Oct. 3 meeting of the University of Connecticut’s Board of Trustees and the UConn Health Board of Directors. The debt would be added to the “UConn 2000” bonding package, the state’s financing program for capital projects at its flagship university. 
UConn Health will also separately invest $31 million in the hospitals over five years, CEO Andrew Agwunobi said.
The funding will cover the purchase of Waterbury Hospital, but the acquisition of Bristol and Day Kimball Hospitals will be handled separately, according to the state comptroller.
Some level of forgiveness for the taxes Prospect owes the state will also be a part of the deal. However, those negotiations are happening separately and not explicitly included in the bid submitted on Friday.
“The tax negotiations are ongoing. We’ll have more to share in the coming days,” Comptroller Scanlon said on Friday. 
Court records show that Prospect owes the state $127 million in hospital provider taxes going back more than three years.
Once approved by the judge, any acquisition would have to go through the state’s approval process, overseen by the Office of Health Strategy, known as Certificate of Need. The state would have to approve the deal within 60 days of receiving a completed application, according to the guidelines of the emergency approval process reserved for hospitals that are involved in bankruptcy proceedings. 
Waterbury was the last of the Prospect’s three Connecticut hospitals that needed a buyer. 
Last month, the bankruptcy court judge approved the sale of the other two Prospect-owned facilities — Manchester Memorial and Rockville General — to Hartford HealthCare for $86.1 million. HHC submitted the sole bid. The transaction is currently under review by the state’s Office of Health Strategy.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023_0927_SR_WaterburyHospital_027-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-07 17:01:24.081763

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)The state of South Dakota opened its $20 million, 400-acre shooting range complex Friday.
Members of the state Game, Fish and Parks Commission and other dignitaries were on hand for a grand opening ceremony.
“On behalf of the commission, we are excited for what the Pete Lien and Sons Shooting Sports Complex will mean for South Dakota’s outdoor future,” Commission Chairwoman Stephanie Rissler told South Dakota Searchlight in advance of the event. 
The complex, located about 10 miles north of Rapid City, is one of the largest public shooting ranges in the nation. It includes rifle, pistol, shotgun and archery ranges, and will host recreational shooters, safety programs, marksmanship competitions and law enforcement training. 


 The location of the Pete Lien and Sons Shooting Sports Complex.
The complex is open seven days a week from 8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. May through August, and from 8:30 a.m. to sunset September through April. 
The facility’s 50-, 100- and 300-yard shooting bays and archery range are free to use on a first-come, first-served basis. Memberships are required for the long-range bay, shotgun area, sporting clays course and north range. An individual membership is $100, a family membership is $150 and a day pass is $20. 
Rissler said the facility gives new and experienced shooters a place to learn and practice in a safe environment. 
“This complex will serve outdoor enthusiasts today and for generations to come,” she said. “A big thank you to all the partners and sponsors who helped make this vision a reality and continue to showcase the incredible outdoor opportunities South Dakota has to offer.”
The project did not have a smooth path. Lawmakers refused to appropriate state money for it, and some were angered last year when they learned that then-Gov. Kristi Noem gave the project $13.5 million from the governor-controlled Future Fund.

South Dakota employers pay a fee to the Future Fund when they submit payroll taxes to the unemployment benefits program. State law says the Future Fund must be used “for purposes related to research and economic development for the state.” Unlike other funds administered by the Governor’s Office of Economic Development, Future Fund expenses don’t go through a board of citizen appointees for vetting or approval.
An additional $6.6 million of funding for the shooting range complex has been given or pledged by a total of 58 donors. The Department of Game, Fish and Parks said this week that $3.4 million of the donations are in hand, and $3.2 million are pledged. 
The donations include about $2 million from gun-industry companies or organizations, including Smith & Wesson, a Tennessee-based gun manufacturer, and Glock, an Austrian gun manufacturer.
Pete Lien and Sons Inc., a mining, concrete and construction aggregate company based in Rapid City, obtained naming rights for the facility with an $800,000 donation and an additional $1.2 million pledge, to be paid within three years.

Wilmington, Del. — Small businesses are the backbone of Delaware’s economy — employing over half of all working Delawareans, serving as community anchors, and driving innovation across industries. On November 6, that spirit was celebrated as more than 500 business and civic leaders gathered for the 27th Annual Marvin S. Gilman Superstars in Business Awards Luncheon, hosted by the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce’s Small Business Alliance.
The Small Business Alliance of Delaware State Chamber of Commerce Presents the 27th Annual Superstars in Business Awards
Michael Quaranta, President of the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce, shared why this event is so important to the Chamber and the State of Delaware as a whole:
“The Superstars in Business Awards remind us that small businesses are the backbone of not just the US economy, but of Delaware’s, too. Small business owners don’t always have the time or resources to make their voices heard. Being that voice is one of the pillars of what we do at the Delaware State Chamber. This event is really about celebrating that community by highlighting some of the best, and that’s why it’s so popular and so important to our mission and community.”
This year’s keynote speaker, Robert L. Siegfried Jr., CPA, CEO & Founder of The Siegfried Group, spoke to the importance of personal growth, character-based leadership, and making space for entrepreneurial thinking.
“I’ve got to keep challenging myself and keep asking myself the question of how I get better. Better questions lead to better thinking. Better thinking leads to better actions. It leads to success. This character thing, I realized, it’s not just going to elevate your company, it will elevate your life.”
Siegfried encouraged leaders to embrace reflection as part of their decision making:
“You’ve got to find the time to be thoughtful. So, it’s like, hey, what advice do you have for people? What I wanted to talk about today is find quiet time, spacious time, rhythmic time to be more thoughtful about the why in your life. And listen to your gut feel. Listen to your head and your heart about what you should be doing. And then answer these questions about it: What, why, how, when, how often, and with whom should I best be doing this?”
A Celebration of Small Business Excellence
This year’s honorees represent diverse industries — finance, real estate development, home services, and nonprofit community development — but share a common purpose: creating a stronger Delaware.
Below are the 2025 award recipients:

 **Grey Fox Wealth Advisors** — Winner, 1–24 employees category
 **Jack Lingo Asset Management (JLAM)** — Winner, 25–150 employees category
 **Boulden Brothers** — Award of Excellence recipient
 **Habitat for Humanity of New Castle County** — Nonprofit Award winner

Each organization demonstrated impressive leadership, growth strategy, and community commitment through its applications and interviews.
Grey Fox Wealth Advisors: A Mission Rooted in Trust
Founded with the goal of bringing personal, relationship-driven financial guidance to Delaware families and businesses, Grey Fox Wealth Advisors has experienced rapid growth in both clients served and community visibility. The team emphasizes education and transparency — qualities that led them to top honors in the small employer category.
Co-Founder and Partner Ted Lauzen said the recognition represents a milestone in a long-term mission:
“This award acts as an inspiration to the future. Our team is excited to earn the opportunity to serve more friends, more families and more communities in our great state.”
Their growing involvement in nonprofit partnerships and community events helped distinguish their nomination as a business dedicated to lifting others with them.
Jack Lingo Asset Management: Development with Staying Power
As a full-service real estate investment and development firm, JLAM focuses on projects that support economic growth while enriching the fabric of Delaware’s communities — from multifamily and mixed-use developments to commercial assets that bring new opportunity to the region.
Managing Principal and Co-Founder Doug Motley described the meaning behind the achievement:
“One thing about the business that we’re in is that what we’re creating is enduring. This is going to be a part of the community for the long term. So winning this award and being able to put our stamp on it is really satisfying.”
JLAM’s team was praised for leveraging industry expertise to create lasting impact across Sussex County and beyond.
Boulden Brothers: A Family Legacy of Service
Boulden Brothers, a beloved home services company providing plumbing, HVAC, and electrical solutions, is no stranger to the Superstars in Business spotlight — having previously won 18 years ago. Their ability to evolve with changing technology and customer expectations while maintaining a people-first culture made them a standout Award of Excellence recipient this year.
President Tim Boulden credited the company’s continued success to its team:
“There’s been a lot of changes in the world, in the business industry since we won 18 years ago. What I will tell you, what hasn’t changed is you can’t do this alone. It’s the reason why we continue to be successful and it’s because we have a very talented dedicated team that always puts our clients first. If you put your team first, and they put the clients first, you’re going to be successful.”
Habitat for Humanity of New Castle County: Building More Than Homes
Habitat for Humanity of New Castle County has built more than 300 homes in partnership with local families and transformed entire neighborhoods through community investment. In addition to construction initiatives, Habitat programs provide financial education, home repair assistance, and youth engagement — expanding their mission beyond housing access to long-term empowerment.
CEO Kevin L. Smith said the Chamber’s recognition reinforces the leadership role nonprofits play in the economic ecosystem:
“I think most people recognize us as a home builder. It’s a great honor to see that the chamber recognizes non-profits as businesses, as entrepreneur, as leaders in our communities.”
A Program That Continues to Inspire
The Superstars in Business Awards has become one of the Delaware business community’s most anticipated annual events — not just for the celebration itself, but for the inspiration it sparks.
This year’s winners exemplify what’s possible when organizations — large or small, for-profit or nonprofit — pursue innovation while investing in the people and places they serve.
As the program moves toward its 30th anniversary, the Small Business Alliance continues to champion the entrepreneurs who drive Delaware forward — with determination, creativity, and deep community roots.
And if the success stories recognized this year are any indication, the First State’s future remains bright — powered by those who are willing to lead, build, and believe in what comes next.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0975.jpg,,,2025-11-07 16:17:10.371060

MPD announced Friday that a fifth suspect was arrested in connection with the shooting. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)Montgomery Police arrested a fifth suspect Thursday in connection with an October mass shooting that killed two and injured 12.
The Montgomery Police Department said in a statement posted to Facebook Friday that Ivan Floyd, 22, was charged with certain persons forbidden to carry a firearm. He was taken to the Montgomery County Detention Facility, according to the statement.
Floyd was also charged with robbery in the first degree, theft of property in the first degree, and theft of property in the second degree, which happened on Sept. 29, according to the statement. Police said those crimes were not connected to the shooting. 
“MPD extends its gratitude to local and federal law enforcement partners for their continued support and collaboration, which have been instrumental in advancing the case,” the statement said.
The shooting, which took place during celebrations after a football game, killed Jeremiah Morris, 17, and Shalanda Williams, 43. 
Four others were arrested last month. Kemontae Hood, 21, an unnamed juvenile and Dantavious McGhee, 19, were charged with one count of capital murder, nine counts of first-degree assault and three counts of second-degree assault. Javorick Whiting, 19, was charged last week with one count of attempted murder. Whiting was later released on bond, which sparked criticism from city leaders.
The shooting sparked a war of words between state Republican leaders and city officials, who tend to be Democratic. Attorney General Steve Marshall accused Montgomery leaders of a “stubborn refusal to acknowledge they have a serious problem.” Montgomery Mayor Steven Reed invited Marshall to meet with him about solutions and condemned state lawmakers for passing permissive gun laws in the last several years.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4971-1024x768.png,,,2025-11-07 16:04:21.091063

Norton I State House News Service and Sam Drysdale | State House News Service,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/marijuana/social-pot-consumption-vote-could-come-by-christmas/,"Chair Shannon O'Brien offered the latest timeline at the end of a meeting on Friday, as commissioners also learned that a new member, Carrie Benedon, is joining the commission.","THE CANNABIS CONTROL COMMISSION could vote by Christmas on regulations governing social consumption sites.
CCC Chair Shannon O’Brien offered the latest timeline at the end of a meeting on Friday, as commissioners also learned that a new member, Carrie Benedon, is joining the commission.
Commissioners in late July outlined three social consumption license types: one for existing marijuana establishments like retail stores and cultivation facilities that want to offer their customers the ability to consume products purchased on-site, a “hospitality” license category that would allow for on-site consumption at new or existing non-cannabis businesses like yoga studios or theaters, and an “event organizer” license category that would allow for temporary on-site consumption at events like rallies and festivals. 
Social consumption sites were envisioned under the 2016 marijuana voter law but have yet to launch. 
Benedon works in Attorney General Andrea Campbell’s office as director of the Division of Open Government. She previously worked as an assistant attorney general in the Constitutional and Administrative Law Division. Prior to the creation of the CCC, she “successfully represented the Department of Public Health in several cases challenging its medical marijuana registration and licensing authority,” Campbell’s office said.
Under state law, the three statewide officials appoint two of the five CCC commissioners by majority vote, and Benedon was selected to fill a seat designated for someone with “legal, policy, or social justice issues related to a regulated industry.” Benedon will fill the seat left vacated by Nurys Camargo. 
A possible vote on the social consumption sites was on the agenda for Friday’s meeting, but Commissioner Bruce Stebbins told reporters after the meeting that Benedon’s start date delayed the timeline. Earlier this year in September, O’Brien’s return to the CCC pushed back the finalization of the long-awaited rules.
“We want to give her the opportunity to get caught up to speed on the [social consumption] regulations and be part of the conversation, so that will obviously shift our timeline,” Stebbins said of Benedon on Friday.
He also suggested additional meetings could be scheduled before the end of the year. The next commission meeting is scheduled for Nov. 18.
“[I] really hope that we can get this done by Christmas,” he said. He added that the commission is now focused on fine details: “What you see us doing is getting down into some real granular questions…as much clarity as we can offer on those helps our licensees at the end of the day.”
Asked what people should make of the delays, Stebbins said he “completely understands” why O’Brien pushed back the finalization in September and why they are now waiting for Benedon to get up to speed.
“We want their input. We want their voice. We want to hear their concerns, because we are rolling this out on behalf of the entire commission, and we want to make sure everybody feels comfortable with the regulatory framework,” he said.
The CCC has been operating with three members of its five-member body for months, as a seat has been empty and member Ava Callender Concepcion has been on leave. That has made it more difficult for the current commission, which requires unanimous 3-0 votes to advance proposals. With Benedon joining, they will have more flexibility, though two-two ties remain possible.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Cannabis.webp?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-07 16:04:21.091063

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Another independent candidate has entered the race for Maine’s next governor. 
Derek Levasseur, who describes himself as a small business leader and published a memoir earlier this year about overcoming adversity, announced his plans to run for governor as an independent in a Facebook post Thursday. He filed paperwork with the Maine Ethics Commission the same day listing a Benton address. 
Levasseur said his focus is lowering the cost of living and reforming the state Department of Health and Human Services to increase accountability. He proposes eliminating property taxes on people’s primary homes and increasing government transparency. 
Levasseur, who doesn’t have a storied political career, said Maine needs leaders with lived experience. 
“I’m not a career politician,” he said, in his campaign announcement. “I’ve lived through real struggles. I’ve built businesses, worked with families, and faced life’s hardest moments head-on. That’s why I’m running — because I understand what Mainers are going through, and I’m ready to fight for them.”
Though he’s running as an independent and said “uniting Maine across party lines” is part of his platform, Levasseur challenged U.S. Sen. Susan Collins in 2019 as a Republican. At the time, he criticized Collins for not supporting President Donald Trump enough, according to the Portland Press Herald.
In his campaign announcement, Levasseur also addressed previous charges of domestic violence, including one in 2012 when he was a reserve police officer for the town of Clinton. He was also acquitted in 2021 on separate charges of domestic violence from 2019, according to news reports.
“Like many Mainers, I’ve faced challenges that tested everything I believed in,” Levasseur said. “I was accused of something I didn’t do, and I was found not guilty — but the experience forever changed me. It taught me humility, compassion, and the importance of fighting for truth, even when the odds are against you.”
He went on to say that his experiences in life inspired him to write a memoir about overcoming adversity and finding strength through faith. It’s titled “Derecho: Scars on the Soul.”
Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, is termed out, leaving an open race for her seat. Levasseur joins a crowded field with nearly two dozen candidates, including four other independents.

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)LAFAYETTE – After firing dozens and imposing sweeping cuts, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette has cleared all but roughly $2 million of a $25 million recurring deficit, according to the university’s interim president. But officials still must extinguish an accumulated debt of at least $10 million from prior years.
Earlier this month, 51 people were terminated and 19 others were reassigned, the largest loss of personnel since the deficit came to light. In an interview with The Current, interim President Jaimie Hebert said officials have made a lot of progress in shoring up the university’s finances but left the door open for more cuts or layoffs.
“We haven’t determined that yet, but we said all along [that] we want to minimize the human impact if at all possible. If we can do this without losing another person, we will,” Hebert said.
UL launched a new site this week, documenting ongoing budget moves. It includes a feedback form for faculty and is billed as a “living resource.” In a message announcing the page, Hebert said 120 feedback forms had been submitted so far.
Departments across the campus were mandated to slice 10% from their budgets, except Academic Affairs, which is being cut by 5% to limit the impact on instruction.
Budget cuts to date have trimmed all but $2 million from the $25 million figure Hebert has described as a “structural deficit” — essentially recurring expenses that have outgrown revenues. But he clarified that the full target has been $35 million: The structural deficit plus $10 million of debt carried over.

News of the financial straits came after UL’s longtime CFO Jerry Luke LeBlanc stepped down in May, followed by the early retirement of President Joseph Savoie in July. Savoie assumed the role of president emeritus and will join the faculty next year after a seven-month sabbatical.
In June, UL delayed paying $15 million into the university’s retirement system to the following month, punting the cost into the next fiscal year. Hebert said the delay did not reflect a delinquency on the payment. “[The payment] was never in arrears,” he told The Current.
And while Hebert has thus far declined to publicly recriminate how UL’s finances deteriorated, the former provost acknowledged austerity was in the university’s future.
In town halls and media appearances, he has pointed at rising costs over the last decade, coupled with a decline in full-time enrollment, as major factors in the crisis. Meanwhile, UL added 267 new positions since 2015 to its payroll, he said, clarifying a report disclosed to The Current earlier this month tabulating 467 net positions. That figure included replacement hires.
Still, the added manpower grew UL’s annual personnel costs by $40 million, he noted. UL’s payroll is about $10 million a month.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
At least some of those positions were in research. But UL’s pursuit and maintenance of the R1 research designation was not a key factor in the crunch, Hebert said. “Can I point to R1 as one of the causes of this? No,” he said.
With more debt to clear up, Hebert nonetheless insisted UL has come a long way in closing the budget gap.
“I’m not trying to make light of this,” the interim president said of the structural deficit. “It was a significant issue. But the fact that, in three months time, we’ve been able to address a huge portion of a $25 million deficit tells you that it was not insurmountable.”
Hebert deferred some questions to CFO Edwin Litolff, the “numbers man” spearheading cuts and adjustments, a role he has also played recently at UNO. Litolff, who also previously served as vice president of finance at Grambling State University, has not had a public-facing role.
It remains unclear to what extent the ongoing deficit in the athletics division, for instance, is squeezing overall finances. Some of the terminations in the October cuts were in the athletics department. (The Current is awaiting confirmation of the number of athletics staff reductions from the university.)
UL football has accounted for the overwhelming bulk of the athletic division’s $50 million deficit over the last decade. In the last year alone, football lost more than $10 million, according to UL system financial reports.
“We froze 24 [athletic] positions coming into this fiscal year, and while those don’t contribute directly to savings this year, it removed 24 positions from their overall budget,” Hebert told The Current. He said nearly $4.5 million has been eliminated from the athletics budget, which had about $46 million in expenses in the fiscal year ending June 2024. “So the impact is hitting athletics as well.”


Let us know what you think...


 

Hebert is a numbers man himself, with bachelor’s, master’s and doctorate degrees in statistics — all from UL Lafayette. He joined UL as provost and vice president of Academic Affairs in 2018, the top spot over instruction and faculty, after previously serving as president of Georgia Southern University, and before that as the Sam Houston State University provost and vice president of academic affairs.
Hebert told The Current he has not decided whether he will seek the permanent president’s post: “I’ve not given any thought to it, honestly. At this point, I’m focused on the problem that’s at hand. I really am.”
Hebert also had no information on the status of the search. “That’s run by the system,” he said.
More than three months have passed since Savoie left his post, yet there is still no plan in place for the search, The Acadiana Advocate reported in October. “There are no next steps, nor is there a finalized timeline for finding a permanent leader for the school,” the newspaper reported, citing comments from a system official. The system oversees nine universities.
While signalling that UL is not yet out of the woods, Hebert sought to quiet anxieties about the university’s long-term health, reiterating his commitment to protecting academics.
“We’ve worked our fingers to the bone for the past three months. We’ve looked at all of the data. We’re uncovering everything we have,” he said. “We’re trying, trying our darndest to keep the student experience whole and wholesome at the front end. I feel like for the most part, we have done that.”

Jerry Moran of Kansas walk to a Senate Republican meeting Oct. 8, 2025, at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. Moran says a proposal from President Donald Trump to change Senate rules to eliminate the filibuster can backfire if Republicans lose majority control of the chamber to Democrats. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)TOPEKA — U.S. Sens. Jerry Moran and Roger Marshall of Kansas reiterated opposition to altering Senate procedure so President Donald Trump’s agenda could advance with simple majority votes rather than meet a 60-vote threshold.
Marshall and Moran, both Republicans, expressed concern such a change in Senate legislative rules regarding the filibuster could backfire if Democrats in the future had a partisan majority in the Senate.
Moran said he had rejected an idea broached in 2022 by U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, for ditching the filibuster barrier to gain traction for voting rights legislation.
“When Sen. Schumer proposed eliminating the filibuster, I opposed that idea, and my views on the importance of the filibuster have not changed,” Moran said. “The filibuster provides senators, even when in the minority, the ability to stop bad policies and forces us to find common ground to better serve our constituents.”
On Wednesday, Trump invited Senate Republicans to the White House to lobby for a rule change so the existing 60-vote requirement could be bypassed. The idea has been referred to legislatively as the “nuclear option.”
The GOP holds 53 seats in the Senate, while Democrats have 45 and the support of two Senate independents. Republicans need backing of seven non-GOP members to proceed with legislation, including budget measures tied to the federal government shutdown.
The U.S. House hasn’t been in session since Sept. 19. The U.S. Senate remains in Washington, D.C., but hasn’t reached consensus on a short-term funding extension allowing the government to operate normally.
Marshall told the NewsNation outlet there was no doubt ending the filibuster would help Trump’s agenda reach the finish line.
“If I had to vote today, I would vote no,” Marshall said. “I would vote to keep the filibuster in place, but I’m reserving the nuclear option. We do need to open the government. There needs to be a day and time when the Democrats quit holding these Obamacare Biden funds hostage and set America free.”
He was referencing demands by Senate Democrats for extension of soon-to-expire Affordable Care Act subsidies designed to control consumer health care costs.
“The Democrats very clearly feel the longer they keep the government shut down, the better they’re going to do next November,” Marshall said. “So, like we’ve always said, this is a political shutdown, and that’s why it’s so hard to solve. They’re using this as leverage.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2239994726.jpg,,,2025-11-07 16:04:21.091063

The new round of funding is the most substantial FEMA aid North Carolina has received since the beginning of the government shutdown. It includes $54 million for the NC Department of Transportation to continue rebuilding roads and bridges.
Another total $40 million will go to two utilities — French Broad Electric Company and Rutherford Electric Membership Corporation — to make repairs and prepare emergency protective measures.
And an array of counties and local municipalities are also seeing grant money:

$14.8 million to Henderson County for debris removal.
$9.6 million to Buncombe County for debris removal, emergency protective measures and road repairs.
$3.3 million to the village of Sugar Mountain to repair recreational facilities.
$1.6 million to the town of Boone for road repairs.
$1.4 million for repair work at Paddy’s Creek Beach and Catawba Beach.
$1.3 million to the Buncombe County school board to repair two schools.

State officials continue to wait on other key avenues of federal funding for Helene recovery.

Democrat Mark Mullet and Republican J.T. Wilcox each exited the Legislature at the end of their term in January. Both found success Tuesday in bids for nonpartisan posts.
Mullet spent Wednesday morning picking up campaign signs in Issaquah, where voters elected him to be the city’s next mayor.
The ex-state senator and 2024 gubernatorial candidate said he’s looking forward to reengaging in “public service that solves problems” minus the partisan bickering of the legislative process. 
“My focus will be on making sure state policies don’t have a negative impact on the local level,” said Mullet, who served on the Issaquah City Council before winning his Senate seat in 2012.
Mullet fell well short in his bid for governor, losing the primary to a fellow Democrat, Bob Ferguson, who is now governor. Ferguson endorsed Mullet for mayor.
Tuesday won’t serve as a springboard back into any state office, Mullet insisted.

“This is setting me up to hopefully be a really good mayor of Issaquah,” he said. 
In Pierce County, Wilcox, who led the House Republican Caucus for five years, won a seat on the nonpartisan Port of Tacoma Commission.
He said he was somewhat surprised because he is known as a Republican, and his opponent, Cyrus Donato, is recognized as a Democrat. 
“It didn’t seem like a very good year to be a Republican” on the ballot, he said. 
He was alluding to how the unpopular policies of President Donald Trump hurt GOP candidates in western Washington in Tuesday’s contests.
Wilcox won his House seat in 2010 and served seven terms in the 2nd Legislative District that encompasses parts of Thurston and Pierce counties. He served as House minority leader from 2018 to 2023.
He said the part-time commission post will allow him to serve the public, work on salmon recovery and strengthen the port’s relationship with local governments and tribes, as well as state and federal agencies. And to do the work collaboratively, not confrontationally, he said.
“This is an important part of the economy. It doesn’t deserve to be ruled by activism or ideology,” Wilcox said.
Also Tuesday, two Republican state lawmakers were re-elected to local positions.
Rep. Sam Low of Lake Stevens won a third term on the Snohomish County Council. It will be his last due to term limits.
He led Democrat Kelli Johnson by a margin of 54.2% to 45.7% on Thursday. His performance stood out as a rarity on Tuesday: a Republican getting above 50% against a Democrat. for a partisan office.
“I have a good, strong track record of working in a bipartisan way,” he said Wednesday, shortly before attending a council meeting where he would be voting on a 2026 county budget.

Crews have already begun work on the second assembly facility that mimics the complex’s existing final production line.
Dignitaries, including Gov. Henry McMaster, members of South Carolina’s congressional delegation and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, were on hand Friday to officially celebrate the much-needed buildout as global demand for the 787 takes flight.
“This expansion enables us to go to (production) rates that we only dreamed of in the past,” said Lisa Fahl, engineering vice president for the 787. “It’s huge. We’re doubling the size of the flight line. We’re doubling the size of the factory. We could one day have four production lines running concurrently.”
The company headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, also announced it is doubling the number of jobs associated with the expansion since it was first announced last December. It’s now pledging to hire 1,000 people in the next few years.
Production in the new building is expected to begin in 2028.
The latest expansion will bring Boeing’s total capital investment in South Carolina to more than $3 billion since the company opened its Palmetto State location in 2011. As of 2024, the company employed more than 8,250 workers in the state across its North Charleston and Orangeburg facilities.
The North Charleston factory recently raised its production pace to seven Dreamliners a month, up from five per month in the first half of the year. The company expects to reach a monthly rate of eight planes by the end of December, CEO Kelly Ortberg told investors on a quarterly earnings call last week.
Boeing is aiming for 10 planes a month in 2026 as it works to fill its growing backlog of orders, Ortberg added, though supply issues may make that a struggle. And the new assembly building will eventually push that even higher.
“If we thought capping at 10 was as far as we go, we would not be investing in expanding Charleston,” Ortberg said in response to analysts’ questions.
Boeing’s 787 production peak was previously 14 jets a month in 2018, when the work was split between North Charleston and the company’s original Seattle-area facility. South Carolina became the company’s 787 hub in 2021, after the Seattle line closed.
Meanwhile, new orders for the commercial aircraft have soared to 314 through Sept. 30, compared to 64 for all of 2024. The backlog was up to 1,048 planes at the time of the last earnings announcement.
Boeing gets largest ever order of SC-made planes during Trump’s Qatar visit

Boeing inked a record-breaking deal with Qatar Airways for 130 Dreamliners in May, as well as a smaller with British Airways for 32 of the planes.
Gulf Air signed on for up to 18 Dreamliners in July.
And the day of the groundbreaking, Boeing rolled out even more deals: 15 Dreamliners for Kazakhstan’s Air Astana, four for Tajikistan’s Somon Air and Uzbekistan Airways exercised an option to add eight more Dreamliners to a previous order.
Bessent, a native of Little River, credited President Donald Trump and the administration’s trade policies with aiding Boeing in its recent success.
“If you follow trade news, you’ll notice a constant trend,” he told the crowd of Boeing employees Friday. “Where there’s a Trump trade deal, there’s a Boeing sale.”
Boeing signed the Qatar contract on the heels of Trump’s visit to the country.
“That deal set the tone for those that have followed,” Bessent said. “At the president’s urging, South Korea announced it would purchase 103 Boeing aircraft, Japan announced it would purchase 100 and countries like Malaysia, Indonesia and Cambodia announced they would purchase dozens of their own.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/BSC_Final_Assembly_Building_Rendering.jpg,,,2025-11-07 16:04:21.091063

DOVER, Del. — Two measures that could significantly affect state spending and legislative procedures are set to be heard in House committee hearings Friday, ahead of an extraordinary session of the General Assembly scheduled for next week.
The House Rules and House Administration committees, both made up of the five members of House leadership, will take up House Bill 255 and House Resolution 19.
House Bill 255 – Investment Tax Credit
House Bill 255 addresses the impact of the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), signed into law in July. Because Delaware’s tax code is linked to the federal code, tax cuts and incentives in the OBBBA could affect state tax collections. The bill focuses on two provisions related to tax breaks for large businesses, specifically for research and development expenses and equipment investments. The new federal law allows business owners more flexibility in claiming deductions for these expenses, retroactive to 2022.
The Delaware Division of Revenue estimates that, without action, the state could lose $410 million in revenue over the current and next two fiscal years. HB 255 would “decouple” Delaware’s tax code from these federal provisions, reducing the projected three-year revenue loss to $73.8 million.
Gov. Matt Meyer called the General Assembly into an extraordinary session to address the issue, saying, “Washington keeps handing out tax breaks to the wealthy while working people get left behind.”
Not all lawmakers and stakeholders agree. The Delaware BioScience Association noted in a recent post that the OBBBA allows companies to deduct domestic R&D costs upfront, rather than over five years. Supporters argue the change will boost advanced manufacturing and biotech startups, which many officials see as key to future job growth and new revenue sources.
Marie Holliday, a tax expert with the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce, called the legislation an investment in the long-term growth of emerging industries. “I believe this is a win for our state,” Holliday said.
State Rep. Danny Short, R-Seaford, a member of the budget-writing Joint Finance Committee, questioned the governor’s urgency. Short pointed to earlier projections from the Meyer administration showing slowing revenue growth and rising expenditures, predicting a budget deficit of nearly $408 million by fiscal year 2028. He also criticized the lack of accountability for increased state spending, noting that General Fund appropriations rose by more than 53% from fiscal year 2021 to 2025, not including an expected 7% increase this year.
House Bill 19- Remote Voting for Special Sessions
The second measure, House Resolution 19, would amend House rules to allow members to vote remotely when the House meets outside its regular session, which runs from January to June. The rule would require at least 21 of the 41 House members to be present in the chamber, and members wishing to vote remotely would need permission from the Speaker.
If approved next Thursday, the rule change would allow up to 20 members to vote from anywhere in the world.
Rep. Short noted that HB 255 requires a three-fifths supermajority, or 25 votes, to pass. With 27 Democrats in the House, the absence of just three members would prevent the measure from passing on Democratic votes alone.
“While it’s not explicitly stated, I believe there is an expectation for lawmakers to meet in person at Legislative Hall, debate bills face-to-face, allow the press and the public to witness, and be available for questioning afterwards,” Short said. “The only time we should be casting votes remotely is under the most dire of circumstances. I view this rule change as not only a political convenience for the upcoming session, but also as the camel’s nose under the tent. If we pass this, I predict it will not be long before this rule is again modified, further expanding the use of remote voting.”
Committee action on both measures is scheduled for 11 a.m. Friday in the Joint Finance Chamber of Legislative Hall in Dover. The proceedings are open to the public and will be streamed online.

(Kentucky Justice and Public Safety Cabinet)An oversight agency has filed a federal lawsuit against Kentucky’s Department of Juvenile Justice, alleging it is wrongly refusing to release records of two teenage boys it says experienced abuse and neglect at a state facility.
The lawsuit was filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Frankfort by Kentucky Protection and Advocacy, part of a federally-authorized, nationwide system charged with oversight of individuals with mental illness, intellectual or developmental disabilities or other conditions.
That includes some youths in custody of Kentucky’s juvenile justice system, the lawsuit says.
“Given the ongoing reports of abuse and criticism of the care and treatment of DJJ youth, it is unacceptable that DJJ refuses to comply with federal law and is blocking this investigation,” Jeff Edwards, Protection and Advocacy director, said in a statement.
A spokeswoman for the Kentucky Department of Justice and Public Safety, which includes DJJ, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The lawsuit is the latest allegation against the problem-ridden agency which has been buffeted for several years by accusations of abuse and neglect at the detention centers for youths charged with offenses and residential facilities that house those found to have committed crimes.
Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice launched a civil rights investigation into the conditions at eight of the state’s youth detention centers and one residential center. Also last year, Kentucky Republican Auditor Allison Ball, released an audit of DJJ she said revealed “harsh and alarming conditions” in facilities.
Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, recently announced new policies meant to improve treatment of youths placed in isolation he said were recommended by federal justice officials.
The current lawsuit involves Protection and Advocacy’s efforts to get access to records of incidents involving two male residents, both 16, at the Adair Regional Youth Development and Detention Centers. Both have mental health diagnoses and are under jurisdiction of the oversight agency, the lawsuit said.
One went without medical care for two days despite suffering pain and swelling  after he suffered broken bones in his arm and wrist in a fight with another youth, the lawsuit said. The other was sprayed by staff in the back of the head with pepper spray as he was walking away from an altercation with another youth, in violation of state policies on use of the chemical irritant, the lawsuit said. The youth overheard staff say, “Spray him, get him,” the lawsuit said.
Protection and Advocacy learned of the incidents from the youths during an Oct. 1 visit to monitor conditions at Adair. But when it asked for incident reports from the facility, the state denied the request, claiming the youths must authorize the release, the lawsuit said.
The oversight agency responded that under state law, youths under 18 cannot authorize release of such records and that federal law clearly states Protection and Advocacy shall have access to all records of a minor who has a state guardian and abuse or neglect has been alleged. Both youths are in custody of the state.
The lawsuit asked a federal judge to find the state’s refusal to release the records in violation of the law and order “full and immediate access” to the material.

(Photo by Anne Marie-Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)Nearly 3.6 million New Jerseyans voted in this year’s gubernatorial and legislative races, a level of turnout not seen in any non-presidential race this millennium.
About 54% of the state’s registered voters cast a ballot this year. That’s the highest percentage in a New Jersey state election year since at least 1998, and it exceeds turnout in every congressional midterm since then except 2018.
Those totals include 114,766 untallied mail ballots and 58,998 provisional ballots. The number of mail-in ballots will rise over the coming days as ballots postmarked by Election Day continue to reach officials.

Democrat Mikie Sherrill defeated Republican Jack Ciattarelli Tuesday, 57%-43%, to become the state’s new governor-elect. Sherrill, a congresswoman since 2019, is set to take office on January 20, succeeding fellow Democrat Gov. Phil Murphy. Democrats also flipped a handful of Assembly seats in longtime Republican districts, while Sherrill won Morris County, a longtime GOP stronghold in governor’s races.
Turnout this year far eclipsed that of the state’s two most recent gubernatorial races. In 2021, more than 2.6 million voted, or about 40%. Four years earlier, that number was just under 2.2 million, or 39%.
Democratic State Chairman LeRoy Jones said his party has President Donald Trump to thank for the turnout, arguing the administration’s tariffs, prosecutions of political foes, and deployment of military forces into American cities animated voters to respond.
“All those things created a perfect storm, and the turnout was just not in New Jersey,” Jones said, adding, “This whole Donald Trump rollout over the last 10 months has been the gift that gave to the turnout.”
Democrats surpassed expectations in races nationwide Tuesday, winning the governor’s seat and a slew of legislative offices in Virginia, securing a redistricting measure in California, and maintaining Supreme Court seats in Pennsylvania, among others.
Trump was also a major factor in 2018’s elections despite being off the ballot. Those midterms saw Democrats claim four of the five New Jersey House seats then held by Republicans, the party’s gains fueled by animus to the president.
New Jersey voters were split on how they cast their ballots this year. About 2 million voted in person on Election Day, while 739,702 did the same during the state’s nine-day early in-person voting period.
The number of New Jerseyans who cast ballots by mail reached 759,582 this year. Not all those outstanding ballots will be counted. Some mail-in and provisional ballots will be rejected because of procedural defects or because the voters who cast them had already voted or were otherwise ineligible.
Trump at center of GOP loss in NJ governor’s race, Republicans say

By raw votes, turnout was highest in Bergen County, where 407,154 residents cast ballots. Bergen is the state’s most populous county and has more registered voters than any other New Jersey county.
Three other counties — Essex, Middlesex, and Monmouth — turned out more than half a million voters.
Ocean County, the state’s largest Republican stronghold, turned out 478,999 voters.
Hunterdon County saw the highest rates of turnout. There, nearly 63% voted this year. Bergen (60%) and Passaic (61%) were the only other two counties to exceed 60% turnout.
Turnout rates were lowest in Cumberland County, where about 43% of registered voters cast ballots this year. Essex County wasn’t far behind. Despite strong raw turnout numbers, just 43% of the county’s voters cast ballots.

By Jamie Kleman | Contributing Writer Delaware Live | November 2025
A city-owned 20-acre field at the corner of New Road and Park Road will be transformed into a mixed forest and meadow after the Lewes City Council voted unanimously on November 3 to apply for a grant from the Delaware Forest Service to fund the project.
Under the proposal, the grant would cover 90 percent of the cost and the city’s share would be about $8,000 from its newly established resiliency fund. The field lies between the Canary Creek and Pilottown Reserves subdivisions and is zoned open space, having been deeded to the city in 2010 as part of a development agreement.
Deputy Mayor Khalil Saliba described the plan as a smart investment in both nature and finances. “It’s a very cost-effective way to plant trees that are going to be resilient themselves,” he said.
About ten acres of the parcel will be planted with trees around the perimeter, and the remaining acreage will be managed as a native-grass meadow, with up to 40 percent of the site designated meadow. The city emphasized there will be no sports fields, parking lots, or lighting installed at this time.
Local residents voiced strong support for keeping the land natural. Doug Spelman of Canary Creek said, “Thirteen years ago we fended off soccer fields with lights and trucks and parking, and a lot of things that were not part of the arrangement with the city.”
Another resident, Russell Small, whose grandfather farmed the land, reminded the council of its cultural importance. “It’s a cultural site where Native Americans lived and died. My grandfather excavated a site. The artifacts are in the Smithsonian today,” he said.
City staff intend to submit the grant application in the coming weeks. If approved, the planting phase could begin in spring 2026 and continue through 2028. The project aligns with the city’s broader resiliency strategy, using nature-based solutions to manage stormwater, stabilize soils, and enhance habitat.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/LewesOpenSpace-002.jpg,,,2025-11-07 15:17:19.907341

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A federal judge has declined to require daily monetary penalties against the state’s mental health department for failing to meet certain benchmarks.
The benchmarks are a part of an agreement to begin providing timely competency restoration for indigent defendants.
U.S. District Court Judge Gregory Frizzell directed the parties to use a dispute resolution process outlined in a consent decree to resolve differences.
The Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services has begun implementing a settlement agreement stemming from a 2023 lawsuit that alleged the agency failed to provide timely competency restoration services, leaving some inmates, who were ordered by a court to receive competency restoration services, languishing in jails.
The agency entered an agreement with the plaintiffs to resolve the lawsuit. It set out certain benchmarks for the agency to meet.
A September report from the court-appointed consultants determined the agency had not met those benchmarks. 
Plaintiffs in the case sought monetary penalties of $10,000 a day against the agency.
Frizzell with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District disagreed with plaintiff’s allegations the noncompliance was willful, adding that the consultants said the agency was acting in good faith.
But he was also critical of the agency.
“It is true that Class Members continue to endure long wait times for restoration treatment, often in conditions that exacerbate their mental illness,” his Wednesday order said. “The continued delay in the provision of restoration treatment by the Department should be and is of great concern to this court, as well as the general public.”
The agency issued a statement saying it welcomed the decision.
“We remain mission-driven and steadfast in this long-term process, supported by all of our facilities and state partners, to meet the consent decree’s requirements and strengthen Oklahoma’s competency restoration system,” the statement said.
Paul Demuro, the plaintiffs’ attorney, said the ruling was not what they wanted, but he appreciated the court’s quick action to decide the motion.
He said they’ll use the dispute resolution process before asking the court to intervene again.
“We’ve already initiated that process,” he said. “We won’t stop fighting until the competency restoration system is fixed.”
The agency has been in financial turmoil. It received a $27.4 million supplemental appropriation from lawmakers. The agency is requesting an extra $79.5 million for the upcoming fiscal year. Agency officials said some of that funding would help the agency comply with the settlement agreement.
Lawmakers in May removed former Commissioner Allie Friesen from her post, saying they had lost confidence in her. 
Gov. Kevin Stitt appointed Gregory Slavonic as interim commissioner.
The agency has launched a search for a new permanent commissioner of mental health.

The W, located in Columbus, had the largest enrollment increase of the eight public universities: 8.1% or 2,371 students. That’s the university’s largest enrollment growth in over a decade. 
“We had increases in both new students and in continuing students, so recruitment and retention strategies are having a positive impact,” Nora Miller, president of The W, said in a press release. 
Delta State, another regional institution located in Cleveland, enrolled 2,791 students this fall — a 5.2% increase from 2024. The university also had its highest freshman enrollment growth since the pandemic: a 38% increase from fall 2024. 
“This milestone reflects the exceptional value of a Delta State education, the dedication of our faculty and staff, and the growing confidence families place in our mission to transform lives through innovative, student-centered learning,” Delta State President Dan Ennis, said in a press release. 
Delta State also enrolled 18% more transfer students this year than in 2024, and has 33% more first-time graduates, according to the university. 
For Delta State, that growth occurred after years of  declining enrollment. 
Last year, the university cut $3 million from its budget, which included more than a dozen faculty layoffs and reductions to 21 academic programs. This year, as Delta State celebrates its centennial, administrators said they are focusing on increasing enrollment through intentional recruitment and admissions marketing.
“That kind of momentum signals that more students and families are seeing the value of a Delta State education and the opportunities it provides,” university officials said in a statement to Mississippi Today. 
Two of the state’s flagship institutions, University of Mississippi and Mississippi State University, saw another year of record-breaking student enrollment. Ole Miss had the largest number of students this fall: 25,222. Mississippi State’s enrollment grew by more than 400 students this semester, totaling 23,563. 
The state’s third largest public institution, the University of Southern Mississippi, enrolled 13,191 students, only 0.2% more than last year. 
For the state’s historically Black universities, Mississippi Valley State University had the highest increase in student enrollment, 3.2%, or 2,276 students. Jackson State’s enrollment by 2.2% this fall, totaling 6,464. 
Alcorn State University, an HBCU near Lorman, was the only state institution that saw a slight decline in enrollment, falling to 2,900 students this fall from 3,000 in 2024. 
Edward Rice, vice president of student affairs and enrollment management, said the university plans to do an audit to assess enrollment over the last five years. The goal is to develop data strategies to improve student retention and assess admissions applicants. 
Rice expressed disappointment in the enrollment decline but said the university’s enrollment team hopes to expand Alcorn’s footprint with a new outreach campaign to target prospective students in neighboring states. 
“As we look ahead to the upcoming freshman class, our focus will be strategic and centered on student support and success as well as enhancing our onboarding process to better support incoming students,” Rice said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/01101220/3X0A8846.jpg,,,2025-11-07 15:17:19.907341

Free.,"Trump administration issues November SNAP benefits, then asks Supreme Court to intervene",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-issues-november-snap-benefits-then-asks-supreme-court-intervene,,"This report has been updated.The U.S. Department of Agriculture told states Friday it was releasing full November funding for the nation’s major food assistance program that helps 42 million people afford groceries, complying with a federal court order issued Thursday.The midday memo to states contradicted the Trump administration’s weeks-long position that funding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, during the government shutdown was illegal. And late Friday, the administration resumed that position, asking the Supreme Court to overturn a lower court’s ruling that compelled the earlier memo.Payments would be sent to states Friday, the department’s Food and Nutrition Service said in a letter to state directors of  SNAP, which is funded by the federal government and administered by the states. Patrick A. Penn, the deputy under secretary for food, nutrition and consumer services, wrote the two-paragraph letter.“Later today, FNS will complete the processes necessary to make funds available to support your subsequent transmittal of full issuance files to your EBT processor,” Penn wrote. “We will keep you as up to date as possible on any future developments and appreciate your continued partnership to serve program beneficiaries across the country.”The move undermined an appeal President Donald Trump’s administration made following Thursday’s order from Chief U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell Jr. of Rhode Island. The appeal said the government shutdown, and the resulting lack of funding for SNAP, was Congress’ fault and that the department could not be compelled to transfer other funds to pay for SNAP benefits.A Department of Justice spokesperson said in a Friday email to States Newsroom the government must comply with McConnell’s order until and unless it is given relief by a higher court.The shutdown, which started when Congress failed to pass annual spending laws by Oct. 1, left SNAP without any appropriated funding for November and beyond. The administration reversed its own guidance and declined to use a contingency fund and other accounts within the USDA held more than enough to cover some benefits.Appeal in limboThe move from the USDA was in contrast to an appeals court brief the Justice Department filed on USDA’s behalf Friday morning, leaving the future of that litigation unclear.The appeal asked the 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals for an emergency freeze on McConnell’s order, which it characterized as a wild overreach to a reasonable agency decision.A three-judge panel for the appeals court denied the government’s request for a stay on the merits late Friday, while saying it would soon decide on a motion for an administrative stay.The judges — David J. Barron, Gustavo A. Gelpí and Julie Rikelman — were all appointed by Democratic presidents, though Gelpí was appointed to a lower court by Republican President George W. Bush. The agency said it complied with a Nov. 1 McConnell order to either pay full benefits by Nov. 3 or partial benefits by Nov. 5 by sending states a memo and tables to calculate partial benefits. The USDA had the power to decide to pay only partial benefits from a contingency fund that held about $4.5 billion, the government argued. SNAP benefits cost the government about $9 billion per month.In McConnell’s Thursday order, he rejected that argument, saying the partial payment had to be made by Nov. 5 to be in compliance with the Oct. 31 order. The judge said Thursday that because the department had not met that deadline, it must transfer money from outside the contingency fund to make November SNAP benefits whole.The administration argued to the 1st Circuit that order was beyond McConnell’s power.“There is no lawful basis for an order that directs USDA to somehow find $4 billion in the metaphorical couch cushions,” the appeal said.The administration has resisted suggestions, including from McConnell, that it tap a $23 billion fund meant for child nutrition programs in order to pay November SNAP benefits.The administration asked the appeals court to pause McConnell’s order by 4 p.m. Eastern time Friday.Problem of government’s 'own making'The coalition of nonprofits and city governments that sued to force the administration to pay November benefits responded later Friday morning that USDA was to blame for the tight timeline that provoked the department’s complaints.The department chose, between the two options offered by McConnell, to pay partial benefits “but with complete disregard for the conditions the district court had attached to it,” the coalition wrote Friday.“Defendants’ current situation, therefore, is entirely the product of their own making,” they wrote. “They purported to comply with an order of the district court in a manner that was not compliant; having done so, they cannot complain that the district court ordered them to take the other path.”The coalition also sharply criticized the administration’s decision not to use the child nutrition program fund. The fund had enough money to pay benefits until at least May, the coalition lawyers wrote Friday. But denying SNAP benefits for November would leave 16 million children hungry this month, they said. Major shutdown issueThe issue has become a focus of the shutdown, with each party in Washington blaming the other for denying food assistance for low-income people and those with disabilities.Friday’s rapid turnaround by USDA appeared to take even lawmakers by surprise.Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, posted to social media after the notice had gone out that Trump was “trying to weasel his way out of a court order requiring him to help millions of hungry Americans.”Rep. Angie Craig, the ranking Democrat on the U.S. House Agriculture Committee, said in a late Friday statement the administration’s mixed messaging led to mass confusion, leaving some states to fully fund SNAP while others have not. “The Trump administration needs to tell American households and states in plain language whether it is continuing to appeal the Rhode Island court order or if it is fully funding November SNAP benefits,” she said. “Americans are still living with the uncertainty around what the hell is happening here. The incompetence is stunning.""Republicans have also highlighted the issue while urging Democrats to accept a stopgap funding measure to reopen the government at fiscal 2025 spending levels.“There are people going hungry right now because Democrats refuse to agree to a clean, nonpartisan funding extension,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said on the Senate floor Friday.Democrats have blocked a House-passed bill to reopen the government, seeking assurances that Republicans will work to address expiring tax credits for people who buy health insurance on the Affordable Care Act marketplace.",,,,2025-11-07 19:56:33.497121

(Photo by Emily Previti/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Alexis Miller first encountered Jim and Janet Bowers when she commissioned their bakery in Shamokin, to make her wedding cake.  
“We didn’t have a lot of money or time,” Miller said.
Miller, who was 24 at the time, said the event came together with just a month’s planning. She’d considered scrapping it entirely because she was so broken up over the recent loss of her grandparents (her grandfather had planned to walk her down the aisle). Her compromise was to fast-track everything and “just get it over with.” In the end, festivities ended up being a bit too abbreviated. 
A bright spot, however, was the wedding cake. To start, Miller said, Jim and Janet got it just right, pulling together and interpreting photos and descriptions from Miller. 
And Miller said a big bonus was that the proceeds helped support the couple’s mobile soup kitchen: God’s Chuckwagon, run out of a retrofitted school bus since 2005 in Pennsylvania’s Coal Region. 
“It was helping them, and helping us,” she said. “We got the cake and they got the money to help the community.” 
The need is great in the area, where the population, economy and overall quality of life started declining decades ago when mines closed. The degradation worsened when factories shutdown and snowballed, culminating in relatively high unemployment and poverty rates as well as environmental degradation, healthcare deserts and more. 
“We used to not come out. We didn’t really need the help,” Miller said. “It’s just gotten hard lately, probably over the last three weeks.”
Miller said she and her family have become regulars as they tighten their belts in every way possible due to the prospect of losing $800 in monthly grocery assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) amid the ongoing, historically long federal government shutdown.

Normally, recipients get SNAP benefits payments on a designated business day within the first half of each month. Even with a federal judge ordering the government to pay them in full, November’s already have been missed. 
The Trump administration, meanwhile, is fighting the court ruling. And there’s no timeline for when payments would resume. Other officials – including state Department of Health Services Secretary Val Arkoosh – have highlighted a relatively efficient process used during the COVID-19 pandemic, to no avail. It would move faster, they say, than the 9 to 22 days  estimated for the approach that the feds want to use to disburse SNAP payments from a contingency fund. 
“I did not expect any of this to happen,” said Miller, who is 27 years old . “A lot of people are on SNAP. And it doesn’t just affect [them]. It affects all the stores, it affects the truckers who drive [for] the stores. It affects everyone.”
In Pennsylvania, about two million people get a collective $360 million-plus each month in SNAP support. More than 18,000 people use the program in Northumberland County – that’s 20 percent of the county, among the highest rates in the commonwealth.
“I’m more worried about it for my children than I am myself,” Miller said. “I can go without eating if need be. But my kids? They’re babies, they’re toddlers. They can’t go without eating.”
Miller spoke as she and her husband Zach waited with three of their five young children (four under the age of six) for hot meals from God’s Chuckwagon on a sunny, windy afternoon in Shamokin, recently  – when the federal government officially stopped sending out SNAP payments.
The chuckwagon served nearly 100 takeout meals within an hour from two locations in the city that day – on top of another 50 in Sunbury the day before. That’s about quadruple the usual demand, according to Janet Bowers.
The uptick matches what local food pantries report seeing during the past couple weeks, according to Megan Bair, who’s executive director of Central Susquehanna Opportunities Inc., The group is the Community Action Agency for Northumberland, Columbia and Montour counties.
“People are scared,” Bair said. “SNAP’s really a lifeline for them. They use their other household funds to cover other essential bills like rent and utilities and gas.”
Bair and Jim Bowers both said they’re concerned that the loss of social benefits would drive people out of their homes.
“We’re already seeing an increase in homelessness, in our counties, and of people who can’t pay their rent. And a lot of these families are working families,” Bair said.
Bowers said he fields calls with increasing frequency from people looking for guidance on finding an affordable place to live.

Stretched safety net
The SNAP lapse coincides with the onset of more stringent requirements to qualify for the program. And it’s but one component of the nation’s social safety net – others include the Low-income Heating Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and Women, Infants and Children (WIC) – stretched during the federal government shutdown. A major sticking point: extending tax credits to prevent health insurance premiums from spiking so high next year that millions would likely be forced to go without it.
In Pennsylvania, the shutdown and its impact on social services and the economy has exacerbated a state budget impasse now in its fifth month. The commonwealth’s schools, nonprofits and county governments have gone without state funding during that time.
Schools have missed $5.3 billion in state payments. And at least three districts have warned they might close as a result after the end of January, absent changes at the Capitol: Morrisville (Bucks County), William Penn (Delaware County) and Northwest Area (Luzerne County) ,, according to the Pennsylvania State Education Association.
“We know that childhood hunger is already a major issue facing our public schools and that the loss of SNAP benefits will only make success at school harder for students facing food insecurity,” said PSEA President Aaron Chapin in a statement. “Hunger in children impacts their ability to learn and perform in the classroom because it hinders their concentration, memory, mood and motor skills.”
Similarly, counties have gone without state funds that account for a third, on average, of their revenue. To compensate, they  are employing a number of measures including furloughs and incurring debt totaling in the tens of millions, collectively and conservatively, according to John Buffone, spokesman for the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania.
Not to mention losing out on interest – reportedly $875,000 in Luzerne County so far – and delaying programs. 
Despite being stretched, Delaware and Northumberland counties are running food drives; Montgomery has diverted $500 million in emergency funding to food pantries.
“How we get things done”
Northumberland is one of six counties where at least 20 percent of people use SNAP benefits.
The others are Erie, Luzerne, Fayette, Cameron and Philadelphia. Setting aside the Democratic stronghold of Philadelphia, voters in each of those counties have overwhelmingly supported President Donald Trump during his campaigns. They went for him all three times he ran except once, in Erie, where former President Joe Biden narrowly won in 2020. 
Three of the six are rural, where experts say SNAP utilization rates tend to be higher, and communities tend to lack access to private capital, philanthropy and other resources that can be tapped to at least help make up for government lapses. 
“We’re not getting a million dollars in donations from companies, but we’re getting donations that are allowing us to serve more people. People are doing food collections. One of the local technical schools is doing a hygiene collection for us,” Bair said. “So, we don’t see the big donors. What we see are many people stepping up. That’s how we get things done here.”
Scicchitano’s Pizzeria, for example, gave away free slices for a week from its location in Berwick, Columbia County.  
“We know times are tough for many right now, and we want to do what we can to help,” read a Nov. 3 Facebook post. “This week only, anyone with a SNAP card is welcome to stop by for two slices of cheese pizza on us. No purchase necessary, just bring your card with you.”
Joey Scicchitano has been operating the pizza shop with his wife Mari for 30 years. He said the offer grew out of the couple’s conversations during the past couple weeks as they’ve followed the news about the looming loss of SNAP benefits that so many people rely on.  
“We’re like, ‘Well,what can we do?’ We’re food people. We knew it was probably going to be overwhelming. And it has been. It’s been a lot. But it’s been worth it,” said Scicchitano, noting that his family used SNAP when he was a small child – something the 58-year-old had forgotten until his older sister reminded him recently.
The response has meant producing twice as much pizza as usual – a challenge considering their small staff and timing considerations for dough made fresh on site, he said.  
It also has left him concerned that people going hungry is a true possibility – at the hands of elected officials who can’t agree. 
“They need to do their job,” he said. 
Businesses stepping up like that supplements the more established meal calendar in the area, expanded during the past month by Central Susquehanna Opportunities adding five locations to its mobile food pantry route. 
For its part, God’s Chuckwagon makes four stops per week, two each in Sunbury and Shamokin – scaled back from 11 pre-pandemic. That’s partly due to reduced contributions and, according to Janet Bowers, she and her husband are getting older.

Looking ahead
Zach Miller, who works as an IT support specialist for U-Haul, said he feared it was basically just a matter of time before the federal government would cut SNAP and other social services after watching the Department of Government Efficiency’s approach earlier this year. 
“Also, a lot of Republicans see  (social services) as government waste,” said Miller, who told the Capital-Star he identifies politically as a moderate Independent and has not voted for Trump. “That people should be working other than collecting benefits. Even though most people work, there’s the misconception that everybody that’s on SNAP is kind of like a freeloader.”
Faced with the loss of SNAP and LIHEAP, the 29-year-old said he could tap investments or family members for help to a limited extent. Part-time work is an option– but not a long-term solution because it would mean even more time that Alexis is left on her own caring for their five kids including supporting two who are autistic. He’s also says that could be tough in an area where many people “are in the same boat.”
“It really depends on how long the shutdown is actually going to last,” he said. “It’s discouraging.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/gods-chuckwagon-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-07 14:57:26.059169

(John Gray/Verite News)Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson successfully argued Friday that she shouldn’t have to pay the full fine for missing a campaign reporting deadline because her attorney was incarcerated at the time. 
The Louisiana Board of Ethics voted to reduce Hutson’s fine for filing the annual report for the Orleans Jedi Guardian political action committee, where she is the chairperson, three weeks late earlier this year. 
Her original fine was $2,800, but the board lowered it to $500. The ethics board staff had recommended that the fine, at a minimum, be reduced to $2,000, according to board documents. 
The board was apparently swayed by Hutson’s explanation that she didn’t realize the PAC’s attorney, Jimmy Burland, was behind bars and couldn’t file the paperwork on time. The report was due Feb. 18 but but wasn’t filed until March 11. 

“Unfortunately, this was one of the PACs that was being handled by Jimmy Burland, who my client found out was in prison, so my client was not aware the filing had not been completed,” wrote Alesia Ardoin, Hutson’s new attorney, in an email to the board staff. 
A longtime Louisiana lobbyist, Burland pled guilty to federal charges of possessing child pornography in November 2024, three months before Hutson’s PAC’s campaign report was due. Both his conviction and a federal raid on his office in downtown Baton Rouge, which took place in April 2024, were well-publicized.
Hutson, who lost her reelection campaign earlier this month, will step down as sheriff in June. She is in the process of dissolving the Orleans Jedi Guardian PAC, Ardoin told the ethics board Friday. 

The PAC only took in one donation during the entirety of 2024 — $275 from Hutson herself — and only had $97 available in its account at the end of last year, according to campaign finance documents.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/OPSO_02-2048x1365-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-07 14:57:26.059169

Sharice Davids in the November 2026 election. This March 2025 image is of Hawkins speaking to a GOP colleague. (Photo by Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas House Speaker Dan Hawkins stripped three Republicans of committee chairmanships for refusing to sign a petition calling for a special legislative session to redraw congressional boundaries in a bid to block reelection of Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids and to tackle a handful of unrelated bills.
Hawkins relied on his unilateral power as the House’s top leader to alter committee assignments and remove as chairmen GOP Reps. Steven Howe of Salina, Nathan Butler of Junction City and Jesse Borjon of Topeka. At least one committee vice chairman, Rep. Clarke Sanders of Salina, also was removed from the position by Hawkins.
Sanders, who was vice chair of the House Higher Education Budget Committee, said Hawkins called him Friday with the news. Sanders said Republicans in committee leadership positions who wouldn’t sign the special session petition were targeted.
“Those of us who were chairs and vice chairs … have been relieved because we didn’t agree to sign on for a special session,” Sanders said. “I understand it. I knew that not signing it came with a risk. I just didn’t think it was the right thing to do. I hope to maintain a good relationship with the speaker, but this was something he felt he had to do.”
It’s likely additional committee vice chairs could be removed from leadership positions by the House speaker. Rank-and-file members of the House also could face sanctions in terms of committee assignments ahead of the 2026 legislative session in January.
The committee leaders demoted by Hawkins were among 10 Republican House members who declined to sign the petition for the special session. Neither Howe, Butler nor Borjon could be immediately reached for comment.
“I’m not shocked. It wasn’t too much of a surprise to me,” said Rep. Mark Schreiber, an Emporia Republican who was among the GOP representatives who didn’t sign the petition. “I’ve been there quite a long time as a lobbyist and legislator. I’ve seen that from leadership.”
He said the Republicans who lost committee assignments wouldn’t be deprived of an opportunity to represent their constituents in the House.
“They still have votes on the floor and can speak from the (House) well,” Schreiber said.
Hawkins was able to convince 78 of the 88 GOP members of the House to sign, which fell below the two-thirds requirement of 84 signatures from 125 House members to authorize the special session. Kansas Senate President Ty Masterson was able to secure the necessary 27 signatures to complete special session requirements in that chamber. The special session had been scheduled for Nov. 7.
On Tuesday, Hawkins threw in the towel on a special session but vowed to take on congressional redistricting in 2026. Under legislative rules, he said, once the Nov. 7 deadline was breached the original House and Senate petitions would be voided and the signature search would have to start over.
“To say I’m disappointed would be an understatement,” Hawkins said in his newsletter posted Friday. “At this late date, the only option was to wait until we return for the regular session on January 12.”
In terms of Kansas’ four congressional districts, President Donald Trump urged GOP-led legislatures in Kansas and other states to redraw boundaries to promote election of more Republicans in November 2026 so the U.S. House might remain under GOP control.
Hawkins wanted the Legislature to gather in November to address Trump’s plea for mid-decade redistricting and to consider how to handle federal funding of rural health care and a court decision allowing Kansans to change gender information on a driver’s license. There also were discussions about taking up property tax legislation during the special session.
He said in a statement Tuesday that scheduling conflicts and competing agendas made planning a special session an “uphill battle.”
In the House speaker’s newsletter Friday, he said delaying decisions until January meant Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly would have “full discretion” on allocation of new federal funding for health care in rural Kansas. Without advance guardrails, he said, funding accepted by Kelly couldn’t be returned to the federal government.
“Those who refused to sign a petition played right into the governor’s hands by giving her free rein without oversight on hundreds of millions of dollars. Sad,” Hawkins said.
Hawkins said delaying passage of a gender identification bill meant the Legislature’s action to nullify the court decision would be “very costly and difficult.”
The timeline for imposing new congressional districts on Kansans — the focus has been on splitting voter-rich Johnson County among multiple districts — would be “greatly shortened,” Hawkins said.
He also disclosed there were “valid” complaints about the cost to taxpayers of a special session, especially since the regular session would begin in two months on Jan. 12. The GOP-controlled Legislative Coordinating Council voted in October to allocate $460,000 to the special session.
“It’s also important to remember that the Legislature did their business in record time this (2025 regular) session saving a significant amount of money,” Hawkins said. “These savings would have been more than enough to cover the cost of a special session.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hawkins-1-3.24.25-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-07 14:57:26.059169

The release of the funds comes as the federal government shutdown entered day 38 on Friday; it’s the longest shutdown in American history.
The lapse in federal funding for SNAP, known as FoodShare in Wisconsin, took effect on Nov. 1 — leaving nearly 700,000 Wisconsinites, including 270,000 kids, without access to food assistance. Two court orders last week directed the Trump administration to pay SNAP benefits by a Wednesday deadline.
This week food banks across the state, including in Milwaukee, have seen a spike in need.
Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr., a federal judge in Rhode Island, ordered the Trump administration Thursday to pay the full month of food assistance benefits for November. McConnell said the Trump administration missed its chance to make partial payments after it failed to release funds by the deadline.
Shortly after the court decision was released, the Evers administration announced it was taking steps to get the funds out the door as soon as possible.
“My administration worked quickly to ensure these benefits could be released as soon as possible so that our kids, families, and seniors have access to basic food and groceries without one more day of delay,” Evers said in a statement Thursday evening. “But let’s be clear — it never should’ve come to this. Wisconsinites should’ve never been without food assistance, period, and they wouldn’t have been if President Trump and the Trump Administration had listened to me and so many who urged them to use all legal funds and levers to prevent millions of Americans from losing access to food and groceries.” 
The Evers administration said Friday morning that it used the same process it typically uses to process benefits, submitting information to its SNAP payment vendor, which processes payments to QUEST cards, a few hours after the court decision to ensure payments would go out as soon as possible. 
The funds became available to households at midnight. According to the administration, a total of about $104.4 million was issued for 337,137 households. It said the payments went out before the Trump administration requested that a federal appeals court block the order from McConnell on Friday morning. The emergency stay has not been granted as of Friday afternoon. 
The administration received notification from the federal Food and Nutrition Service on Friday morning that it was working to implement November benefits in accordance with the Thursday court order.
The Evers administration said it is still monitoring the situation for any issues that may arise related to processing last night’s payments. 
Evers said the actions of the Trump administration are “contemptible” and called on federal Republicans to work with Democrats to end the government shutdown. Last week, Evers had also declared a state of emergency due to the lapse in funding for food assistance, directing state agencies to do everything they could to support Wisconsinites.
“Wisconsinites simply cannot afford another month of Republican dysfunction in Washington,” Evers said. “It’s time for Republicans to get back to work and do the right thing by working across the aisle to end the federal government shutdown to ensure Wisconsinites continue to have access to basic needs, including affordable healthcare and food assistance, moving forward.”

As of Friday, 31 people were in quarantine, down from more than 150 a month ago. Health officials are expecting more cases in friends and family members of those in quarantine, according to a Friday news release.
The decrease in recent cases shows that 21-day quarantines are effective in stopping the disease from spreading in the community, said Linda Bell, the state epidemiologist.

“We’ve got a positive sign,” Bell told reporters Wednesday of the decrease in new cases. “It is too early to say, however, that the outbreak is waning.”
For officials to declare the outbreak over, the state would need to go 42 days without a new case reported in the community, Bell said. That represents two incubation cycles for the virus.
Measles could continue to spread throughout the state during the upcoming holidays, Bell said. During the busy travel season surrounding Thanksgiving and Christmas, the disease could spread quickly in airports or on crowded flights, she said.
Symptoms sometimes take weeks to show up, so people may not realize they’re sick when they travel. The state could see its case count rise in the weeks after Thanksgiving, Bell said.
“This is a risk that takes us through the Thanksgiving holidays, into the Christmas holidays, that could keep rolling along into the early part of next year if we don’t increase our vaccination rates now to get people protected before these potential exposures,” Bell said.
Quarantines show effectiveness as measles cases continue to rise, SC health officials say

Early symptoms include a fever, cough, red eyes and a runny nose. A rash typically follows those symptoms, starting on the face before spreading to the rest of the body. Severe cases can cause pneumonia or brain swelling, which can be fatal, especially in young children.
Vaccination is the only sure way to stop the virus from spreading, Bell said. One dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine is about 93% effective at preventing infections, and two doses is about 97% effective, she said.
Immunizations are available for free at mobile health clinics in Spartanburg County, as well as through state health departments and other clinics. Since the state’s mobile clinics launched Oct. 16, they have administered 30 shots, Bell said.

(Photo via Google Earth)First impression of Keokuk: beautiful and blighted, drained away with the currents of time at the confluence of the Mississippi and Des Moines rivers on Iowa’s southeastern tip.
You could forsake it were it not for the stubborn and resilient people who have laid claim to the place since 1837.
It was a major-league city with major-league ambitions. It was the Gate City to the river trade. It was a milling and foundry town. In 1875, the Keokuk Westerns played in the National League, compiling a 1-12 record and hanging up their cleats by June, never to play the Chicago White Stockings again.
The town boasted industrialists like J.C. Hubinger, a miller who had a huge mansion and amusement park overlooking the river and died poor in a boarding house. Now you could buy a manse along the river for $300,000. Forty percent of the historic brick buildings downtown are vacant.
In 1960, just before the fathers of industry were selling out to corporations, the population was 16,000. It dropped in the last census to under 10,000.
Keokuk has taken its lumps, like so many other working-class towns: Fort Madison, Ottumwa, Fort Dodge, Clinton. Keokuk got a rap. It rubs the wrong way.
“We know we have a chip on our shoulder,” said Teamsters union business agent Drake Custer at the Keokuk Labor Temple. “We also know what we are capable of.”
We spent four days in Keokuk shooting video for a series of documentaries about the real issues eating at rural Iowa. We will have episodes on water, cancer, agriculture and rural consolidation.
Keokuk helps you appreciate what Iowa is up against. We are letting the state decay while the politicians fly over. Keokuk is ready for anyone who will lend a hand.
City Councilman Mike Greenwald said the town realizes that if it wants to get things done, they have to do it themselves.
The restored Keokuk Union Depot. (Photo via Google Earth)
Downtown vacancies were 60% five years ago. The Main Street Alliance has invested over $1 million. (You could own two buildings three stories high on the main drag for just $55,000.) It’s getting better. The old railroad depot is restored to glory with private fundraising. New field turf was laid down for football and soccer, and the high school grandstands are next.
Mayor Kathy Mahoney believes Main Street will fill up again.
Maybe. It was built for a town twice its size, and before Amazon and Walmart.
“We have top-dollar employers, we just can’t get the workers,” said Roslyn Garcia, who moved home to Keokuk from Austin, Texas, with her husband Jonathan. She served a four-year term on the city council during which the broken-down road leading to Iowa’s only national cemetery was finally rebuilt.
There is justifiable optimism that Keokuk and Fort Madison may have bottomed out, but you cannot know when the calls are made in a faraway corporate boardroom. The Case-IH plant at Burlington upstream is threatened. These towns are forced to constantly pull themselves up with little outside help. Des Moines might as well be on the moon.
The county flipped from blue to red, from Obama to Trump. Anyone who wants to understand should listen.
Keokuk officials did listen when Custer and his union brethren launched the Iowa Dignity Project. The group surveyed 400 residents to identify the major issues and held town halls in 2022. Abortion and transgender issues did not make the cut. Streets remain the top complaint. Health care is right up there, since the hospital closed three years ago because of low reimbursement rates. Wages. Child care. Public transportation. The report card was redlined with Fs.
The people were heard.
The city lobbied for help to fix the embarrassment of a road leading to the National Cemetery, planted during the Civil War for soldiers who died in the local hospitals. Finally, the city got a federal earmark in the infrastructure bill through Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks after her opponent, Democrat Christina Bohannon, enjoined the crusade. Eight blocks cost $3.2 million — money that the city just doesn’t have.
When the people stood up, the politicians had to listen.
“If everybody does their part, we can do great things,” Garcia said.
The city got EPA brownfields grants to clean up the site of an abandoned carbide factory. A group is raising money for a library park. The town rehabbed the opera house into a performing arts center. It raised funds for riverfront amenities. Boosters acknowledge that local donors are getting tapped out. But there is an attitude that things can change.
A construction company bought the vacant mall and intends to bring back the movie theatre. Cheap property is at the ready. Electric rates are high because the hydroelectric dam sends the juice downriver to feed St. Louis. People are nervous about discussions on the board of supervisors about losing the courthouse — Lee County is Iowa’s only county with two courthouses, the other being in rival/twin Fort Madison. The radio station is back on the air thanks to new local owners after going silent for awhile.
People cling to a place. Fort Dodge is coming around after 40 years of hard work when the meatpackers shut down. Dubuque is back on its feet following a pummeling in the 1980s. Storm Lake grows because of immigrants. So could Keokuk. Each of these places need strategic investments from state and federal government, not simply more tax cuts. Everyone talks about housing needs yet a huge Plaza Hotel in downtown Fort Dodge has been home to pigeons for decades.
“We have river, road and rail. We have to forge a new path,” Garcia said.

Carol Hagan McEntee, a South Kingstown Democrat, will become the next chair of the House Committee on Judiciary. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi announced Friday that he is elevating Rep. Carol Hagan McEntee to be the next chair of the panel responsible for shaping Rhode Island’s penal code and judicial system.
McEntee, a South Kingstown Democrat, will succeed Rep. Robert Craven, who announced Oct. 6 that he’s stepping down from the House Committee on Judiciary — and elected office altogether when his term ends following the 2026 legislative session.
Craven bowed out from his committee position after launching a brief run for Rhode Island attorney general that ended in early October amid renewed scrutiny of domestic assault charges from two decades ago.
Craven will remain on the committee, House spokesperson Larry Berman confirmed.
McEntee spent the last five legislative sessions as first vice-chair of the Judiciary Committee, presiding over hearings in Craven’s absence. In a statement Friday, McEntee called her appointment a “tremendous honor.”
“At a time when countless rights are being trampled upon and disregarded, the House Judiciary Committee stands as a crucial line of defense for all Rhode Islanders and that will not change,” McEntee said in a statement. “I look forward to working with other members of the committee and the entire House of Representatives to ensure that the people of Rhode Island are cared for, supported and protected.”
In addition to giving McEntee the chairmanship, Shekarchi has appointed Rep. Jason Knight, a Barrington Democrat running for attorney general next year, from second vice-chair to first vice-chair. Rep. Matthew Dawson, an East Providence, will take over as second vice-chair.
McEntee was elected to represent House District 33 in 2015 and has been a champion of legislation assisting victims of domestic assault and sexual violence. In 2024, she was the lead sponsor of a law that now allows sexual assault victims use a medical forensic exam instead of a police report to qualify for the State Crime Victim Compensation Program.
She was also one of the proponents of the newly enacted law banning the purchase and sale of assault-style firearms starting in July 2026.
McEntee works as an attorney, licensed in both Rhode Island and Massachusetts, at her private practice in Wakefield and Warwick. She is also a former special assistant attorney general in Rhode Island and a former assistant city solicitor and prosecutor for the City of Warwick.
Shekarchi said of McEntee in a statement that he has “no doubt that her dedication and compassion will continue to serve all Rhode Islanders well as the Judiciary Committee.”
“I have the utmost confidence in her ability to lead this important committee,” Shekarchi said. “As one of the House’s leading voices to protect and deliver justice for victims of childhood sexual abuse, she truly understands how this committee helps and protects the people of Rhode Island.”

Sept. 5, 2023. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)With Maine Gov. Janet Mills set to term out after eight years, the field for the November 2026 gubernatorial election is packed with candidates with a spectrum of experience and views. 
Those running as either Democrats or Republicans will first face off against each other in the June 9, 2026 primaries in an effort to win over their base and secure their party’s nomination.
Open to all Maine voters, the primaries will be a ranked-choice ballot, though the general election in November will not. With at least one political heavyweight, Maine Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, opting out of either major political party, it remains to be seen how that could influence Maine’s historically independent electorate.
The field is already crowded with several well known names vying for the Democratic Party nomination, including Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Senate President Troy Jackson, former speaker of the Maine House of Representatives and daughter of a U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, Hannah Pingree, and Angus King III, son of Maine’s independent U.S. senator.
Whoever becomes Maine’s next governor will take the helm for the remaining two years of President Donald Trump’s second term, and will have to navigate massive cuts in funding, the dismantling of federal agencies and programs, and greater pressure on states to conform with his agenda amid increased economic uncertainty.
Here’s the latest on the race for Maine governor.

Maine House Speaker Fecteau backs Pingree for governor


By: Lauren McCauley and AnnMarie Hilton - Friday November 7, 2025 1:44 pm





The Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives announced his top choice for Maine’s next governor.
At the former Biddeford Courthouse Friday afternoon, House Speaker Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford) said he is backing Hannah Pingree in next year’s gubernatorial election.
He said Pingree, who also previously served as the leader of the legislature’s lower chamber and most recently as head of the state’s Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, has the leadership necessary to defend Maine from federal attacks and continue the work the state has done in recent years under a Democratic trifecta.
“As we watch the dysfunction and cruelty coming from Washington, it’s clear that we need leaders that will stand up for Maine people, for the food assistance they need, for the health care every person deserves, for smart forward-looking policies that will protect our state from climate change,” said Fecteau, who was flanked by roughly 20 current and former legislators.
“We need someone who will stand up to the Trump administration and the ridiculous ongoing attacks on the most vulnerable Mainers,” he continued. “Hannah Pingree is that person.”

Former Maine CDC director Nirav Shah joins governor’s race


By: AnnMarie Hilton - Monday October 20, 2025 10:50 am





The doctor who led Maine through the Covid-19 pandemic and later moved to a national public health position is running for governor. 
Nirav Shah announced Monday he will throw his name into an already crowded field of Democrats vying for the Blaine House. Shah was appointed as the director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention in 2019. He held that role until he became principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2023.
“As Maine CDC Director, I saw how we could get through incredibly tough times together with empathy, resilience, and vision,” Shah said in a news release. “I’ll bring those same values as governor to tackle big challenges: the unsustainable increases to the cost of living and housing, an economy that’s not delivering for people, and a rural health care system that’s struggling and will only get worse because of [President Donald] Trump.”

Jonathan Bush, nephew of the late President George H.W. Bush, officially launched his campaign for governor on Wednesday, running as a Republican to replace outgoing Gov. Janet Mills in the 2026 election.
Branding himself as a “disruptor, a job creator and a fanatic Maine optimist,” the health care entrepreneur launched his campaign at the Belfast headquarters of athenahealth, a company he founded in 1997 but was eventually ousted from.
In a launch video, Bush outlined some of the changes he hopes to make as governor, including auditing the government, investing in trade schools and jumpstarting the economy “by getting rid of silly regulations.”
“To change things, I’m going to have to break a few eggs along the way,” he said in the video.

State Rep. Ed Crockett enters Maine governor’s race as independent


By: Emma Davis - Thursday September 25, 2025 5:07 pm





Rep. Ed Crockett of Portland has entered the race for Maine’s next governor. And, he’s the second sitting legislator who has unaffiliated from a political party to run as an independent.
Crockett, who until recently had been a Democrat, announced his intention to run for higher office in an op-ed earlier this summer, in which he condemned what he described as a Legislature “stuck in a morass of partisanship.” Crockett is approaching his eighth and final year serving in the Maine House of Representatives before he’ll be termed out.
That critique echoes why Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, formerly a Republican, similarly said he decided to run as an independent for governor earlier this year
With Crockett in the running, there are now 17 candidates in the open race to replace Gov. Janet Mills, who terms out in 2026. Crockett is the third independent, along with Bennett and John Glowa, a retired environmental specialist.

Another popular figure in Maine is considering a run for governor. 
Dr. Nirav Shah told the Portland Press Herald in an interview Friday that he’s considering entering the race as a Democrat, which would have him joining a field already crowded with well-known players in Maine politics.  
Shah became a household figure as head of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic, holding daily briefings during which he would answer questions and provide updates on the public health crisis. He often appeared alongside Maine officials, including Gov. Janet Mills. 
He told the paper that experience gave him an appreciation for the impact state government can make on people’s lives.
“What attracted me in particular to the governor’s office is the impact you can have in the executive branch,” Shah said.
In January 2023, he was appointed as the principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under former President Joe Biden. Recently, he returned to Maine to launch a public health education program at Colby College, where he is a visiting professor.









Retired DEP employee is third independent to join the race for governor


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Thursday August 7, 2025 5:44 pm





A former longtime state government employee is running for governor as an independent.
John Glowa of South China is the most recent candidate to add his name to the growing list of gubernatorial candidates. So far, 16 people have entered the race, including three independents.
The most prominent of those is State Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, who left the Republican Party earlier this year to announce his run, in addition to Dover-Foxcroft resident Alexander Murchison, according to the Maine Ethics Commission website.
Glowa worked for the Maine Department of Environmental Protection as an environmental specialist from 1987 until 2016, according to his campaign website. He then retired and ran for state representative as a member of the Democratic Party, and then for a seat in the Maine Senate.
He also founded the Maine Wolf Coalition, which advocates for wolf recovery in the northeast, and has accused state wildlife officials of deliberately downplaying evidence of wolves’ presence in the state.

Here are the Republicans vying to replace Gov. Janet Mills next November


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday August 6, 2025 8:04 am





Ben Midgley, a fitness executive from Kennebunkport, on Tuesday officially became the seventh Republican candidate in a crowded race for Gov. Janet Mills’ seat.
Midgley is the latest of 17 officially registered candidates vying to replace Mills, a Democrat who terms out next year. Both the Republican and Democratic primaries, slated for June 9, 2026, are open to all Maine voters. The primaries will be a ranked-choice ballot though the general election for governor in November will not.
Most of the Republican candidates listed on the Maine Ethics Commission website have not held public office at the state level, with the exception of state Sen. Jim Libby (R-Standish). Bobby Charles, a lawyer who served under former Republican presidents, and former Paris selectman Robert Wessels have also been involved in politics in different capacities.
In contrast, the Democratic field is stacked with party leaders, including Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Senate President Troy Jackson, and former Speaker of the Maine House of Representative and Mills administration official Hannah Pingree, among others.
Other GOP candidates, including University of Maine System trustee Owen McCarthy, tout their financial credentials while framing themselves as political outsiders. All seven appear to have varying stances on issues including the economy, education and immigration, but almost all have expressed concern about the increasing cost of living in Maine, which according to a Pan Atlantic Research poll conducted this year was the biggest concern expressed by voters.

Republican Sen. Rick Bennett announces independent bid for Maine governor


By: Emma Davis - Tuesday June 24, 2025 12:03 pm





After decades of public service as a Republican, state Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford announced on Tuesday that he is running for governor as an independent.
“My candidacy is not an indictment of either party,” Bennett told Maine Morning Star in an interview. “It’s an indictment of the party structure and parties as the solution to solving our problems.”
Calling his independent bid liberating, Bennett said he intends to take his message — one of fiscal responsibility — directly to Maine people and not a subset of the electorate, an approach he sees as a return to Maine’s independent tradition.
“I see politics beginning to slide more towards the politics of Washington,” Bennett said, “and I think we have the opportunity as Maine people to say no to that.”

Hannah Pingree officially launches bid for governor


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Tuesday June 10, 2025 7:02 am





Hannah Pingree officially launched her campaign for governor after months of speculation about the candidacy of the former Mills administration official and speaker of the Maine House of Representatives.
She kicked off the campaign with several planned stops around the state on Tuesday, starting with a rally in Rockland, scheduled meetings with local leaders in Lewiston and Biddeford before capping off the day with a celebration in Portland.
Pingree left her role as head of Gov. Janet Mills’ Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, also known as GOPIF, which she held since 2019. The office was created to recommend policy solutions for some of the state’s biggest issues including climate change, housing, workforce development, the opioid crisis and more.

Republican state senator enters race for governor


By: AnnMarie Hilton - Thursday May 22, 2025 12:01 pm





State Sen. James Libby is running in the 2026 gubernatorial race.
Libby, who represents parts of Cumberland, Oxford and York counties, is one of five Republican candidates contending for the Blaine House, according to filings with the Maine Ethics Commission.
The race is already starting to get crowded, with the Democratic ticket drawing notable names including Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who announced her bid in late March, as well as Angus King III, the son of independent U.S. senator and former governor Angus King Jr., who announced his run earlier this month.
Libby is in the middle of his second consecutive term in the Senate, but he has also spent time as a state representative after being first elected to the Legislature in 1992. He also ran in the 2002 Republican gubernatorial primary.

Former Maine Senate President Troy Jackson is running for governor in the 2026 election.
The fifth-generation logger announced Monday that he will join the Democratic primary, saying in a news release from his campaign that “too many Democrats have lost touch with working people or shown they’re not up to the fight.”
“I know what it’s like to punch a clock, live paycheck to paycheck, be treated like I didn’t matter while some billionaire got rich off my back – and how to turn that feeling of powerlessness into action,” he added.

Amid rumors of gubernatorial bid, Hannah Pingree to leave Mills administration


By: AnnMarie Hilton - Thursday May 15, 2025 5:58 pm





Hannah Pingree, who has led efforts on climate and housing policy for the state, will leave her position Friday.
“I’m so grateful to Governor Mills for the tremendous opportunity she gave me to dive into Maine’s biggest challenges and lead work across her administration to chart a path to solutions,” Pingree said in a news release from the governor’s office Thursday.
Though the release didn’t specify what Pingree plans to do next, she said she will “remain relentlessly focused on the future of the state we all love.” The Bangor Daily News has reported that Pingree is expected to throw her hat in the ring for the Democratic gubernatorial primary next year.

A familiar name has entered the race for the Blaine House, as Angus King III has announced his campaign for governor.
The son of independent senator and former governor Angus King Jr. is running as a Democrat in the 2026 gubernatorial election, according to a news release from his campaign. His candidacy paperwork was listed on the Maine Ethics Commission website Tuesday morning.
With multiple other Democrats in the race, including Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who announced her bid in late March, and Kenneth Pinet, King III will first face a primary election next June.

Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows officially announces bid for governor


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday March 26, 2025 7:53 am





Secretary of State Shenna Bellows announced her run for governor in 2026, becoming the first major Democratic candidate to throw her hat in the ring.
During her address early Wednesday at the official launch event at the Hancock Community Center, Bellows said “we need leaders who will meet the moment.”
“Because while we’re paying our taxes or helping our parents measure out their medication, our country is being demolished by a greedy, unelected billionaire who thinks his dollars are more powerful than our voices…Who thinks the value of his stock portfolio matters more than the values of our community.”

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital will have enough money to stay open till the end of the month under a short-term financing agreement between their bankrupt owner and the Rhode Island Attorney General’s office.
The deal approved by a federal bankruptcy judge in Dallas Friday morning attempts to cure what looked like a fatal prognosis a week earlier. Prospect Medical Holdings, the LA-based hospital chain operator, sought court permission to close the safety net hospitals in Providence and North Providence by the end of the year amid delays in the sale to a new owner. 
The $80 million sale of the hospitals to The Centurion Foundation received conditional approval from state regulators in June 2024. Despite multiple revisions to the 85 conditions, the Atlanta-based nonprofit remains unable to secure the $150 million in bond financing needed to close the deal.
Meanwhile, Prospect, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January, continues to rack up losses on the hospitals to the dismay of its many creditors.
The compromise: The state will put up half of the $6 million cost to keep the hospitals operating in November, using money from an AG-controlled escrow account funded by private equity firm Leonard Green as part of its 2021 exit from the hospital ownership group. The remainder of hospitals’ November costs will be put up by Prospect’s legal bankruptcy estate.
“Maintaining access to care is critical for the communities that Roger Williams and Fatima Hospital serve, as well as our statewide health care system,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement Friday. “This temporary funding solution will ensure that until the transfer of the hospitals to new ownership, patients will continue to receive care from the dedicated health care professionals at both facilities.”
The two hospitals offer 500 beds between them, including 104 beds for behavioral health patients, which represents more than one-fifth of the state’s behavioral health beds. They accounted for more 50,000 emergency room visits in 2024 and Roger Williams houses the only fully accredited bone marrow transplant unit in the state. 
Providers and elected officials warn that closing the hospitals and laying off its 2,400 workers would have catastrophic consequences for the state’s fragile health care system.
Neronha was initially reluctant to deplete any of the state’s $51.5 million escrow balance, wanting to preserve the money for daily operational costs once a new buyer takes over, according to court filings. But following a day of in-person negotiations with attorneys for Prospect and Centurion in Dallas Tuesday, Neronha softened. 
If the hospitals close, preserving the hospital fund balance becomes meaningless.
“Rhode Islanders are counting on these hospitals for life-saving care, and the Office is committed to keeping them open,” Neronha said Friday.

House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi in a statement Friday thanked Neronha for his work and attention on a “critical” issue, calling it an “all-hands-on-deck approach.”
The state’s financial contribution won’t be permanent. Under the terms of the agreement, the new buyer will be required to repay Prospect’s estate for the money it is contributing to cover the hospitals’ November expenses, and simultaneously replenish the state escrow account, “or other consideration acceptable to the RI Attorney General.” 
Megan Skinner, a spokesperson for Neronha’s office, said the stipulation is meant to address “a rapidly evolving situation” but did not specify what alternative conditions the AG’s office might impose on a buyer.
“We will keep the public apprised of next steps in this proceeding or any further actions involving the hospitals,” Skinner said in an email Friday afternoon.
Andrew Troop, a New York attorney hired by Neronha’s office to represent the state in the bankruptcy case, stressed the importance of acting quickly during the court hearing Friday.
“What I think everyone is saying very politely is we continue to be off to the races to get to the end, which is a real solution to transfer these hospitals from Prospect to new owners,” Troop said. “Time is of the essence.”
Primed for purchase?  
Centurion appeared for years to be the only interested buyer for the struggling community hospitals. But earlier this week, an alternative option was publicly acknowledged for the first time: Prime Healthcare. 
The California for-profit owns 51 hospitals nationwide including Woonsocket’s Landmark Medical Center. Rhode Island Health and Human Services Secretary Richard Charest, had reached out to Prime within the last couple months to inquire about its interest in buying the hospitals. Charest previously served as CEO and president of Landmark during its bankruptcy and 2013 sale to Prime. 
Noel True, a spokesperson for Prime, confirmed in an email Friday morning that the company’s nonprofit arm, Prime Healthcare Foundation, has begun “rapid assessment” of an acquisition deal at the request of state officials. True declined to provide details on the status of the review.
Otis Brown, a spokesperson for CharterCARE Health of Rhode Island, Centurion’s local subsidiary, did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Friday. Earlier this week, David Wender, an attorney for the foundation, said it may be able to delay bond financing and secure a short-term loan through Bank of America instead, with the goal of closing the sale in early or mid-December.
Chief Judge Stacey Jernigan of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas reiterated her prior frustrations with the delays in closing a deal on Friday morning.
“We’re 10 months into this case now, and as we all know, we had Centurion in place for months, pre-petition,” Jernigan said. “If it’s not going to be them, it’s got to be someone else.”
The United Nurses and Allied Professionals, which represents more than 1,200 union workers across both Roger Williams and Fatima, maintains that Centurion presents the best hope for survival, given that its offer is already on the table. The union is also pressuring a local charitable foundation formerly tied to the hospitals to “return” $6 million in donations to the facilities. CharterCARE Health first asked the unrelated Chartercare Foundation in early October to reimburse the hospitals for donations made before the entities separated in 2014. Its request, backed by state lawmakers, is still pending before the foundation’s board of directors more than one month later. 
An alternate hospital buyer would still need the sign-offs of Neronha’s office and the Rhode Island Department of Health. It took over a year, and multiple failed applications, before Prospect and Centurion secured state regulators’ approval.
An update on the sale proceedings is scheduled for Nov. 18 in Dallas bankruptcy court.

Connecticut does not have the biggest income inequality in the nation, but it ranks among the highest.
The state consistently appears near the top of national rankings for income inequality, often in the top five. According to 2023 U.S. Census data, Connecticut’s Gini coefficient is 0.4989, placing it fourth in the country behind Puerto Rico (0.5338), the District of Columbia (0.5244), and New York (0.5186). The Gini coefficient measures income inequality on a scale from 0 to 1, where higher numbers reflect greater disparity.
The state’s sharp divide stems largely from Fairfield County’s concentration of wealth, contrasted with struggling urban centers like Bridgeport, Hartford and New Haven. While Connecticut’s poverty rate is lower than many states, its top earners make more than 37 times what the bottom 99% earn. This gap fuels deep disparities in housing, education and opportunity, making inequality a defining issue across the state.

(Photo by Lauren McCauley/ Maine Morning Star)The Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives announced his top choice for Maine’s next governor. 
At the former Biddeford Courthouse Friday afternoon, House Speaker Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford) said he is backing Hannah Pingree in next year’s gubernatorial election. 
He said Pingree, who also previously served as the leader of the legislature’s lower chamber and most recently as head of the state’s Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, has the leadership necessary to defend Maine from federal attacks and continue the work the state has done in recent years under a Democratic trifecta. 
“As we watch the dysfunction and cruelty coming from Washington, it’s clear that we need leaders that will stand up for Maine people, for the food assistance they need, for the health care every person deserves, for smart forward-looking policies that will protect our state from climate change,” said Fecteau, who was flanked by roughly 20 current and former legislators. 
“We need someone who will stand up to the Trump administration and the ridiculous ongoing attacks on the most vulnerable Mainers,” he continued. “Hannah Pingree is that person.”
More than 100 current and former state leaders are backing Pingree’s campaign, including former Senate President Mark Eves, former Senate Majority Leader Eloise Vitelli, and current House Majority Leader Matt Moonen, who all spoke at the event.
During her speech, Pingree thanked her friends and colleagues, saying they represent “leaders that know what it takes to govern, to listen and to deliver real results for the people who they serve.”
Late last week, Pingree was also endorsed by a broad coalition of health care providers and two former commissions of the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, Brenda Harvey and Jeanne Lambrew. This came after she published an op-ed in the Portland Press Herald outlining her plan for a public health insurance option that she argues could lower premiums and ensure accountability to patients.
Fecteau and Pingree spoke about the need to address rising costs, especially for housing, so that Maine can continue to be a place people want to live and work. As part of her campaign, Pingree has been on a statewide housing tour to identify solutions for the state’s housing shortage and affordability challenges. She plans to make stops throughout western Maine this month, including Rumford, Bethel, Norway and South Paris.
Pingree, who is the daughter of 1st District U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, will first face a crowded primary with plenty of name recognition in June. Other Democrats vying for the Blaine House include former Senate President Troy Jackson, current Secretary of State Shenna Bellows and the son of one of Maine’s U.S. senators, Angus King III.
The gubernatorial primary will be ranked-choice, though November’s general election is not. Asked if he would be making other endorsements, Fecteau said that if this were the NFL draft, Pingree would be “his top five picks.”

Ned Lamont to file papers today to run for third term,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/07/ned-lamont-governor-third-term/,"Ned Lamont, a Democrat who has left no question of his intention to run for another term as governor, still plans a formal public kickoff.","Gov. Ned Lamont is filing papers Friday that will make him an official, if still unannounced, candidate for governor, an anticlimactic start to a campaign for a third term as Connecticut’s 89th governor in 2026.
Lamont, 71, a Democrat who had left no question in recent months of his intention to run while lining up a manager and a campaign consultant, still plans a formal public kickoff, a spokesman said.
The creation of a campaign committee is a step allowing Lamont to begin making expenditures and accepting contributions, though the independently wealthy governor has largely self-funded his previous campaigns.
By state law, he will be a candidate the moment his papers are filed with the State Elections Enforcement Commission. 
Lamont said at a press conference Friday that there would be more details about the plans for the campaign next week.
“[Lt. Gov.] Susan [Bysiewicz] and I are ready to go,” he said.
Asked why they waited so long to file, Bysiewicz said they were waiting for municipal elections to end.
“We had some really impactful municipal elections, and we’re glad they’re over with,” Bysiewicz said. “The people of Connecticut have spoken very loudly, and now we can think about what’s next.”
Lamont backed into his campaign for a second term with a similar filing Nov. 8, 2021, though he initially confused reporters then by saying the filing “facilitates” his getting into a campaign, but he’s got to “make up my mind formally in the months to come.”
Bysiewicz quickly clarified they were running at the time.
On the form he is filing Friday, Lamont must choose if he once again will opt out of the state’s voluntary system of publicly financing campaigns.
The public grants for a gubernatorial race are $3.2 million for a primary and $15 million for the general election. Lamont spent $15.1 million on his 2018 campaign and $25.7 million on his 2022 reelection.
Lamont could face a primary. Rep. Josh Elliott, D-Hamden, opened a gubernatorial campaign over the summer, saying the governor is too conservative on taxes and spending.
The contenders for the Republican gubernatorial nomination are Sen. Ryan Fazio, 35, of Greenwich and Mayor Erin Stewart, 38, of New Britain. Fazio opened his campaign in August, and Stewart has been raising money through an exploratory campaign committee since January.
“Gov. Lamont’s first eight years in office have seen Connecticut’s electricity rates rise to the third highest in the nation and our economic growth plummet to fourth worst in the country,” Fazio said in a Friday press release. “Two terms are more than enough.”
Connecticut, which has no term limits, is one of only 13 states that allow a governor to seek three consecutive terms. Over the summer and into the fall, Lamont had been a running a soft campaign, holding events publicizing the state’s fiscal stability and economic growth. 
A month ago, he acknowledged in an interview he soon would have to have to shift to outlining a third-term agenda.
“You can’t sit around and talk about the past,” he said. “That’s for damn sure.”

The state’s final ResilientCoasts plan, unveiled on Thursday after a draft strategy was released earlier this year, calls for such a program to be stood up within three to five years, once a study currently underway is completed.  
Talk of a statewide buyout program has been bubbling up from the shores of coastal communities battered by storms — and bedeviling state and local officials who recognize the economic risks posed by increased flooding resulting from a warming planet but balk at the political and logistical hurdles of roping off sections of shoreline property for human living.  
Now, those tradeoffs are set to ramp up as the state pursues the buyouts, a form of managed retreat in which people, buildings, and infrastructure are relocated from hazardous areas. 
“There was a lot of enthusiasm for this as an option during our public engagement process,” Deanna Moran, chief coastal resilience officer at the state Office of Coastal Zone Management, said in an interview in Chelsea where the plan was announced. “It really does come down to both community choice and also individual choice. It’s a voluntary program, so the homeowners who want to participate are the ones for which it would be available.” 
Other states, like New Jersey, have established buyout programs to keep residents out of harm’s way and allow them to relocate with some free will and with payments resembling the fair market value of their homes — before the seas swallow up what is for many people their largest investment.  
Doing so, however, isn’t cheap. Massachusetts will likely need to confront a hefty price tag if it is to help make residents whole who are living on eroding cliffs in Nantucket or in low-lying flood-prone areas in Marshfield or Winthrop, for instance. And forbidding development on certain properties or moving people away from their homes could also disrupt the local tax base. 
“That’s one of the things that we’ll be looking at in the study,” Moran said. 
Still, all of it may be worth it to avoid the economic consequences of sky-high insurance rates and communities upended as a result of the encroaching ocean.  
Every $1 invested in resilience and disaster preparedness can yield up to $13 in cost savings, according to the report, which was prepared by the state’s Office of Coastal Zone Management. And the state could experience over $1 billion in coastal property damage each year by the 2070s, the report found.  
“Sitting around doing nothing is going to cost more than taking action,” said Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Rebecca Tepper.  
Massachusetts will now be forced to confront these and other thorny issues.  
The plan also calls for the state to adopt flood risk disclosure requirements so that would-be homebuyers and renters are aware of the property’s potential flood risks — something that Gov. Maura Healey proposed in her environmental bond bill but could face resistance from the real estate industry. Massachusetts is one of just 14 states not to require flood disclosures.  
The plan establishes 15 coastal resilience districts ranging from Cape Cod to the Boston Harbor Islands to Buzzards Bay and the North Shore, assessing in each the number of structures exposed to flood risk and shoreline type from coastal dunes to salt marshes. Since 2000, Massachusetts has spent $194 million in coastal resilience investments, with the dam and seawall repair and removal program accounting for $66 million in spending.  
But no one expects the scope and scale of past investments to come close to matching the need. “New sources of revenue from a variety of stakeholders including local, state and federal governments and private property owners are needed to meet the full scale of the challenge,” the report said. 
The plan also proposes a statewide home elevation grant or loan program to assist low-income homeowners, incentivize municipalities to prioritize development in higher-elevation areas, prepare guidance for insurance companies to offer discounts for homeowners that undertake resiliency efforts, and give municipalities the authority to raise more money for coastal projects. 
The state’s vision outlined in the new plan is a big lift. So is the harm if sea level rise projections come to pass. 
“People always need to eat,” said John Lucero, general manager of the Chelsea-based New England Produce Center, the largest privately owned terminal market in the country. “That’s why it’s so important to protect this area from flooding. The problem is getting worse. An interruption in service would be absolutely devastating to the region, our economy and the health of 9 million people.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0338-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-07 14:01:55.079404

The site is the most significant site at Chaco Canyon National Historical Park, which Pueblos and advocates say remains under threat from continued oil and gas development, and worry protections could by scaled back by the new administration. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)In a letter Thursday, New Mexico’s congressional delegation continued exhorting U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to change course on plans to rescind federal protections around Chaco Culture National Historical Park.
In 2023, under the Biden Administration, the federal government issued Public Land Order No. 7923, banning further oil and gas development on federal lands within 10 miles of the historic site for 20 years. Advocates celebrated the move, as did numerous tribal governments, as the area around Chaco Canyon holds paramount spiritual and cultural significance for numerous tribes and pueblos.
The delegation’s letter follows an Oct. 30 letter from the U.S. Interior Department to pueblo and tribal governments, announcing that BLM would be considering a revocation of  the land order creating the buffer.
New Mexico’s congressional delegation also issued a statement last week condemning the Trump administration for seeking to remove the protections. Native activists also referenced the threats to Chaco during a protest over forthcoming oil and gas lease sales in the Greater Chaco landscape held Wednesday at the Bureau of Land Management’s Santa Fe office. The delegation also introduced legislation last spring to try to make the buffer zone permanent.
In their letter Thursday, all five members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation, all of whom are Democrats, noted they have been in ongoing communication with Burgum since his confirmation regarding the importance of protecting Chaco Canyon.
“We have invited you to follow in your predecessors’ footsteps and visit New Mexico to conduct robust Tribal consultation and community outreach before taking any action on the existing mineral withdrawal around Chaco,” the letter says. “Tribes are sovereign governments, and you have a legal trust obligation to Tribal leaders to operate with the highest responsibility and trust, which is not reflected by your expedited actions and unclear directions.”
The letter also contends the National Historic Preservation Act requires the Interior department to consult with tribal governmentsin order to consider how the agency’s “actions will affect historic properties.”
“Chaco Canyon is a sacred cultural landscape central to the identity of Tribes throughout New Mexico. The value of this living landscape does not end at the park boundary,” the delegation writes, concluding that “your legal and moral responsibility as trustee to these Tribes requires your direct attention and involvement in this issue and for meaningful engagement with the Tribes before any action is taken.”
At least 10 pueblo governors went to Washington D.C. in September as part of a week of advocacy to press for protections for Chaco.

On Oct. 2, 2025, the Iowa Board of Veterinary Medicine issued an emergency order indefinitely suspending the license of veterinarian Jerry Couchman, 80, who practices in and around Appanoose and Decatur counties.
At the time, the board charged Couchman with five counts of violating laws and administrative rules governing veterinary medicine, and alleged his conduct posed an immediate danger to the public health, safety and welfare.
According to the board, the disciplinary charges stemmed from a report received from a drug distributor alleging Couchman had been ordering a significant amount of xylazine, which the board describes as “a powerful non-opioid sedative commonly mixed with fentanyl for illegal drug use,” as well as ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic with hallucinogenic effects that is categorized as a controlled substance.

The board says it then reviewed Couchman’s drug purchasing records from several drug distributors and determined that between January 2024 and June 2025, Couchman had purchased approximately 1,545 50-milliliter bottles of xylazine, plus 1,128 10-milliliter bottles of ketamine.
On July 7, 2025, the board served Couchman with a subpoena for his veterinary records. According to the board, Couchman responded to the subpoena for his drug log by providing a copy of “a handwritten document created in response to the subpoena that contains some, but not all, of the information required by Iowa’s rules.” Couchman also refused the board’s request that he identify all of his clients, the board alleged.
The board charged Couchman with knowingly assisting a person in unlawfully practicing veterinary medicine; failing to properly document and prescribe controlled substances and prescription drugs; failing to keep adequate records; dispensing controlled substances and prescriptions in cases where he had no valid veterinary-client relationship; and dispensing drugs used by laypersons to provide unlicensed veterinary medical services.
The board also charged Couchman with failing to comply with the requirements of an investigatory subpoena from the board, which the board says impeded its ability to investigate the matter.
Board: Couchman lacked records to support his claims
According to board records, Couchman attempted to explain the “large quantities of ketamine and xylazine” he purchased by asserting that he used the drugs for surgeries on dogs. The board noted that Couchman owned a kennel with approximately 70 bulldogs and also provided veterinary services for other kennels that had 1,100 bulldogs and other mixed-breed dogs.
According to the board, Couchman claimed he also provided the drugs to various dog-grooming services, which he allegedly said might number “anywhere from 1,500 to 2,000 per year,” and claimed to have used the drugs for the neutering or castration of roughly 1,200 to 1,500 horses per year, which would equate to an average of 23 horses per week.
The board alleged Couchman failed to provide records corroborating those claims.
On Nov. 4, 2025, Couchman and the board agreed to resolve the disciplinary case with a settlement agreement that calls for Couchman’s license to be suspended for nine months, after which it will be placed on probationary status for three years.
Couchman must also pay a $3,000 fine and meet at least once with a practice monitor to discuss the settlement agreement and the circumstances that led to the disciplinary action. In addition, he must complete 10 hours of educational training related to controlled substances, veterinary ethics and recordkeeping.
Couchman declined to comment on the case when contacted by the Iowa Capital Dispatch on Friday.
State and federal records indicate Couchman has done business with two Iowa dog kennels accused of “puppy laundering” — a practice that involves a repeat violator routing dogs to an associated kennel that’s operating under a different license so the animals can be sold in jurisdictions that ban the retail sale of dogs from repeat offenders.
In December 2023, a federal inspector from the U.S. Department of Agriculture visited a dog-breeding kennel, in the Van Buren County town of Cantril, that is on property owned by Steve Kruse, one of Iowa’s largest dog breeders. The kennel was operating under a license held by a Kruse associate, Wuanita Swedlund.
The inspector cited the kennel for a number of violations, some of which were tied to the death of six puppies that appeared to have died due to a lack of shelter from the cold.
State records indicate the attending veterinarian for the business at that time was a “Dr. Couchman” who had not “examined dogs or been available when needed.” Board records indicate Jerry Couchman is the only licensed veterinarian in Iowa with that last name.
After the inspection, state officials instructed Swedlund to hire a new veterinarian.

Nov. 6, 2025. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. “Are we ready to fight for our democracy?” asked Brian Kelly, vice president of a midwestern chapter of the American Federation of Government Employees, to a room of about 50 people on Thursday night in Lansing.
The group gathered at the Plumbers and Pipefitters Local 5405 hall for a panel hosted by Michigan’s 7th Congressional District Democratic Party on impacts of the Trump administration’s policies on local residents. 
One focus of the panel was the impact of layoffs of federal employees — a key piece of the administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE — in Michigan. 
Andrew Lennox, a 10-year Marine Corps veteran living in Hamburg Township who was fired from an administrative position at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, said that he was notified of his layoff in a late-night email in February. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“We’re saving money to help veterans, by firing veterans,” he said. 
Though Lennox was eventually re-hired, he criticized the government providing limited resources — including mental health resources — to veterans being laid off, who already face higher rates of suicide. 
“We risk our lives to further the American ideals. Not that this is a perfect place, but that we can work towards something perfect, that we have the tools and the resources to do it. And then you come home, and that image of truth and justice is just thrown out the window,” Lennox said. 
“The MAGA playbook is to fire, intimidate and harass federal employees,” Kelly added.

Unlike Lennox, Nicole Rice, a former researcher with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Great Lakes Environmental Research Lab in Ann Arbor, did not get her federal job back after being laid off. 
She warned of the bigger environmental impacts that could happen without teams like the one she was laid off from. 
“There’s about 100 employees right now who are scrambling to try to figure out how to continue their research,” Rice said. “Decades of research are sitting inside of that building. Data is being turned off. Satellites are being turned off.”
“We are in the world’s largest freshwater system,” she added. “We are in a vital resource that is becoming more and more scarce across the world.”
“What kind of talented people want to work in a place where you’re not sure if you’re going to get an email?” Lennox continued, noting that VA hospitals train a large proportion of medical professionals — and without job stability, it will harm the health care industry overall. 
But the impacts of federal policies go far beyond layoffs in the 7th District, panelists said.

Mark Zacharda, a third-generation farmer in Shiawassee County, said that the Trump administration’s tariff policy has harmed his family’s farm — specifically their soybean crop, in which China had previously been a major trading partner prior to retaliatory tariffs going into place. 
“Farming has, for a long time, not been a super profitable industry, especially for a smaller scale or mid sized farmer, as we are, but we were getting by for a long time,” he said. “But the past few years, we certainly have been operating in the red, and that’s in no small part, because of the Trump administration policies in the first one, and certainly now in the second one.”
Zacharda noted that many essentials for farming — from fertilizer to replacement parts on machinery —have seen prices more than double because of tariff policies. As for the idea of bringing that manufacturing back to the U.S., he said that globalization has made it a different market than it was half a century ago. 
“This is a modern world,” he said. “Things have shifted. We can’t just snap our fingers and bring all this stuff back, even though we would like to see more here.”
Peggy Vaughn-Payne, executive director of the NorthWest Initiative in Lansing which works towards food access and re-entry services for folks coming out of prison, said that her organization’s staff was more than halved after elimination of funding for Americorps and other jobs programs. She also lost around $300,000 in federal grants from funding cuts. 
“We’re hurting, and we still have people who come to us and call us every day, every week for services,” she said. 
But as much as she said that has impacted her own finances — cutting her own hours and salary, while also trying to keep providing services — Vaughn-Payne said that her heart goes out to the community members losing access to SNAP benefits.

Liam Richichi, chair of the 7th Congressional District Democratic Party, noted early in the panel that the party had extended an invitation to the district’s representative, U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte), who was not present. 
Zacharda also criticized Barrett’s lack of responsiveness to constituents, especially constituents across the aisle from him. 
“Tom Barrett was elected to represent us here in the seventh congressional district, we’re supposed to be able to appeal to him,” he said. “That’s where Tom really dropped the ball, because you’ve got to be listening to everybody.”

McIver wants judge to threaten Trump admin with sanctions,Nikita Biryukov,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/briefs/lamonica-mciver-trump-posts-trial/,Attorneys for Rep. LaMonica McIver argue the threat of sanctions is needed to keep federal officials from making prejudicial posts about her case.,"Attorneys for Rep. LaMonica McIver argue the threat of sanctions is needed to keep federal officials from making prejudicial posts about her case. (Photo by Jemal Countess/Getty Images for MoveOn)Attorneys for Rep. LaMonica McIver asked a federal judge to threaten sanctions to block the Trump administration from making any more statements about McIver that could affect her upcoming trial.
McIver’s filing, made on Thursday, is the latest salvo in a battle over how U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials have described the conduct of three New Jersey congress members during an unannounced inspection of Delaney Hall, an immigrant detention facility in Newark, in May. McIver (D-10) is accused of assaulting federal agents during that visit.
“DHS has slow-walked the removal of clearly prejudicial statements, issued new ones, and continued to maintain others on its website,” McIver attorney Lee Cortes said, adding that absent a court order McIver must continue playing whack-a-mole over federal officials’ statements about her.
‘Supposed assault’ at center of charges against NJ congresswoman

U.S. District Court Judge Jamel Semper last month ordered the administration to remove a series of posts made to the Department of Homeland Security’s X account that said McIver and Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-12) and Rob Menendez (D-08) stormed the facility during their May visit.
Body camera and other surveillance footage released in discovery show Delaney Hall officials let the House representatives into the facility for an inspection.
Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (in tan coat) and Reps. LaMonica McIver and Rob Menendez enter a gate to visit Delaney Hall in Newark on May 9, 2025.
The three-count indictment against McIver alleges she assaulted federal officers during a scuffle outside Delaney Hall. McIver has pleaded not guilty.
McIver argues the charges are politically motivated and the prosecution is selective. The court heard arguments over McIver’s motions to dismiss the case on those grounds last month, though Semper has yet to issue a ruling.
McIver’s Thursday letter notes some prejudicial statements about her remain online despite Semper’s order that they be removed, including a May Department of Homeland Security press release that accuses McIver and others of “storming Delaney Hall” and a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement social media post that says McIver “attacked ICE officers.”
The letter also notes that Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman, is quoted in an October Politico article saying Democrats are no longer able to “storm ICE facilities.”
McIver’s attorneys argue the statements are part of a pattern meant to prevent fair trials in criminal cases. U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche has told Semper his office has had trouble getting the Department of Homeland Security to remove posts deemed prejudicial to McIver.
At least one judge has issued an order that threatened sanctions on similar grounds. Last week, U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw filed an order warning federal officials could face sanctions if they continue to make prejudicial statements about Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who administration officials have repeatedly claimed is an MS-13 gang member.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota Supreme Court Chief Justice Jon Jensen has announced he will step down as head of the court when his term ends this year.
Jensen will continue serving as a justice.
“The position of Chief Justice, for me, has not been about a title, it has been about service and making our judicial system as great as it can be,” Jensen told the North Dakota court system in a Wednesday letter. “It has been an honor to serve.”
Jensen was elected chief justice in December 2019 and reelected to another five-year term in 2020. 
In his letter, Jensen highlighted accomplishments but did not cite a reason for not seeking another term. He said one of his priorities as chief justice was growing resources for state district courts.
Jensen noted that the court system has added three new judges and 29 full-time employees under his tenure. District court judge salaries have also gone up by $30,000 since 2021, he added.
The chief justice is selected by a vote of the five North Dakota Supreme Court justices and state district court judges.
Jensen’s predecessor as chief, former Justice Gerald VandeWalle, led the court from 1993 until he decided not to seek another term as chief in 2019, citing his age. VandeWalle retired from the North Dakota Supreme Court in 2023 for health reasons.
North Dakota voters generally elect state Supreme Court justices for 10-year terms. In Jensen’s case, he was appointed by former Gov. Doug Burgum in 2017 to fill a vacancy on the high court left by former Justice Carol Ronning Kapsner, who retired. Jensen was then elected to a 10-year term on the court in 2020.

Democratic candidate for the 7th Congressional District William Lawrence announced his endorsement Thursday by Track AIPAC, noting he was 100% free from donations made by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobbying group. “This campaign will not be taking any AIPAC money and in Congress, I will be a voice and a vote for Palestinian rights,” Lawrence said in a social media post.
On Wednesday, former Maryland Governor and former commissioner of the Social Security Administration Martin O’Malley endorsed Haley Stevens in her bid for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate.
Meanwhile, fellow U.S. Senate candidate Abdul El-Sayed on Thursday announced the endorsement of Bay City Commissioner Chris Runburg.

 
Announcements

Former Michigan House Majority Floor Leader Abraham Aiyash (D-Hamtramck) has filed paperwork to run for Michigan 1st Senate District seat, currently held by state Sen. Erika Geiss (D-Taylor), who cannot run in 2026 due to term limits. Also in the running for the Democratic nomination is Justin Onwenu, who is Detroit’s first director of Entrepreneurship and Economic Opportunity.
Former state Rep. Ryan Berman (R-Commerce Township) on Monday announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination for Michigan’s 13th State Senate District, currently held by state Sen. Rosemary Bayer (D-West Bloomfield). Bayer is not seeking reelection and has endorsed Oakland County Deputy Executive Sean Carlson for the Democratic nod.
Waterford School Board Trustee John Paul Torres has announced he is seeking the Democratic nomination for Michigan’s 11th Congressional District seat, currently held by U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), who is running for U.S. Senate. Torres joins a Democratic field that already includes state Sen. Jeremy Moss (D-Bloomfield Township), Sterling Heights attorney Aisha Farooqi and former Ford Motor Co. engineer Don Ufford, also of Bloomfield Township.

 



Also of note
A poll released on Sunday showed Democrats Bridget Brink and Matt Maasdam, each running for the nomination in Michigan’s 7th Congressional District, leading the incumbent, U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) in head-to-head matchups.
“Despite little name ID for either challenger, they both start out with 4-point leads,” Jim Williams of Public Policy Polling stated in a release.
While Brink led Barrett 45-41 points compared to Maasdam’s 43-39 lead over Barrett, Williams noted that would increase by two points once voters heard more about Maasdam’s background as a former Navy SEAL. Brink saw a one point bump when respondents learned about her background as the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.

When directly pitted against each other, however, the poll found 42% said they prefer Maasdam’s background as a combat veteran and local small businessman, while just 14% said they prefer a career State Department diplomat.
To no one’s surprise, Brink’s campaign used the poll to emphasize her lead in a straight matchup against Barrett as well as her fundraising lead, while Maasdam’s camp touted his biographical advantage as well as dominance with respondents who didn’t support Kamala Harris in 2024.
The Democratic primary, set for Aug. 4, 2026, is just under 9 months away.

The task force charged with assessing State University System efficiencies released a 26-page report that found the University of Central Florida, the school with the largest enrollment, had the lowest cost to produce a degree from start to finish at $46,548, while New College of Florida had the highest at $494,715. New College has the fewest students in the state university system.
Presented to the Board of Governors, the report said the cost of university operating expenses per degree is the “key metric for measuring overall institutional efficiency.”
Universities’ annual operating expenses per student across the system increased from $16,792 in 2017-2018 to $22,217 in 2023-2024, or nearly 25%, not accounting for inflation. The report cites increase in payroll and labor costs as the main cost drivers.

The report tracks the universities’ success in getting students into jobs. For purposes of the report, job placement is defined as those who within a year of graduating with a bachelor’s, earn more than $40,000 annually or are in graduate school.
It found that New College of Florida has the lowest placement rate at 65%, followed by Florida A&M University with 70%. Conversely, Florida Polytechnic University ranks highest in the report for job placement with 81%, followed by University of West Florida with 80% and University of Florida with 79%.
FAMU graduates had the lowest median starting salary in the SUS at $45,800. The next closest is New College at $46,100. Florida Polytechnic had the highest at $66,800, followed by University of Florida at $58,200, each school with emphasis on science and technology. 
There were 657,000 applications to attend Florida universities in 2024, a 41% increase from 2018 when 466,000 students applied.
In 2023-2024, 27% of students took out student loans. That’s compared to 40% of students in 2017-2018.  Tuition did not increase.

The University of Florida had by far the most research revenue generation during fiscal year 2024, with $2.03 billion. The next closest was the University of South Florida at $612 million.
“Really good insight and information, a lot for the universities to take in and consider and note that the BOG also is taking this quite seriously and we know there’s a chance to get better here,” Board of Governors chair Brian Lamb said during the meeting at University of South Florida.
The report is an attempt to bring transparency to the SUS given about two-thirds of the $5.8 billion SUS budget is paid by state dollars. Student tuition accounts for just $2 billion.
New College of Florida spending called into question

The report also stems in part from a dispute between BOG member Eric Silagy and New College of Florida President Richard Corcoran. Silagy claimed New College was spending more than $91,000 annually to educate each student while Corcoran said it was $68,000 annually.
The report’s findings weren’t lost on Silagy Thursday.
“Thank you for your team’s work on this, for pulling together the data, so there can be really no question anymore about what the numbers really are and that’s not an excuse anymore,” Silagy said, a reference to his prior math disagreements with Corcoran.
The report recommended that universities improve budget and financial reporting and suggested requiring universities to track and report on “key metrics.”
New College questions
In September 2024, Silagy questioned the financial future of New College. 
Those questions rose again during the board’s January meeting this year. 
During that meeting, Vice Chair Alan Levine acknowledged during his tenure on the board, balance sheets and other financial metrics were not actively reviewed. He suggested putting together “a more transparent scorecard of university finances and some of the metrics that we look at in terms of cash management and things like that.”

In February, Gov. Ron DeSantis called for a “deep dive” into state universities and looked to eliminate spending that decision makers deemed unnecessary. 
Florida DOGE to ‘deep dive’ into state universities, ‘prune’ ‘ideological study stuff’

“This is the DOGE-ing of our state university system,” DeSantis said in February during a news conference in Tampa announcing the audit. “And I think it’s going to be good for taxpayers and it’s ultimately going to be good for students, as well.”
The report Thursday did not include detailed information about particular programs.
In other business
Also during the BOG meeting, governors extended University of Central Florida President Alexander Cartwright’s contract for another year, through the end of 2026. 
The BOG will vote on University of North Florida President Moez Limayem’s move to be president of University of South Florida during its next meeting. 
SUS Chancellor Ray Rodrigues said he will provide an update on DeSantis’ call to “pull the plug” on H-1B visas in January.
Regarding the safety summit last month, following the shooting at Florida State University, stakeholders recommended universities identify doors without locks and plan to “address these vulnerabilities” and “address rooftop access to ensure these areas are secure.” That comes after Charlie Kirk was killed on a college campus in Utah. His alleged assassin was on a rooftop of an academic building. 
The recommendations also focused heavily on communication protocol in times of emergency. 
Lastly, Lamb did not seek another term as chair of the board. Levine was voted chair for 2026 and Tim Cerio voted vice chair.

The state legislature then committed $300,000 in COVID relief funds for an “HVAC training agency” in May 2022 — at McCrory’s behest, one top state official said.
That money was never spent and was eventually returned to the legislature. But McCrory’s orchestration of the plan — and Cicero’s involvement in the discussions — fit a pattern.
Since 2020, records show, McCrory pushed for Cicero and her companies to receive several state grants for education initiatives, economic development programs and other projects. 
Not all of those efforts paid off, but in the span of a several years, Cicero’s businesses went from unknown entities to organizations that netted millions of dollars in taxpayer money.  
It’s not uncommon for state lawmakers to assist their constituents or to direct them to state agencies for help. But McCrory’s work on Cicero’s behalf could be problematic if the two were in a personal relationship, as federal investigators are looking into. 
Cicero did not respond to text messages or emails for this story. McCrory, who has served in the legislature for two decades, also did not answer questions that the CT Mirror sent to him over the course of several days.
McCrory answered a phone call from the CT Mirror on Thursday, but the state legislator said he was too busy to answer questions about the meetings he arranged between Cicero and the commissioners in 2022. 
Gov. Ned Lamont’s policy director at the time, Jonathan Dach, was included on emails regarding the meetings among his cabinet members and McCrory, but a spokesperson for the governor declined to comment for this story on Thursday.
When Lamont was asked at a press conference on Wednesday about the federal corruption probe targeting McCrory, he said people should let the investigation play out. 
“I think this thing is under investigation,” said Lamont, a Democrat who is preparing to announce a campaign for a third term as governor. “Let’s see how things sort out over the course of the next few months.” 
The emails from early 2022 show McCrory repeatedly contacted the commissioners of the state Department of Labor and Department of Administrative Services, as well as the state Office of Workforce Strategy, asking them to work with Cicero and the Minority Construction Council on the HVAC program. 
“I’m respectfully requesting another meeting, as soon as possible, to discuss the direction of the program as a follow to the last meeting you held with SHEBA Consulting and Minority Construction Council,” McCrory wrote to the commissioners in April 2022. “It is imperative that we address the effectiveness of our current apprentice programs as it relates to racial equity and diversity.”
The emails also show that McCrory wanted to be included in all of the discussions between Cicero, Little-Greer and the state agencies. And he found an ally in Michelle Gilman, the commissioner of the Department of Administrative Services, who in the emails appeared eager to help advance his cause. 
Gilman told the other commissioners that the HVAC training program was a “priority” for McCrory, who has served as the chairman of the legislature’s education committee for several years. 
At that time, McCrory was also negotiating with Lamont’s administration over whether the state should spend hundreds of millions of dollars upgrading the HVAC systems in Connecticut schools following the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Gilman, who oversees the state’s school construction grant program, explained that McCrory wanted to create some type of pilot program to make sure minority contractors were capable of securing some of that future work. 
And that is where SHEBA and the Minority Construction Council would come into play, Gilman explained. 
“What I’d like to ask for is your help in discussing options for a pipeline program pilot or connecting the Minority Contracting Council and SHEBA to the trades/education sector to discuss workforce training and growth,” Gilman wrote to the other agency heads in early April, 2022. 
The CT Mirror contacted Little-Greer, the head of the Minority Construction Council, this week to ask how she became involved in the discussions about the HVAC training program with McCrory and Cicero. 
“I wanted to discuss a program. They’re not discussing,” Little-Greer said, referring to Cicero and McCrory. “We’re the Minority Construction Council. It was a program I wanted to get implemented, and I still want to get it implemented.” 
Little-Greer then refused to answer further questions about why Cicero was looped into the meetings, and she asked whether the CT Mirror reporter had money for her to start the HVAC training program. 
“Do you have money that I could implement it?” she asked before ending the phone call. 
Danté Bartolomeo, the state’s labor commissioner, participated in at least one of the follow-up meetings with Cicero and Little-Greer, but she later explained to McCrory that her agency, while involved in apprenticeship programs, did not directly run them. 
“Please remember that CTDOL does not place apprentices in (registered apprenticeship programs), nor do we hire instructors,” Bartolomeo wrote. 
In a separate email, Bartolomeo told Gilman that she and Todd Berch, the state’s apprenticeship director, had numerous connections in the construction trades. But she said she had never heard of SHEBA or the Minority Construction Council. 
“I don’t know Jennifer Little-Green (MCC ED) and Sonserae Cicero (SHEBA CEO),” she wrote. 
The emails show Kelli-Marie Vallieres, the state’s Chief Workforce Officer, was more amenable to the proposal that McCrory was putting forward. 
Vallieres told her staff she was frustrated that she wasn’t more informed about the proposed training program during the first meeting with McCrory in March. 
The Office of Workforce Strategy was a relatively new agency at the time. It was only officially recognized by the legislature the previous year. And Vallieres and her staff said they were eager to become “the go-to agency for workforce development.” 
As a result, Vallieres told Gilman that OWS might be able to create a “pre-apprenticeship program.” And she said that “could attract workers into this field with a ladder to a full apprenticeship.” 
But Vallieres’ staff expressed concerns, as well.
Niall Dammando, her chief of staff, noted that the office might want to avoid anything to do with the state’s school construction program, which at the time was the subject of another federal criminal investigation.
“This might be an area that we want to stay away from. School construction is super politicized,” Dammando wrote, adding that he would reach out to Lamont’s office for advice. 
It’s unknown whether Lamont’s office provided guidance to the staff at OWS and the other agencies. But the emails show that Vallieres continued to schedule meetings with Cicero and Little-Greer as the legislative session wound down. 
Before one of those meetings, Vallieres was informed that Cicero’s company was also partnering on another state grant application for $5 million. And they debated whether she should continue to hold meetings with Cicero on the HVAC program. 
Vallieres decided to keep the lines of communication open, however. 
“Let’s keep this meeting,” she told her staff. “It is focused specifically on a request from Sen McCrory on attracting more minorities to HVAC careers.” 
Vallieres told the CT Mirror that McCrory was responsible for directing the $300,000 that eventually was sent to her office. 
But she said the federal funds were never spent because McCrory didn’t explain his intentions for the money and because her small staff didn’t have the capacity to run another program at the time.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0530_SR_Session_058-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-07 11:58:58.575442

As of Friday morning, the Secretary of the State reported that 788,511 of 2.18 million registered Connecticut voters had their votes counted — either after showing up to the polls on Tuesday, during early voting or through a mail-in ballot. With 99.85% of precincts reporting, 2025 voter turnout was nearly four percentage points above 2021 municipal election turnout.
While the results for this year’s municipal election resulted in a “blue wave,” flipping 29 Connecticut towns and cities to Democrat control, voter turnout for the Democratic primary earlier this year was nearly 3 points below Republican primary turnout. Historically, fewer Democrats have showed up to the polls during primaries than Republicans.
Despite higher voter turnout this municipal election cycle, in some of the state’s most populated areas, less than 10% of eligible voters cast a ballot.
Hartford and Bridgeport saw some of the lowest turnout numbers state-wide, with less than 5% voter turnout in Bridgeport and less than 7% voter turnout in Hartford.
In Hartford, the only races on the ballot were for school board candidates. But in Bridgeport, there were city council races for various districts as well as school board and city sheriff races.
This was the first municipal election with early voting after a law was passed in 2023 creating a system of early voting rules. The law requires 14 days of early voting for general elections.

(Photo by Cami Koons for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Joseph Rupnick, chairman of the Prairie Band Potawatomi Tribal Council, is disappointed that the recently formed Kansas water task force does not include any Native American representation.
He said so at the group’s Monday meeting.
“We asked for that position when this committee first started,” Rupnick said during testimony.
But the 16-member task force contains only legislators and legislatively appointed members, none of them representatives from any of Kansas’ four federally recognized tribes.
As Kansas navigates water quality and quantity issues and plans for the future, the state’s Native populations don’t have a seat at the table.
The task force has met five times in rotating locations across the state since its creation through legislation that passed in April, hearing about water quality and quantity issues. It must submit a preliminary report by the end of January and a final report to the governor and the Legislature by the end of January 2027. The document will guide water policy and funding priorities.
There should be Native representation on the task force, Rupnick argued, because of the Winters doctrine, which ensures reservations are vested with the water rights necessary to support tribes’ activities on a reservation.
Rep. Ken Rahjes, an Agra Republican, responded to Rupnick’s concerns, saying if everyone who wanted a seat at the table received one, the task force could fill an arena.
“This is the size that we came up to,” he said
Rahjes, who said he wrote the bill that created the task force, vowed not to limit debate or conversation.
“Just because you don’t have a seat here,” Rahjes said, “doesn’t mean you’re not listened to and being taken care of.”
 
Maximizing sovereignty
The Prairie Band Potawatomi’s goal is to become water sovereign, Rupnick said.
That would involve creating its own water source and treatment plant and factoring in local, state and federal interests. Rupnick highlighted Native water rights, which predate the state of Kansas and have been strengthened through courts and legislation over the past century, as key to understanding how a tribe could become water sovereign.
One way to achieve that goal is with federal action creating a settlement meant to resolve water rights disputes The payments could then be used to create water resource infrastructure on tribal land.
One Kansas tribe, the Kickapoo, is currently negotiating to obtain a Congressionally recognized water rights settlement. It’s at step two in a four-step process.
Tribes must go through pre-assessment, pre-negotiation and negotiation before reaching a settlement and subsequent implementation.
“The federal negotiating process is decades long,” said Stephanie Zehren, special water counsel to the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation.
Of the United States’ 584 federally recognized tribes, 39 tribes — largely in the northwest and southwest — have sanctioned water rights through Congressionally or administratively approved settlements.
“That leaves the vast majority unquantified,” said Zehren. “The fact that a water right is not quantified does not change the fact that it exists.”
Tribes inherently have water rights, Zehren said, which often precede any existing rights. But the federal process is a major undertaking that requires time and money. Often, navigating the checkerboard of governance, which includes tribal, state, municipal and federal jurisdictions, is the best available option for urgent needs.
Government-to-government relationships are much more effective “because we are hamstrung by how much progress we can make,” said Missty Slater, chairwoman of the Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska.
She said the tribe would like to continue its partnership with other governments, including the task force and the state of Kansas, “so when the water comes to us, we might have less work to do to improve its quality.”
Slater said the tribe has taken proactive measures to improve water quality, including treatment, testing and a transition to regenerative farming, which reduces the need for water treatment.
“We are committed, as water is sacred, to doing what we can to make sure all of our water is the highest quality,” Slater said.
Both she and Rupnick said their tribes were considering pursuing a federal settlement.
“I cannot commit to anything right now,” Slater said, “but we are exploring that, as it would maximize our tribal sovereignty.”
Sen. Michael Fagg, an El Dorado Republican, asked earlier in the meeting how much land in Kansas is tribal and didn’t receive a definitive answer. In many ways, tribal land extends beyond the bounds of a reservation, Rupnick said.
Zehren later said that tribes need to be factored into the task force’s work regardless of what percentage of Kansas land is tribal.
“Trying to suggest that in order to protect and preserve these rights in the future requires a quantification is fairly offensive,” she said

The committee has yet to vote on Robert Chamberlin and James Maxwell, both nominated by Trump in August to fill open federal judge positions in Mississippi’s Northern District. Both are current justices on the Mississippi Supreme Court. 
The committee also has not taken up Trump’s nominations in early July of Scott Leary and James Kruger, his choices for U.S. attorney for the Northern and Southern districts of Mississippi, respectively. Leary declined to comment. None of the other three nominees responded to a request for comment. 
The committee must vote to advance the nominees before the full U.S. Senate can consider them. The committee has met several times, including on Thursday, and has not voted on the nominees. 
The committee cancelled its Oct. 23 executive business meeting entirely when the four men were the only nominees the committee was to consider that day.
A spokesperson for Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley told Mississippi Today that the delay in advancing the Mississippi nominees out of committee is unrelated to the nominees themselves. 
“They’re caught up in a dispute between on-committee and off-committee senators,” the spokesperson said. “The chairman will plan to advance them when the issue is resolved.”
Most judicial nominees receive committee votes within a couple of weeks of their confirmation hearings, depending on the Senate schedule. The delays involving the Mississippi nominees are unusual because the committee has repeatedly delayed voting on them without explanation.

Housing prices in the region have increased 72% since 2017. (Photo: Getty Images)A government shutdown that lasts beyond November would be “incredibly harmful” to efforts to provide safe and affordable housing to the nation’s most vulnerable citizens, U.S. Rep. Alma Adams (NC-12) said Thursday.
The record-breaking government shutdown has already been “devastating” for citizens who have trouble accessing healthcare and food assistance or paying rent, Adams said.

“We’re talking about thousands of residents who will not be receiving the essential rental assistance payments that they’re due and unhoused people will not receive the housing support that they need,” said Adams, adding that she hopes the shutdown doesn’t go beyond next week.
Adams noted the threats the shutdown poses to U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) rental assistance programs such as Housing Choice Vouchers, Projects-Based Rental Assistance and public housing. Citizens who receive such assistance are expected to have rent paid through November.
But assistance from HUD will come more slowly due to Trump administration-ordered firings and furloughs, Adams said. Since January, roughly 2,300 HUD employees have been laid off, she said, and staffing at HUD’s Fair Housing Office has been “significantly reduced,” which gives citizens less recourse to address housing discrimination.
“People who need that kind of support from those agencies, will continue to face delays in receiving the services, because if you go into an agency and you fire half the people, then the people who are depending on getting access to services, they don’t have access to a person who can help them, so that becomes a problem as well,” Adams said.
She said Congress must come together and pass a bipartisan solution to the problem, because “people need housing, people need health care and we’ve got the resources to take care of both.” 
The congresswoman made her remarks during the final installment of her “Charlotte Matters” webinar series, which was put together to discuss how the government shutdown is impacting Charlotte and the rest of North Carolina. Previous topics included healthcare, education and hunger. 
Adams said President Donald Trump is being dishonest when he says there’s no money to provide America’s most vulnerable citizens decent housing, health care and food assistance.
“You’ve got money to send $40 billion over to Argentina or some other place,” Adams said. “You’ve got money to tear down half of the White House to put up a ballroom.”
Housing, health care and hunger are not partisan issues, Adams noted.
“It’s about being human and everybody needs a decent, affordable place to live,” she said.
 Skyrocketing rents, increasing evictions 
Karen Pelletier (Photo: Screenshot from housing webinar)
Adams was joined by a panel of housing experts and advocates for people experiencing homelessness.
Karen Pelletier, division director of Housing Innovation and Stabilization Services for Mecklenburg County, said the county has been able to help cover rents for about 200 households that receive HUD subsidies.
“We’ve been able to provide that support and continue to pay the salaries of staff that are also federally funded,” Pelletier said. “And so what this shutdown has created is great stress in the community between staff that are wondering when those payments are going to run out, landlords wondering when the rent payments are going to stop.”
She said individuals with long histories of homelessness, seniors, children and other vulnerable citizens who live in subsidized housing programs are now at risk of losing housing because of changes to HUD policy.
O’Shauna Hunter, director of Housing Solutions for A Home for All with the United Way of Greater Charlotte, noted that the Charlotte area has more than 2,000 people who are unsheltered . Evictions are increasing and rents are skyrocketing, she said.

Hunter said more resources are needed to ensure homelessness is “rare, brief and non recurring.” 
“We need case management and support to those who are on their journey to housing stability,” Hunter said. “We need efforts to prevent people from becoming unstably housed or losing their housing, and then we need the production of more housing and all types of housing.”
Latonya Agard, executive director of the North Carolina Coalition to End Homelessness, said she’s concerned about Trump administration plans to end funding for Housing First initiatives, which prioritize providing permanent housing to people experiencing homelessness.  
Latonya Agard (Photo: Screenshot from housing webinar)
“This is the program that works, the evidence is there, and it is distressing to know that the current administration is deciding not to fund Housing First programs and then to turn to other programs that really do place more obstacles, rather than abilities to help in front of people,” Agard said.
Adams began the housing webinar discussing housing issues in Charlotte, which she said is one of the greatest challenges facing the city. That was true, she said, even before the Trump administration’s “reckless federal cuts to housing and the government shut down.”
She noted that 157 people move to Charlotte-Mecklenburg everyday, which has placed pressures on the region’s housing supply.
“We simply are not building enough housing to meet our housing demand and this, of course, has led to housing prices skyrocketing in the Charlotte region,” Adams said. 










Housing prices in the region have increased 72% since 2017, compared to 41% nationally.


“Charlotte is experiencing a significant rise in gentrification as a result, pushing out residents of historically Black working-class neighborhoods, because they are some of the only affordable locations in our city,” Adams said.
Adams said corporate home ownership continues to be a serious problem. In 2023, 26% of all single family homes in Charlotte were owned by large corporations, she said.
“I believe a home should be a place for you to start a family, build your life, but unchecked corporate housing ownership is really making that less and less attainable for Charlotteans,” Adams said.
She noted that she introduced the American Neighborhood Protection Act to address the problem of mass corporate ownership of housing.
“My bill requires any corporation that owns more than 75 single family homes to pay an additional $10,000 per home annually,” Adams said. “These funds would be placed into a housing trust fund for down payment assistant grants to families who are purchasing homes.”
The law would lower housing costs, increase housing supply and provide financial assistance for families looking to buy a home and start their lives, she said. 
“As Charlotte navigates our housing issues, the government shutdown and federal cuts made this year are only worsening the problems facing our residents,” Adams said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1496483184-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-07 11:58:58.575442

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Bill DeLong knows first hand that people’s beliefs can evolve. Describing himself as a “recovering Republican,” tears welled up in his eyes as he described how after someone close to him came out as gay, he thought, “Wait, have I been on the wrong side this whole time?” 
So when the Biddeford resident heard about U.S. Senate candidate Graham Platner’s controversies, he was initially worried. But now he feels reassured by how the political newcomer has handled it, viewing the fact that Platner has taken responsibility and apologized as a welcomed rarity in politics. 
The daily headlines about the sexist, racist, homophobic and other offensive statements unearthed from Platner’s Reddit history and the candidate’s now-covered tattoo that resembled a Nazi symbol — a connection he denied knowing until recently — may have led many looking from afar to believe that his quick rise was coming to an end. Some of Platner’s opponents in the Senate primary race, former state officials and members of Congress outside of Maine have called for him to drop out. 
But Maine Morning Star’s conversations with left-leaning Mainers across the state show a more complicated picture.
That’s not to say everyone is convinced to back Platner, a 41-year-old from Sullivan who was recruited by labor unions and community groups to run against long-time Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican. But for people like DeLong, who is still entertaining other options, Platner’s past doesn’t change how he’s evaluating his candidacy. 
“People have a past, and the purity politics that the Dems play really irks me,” DeLong said. “The other side doesn’t play by the rules.”

DeLong was one of more than 700 people who turned out on Nov. 2 to an event Platner headlined in Portland, a joint effort to also rally voters against a state referendum that sought to change election laws. Platner, an oyster farmer and veteran, has continued to draw crowds to his town halls and other public events since the controversies have come to light: more than 500 spilling into an overflow room in Ogunquit on Oct. 22, the day he announced he’d covered his tattoo, more than 700 in Damariscotta less than a week later, and a packed house at a 300-capacity theater in Bath Thursday evening. 
The first public polling of the race, based on surveys taken while the revelations were being reported, showed Platner as the frontrunner, with wide margins over Gov. Janet Mills — a candidate DeLong said he’s not considering. 
“I’d like to see politics more in the hands of younger generations of people. It’s not working right now,” he said. If elected, Mills, 77, would be the oldest incoming freshman senator in history. 
Many Mainers said their frustration was only heightened by the fact that Platner’s controversial past came to light shortly after Mills entered the race. Mills is backed by the Democratic establishment in Washington, D.C., and while she’s gained a progressive persona nationally for standing up to President Donald Trump, the governor is known as a moderate Democrat among Mainers. 
While Platner continues to turn out crowds of defiant supporters, conversations beyond those hubs also show there are still Mainers who barely know his name. That includes Democrats and independents who will shape the primary outcome in June, and also Republicans, some who are already certain they’ll be voting for Collins.
Regardless of how they feel about Platner at this moment, Mainers said they want those “from away” to back off. 
“We take care of our own business,” said Freeport resident Phil Moen, a staunch supporter of Platner. “We’ll handle this one, thank you very much. Washington need not apply.”
A story of redemption 
Mainers who remain supportive of Platner painted his story as one of redemption, echoing how Platner’s strategist is approaching the controversies, knowingly or not. 
The first two people in line to hear Platner speak at Portland’s State Theatre last weekend, Dale Stephenson and her husband Frank Smith of South Portland, said they had no reservations about continuing to show up for him. 
“I needed to question this notion of: Is he authentic or not?” Smith said. “When I heard his responses, I mean, he owned what happened. He dealt with it honestly. He didn’t misdirect or obfuscate, and I think that says a tremendous amount for an individual, especially politicians.”
Stephenson said of his past Reddit posts, which spanned Barack Obama’s presidency into Joe Biden’s, “He was much younger then. He’s been honest and owned up to the things that he’s done and felt remorse for. You’ve got to respect that. I don’t hold it against him.”
Some Mainers said regrettable online comments and thoughtless tattoos may be par for the course if Maine wants to elect someone who hasn’t been a more calculated career politician.
“Everyone has skeletons,” Phil Moen said. “There are things that I did at that age that I was certainly not happy about and not proud about.”
His wife, Cathy Moen, chimed in, “Thank God we lived before the internet and social media.”

Adding to anecdotal evidence in Maine, a Democratic win in Virginia in the Nov. 4 election may suggest the party is in a post-cancellation era, as Politico put it. Virginia voters selected Democrat Jay Jones for their attorney general despite his scandal of sending violent text messages about political rivals. 
Some of Platner’s past Reddit posts suggested violence is necessary for political change. In one, he wrote, “an armed working class is a requirement for economic justice.”
Platner has attributed many of his past comments to disillusionment after his time serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, which Cathy Moen brought up when defending the candidate. 
“How dare someone criticize somebody with the military background that he has, the things that he saw,” she said. 
Outside the polls after casting votes in the Nov. 4 election, several voters told Maine Morning Star they already knew their next vote would be for Platner in the Senate primary in June 2026. 
“Everyone has a history,” said Doug White, a Democrat from Poland. “In the current presidency, nothing’s off the table.”
Although, White said he is concerned about the turnover in Platner’s staff. Several have resigned since the controversies came to light, including his national finance director Ronald Holmes III who said he felt his “professional standards” were “no longer fully aligned with those” of Platner’s campaign.
Gabby Riggieri, an independent from Oxford, said she isn’t writing Platner off because she believes people can be a product of who they are surrounded by.
“When you’re around other people, you might feel differently,” Riggieri said. 
That’s the story Platner himself has told, specifically when it comes to his past use of anti-gay slurs, which were among the most recent of his Reddit comments between 2016 and 2021, after his military service but during his time as a military contractor in 2018. 
“These were words that I used for a long time in ways that I did not take seriously,” Platner told The Advocate, which first reported those posts. “Because of personal relationships that I’ve developed over the years, I do not use [them] now and find [them] to be quite offensive.”
Not all are convinced 
Others don’t think voters should accept Platner’s offensive comments. 
Jordan Wood, the only gay candidate in the Senate race, called for Platner to resign. Wood previously told Maine Morning Star he thinks the worst thing the Democratic Party can do “in the opposition to Donald Trump is somehow give permission to looking lightly on what I believe are both offensive and threatening symbols and words.”
Other high profile LGBTQ people in Maine politics have also been critical of Platner.
Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford), the youngest and first openly gay person to serve in the position, weighed in with an Instagram story, pointing out that Platner deleted his Reddit comments before launching his bid “because they were considered a liability.”
“It is on us as primary voters to determine how much or how little we care about this liability he tried to avoid anyone knowing about,” Fecteau wrote in the post, which disappears after 24 hours. 
On Facebook, former State Treasurer Henry Beck wrote that voters should care about it. “If Graham Platner was a Republican, so many of us would be protesting in the streets for his resignation,” he wrote.
In another post, Beck said he’s not interested in excusing Platner’s past comments because he knows people who fought in the same wars, and “they all seemed to have known better and had better self-awareness, restraint and a genuine caring for fellow men important in their life who happened to be gay.” 










People have a past, and the purity politics that the Dems play really irks me. The other side doesn’t play by the rules.


– Bill DeLong of Biddeford


Mills said she “vehementally disagrees” with Platner’s past comments and “abhorrent tattoo,” but hasn’t said he should drop out. 
“What he should do in the future is not my business,” she said. “It’s up to the people.”
When Politico asked Platner’s strategist Morris Katz if he should have weighed Platner’s online history differently before launching the campaign, Katz essentially echoed Mills’ statement. 
“I think these decisions should be made by voters and not ‘What do five a*****s in D.C. think is disqualifying and not,” Katz said. “Because I think if we’ve learned anything from having lost the White House, lost the Senate, and lost the House, it’s that maybe the people who’ve been in these positions of power don’t have the greatest read in the world on what voters care about.”
Sophie Creamer, a 25-year-old who has organized for LGBTQ+ issues in the state, wants Platner to explain how and why his views changed over time to assure voters that he doesn’t still harbor any of those beliefs.
An independent absentee voter who grew up in Brunswick and now attends college in Massachusetts, Creamer first spoke with Maine Morning Star shortly after Platner’s campaign launch at his Labor Day rally with Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders. Then, Creamer said they feared he could be another John Fetterman, the plainspoken former steel town mayor who has walked back his progressive stances since Trump was reelected.
“I’m feeling a little wary about this rural white man,” Creamer said of Platner when Maine Morning Star followed up recently. “I don’t know his experience. I don’t know who he is as a person, but with the recent controversies, I just feel more — what’s the right word — frustrated? No. On the fence, I suppose.” 
But Creamer isn’t entertaining other candidates. Through their work in state-level organizing, Creamer has closely followed Mills as governor and disagrees with many of her stances, including her opposition to closing the state’s youth prison and piecemeal approach to tribal sovereignty. “I don’t agree with her more reformist tendencies,” Creamer said. “I’m definitely more radical.”
If it comes down to Platner and Mills, Creamer said they’d vote for Platner. Dresden resident Alfred Beattie, a registered Democrat who leans more left, is considering the opposite. With Mills, he said he knows what he’s going to get. 
Beattie, a music teacher and freelance sound engineer, also heard Platner speak at the Labor Day rally. After that, he said he had thought his mind was made up. He liked that Platner didn’t speak like a politician and understood the average working person’s struggles. 
But when Maine Morning Star followed up with Beattie after the controversies came to light, he said, “I’m not looking forward to the amount of work that I’m going to have to do” to decide who to vote for.
Beattie found some of Platner’s past comments to be “pretty deplorable stuff,” he said, but he left space for redemption. “I’m not seeing it as a collapse of Platner’s character,” he said. For him, the offensive posts and tattoo underscored just how “green” Platner is.
Beattie is considering other candidates, such as Wood, but he said he may ultimately back Mills. “She’s been through the ringer,” Beattie said. “She knows how to deal with this kind of stuff. He doesn’t have any experience.”
In Beattie’s view, he said, “What we need to change anything right now is just a Democratic majority.”

Is the movement bigger than the person?
Platner’s candidacy is not just about flipping the Senate for the Democrats, or beating Collins, so he’s said. 
“We are going to build power again with working people,” Platner said at the Nov. 2 rally in Portland. “We are going to build power again in our communities.”
That’s already started. 
While Platner headlined the event, it was organized to rally people against Question 1, a referendum Maine voters ultimately rejected days later that sought to require identification at the polls and remove several means of absentee voting. 
In the lead up to the Nov. 4 election, volunteers, including those who signed up at that event, canvassed under Platner’s campaign against the referendum. According to his campaign, they contacted more than 40,000 voters during more than 2,000 canvassing shifts all over the state.  
While Platner often repeats that the extent of his political career was serving as harbormaster of Sullivan, he has years of experience in grassroots organizing, previously leading efforts through a local progressive political group called Acadia Action. 
As Phil Moen waited for Platner to take the stage, he said Platner’s past is not what he or others should be focused on.
“It absolves people from actually thinking about the issues,” he said. “We can’t do that anymore.”
Beyond Question 1, Platner also used his speech to call on the crowd to support food assistance since the federal government withheld payments during the government shutdown. 
“The federal government is not going to show up and save food banks in Maine, not now. We’ve got to do something vastly different in our politics before that happens again,” Platner said. “We need to make up the difference.”
Food donations were collected at the event for the food hub on Preble Street and monetary donations for the Midcoast Hunger Prevention Program, Platner announced to a cheering crowd, also urging people to continue to support their local food banks. 
“Hopefully, in all of this work,” Platner said, “we are going to learn that we all need each other, and that it is in each other, it is in the people of Maine that we are going to find the energy, we are going to find the time, we’re going to find the solidarity to build the power we need to change politics in this country.”
Phil Moen said if another candidate were to come out with a more enticing message than Platner, he’d pay attention, “but that’s a high bar.” 
His wife, Cathy Moen, echoed him, “That’s a high bar.”

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)We may think of a government shutdown as something that happens in Washington, with gridlock between legislators, press conferences on the U.S. Capitol steps, and federal agencies grinding to a halt. But after more than a month of the federal government lacking operating funding, the impact is no longer confined to images from the District of Columbia.
The effects of this shutdown are reaching into every New Hampshire community and altering our state’s economy.
First, the federal government shutdown is hitting many Granite State workers directly in their wallet. For thousands of Granite Staters, the shutdown isn’t a distant debate; it results in a missed paycheck. About 9,100 federal jobs are based in New Hampshire, and those jobs paid close to $1 billion in wages last year. Even when paychecks stop coming, bills and other expenses don’t.
Second, the shutdown has already put a key resource for thousands of Granite Staters at risk. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, helps approximately 76,000 New Hampshire residents buy groceries each month. That’s about one in every 19 people in the state and includes 26,000 children. But as of Nov. 1, those benefits ended as previously transferred federal funds for the program ran out. The impact of this disruption to food assistance is being felt in rural areas in particular, as nearly two-thirds of New Hampshire’s SNAP recipients live outside the state’s five most populous communities.
Finally, with a prolonged federal government shutdown, the strain can spread through the state’s economy. The impacts of missed paychecks don’t stop at household budgets. A federal worker who can’t afford gasoline or groceries means one less customer at a small business.  SNAP dollars move quickly through New Hampshire’s economy: an estimate from 2021 indicated the economy missed out on the approximately $1.61 in economic activity for every dollar in SNAP spending. When SNAP spending stops, it doesn’t just hurt families — it impacts local grocers, farmers, food suppliers, and other Main Street businesses. Uncertainty can be a drag on economic activity, as families pull back on spending, and businesses hold off on hiring. The result is slower growth and fewer opportunities.
While the federal government shutdown centers around Washington, the impacts are felt in every state in the country, including right here in New Hampshire.
In 2024, the federal government awarded $14.8 billion in contracts, grants, and direct payments for work and services in New Hampshire, or the equivalent of about 12% of the state’s entire economy. Federal funds support child care, housing, transportation, public health, and education among other critical services. When that federal support becomes unreliable, New Hampshire has to either pick up the slack or risk weakening or stopping key programs, potentially leaving thousands of Granite Staters further behind.
Even when the federal shutdown ends, federal support may not be as reliable going forward as previously assumed. To keep our families and economy stable, lawmakers could build more fiscal resilience so that critical programs and local economies can withstand future external shocks.
A government that is able to serve Granite Staters in a reliable manner, even if resources from Washington are unreliable, can offer greater certainty for the state’s economy and residents.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/capitolsunsetsept302025-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-11-07 10:59:09.491231
,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-11-07 15:47:40+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Half of Holyoke’s middle school students started the year at a new school. The other half were ‘left behind.’,Hallie Claflin,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/education/half-of-holyokes-middle-school-students-started-the-year-at-a-new-school-the-other-half-were-left-behind/,"In 2019, Holyoke set out to build two new middle schools. But after months of heated debate, the ballot measure to fund the project was voted down by the community. Some say the outcome is a testament to how limited fiscal capacity, insufficient state funding, and local tax constraints work to prevent Gateway Cities from building equitable, modern school fac[...]","ON AUGUST 25, over 500 middle school students in Holyoke filed into the newly built William R. Peck Middle School – the first new public school built in the city since 1989 – to start their first day of classes.  
The facility’s modern amenities – a science lab stocked with 3D printers, a media center with a library that will soon be filled with books, and a new fitness center – are providing learning and enrichment opportunities to kids in one of the state’s most disadvantaged school districts, where nearly 84 percent of students are low-income and 90 percent are considered high-need. 
The expansive courtyard, newly constructed classrooms, large windows, and wide, spacious hallways are just some of the brand-new building’s features.

“There’s a sense of pride that kids have when they walk into Peck. Like, ‘Oh my god, my community cares about me,’” said Anthony Soto, interim superintendent of Holyoke Public Schools.  
But as those students enjoy a state-of-the-art facility, the other half of the district’s middle school students aren’t so lucky. Instead, they file into Clare P. Sullivan Middle School, a building constructed in 1961 that was originally built as an elementary school. 
In 2019, Holyoke set out to build two new middle schools for all of the students to replace their dated facilities. After months of heated debate, the ballot measure to fund the project was voted down by the community, and the city was forced to continue with the construction of just one school – all they could afford. Some say the outcome is a testament to how limited fiscal capacity, an insufficient state funding formula, and local tax constraints work to prevent Gateway Cities like Holyoke from building equitable, modern school facilities. 
But many community members and local officials also argue that racial bias has long prevented the city from investing in its public schools, and it wasn’t the first time property tax overrides have been divisive for the community.  
Former superintendent Stephen Zrike, who led the district at the time of the 2019 debt exclusion, lamented the fact that only half of Holyoke’s middle school students ended up in a new building.

“I’m sure it creates inequities that I know many people in Holyoke would like to see addressed,” Zrike said. “All those kids deserve the state-of-the-art schools that more affluent districts have around the state.” 
The Massachusetts School Building Authority’s 58 percent reimbursement rate for the 2019 construction plan for two new middle schools fell short of the 80 percent guaranteed in state law. The city’s anticipated contribution of $54 million for the nearly $130 million project required an increase in local property taxes. The total cost of the new Peck school was $85 million, with the MSBA ultimately reimbursing 68 percent of project expenses.  
The state has generally failed to meet the 80 percent contribution outlined for urban districts, which have, on average, received a smaller share of their statutory reimbursement rate than suburban districts, according to an October report by the MassINC Policy Center. (The MassINC Policy Center is part of the same organization that publishes CommonWealth Beacon.) The report also found that wealthier districts accounted for a disproportionate share of school building projects approved by the MSBA over the last decade.

Proposition 2½, a 1980s-era state law asserting that property tax levies in cities and towns can’t rise faster than 2.5 percent per year, ultimately required the city of Holyoke to go to local voters to approve or reject a debt exclusion – a temporary increase in the tax levy that allows a city to borrow for a specific capital purpose – to fund the construction of both schools in 2019. The measure was defeated by a two-to-one margin. 
City officials, school leaders, and some residents assert that decades of racial bias and poor perceptions of Holyoke’s public schools played a role in the failed debt exclusion. More than 81 percent of students in the district are Latino, and less than 11 percent of its middle school students met or exceeded expectations on statewide MCAS exams in 2025.  
“There might have been, over the course of our history, some institutionalized and structural racism involved in the disinvestment in our school district,” Mayor Joshua Garcia said. 
A Proposition 2½ override vote in 1992 similarly caused controversy in Holyoke. The proposed tax increase for schools failed, while increases for other city departments passed.  
“Our schools are becoming predominantly Hispanic, and we’re seeing these kids get out of school – for the most part, they’re not doing anything,” a Holyoke police officer said during a 1992 news segment. “The people that are paying the bill are not Hispanic and are looking at it saying, ‘Why should we be paying to have some kids that can’t even speak English when they get out of school?’” 
Three decades later, local leaders say not much has changed.  
“This stuff that you heard back then you still hear today. Voting down those two buildings is when it reared its head again,” Soto said. “You have that loud minority that’s saying, ‘Why do we have to build schools for these kids?’”

While overall voter turnout was just 29 percent in the 2019 local election, the two highest-income wards in Holyoke had the largest turnout at 40 percent and 46 percent. Both wards voted the measure down by three-to-one and two-to-one margins.  
More than 400 students per year have been opting out of the Holyoke school system through school choice, according to the district. The students who leave are far more likely to identify as white and far less likely to identify as low-income. Those students most often choose to attend Easthampton Public Schools, where two new school facilities have been built.  
“In Holyoke, there’s a lot of homeless families, there’s a lot of families who are renters … These folks are recent arrivals, they’re immigrants. But those kids deserve a brand-new school as much as anybody,” Zrike said. 
Latasha Hinton, a mother of two middle school students in Sullivan, said her children feel left behind, and have asked if they can attend the new Peck school.  
“For a kid, it kind of feels like, ‘How come we don’t deserve the same thing?’” Hinton said. “They didn’t do anything to not deserve to have everything that is in that new middle school. They kind of feel like they don’t deserve it, and they want to know why.” 
The school library in Sullivan had to be converted into classroom space – a key learning feature Hinton said her daughter misses out on. The hallways are narrow, and other amenities are dated. The school was built for elementary school students, meaning building features like the cafeteria stage are smaller in size.

Hinton wasn’t surprised when the plan to build two schools was voted down. She even considered leaving the district like other families did, she said. 
The city, in partnership with the MSBA, has spent millions in the last few years on repairs and upgrades to Sullivan, including new windows, doors, roofing, and heating and cooling systems. The district has also made efforts to provide more amenities at Sullivan, such as an outdoor basketball court. But some have argued that investing in dated buildings that already don’t meet modern needs may not be the most efficient use of public funds.  
“If we wanted to do a complete renovation project for this school through the MSBA to bring it up to code, it would cost just as much money as tearing it down completely and building brand new,” Soto said of Sullivan.

According to the MassINC report, Gateway Cities have been significantly underrepresented in the MSBA’s Core Program, which distributes large grants to help districts build new schools or fully replace or renovate existing buildings. The authority approved Core Program awards for an average of 17 projects each year between 2008 and 2024 – a pace that would take nearly 50 years to rebuild all 276 high-need schools in Massachusetts. 
“There’s huge risks in not investing in the … program that the MSBA has,” Zrike said. “That was a concern we had all along – that it didn’t matter what you did to Sullivan or any other school. It wasn’t going to provide the same facility that a brand-new school would provide.”

The MSBA’s funding is tied to sales tax revenue growth, which has not kept pace with the rising cost of school construction in Massachusetts. State law also places a cap on the authority’s borrowing authority, which was raised to $1.2 billion in the 2024 state budget. 
Five of Holyoke’s 11 schools received low building condition ratings in a 2016 MSBA survey, yet just one has been rebuilt since then.  
Without “more money in the pot,” school leaders like Soto are skeptical that the MSBA can keep up with the need for modernized buildings in Gateway Cities like Holyoke. Tweaking the formula to require 80 percent reimbursement in urban districts without increasing the MSBA’s overall spending authority would only further limit the number of projects they can fund, he said.

Debt exclusions and overrides aren’t easy to pass in low-income cities like Holyoke with limited room to generate tax revenue, and as construction costs have soared following the pandemic, Zrike estimates it has become even harder. Even in a world where Proposition 2½ didn’t exist, Soto said Holyoke would still be between a rock and a hard place. 
“If it goes to a vote, it won’t be successful, and if it didn’t have to go to a vote, and it was just a mayor’s choice, at some point families are going to move out of Holyoke because they can’t afford it,” he said. “It would still be an increase in in taxes to the local community who doesn’t have much.” 
The district has struggled with staff retention, which Soto believes better building conditions could help solve.  
“A community investing in those spaces I would imagine has an impact on a teacher being like, ‘I want to work here and stay here,’” Soto said. “That has an impact on student outcomes.”

School conditions also matter to parents deciding which districts to send their kids to, Zrike said. Desegregating the urban district and increasing enrollment depends on its ability to build facilities that families want to choose.  
“The building doesn’t teach kids directly, but I do think it sends really important messages to kids and families about how much a community values education,” Zrike said.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/outside-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-07 10:59:09.491231

The program started the month without funding due to the ongoing federal government shutdown. A federal judge last week ordered the executive branch to resume at least partial benefits. On Thursday, the same judge directed the President Donald Trump administration to fully fund the program for November.

“We know how important these benefits are to families and individuals across North Dakota,” Interim Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Pat Traynor said in a Thursday evening announcement. “Our team has been working diligently to update systems, recalculate benefits and ensure households receive their adjusted benefits as quickly as possible.” 
The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services is distributing partial benefits to the roughly 28,000 North Dakota households on SNAP based on a formula set by the federal government that funds the program at 65%.
Under that formula, some households will receive less than their typically monthly benefit and some will receive no funding, according to the agency.
The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services acknowledged in the Thursday announcement that the formula could soon change given the judge’s recent court order. 
The agency said it is “prepared to comply with any new federal guidance from the USDA pending the outcome of ongoing court proceedings and once systems are updated.”

North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong last week announced the state had granted $915,000 to the Great Plains Food Bank to address food insecurity amid the funding distribution.
The federal government is now also fully funding the Women, Infants and Children program for November. North Dakota had previously planned to use $600,000 in Department of Health and Human Services general fund money to sustain the program through the month if no federal money was available.

Oct. 15, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — State Sen. John Cavanaugh picked up two more endorsements from local unions in his bid to be the Democratic nominee in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District.
The two endorsements came from the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen and the Nebraska State Legislative Board and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. This brings Cavanaugh’s union endorsements to six.
Cavanaugh is in a six-person Democratic primary race with business owner and political action committee co-founder Denise Powell, Douglas County District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades, Navy veteran Kishla Askins, former congressional staffer James Leuschen and Evangelos Argyrakis. 
The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen chairman, Adam Hausman, said Cavanaugh “has consistently stood up for organized labor and advocated for rail safety.”

“John has been a true friend of labor and consistently fights for workers,” said Hausman, “Labor can trust him to keep his word and do right by us.” 
Cavanaugh has also received endorsements from seven current state lawmakers and Bob Kerrey and Ben Nelson, who served as Nebraska governors and U.S. senators. Rhoades received an endorsement from Omaha Mayor John Ewing 
Rhoades has announced the endorsements of three local unions and said she is working to get more by year’s end.  
Powell has received endorsements from an influential abortion-rights group, former Omaha State Sen. Tony Vargas and two state lawmakers. 
The Omaha-based 2nd District is typically competitive. But Democrats are feeling optimistic about picking up a win in the midterms, when the out-of-power party typically gains ground, especially with Republican U.S. Rep. Don Bacon retiring.
Cavanaugh said he has “stood with labor and working people in the legislature and will do the same in Washington.”
Cavanaugh, in a statement, said, “I promise that I won’t just be at your union hall during election season, but will show up and listen to you at every turn.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-07 15:21:49+00:00,CT Mirror,"New housing bill cuts requirements in favor of opt-ins, strikes ‘fair share’",Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/07/hb5002-replacement-special-session-new-bill/,"The replacement for HB 5002, which Lamont vetoed in June, uses opt-in measures and incentives for more housing and strikes 'fair share'","This story will be updated.
After months of negotiations, the governor and state lawmakers have reached compromise on a new version of sweeping housing legislation, which they’re expected to take up in a special session next week.
The replacement for House Bill 5002, which passed the legislature in June but was then vetoed by Gov. Ned Lamont over the summer, uses opt-in measures and incentives to push municipalities to allow more housing — rather than the requirements included in the previous version of the legislation. It also strikes a provision known as “fair share.”
Lamont is expected later today to announce the details of the new bill and call a special session for next week to pass it, among other measures.
A summary of the bill obtained by the Connecticut Mirror says municipalities can choose between three options to allow more housing. They can sign a contract with the Connecticut Municipal Development Authority, zone for more housing near train and bus stations or develop what’s called a housing growth plan, according to a summary of the bill obtained by The Connecticut Mirror.
Selecting one of these three options makes towns eligible for new state funding.
Towns can sign contracts with the Connecticut Municipal Development Authority and develop plans to increase housing in downtowns or near train and bus stations. The authority was established in 2019, funded in 2024, and started work earlier this year.
They can also opt to participate in what’s known as Work, Live, Ride, which pushes towns to allow more housing density near train and bus rapid transit stations. It’s a concept more broadly known as transit-oriented development that has grown more popular nationwide over recent years.
The summary also says towns can create housing growth plans by working with their councils of government or on their own. The plans have to be approved by the Office of Policy and Management.
If towns choose not to create these plans, they are not eligible for temporary pauses from being sued by developers whose affordable housing plans are denied under statute 8-30g.
Since the veto, Lamont has faced criticism from his own party and housing advocates. His office negotiated House Bill 5002, and the governor had been expected to sign it. He first publicly showed signs that he was wavering on his support for the bill the day after the legislative session ended in June.
He ultimately vetoed the bill saying he wanted to get local leaders on board with the measure. Behind the scenes, he and advisors fretted over the political implications of signing the measure as they received thousands of calls from opponents and Lamont considered a third-term run next year.
In a statement Friday morning, the governor said, “Over the last several months, I have consulted with bipartisan state lawmakers, municipal officials, housing advocates, and nonprofit partners to craft policies that will have a real-world impact and implement the tools we need to succeed in building more housing. This comprehensive proposal takes strong steps toward addressing this crisis and will help Connecticut reach these goals. I appreciate the collaborative input of everyone involved in this process and I urged lawmakers to approve this proposal.”
Lawmakers have long been working to address the lack of housing in Connecticut, particularly housing that’s affordable and available to the state’s lowest income residents. Multiple estimates show the state lacks upwards of 100,000 units of housing to meet residents’ needs. H.B. 5002 was the most wide-ranging housing bill to cross Lamont’s desk since he came into office in 2019.
The new bill, slated to be taken up in a special session of the General Assembly next week, includes many of the same measures as the old bill. The starkest difference is the opt-in measure. Previously, towns would have been required to plan and zone for a set number of housing units based on regional housing needs. The bill also previously prioritized existing state infrastructure money for towns that opted to increase density near public transit.
The question of how much the state should intervene to force towns to allow more housing has been central to the debate about Connecticut’s housing policy. Many town leaders say they want to preserve local control and create solutions that make sense for them, while housing advocates say towns have had plenty of time to build more housing and simply won’t do so without requirements from the state.
The new bill leans on incentive and opt-in structures.
H.B. 5002 also would have removed minimum off-street parking requirements for new housing developments with 24 units or fewer. The new bill lowers that number to 16 units or fewer and allows towns to possibly exempt two contiguous zones amounting to not more than 8% of the land.
In those zones, towns could require a parking needs assessment and developers would have to build no more than one parking space for each studio or 1-bedroom apartment and two spaces for each unit with two or more bedrooms, or the number recommended by a parking needs assessment paid for the developer. The requirement would be for whichever number is lower.
Parking reform was one of the most controversial topics in H.B. 5002. Opponents feared it would mean there weren’t enough spots to park and would have negative consequences for residents. Supporters said it would allow more flexibility and make it cheaper for developers to build housing.
The other controversial piece of the bill, known as fair share, has been removed. It would have required towns to plan and zone for a set number of units based on an assessment conducted by an outside consulting group. The group analyzed regional housing needs to figure out the numbers, and H.B. 5002 would have required that towns plan for a quarter of the recommended numbers.
Fair share has been utilized with some success in New Jersey.
The bill establishes a Council on Housing Development with legislative and executive branch appointments. The council would approve or deny towns’ housing growth plans if OPM fails to act on them within 120 days.
It also says that the Department of Housing can act as a statewide housing authority to develop more affordable housing. The department can partner with municipal housing authorities on projects and can build housing on state land, according to the document.
Other pieces of the old bill, including pieces that ban types of architecture that make it hard for people experiencing homelessness to remain largely intact, according to the summary. The House is scheduled to be in session Wednesday, and the Senate is scheduled to be in Thursday to vote on the housing bill and other measures.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lamont-Veto-0623-DE-056-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-07 10:59:09.491231

A recent analysis by the Movement Advancement Project estimates the loss of annual household income in the hundreds of millions (Illustration by Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).When Rob Connoley shut down his award-winning St. Louis restaurant last year, business was thriving.
Tourists and locals alike lauded Bulrush as a destination for Ozark cuisine, making its way into local and national publications as a top restaurant. Profit margins were beyond national averages, and Connoley was a newly awarded James Beard Award finalist.
But it didn’t feel right.
During a trip to London to represent Missouri in an international food festival, Connoley realized he couldn’t be an ambassador for a state that didn’t respect him.
“It felt egregious and awkward to be promoting a state in a region that was actively working against my own personal interests,” he told The Independent.
Connoley, who is gay, pointed to an onslaught of anti-LGBTQ+ laws. The final push was when the Missouri Attorney General sought out transgender kids’ medical records.
So he packed up and made a home in Oregon.
“It made more sense for me to take my entrepreneurial skills and go to a community that I think would be more supportive of what I’m trying to accomplish,” he said.
For years, Missouri lawmakers have heard warnings that enacting policies targeting the LGBTQ+ population could drive individuals and businesses out of the state. Local officials and chambers of commerce raised red flags about potential impacts on recruitment and retention of employees, as well as the ability to lure businesses to the state.
Now, studies are showing that the state’s actions have already pushed LGBTQ+ Missourians to move — taking their tax dollars, and even businesses, elsewhere.
Analysis by the Movement Advancement Project estimates that around $362 million to $879 million in household income has left the state, a number that is expected to increase.
The estimate is based on a survey conducted by MAP in collaboration with The Trevor Project, a mental health nonprofit for LGBTQ+ youth. Their research shows that among LGBTQ+-identifying people ages 13 to 24, around 39% have considered moving to a different state and 4% have already moved because of policies targeting gay and transgender people.
“There is good reason to suspect this 4% estimate may be even higher in Missouri,” the report says.
Therapists, social workers face scrutiny in Missouri AG investigation of transgender care

A separate study conducted by the National Center for Transgender Equality and released in 2024 found 47% of transgender people have thought about moving to a different state because of discriminatory state laws, and 5% had completed a move for that reason.
Missouri is one of 10 states highlighted in the study as having a higher proportion of respondents moving away.
“When people feel unwelcome or uncertain about their future in a community, they often take their skills and their families elsewhere,” Tracey DeMarea, executive director of the Mid-America LGBT Chamber of Commerce, told The Independent. “That loss affects our workforce, our businesses and our shared sense of community.”
A St. Louis University study released in April found that 32% of parents of LGBTQ+ children have considered leaving Missouri, and 48% of LGBTQ+ adults have considered moving. Political climate was the top reason for their desire to leave.
Analyses at the national level affirm a correlation between LGBTQ+ inclusion and economic success. A 2023 Wells Fargo report showed that states with larger LGBTQ+ populations had higher rates of economic growth between 2010 and 2019. The analysis notes that people identifying as LGBTQ+ tend to be younger and higher educated, but it still found a correlation between representation and economic growth when the data was controlled for age and education variables.
“The responsibility of lawmakers is to represent communities across the state and when they pass laws that target already vulnerable communities, they should consider their actions,” Naomi Goldberg, MAP’s executive director, told The Independent. “When families choose to leave the state, the loss is not only in the vitality and diversity of the community, but also in the economic power and resources that families provide.”
Each year, Missouri lawmakers file dozens of anti-LGBTQ+ bills, with some — like gender-affirming care restrictions — becoming law. And as they make their way through committee hearings, local chambers of commerce have raised red flags about the unintended consequences. .
The harshest warnings came in January 2024, in an eight-hour hearing on multiple bills including proposed regulations on restrooms in private businesses. Lobbyists stayed past 10 p.m., telling lawmakers the bills were a threat to “free enterprise” and “business development.”
Kara Corches, president and CEO of the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry, told committee members at the time that the legislation would impact communities statewide.
“We hear every day from businesses… that their ability to recruit and retain talent is their top concern to the business and economic growth in the state,” she said. “Businesses want to ensure that people feel comfortable and safe in their workplaces.”
Henry Eubank, governmental affairs coordinator for Greater St. Louis Inc., said discriminatory legislation depicts the state as unwelcoming.
“It sends a powerful negative signal to potential residents, investors, businesses and workers,” he said, “That the state of Missouri is not a place that they would want to visit, live, to do business, to start a business or move their family.”
And for some, the state no longer feels like home.
Connoley lived in the Ozarks and St. Louis areas for the majority of his life, and he saw the regional cuisine as something to highlight and promote internationally. Missouri was home until state officials went “too far.”
Rising extremism, he said, has removed a sense of community and cooperation crucial to thrive as a local business.
“Why invest my money right now,” he said, “when I don’t know that it is a good investment of my money.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Artboard-1@3x-1024x614.png,,,2025-11-07 10:59:09.491231

She visits them regularly, takes her daughter to storytimes and listens to audiobooks on Hoopla, an app that provides free access to ebooks, audiobooks, movies and other library material.
“Having a young toddler, it’s nice to be able to listen to audiobooks while you’re driving in the car, doing stuff like that,” said Tramel, 30, who works at Greater Belhaven Foundation in Jackson.

Back in April, a halt to federal funding caused many libraries to temporarily suspend or limit access to Hoopla. Though Tramel did not lose access, she said losing the app means she wouldn’t be able to read as much.
“It would make me very sad,” she said.
The Trump administration’s efforts to eliminate the Institute of Museum and Library Services caused the funding pause. The institute provides federal funding to museums and libraries across the country and is the largest source of federal funding for America’s libraries.
Funding was restored months ago, and federal courts blocked the administration’s efforts. But the federal government shutdown means that the agency’s future is still at risk.
“Sometimes you don’t know what you had until it’s gone,” said Jennifer Lena, deputy executive director of the Mississippi Library Commission. “And I don’t think a lot of people realize how many people don’t have access to the internet at home, especially in rural areas. I don’t think they understand how many people go to their libraries for support, for job searches, again to check out materials for those who can’t afford them.”
If the Institute of Museum and Library Services shuts down, libraries and their users in Mississippi would lose important services.

The Mississippi Library Commission distributes some of the money from the institute as subgrants. It uses the rest to help pay for many of the services libraries and their users rely on.
During the 2025 budget year, the Mississippi Library Commission received $2.1 million from the institute through the Grants to States program. 
Without the federal infusion of funds, library users could lose free access to Hoopla, Talking Book Services, summer reading programs and more. Libraries could lose important resources such as consultants, training and professional development for library staff and technology support.
“Most of the cases … for them (libraries) to try to independently get those services, they would be significantly higher in cost,” Lena said. “So for many of them, the ability to get them back would just really not be there.”
If federal funding sharply decreases or goes away altogether, the commission would have to evaluate its services and decide what it can and can’t keep, based on what would have the most impact.
Mississippi’s libraries receive funding from state and local governments, as well as the federal government. Total funding for each library and library system varies, but small, rural libraries would be hit the hardest by potential cuts.
Patty M. Bailey, director of the Yalobusha County Public Library System, explained that the federal grant is “vital” to her library.

“In small, rural communities like those we serve, the library serves as a community center, a gathering spot for all ages,” she said.
It’s also a place where residents can access computers and the internet.
Emmaline Smith, 41, is a board member of JXN Friends of the Library. She said she and her family often use Hoopla and a similar app called Libby.
“Even if you don’t use the services yourself, there’s a lot of people in our community that really rely on them and need them,” Smith said.
Alivia Beckham, 18, has been going to Quisenberry Library in Clinton since she was in eighth grade. A student at Hinds Community College, she often uses the library to do schoolwork or meet with study groups. 
“I love the library. I come here a lot. It’s my favorite thing to do, is just sit down and read for hours,” Beckham said. She also uses the digital archives for schoolwork, one of the services Lena cited as being at risk if federal funding goes away.
Zarah Drake, 30, lives in Jackson. He used to frequent the Eudora Welty Library downtown. When it shut down, he tried one other branch before finding his favorite, Quisenberry.
He’s been going to libraries for years, though he doesn’t get to visit the library as often because of work. He said he likes to read books and use the WiFi on his laptop.
“I think that libraries, they give us access to a wealth, a treasure trove of knowledge and information that we can utilize and apply in our everyday lives,” Drake said.

Caitlin Sewell, 29, who works as a protective blast engineer,said she uses the online catalog to reserve books and pick them up.
“There’s just so many books that you have access to,” she said. “I mean, I don’t want to have to pay for a book every single time I want to read a book.”
According to Jeanne Williams, executive director of the Jackson/Hinds system, losing support services from the commission would be “the most critical loss.”
The Jackson/Hinds system is working on a five-year revitalization effort. Williams said that without the commission’s support, the system would potentially have to spend money that could’ve gone toward revitalization on replacing the technology support services and consultants. It also would lose access to free training and support for staff and would have to reduce its ebook catalog.
“If Mississippians care about literacy, workforce development, economic health, access to technology and the internet and safe spaces for learning and community connection, then they should care deeply about libraries,” Williams said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/08122954/Jennifer-Lena-Ms.-Library-Commission-1.jpg,,,2025-11-07 10:01:22.590231

SNAP was designed during the Great Depression and formalized in the 1960s as part of the War on Poverty, a bridge for families between hardship and self-sufficiency. Today, it reflects a system that has stopped solving problems and started managing them. The question is no longer how to help people through hard times; it is how to live with the permanence of those hard times.
This is the uncomfortable truth revealed by the budget impasse. Hunger is no longer a temporary emergency. It is a policy choice.
For decades, the number of Americans who depend on SNAP has quietly measured how many of our public systems have failed: unaffordable housing, stagnant wages, childcare, and health care that few can afford. We have programs layered on programs, each designed to fill the gaps left by another, until the very complexity of the system becomes its own form of poverty.
With SNAP benefits paused, Michigan recipients, advocates and lawmakers determine how to respond

When Congress fails to pass a budget, it is not just our government workforce who go unpaid. It reveals how far removed Congress is from the human cost of doing nothing. We do not need another round of partisan press conferences to fix that. We need a different conversation, one that starts not with blame but with proximity. The people closest to the problems should not be the furthest from the decisions that shape them. Yet that is exactly how we have built our systems: top down, fragmented, and resistant to collaboration.
While one party may benefit from the political stalemate for now, both would gain by addressing the problem’s root causes. The government would spend less, people would secure housing, transportation, and jobs, and we could move on to the next challenge in building a better system.
When I worked for the City of Detroit, following the resignation of Kwame Kilpatrick and before its bankruptcy, I saw how government, business, and philanthropy came together to support the city and ultimately save it through what became known as the Grand Bargain. That collaboration preserved pensions, protected city assets, and set a global example of how foundations can serve as conveners, aligning diverse partners across sectors to take concerted action and improve outcomes.
Detroit and Michigan: A Fragile Bargain

If we want fewer families depending on SNAP, we cannot start by cutting the program. We must cut the conditions that make it necessary. That means removing barriers to opportunity: wages that do not meet the cost of living, transportation systems that make jobs unreachable, and childcare that costs more than rent. It means aligning the work of government, philanthropy, and business around a shared purpose, because no single sector can solve a structural problem alone.
Philanthropy has an opportunity to lead where politics fails. Consider the staggering sums spent on recent election cycles, millions of dollars in Michigan alone, much of it poured into campaigns promising to fix what government itself keeps breaking. Imagine if even a fraction of that money were redirected to foundations and community organizations already doing the work: building local food systems, training workers, and connecting families to opportunity.
If facilitated effectively, foundations and business leaders can come together again to prevent future breakdowns in essential benefits by reducing dependence on them. It could be a win for everyone. Families move from survival to stability, the private sector gains a stronger workforce, Republicans reduce long-term spending and strengthen families and local control, while Democrats deliver on their promise to fight for working Americans and fortify the social safety net.
The challenge is that elected officials often thrive on political division and prefer to control the process internally. That is where the private and philanthropic sectors can step in, convening stakeholders, identifying barriers, and aligning resources to sustain progress without waiting for Congress or state legislatures. Foundations can link funding to measurable outcomes rather than short-term programs and coordinate on a larger scale across the communities they serve, guided by a shared strategy. With a collective voice, they can leverage their power to hold lawmakers accountable for removing the remaining legislative or regulatory barriers.
In Michigan, we have strong foundations and an influential private sector. Actual progress will require innovation to break down existing silos and share best practices. The status quo is no longer acceptable. Philanthropy can help depoliticize the work ahead by convening partners across sectors and aligning efforts toward measurable outcomes.

The media, too, has a role. It can illuminate the systems that produce hunger, not just the faces that endure it. It can tell the story of what happens when policy becomes theater, with lives at risk, and of the barriers families face in keeping their children fed.
It is time for the people we elect to lay down their swords and focus on collaborative problem-solving. Instead of arguing over positions, focus on shared outcomes. No one wants children to go hungry, and everyone wants people to succeed on their own terms. Starting from that common ground is the first step toward any durable solution. It is also the essence of democracy: staying in the conversation long enough to find a resolution.
The shutdown will end, eventually. Workers will get paid, and benefits will be restored. But unless we fix the larger failure, the one that leaves 42 million Americans reliant on SNAP every month, we will be back here again, mistaking a temporary budget for progress.
The private and philanthropic sectors must hold our elected leaders accountable and need to bring the stakeholders to the table to find common ground, remove barriers, align strategy, and transform the system of care so it serves people, not politics.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_7306-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-07 10:01:22.590231
