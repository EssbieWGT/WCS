(Photo by FatCamera/Getty Images)For the past year, families in need of child care assistance in Indiana have been sitting on a waitlist that has ballooned from 3,000 to 30,000 kids. It’s still climbing — and no one is coming off of it.
Emily Pike, the executive director of New Hope For Families in Bloomington, which cares for children experiencing homelessness, can’t remember a time when no families were coming off the waitlist. Before this year, she said, low-income families could expect to be on the list just a few weeks before they found placement at a center that took child care vouchers, which for most brought their costs down to zero.
But now, state officials project that no kids will come off the list until at least 2027.
That isn’t the only drastic change. In September, Indiana moved to lower its child care reimbursement rates, meaning the state will pay providers 10 to 35 percent less to care for low-income kids. Centers have had to pass those costs on to parents through higher co-payments.
Already, centers have closed classrooms as a result. Workers have been fired. Parents have pulled their children out of care.
Versions of this story have quietly been playing out across the nation, including in Arkansas, Oregon, Maryland and New Jersey. The reasons appear to be the same: States used a historic infusion of COVID-19 relief funds to improve their child care systems over the past few years, and now that the money has run dry, some can no longer keep their child care reimbursement rates up. To keep funds going to families already receiving state assistance, states have stopped accepting new children into their voucher programs and implemented waitlists.
At the same time, they’re facing cuts — or upcoming ones — in federal funding.
Arkansas education department adopts most of plan to keep families, providers in child care industry

President Donald Trump’s tariff hikes are constricting budgets in states, like Indiana, that rely on international trade, and his Big Beautiful Bill spending package will dramatically cut funding for Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Scrambling to fill those new holes in their coffers, states have looked to child care.
“A lot of states are facing major budget pressures for various reasons and those are unlikely to get better, and very likely to get worse, as a result of the Big Beautiful Bill, said Elliot Haspel, a national child care expert. “In some ways it’s all the more alarming that states are doing this before they are feeling the full effects.”
In Arkansas, where the state proposed leveling reimbursement rates, the waitlist for child care vouchers is frozen.
Maryland has stopped offering new applicants child care vouchers because it has more children enrolled right now than it can financially support. The state would need more funding to shrink its waitlist, and legislators have said that is not likely to come because of cuts in federal funding.
In Oregon, the legislature has slashed the budget for its free preschool program by 10 percent due to poor economic projections for the corporate tax that funds the state’s program. The reason for those poor projections? Tariffs hitting a state economy that relies heavily on international trade. An estimated 640 kids will no longer get free preschool.
Helene Stebbins, the executive director of the Alliance for Early Success, a group that brings together early childhood advocacy at the state level, said some states “did not prepare for the very predictable end for the COVID dollars,” while others, like New Mexico and Connecticut, have instead invested more state money in child care after the funds ended.
“It’s a choice about how they collect and redistribute revenue and budget,” she said.
In 2021, child care got a $39 billion infusion after 16,000 child care centers and homes closed during the pandemic and more than 370,000 workers lost their jobs. It was money states used for a whole host of things, including paying providers more, raising wages and improving infrastructure. The last of those dollars expired in September 2024. Many advocates in 2023 warned that a child care cliff was coming. Years later, it’s now here.
In Indiana, the state said its recent changes were largely due to a projected $225 million funding gap created by “unsustainable” use of COVID relief funds by the prior governor’s administration. In 2021, the funds allowed the state to pay providers about 20 percent more to care for low-income kids and expanded the eligibility requirements, which led to more families enrolling in child care vouchers. But after the funds expired, Indiana could no longer cover those rates, even after it invested an additional $147 million in child care earlier this year.
The state declined an interview on the changes, but a spokesperson for the Office of Early Childhood and Out-of-School Learning told The 19th that Indiana is also battling lower revenue projections in part due to tariffs. Indiana is the fourth highest exporter of goods to China in the United States. Cuts to Medicaid and SNAP that will take effect in 2027 are very likely also going to affect the child care budget, a spokesperson said.
In a news release, Adam Alson, the director of Indiana’s early childhood office, said the state decided to focus its funding on the families already receiving aid. He reasoned it out like this: “There is only one pot of money — we could either protect providers or kids, and we chose kids.”
But if centers have to fire teachers, close classrooms or close entire buildings, children will also be impacted, multiple Indiana child care providers told The 19th. Most of the children on vouchers in Indiana are Black or Latinx kids from single-parent households. About 60 percent of those families are living below the poverty level and nearly all are working. If those children can’t be in care, their parents face missing out on work or losing jobs altogether.
“When policymakers decide to cut something like this, what they’re saying is, ‘Oh people will figure it out.’ I think they expect caregivers to figure it out,” Pike said. “It’s a dramatic misunderstanding of what the field does, because at the end of the day, we as a society make choices about what’s most important to us. When we choose not to fund early learning we are demonstrating real short sightedness.”
Cori Kerns, an early childhood advocate and staff consultant at Little Duckling Early Learning Schools in Indianapolis, said families there are seeing their co-pays rise from $5 to $15 a week, and even that modest increase is having a big impact. So big, in fact, that the centers had to consolidate their two buildings into one because so many parents stopped bringing their kids in after the rate hikes. The center is surviving only because the community has chipped in to cover electricity bills and rent payments.
Across Indiana, at least 36 centers have closed entirely since the start of the year, said Hanan Osman, the executive director for Indiana Association for the Education of Young Children, which is tracking closures.
Arkansas faces a similar situation: Providers were staring down as many as 400 layoffs and potential closures due to significant reimbursement rate cuts proposed by the state designed to spread the money across more kids and lower the number of children on the waitlist. The list now numbers 1,100 and has also been frozen since the start of the year.
In September, the state notified providers that it would no longer pay out higher reimbursement rates to higher-quality centers. In Arkansas, centers are rated for quality from 1 to 6 — the higher their quality rating, the more money the state puts in to cover the cost of providing that care, often because the provider is also spending more on curriculum, teacher pay and materials. The state then proposed that every provider will get a flat fee. Higher co-payments for families kicked in October 1, and the reimbursement rate change was delayed to November 1 after significant public opposition to the plan.
Last month Arkansas Secretary of Education Jacob Oliva said uncertainty around the federal government shutdown was part of it, and so was an unexpected reduction in the federal funds the state receives for child care due to a change in how state allowances are calculated. That led to a realization that the voucher program was significantly over budget, to the tune of as much as $9 million more a month, because so many more children were receiving services.
In late October, a task force of child care experts presented recommendations to the state to scale back the cuts, most of which have now been implemented. Instead of a new flat reimbursement rate, providers rated 3 to 6 in quality will still get higher rates, albeit not as high as they were previously.
It’s all been incredibly stressful for McKinley Hess, the executive director of Conway Cradle Care in Conway, Arkansas, which primarily serves teen parents. In the past, those teens had been able to bypass the waitlist because they are considered a priority population, but Arkansas removed the exception at the end of August. The center is a level 3 of 6 for quality, but under the proposed cuts she would have seen a cut of $20 less per infant per day and $16 per toddler per day. Now, the cuts will be less dramatic: $5 a day each for infants and toddlers.
Still, “it is a disaster,” Hess said bluntly. The center had been covering all costs for eight families who are sitting on the state’s waitlist for assistance and plans to continue doing so until those families come off it.
“While the new reimbursement rates are not as detrimental as the initially proposed cuts, our most pressing challenge remains the number of adolescent parents who are waitlisted and unable to receive assistance,” Hess said. “For our adolescent parents, access to child care is the bridge between continuing their education and being forced to drop out of school.”
In Mountain Home, Arkansas, Jill Wilson, the executive director of Open Arms Learning Center, was looking at a $32,000-a-month shortfall from the rate changes. Now the shortfall will be more like $3,200. Her center is accredited 5 stars out of 6, a quality level that she earned through significant investments like specialized curriculum for each class room — $4,000 each for 17 rooms.
Already, she had to cut two staff positions and combine classrooms.
“I have been here for 20 years and it’s never been like this,” Wilson said. “I feel like the rug has been pulled out from under me.”
For Pike in Indiana, the situation goes far beyond the dollars and cents of a state budget. For the families she serves, access to child care is the key to retaining a job and moving out of homelessness.
“I have seen families make devastatingly difficult decisions when they don’t have access to child care. It makes me emotional to talk about it. I have seen families choose to leave their children with someone with an active substance use problem. I’ve seen families leave little kids home with big kids. And I’m using big kids pretty loosely there — they might be 8 or 9 or 10. I have seen families lose jobs,” Pike said.
She started her center 10 years ago when she encountered a crying mom with a 4-year-old girl and an infant in the parking lot of a shelter. The little girl had been bitten by a dog at an unlicensed child care home the previous day and received 17 stitches in her neck. The mom’s boss was threatening to fire her if she missed work, and so the mother had no choice but to send her daughter back.
Pike helped the family that day and later started her center, an experience that has fueled her belief that cutting access to child care funding does not mean children no longer need care. They still have to go somewhere.
Put simply, she said: “When we take away subsidies, we are taking away low-income families’ access to safe care.”

English professor Brenda Brueggemann had driven by the memorial stone, the grassy grove and the architectural shells of the shuttered institution every day for years on her way to teach at the University of Connecticut.
The campus of the former Mansfield Training School, a state institution that, until the early 1990s, had housed people with intellectual disabilities, was now nothing more than a labyrinth of empty buildings along a stretch of Route 44, overgrown with ivy and left to rot on the inside.
Then in 2022, a student of Brueggemann’s, who was researching how individuals with disabilities were treated in university settings, started digging through UConn’s archives. The work would lead to what Brueggemann called a “dark realization” about the history that was hiding in plain sight. 
And it launched a much larger project.

For the past three years, Brueggemann and her students have been piecing together the history of the Mansfield Training School, now owned by the university and referred to as the “Depot Campus.” They’ve gone through archives, given presentations, made visits to the site and created a website outlining the history of the training school and what they’ve found in its archives. And they’ve grappled with its controversial legacy — one that aligns with the fraught history of institutions for disabled people across the U.S. 
Brueggemann has also taken on the task of piecing together an oral history of the Mansfield Training School. She’s spoken with family members of former residents and, through a Facebook group, she’s interviewed people who used to work there. Now she’s looking for a way to formally preserve it all.
“The more I found, the more I knew that we needed a memorial of some kind,” Brueggemann said. 
The student who first called Brueggemann’s attention to the vacant campus was Jess Gallagher. Then an undergraduate student in English literature, Gallagher was working on an honors thesis and had been reading about the way people with disabilities were treated in university settings. They began wondering what that history was at UConn.
Over the course of roughly 400 hours going through documents in the archives, the professor and her students unearthed a story of an institution that reflected the shifts and changes in contemporary opinions about the proper setting and treatment for people with intellectual disabilities.
The site was a hospital in the mid-1800s and a labor farm in the 1920s. By the 1960s, it was the site of psychological experimentation. In subsequent decades, treatment for the resident population transformed from restraint, seclusion and the use of heavy sedatives to more modern care — such as homier living quarters and more targeted pharmaceuticals.

Over the years, its barracks-style residences, cut off from society at large, were replaced with smaller dormitories and more integrated living — group homes — in the surrounding community. Ultimately, in 1993, shifting public opinion and legal battles put an end to the institution all together.
But Gallagher said the school’s archival records only revealed so much. The documents they’d combed through often referred to Mansfield Training School residents simply as “numbers,” she said.
The stories that truly brought life and color to the school’s history were those Gallagher found outside the archives — like one memorable 2001 profile they’d read in The Hartford Courant, which changed the way they thought about the research project.
Jimmy Lundquist, the subject of the profile, lived at Mansfield Training School for nearly two decades and tried to escape several times. He’d witnessed residents being placed in straightjackets and isolation rooms, and in the article he recounted beatings and strip searches. Eventually, after leaving the school and living in multiple group homes, he found work and became a well-known resident in his West Hartford neighborhood.
Stories like Lundquist’s — along with the oral histories Brueggemann has compiled — lend a human face to the institutional history. Gallagher said they believe that’s worth preserving.
“ During the time period of institutionalization, and even today, people have the stereotype that people with disabilities can’t live fulfilling lives or independent lives. So seeing [Lundquist] flourish and subvert that narrative, I think, was the best thing to see,” they said.

From the archives
In a timeline on the memorial website, Brueggemann and her students lay out much of the institution’s first 175 years.
It was established in 1850 by a doctor named Henry Knight, who ran it by himself for its first six years. The state of Connecticut then agreed to provide funding to the institution, which was called “Knight Hospital” and described by author and scholar James W. Trent Jr. as a place for “feeble-minded patients.” It would become the Mansfield Training School and Hospital in 1917. 
During the flu epidemic of 1918-19, an overwhelming number of residents got sick, and 30 died. 
By 1940, the Mansfield Training School had grown to nearly 1,200 residents. They were trained to cook, sew, clean and farm — but they weren’t paid for their labor. Female residents made clothes and baskets, which were sold to support the institution.
Archival records document poor conditions and overcrowding. The archives also revealed abuse, including the frequent use of restraints and isolation. Anyone who tried to run away was punished.
In one month in 1957, 39 residents spent more than half of each day in restraints. In 1972, an article in the Mansfield Chronicle revealed that employees at the training school routinely abused and beat residents. And in 1977, the Connecticut Department of Labor logged 41 pages of health violations at the facilities. 
UConn, which acquired the campus in 1969, became involved with the school years earlier, in 1963. That year, the state passed a law allocating funds for research centers, community mental health centers and teacher training for children with disabilities. Part of that funding went to UConn to build clinical facilities. University students began visiting the training school to conduct clinical work there, and professors at UConn received grants to conduct experiments on residents of the training school.
“It seems that the … residents at MTS were often used for the benefit of the institutions they inhabited,” the website timeline reads.

Telling their stories
Former workers at the school have nuanced memories of the place. 
John Ryan, an employee from 1967-1975, remembers both happy and dark moments. Ryan worked as an aide with residents who were moderately disabled and with the blind. He said he helped teach them to tie their shoes and dress themselves, and he enjoyed the work.
There were trips to the circus and to a baseball game at Fenway Park. He remembers making a float for Memorial Day and parading with students down the campus’ main road.
But Ryan said the situation was different for staff who worked in a separate building with severely disabled residents. Workers regularly called out sick, he said, and they often smelled of urine. 
“They had a huge turnover in those buildings,” Ryan said. Some of the school’s more high-functioning residents, known as the “working boys,” would help out with the more severely disabled residents, changing their clothes and cleaning up.
There was a larger societal problem, too, Ryan said — a stigma. He recalled that some parents rarely visited or took their children out for the day. 
“Back in the ’60s and ’70s, mental retardation was a dark subject,” he said. “They didn’t know as much about it.” 
Many families avoided talking about their disabled children. But over the years, some of those same relatives have gotten curious about the place their loved ones spent much of their lives. 
Gretchen Law remembers going to visit her older sister, Missy, when she lived at the Mansfield Training School. On Sundays after church, the family would drive over from their home in Granby. 
Law said she remembers the “institutional hospital smell” of the buildings “and the color on the wall. It was kind of that sort of greenish blue institutional color.”

Missy, who was nonverbal and needed help feeding herself, was sent to live at the training school in the early 1960s, when she was 8 or 9.
“ I can’t speak for my mom and my dad, but it was a decision that they made based on what was done with children like this during that time,” Law said. 
In their father’s journals, which Law discovered years later, he wrote that he believed it had been a “wise” decision and he was grateful to the staff for taking care of Missy.
But Law said that their mother never received any support or therapy to help her through the experience and that, even today, the knowledge of having placed her daughter at the Mansfield Training School “haunts her.” 
When Law was 7, her parents separated. Not long after, Missy, then 15, died from a congenital heart defect. Law said that she and her family rarely talked about Missy after that.
About 15 years ago, Law was working as a teacher in Deerfield, Mass., when she started to wonder whether her sister’s life might have been different if she’d had the kind of support now available to students with special needs. 
“ In my school, we had a program where kids were nonverbal, they were in feeding tubes, they were in wheelchairs. So I would look at these kids and just say, ‘That was my sister,’” she said.
Law said sharing the stories of people who spent time at Mansfield Training School could help family members — like herself and others like her — to find peace. 
“We should be telling these stories,” she said. “It affects someone, it came from someone’s life experience, so this is part of our culture. Let’s not ignore it.”

The end of an institution
By 1970, the Mansfield Training School’s days were numbered. Public opinion of residential institutions for the disabled was shifting. Lawsuits were being filed across the country. 
In Connecticut, an investigation by the American Association of Mental Deficiency had determined that Mansfield was overcrowded and understaffed and that residents had no privacy. 
In response to the sea change in public opinion, school leaders worked to revamp the facilities. “Cottages” were constructed to replace the large barracks-like dormitories. The school also established rules for the use of restraints and added reporting requirements and training for staff. 
Robert Tyrka, who worked at Mansfield Training School from 1978 to 1988, witnessed the change. When he first started working there — helping the residents shower, eat and get ready for activities — he said there might have been two staff members for every 20 residents. 
But as time went on, that ratio improved, he said. Negotiations with the union led to significant improvements in salaries and benefits, and over time people began thinking of the jobs less as a temporary placement and more as a career. And thanks to pharmaceutical improvements, doctors began to prescribe more targeted treatments rather than the heavy-duty drugs they relied on in the 1970s. 
But the improvements at the school didn’t save it. 
In 1978, a group of parents filed a lawsuit against what was then known as the Connecticut Department of Mental Retardation, in part to stop a plan that would have allowed the Department of Correction to use certain buildings on the Mansfield grounds to house prisoners. A consent decree that emerged from the lawsuit provided the plaintiffs with case managers tasked with finding them new homes within their communities. The decree eventually led to the closing of the Mansfield Training School.
“The stories are still there.”Ashten Vassar-Cain
The remaining residents were transferred into group homes, and the land and buildings were abandoned to decay, quietly receding from sight and from memory. 
Tyrka, who went on to work at Southbury Training School and later at group homes, said he believes the group homes were mostly an improvement over institutional settings. But he said what he perceived as near-constant news coverage of abuses at Mansfield was unfair. He said those reports didn’t portray any of the positive things that happened there until it became clear the facility was going to close. He’d like to see the full story told. 
“If it can be done in an even-handed, in a balanced way, then I think it would be worthwhile to explore the good, the bad, the ugly — all of it from Mansfield insofar as that can be encapsulated,” he said. 
In the years that have passed since the closing, the University of Connecticut has tried to find a use for the land. The school has sold part of the property to the state of Connecticut to be used for the construction of a new Windham Technical High School. Other deals to sell portions of the land have fallen through.
Brueggemann and her students are curious about the possibility that human remains might be buried at the site. Other states, including Kentucky, California and Minnesota, have made such discoveries. Last year, Brueggemann and several students sent an email to UConn President Radenka Maric and associate vice president in charge of University Planning, Design, and Construction Laura Cruickshank inquiring about conducting a survey using ground penetrating radar, a technology that can show whether human remains lie under the ground.
UConn officials responded that there were no records that would indicate a burial ground existed on the property and that they did not plan to do a survey without further evidence. 
Ashten Vassar-Cain, a former student of Brueggemann’s, said he’s planning to seek funding from the Connecticut State Historical Preservation Office to do a radar sweep of the area. But he said UConn would have to approve it. 
“Even though Mansfield Training School has been closed for over 30 years, even though the buildings are standing near rotting, and nothing has been ‘done’ with the land, the stories are still there,” Vassar-Cain said.

Restoring without ‘sanitizing’
What happened years ago at the Mansfield Training School remains a question in the minds of relatives — one that may never be fully answered. 
That was the case for Jan Doyle, whose older sister Evvie was a resident of the training school for four decades. Jan said her sister was  born prematurely and suffered brain damage. After their parents placed Evvie in Mansfield, in 1953, they never spoke about her.
“ Personally, I was very angry at my parents for years for doing that,” Jan said. “But I understand now through my own research, they were just doing what the experts told them was the best for their child.”
By the time Jan officially met her sister, they were both in their 40s. Evvie had been placed in a state-run group home after Mansfield closed, and Jan was asked to be her sister’s medical proxy. Jan said she felt compelled to step forward.
On the first day they met, Jan threw Evvie a birthday party. They began spending more time together, and Jan regularly took Evvie and her boyfriend — a fellow resident at the group home — out to lunch. She and Evvie liked to sing along to songs on the radio together. 
But when Jan asked Evvie if she remembered being at Mansfield Training School, she clammed up. “ She wouldn’t talk to me anymore for the rest of the day, and she has never been like that,” Jan said. “The experience had to be so horrible that when she was in her 70s, she still couldn’t talk about it.”

Evvie died of cancer in 2022. Since then, Jan Doyle has been working on projects that would honor her sister’s memory, including a fictional memoir and a series of quilts. She said she wants to educate family members about the value of being involved in the lives of people with special needs. 
Doyle said she’d like to see a few of the buildings at the training school be restored to the way they used to be — without it being “sanitized” — as a way to memorialize the history of the site. It could be part museum and part gathering place for families to “learn, share and support each other in a safe place,” she said.
“It could be a resource and a hub for the state and the country to share this information — where we were, which was horrible … and where we are now.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1028_SR_MTSUConn_194-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-09 05:16:32.110161

(Photo by Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)As I write there’s a calico tabby on the porch, asleep in the sun.
It’s an afternoon in early November and the temperature is 65 degrees, says our outdoor thermometer. There is no wind and the atmosphere is so clear it seems distilled by the intensity of late fall. Constitution Street has been made vivid by low sun and dry air.
Even the sky seems more blue.
I don’t know if the cat appreciates this beauty — as I understand it, the scene looks muted and blurry for her — but she lives easy on days like this. Her name is Newt. Don’t ask me how she came by that, but my wife Kim can recount the complicated backstory, as there always is with cats. I don’t know if Newt has her own secret name, as Eliot poetically declared, but today she has no time for meditation on the ineffable. Just rest.
The cat sleeps on a piece of paint-splattered cardboard, but earlier it was the lazy gray cat on the makeshift mat. His name is Geebers and he is even lazier than Newt, although his curiosity draws him inconveniently underfoot. The third cat, the white Foxy One, prefers her own company and is perched atop a plastic trash bin in the back yard.
Have I mentioned I am not a cat person?
The cats have places to sleep, store-bought beds tucked in corners of the deck and the back porch, but they prefer my old T-shirts that have become work rags or the scraps of cardboard that catch paint drips. We still have things to do, so there are brooms and brushes and buckets of stuff on the porch. But largely, the work is done for this fall. Our handyman friend and his wife have done most of it, but I’ve managed rebuilding the steps out front. The handyman’s name is Junior and that reminds me of my dead father, whose given name was Carl but who was called Junior by just about everyone who knew him. Sometimes the handyman friend will forget to bring a tool and he’ll ask to borrow one of mine. It was a level yesterday and I imagine my father would have been pleased when I produced one that he himself had used 30 or 40 years ago.
A few things are left that I can do. A bit more carpentry. Some paint. Maybe repair that leaking gutter on the big round corner of our house that’s been here well over a hundred years. All I need is a few good days and a little ambition.
But who am I kidding?
There will always be things to do. The work is never done.
And that’s OK with the cats.
The cardboard the cats prefer is dappled with the new colors of the house, porch, and deck: yellow, tan, redwood, dark brown. It didn’t occur to me during summer that we had chosen an autumn palette for the house, but it’s apparent now. There’s not much color in the trees in front of our house on Constitution Street, but a block over there’s a maple that fairly burns with red and orange. Kim came back not long ago with photos of it on her phone, an attempt to memorialize fleeting beauty in an ordinary moment. Her photos make me sad for the maple in our back yard we lost to a wind storm last year.
This is the melancholy territory when Halloween is behind us, but it’s not brisk enough to yet imagine Thanksgiving. It’s a lull in battle, a bit of rest before the harshness of winter. It feels like we didn’t have much of a summer, because of the rain, because of projects, because of 2025. The strangeness of days is not just because of the weather.
I’ve linked the personal to the public during this time before. Last year I wrote about our mind-bending cultural landscape. In 2023, I noted my brother’s death and took comfort in Thoreau. But anxiety and uncertainty still rule. We are now in the longest government shutdown in United States history, our military masses off foreign shores, more than 40 million people have already lost their food assistance, and health care for another 20 million may become unaffordable as federal tax benefits expire. There is much more to worry about, but these issues are the most pressing.
Never mind just now who is to blame. When your apartment building (or the house of democracy) is on fire, you work at saving yourself and as many others as you can first, even if you have a good idea who lit the match. If you survive, there’ll be time later to investigate how the fire started. If you don’t survive, there’s no point.
A couple of days ago Kim and I took all the loose change we could find in the house, from jars and pockets and one comically large Jack Daniels bottle, and cashed it all in. We fed the coins into one of those machines at the local grocery store and it clanged like a slot machine and counted more than 90 bucks, including a thousand pennies. We gave half of the amount to a local food bank and used the rest to buy macaroni and cheese and peanut butter and other staples to put in blessing boxes around town. We aren’t hungry, but we know it’s a thin line that separates us from those who are. Our acts are not so much charity as they are an affirmation. We’re still here, we’re mostly okay, we can afford to help others. We do it while we can.
Kim is one of those 20 million Americans who rely on the tax credits for the Affordable Care Act plans, subsidies which are set to expire at the end of the year unless Congress acts. Her premiums are expected to triple, according to this KFF (formerly Kaiser Family Foundation) calculator. She’s contemplating going without, but that risks catastrophe. Such conversations have been frequent since my job as a professor was taken away in a purge of the humanities in 2022, because Kim was on my health insurance. But many other families, from all professions, are having these discussions. The past three years have been tough, although we managed to survive and are better now. But the health care problem lingers.
The fears many of us had this time last year, in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election, have materialized into what may become life-or-death decisions. Health care or house payments? Food or rent?
I’ve always tipped too much at restaurants, and in the past the motivation was in that “Sun Also Rises” way of making people happy and getting them to like you, but now is different. I don’t care so much who likes me anymore. But I do care about those who rely on tips.
If the last few years have had any lesson for me, it’s that you can suddenly become disadvantaged by events beyond your control, even if you’ve spent years building what you thought was job security. You’re just one workforce management decision or one major illness away from having it all come crashing down. We’ve been lucky. We held onto our old and admittedly modest home on Constitution Street, but it was not without struggle. The paint and repairs represent for me a victory over the forces of career disruption and economic entropy. The place will never be a model home, but every dab of paint and each driven screw is a testament to tenacity.
The struggle to get by has reached such proportions in America that it should make us all ashamed. When I was a kid it was easier to get by because the cost of doing human business was more straightforward. You paid this much for rent, that much for food, you kept the car running and if you were lucky you had a little left over to buy gasoline and a couple of movie tickets. There are a dozen things you could name that make it more expensive to live now, from your smart phone (required if you want to stay or be employed) or your home computer and internet. We have better health care now, due to advances in technology, but prices have far outstripped general inflation. We also spend more on health care than any other large, wealthy country, but that spending doesn’t translate into better outcomes. Even if you have insurance, you might fear the cost of co-pays for a major illness.
Everybody knows, even if they won’t admit it, that health care in this country is broken. We are trapped in an upward spiral of services and premiums that cannot be sustained. There is a strong correlation between poor physical and mental health and food insecurity, so we’re really talking about different aspects of the same problem. That problem is economic inequality. The United States is experiencing a widening income gap, with an inequality chasm not see since before the stock market crash of 1929.
Will we have another Great Depression?
I don’t know. Maybe.
That’s one of those saving people from the flames first and investigating the arson later questions. We must do what we can right now to relieve the suffering of our friends, our neighbors, and especially people we don’t know. We are naturally disposed to helping family and friends, but helping strangers may be the true test of our humanity. To live in America today is to dwell in a nation of abundance in which 1 of every 8 people is in danger of going hungry.
If you are not among them, give thanks. Your good fortune might be because of your hard work or your family connections or simply good luck. If you are among the 13% who are, don’t believe those who say you’re lazy or otherwise undeserving and chalk it up instead to bad luck.
Poverty in America is a choice, but the choice isn’t made by those it afflicts, and certainly not their children. We have made the collective choice to embrace a system that resembles the worst aspects of our Gilded Age past more than the golden age of mid-century democracy. In today’s America, the only unpardonable sin is being poor.
The last few years have left many of us emotionally battered.
I am so weary as the cat sleeps on the porch that I’m not prepared for a day of sun in autumn to feel like a gift. But it is a gift, and perhaps that’s the lesson for the day. One individual can’t control sweeping cultural events any more than one can control the weather. All one can do is to enjoy the good days, prepare for the bad, and try to help those in danger of being swept away.
I stand for a long time on the porch, looking at the slanting light and the fallen leaves on the steps. I think they’re all maple but the yellow ones are from a gum tree, Kim tells me. She also says Newt’s name is a contraction of “New Cat.” Not mysterious at all, just a convenient name for the third orphaned or otherwise abandoned cat she’s adopted. I reflect for a moment on labels and ponder whether I am disappointed by politics or seriously disaffected. Then the thought passes. I should be painting or cutting lumber, but then the moment would slip away. In time the lazy gray cat ambles sleepily over from where he’d been hidden and looks up at me with wide green eyes.
I reach down and scratch him behind the ears.
Have I told you I’m allergic to cats?
I will have to wash my hands thoroughly later. For the moment, it is enough to feel the back of Geebers’ bony head beneath my fingertips as his eyes close and his tail goes slowly back and forth. The cat has no politics. For the moment, neither do I.

But there’s a lighter side to the job, as I wrote a few years ago, based on former conductor Michael Shaw’s great book, “My Rail Life” after he retired from a 36-year career on the New Haven line.  He clearly loved his job.  And he swears these stories are true.


He once told passengers on a standing-room only train: “OK, folks. We are half way to Grand Central.  It’s time for everyone who’s been seated to get up and give their seats to folks who’ve been standing.”
Asked by a passenger boarding at Grand Central, “What times does this train arrive in Stamford?” he answered candidly, “Usually about 20 minutes after the schedule says.”
On another train he announced: “Folks, I have good news and bad news.  The good news is that Metro-North fixed the air conditioning you complained about not having all summer long.  The bad news — it’s now winter.”
Honest to a fault, he turned in everything left by passengers on his train to the Metro-North Lost and Found… even an envelope containing $400 in cash. (The lost money wasn’t claimed so he got it back.)  On several occasions he’d find a lost briefcase or cell-phone and personally return it to the owner’s home the same day.


He also loved razzing his fellow railroad workers, once announcing, “If you have any railroad questions or would like to take your picture with a real railroad engineer, come to the front of the train and say hello to Jerry who loves chatting with people.”  The engineer’s name was not Jerry and the real man at the controls really didn’t like people at all.
Approaching Bridgeport, Shaw announced the connection for the Waterbury train, adding “Be sure to ask your Waterbury conductor for one of the free 100 Years Commemorative pins.”  There were no such pins.
On Friday late night trains Shaw would bet with his fellow conductors watching drunk passengers boarding at Grand Central, guessing who would be first to throw up.  Shaw immediately chose a 95-pound woman he saw staggering to the nearest car with her equally inebriated boyfriend.  Even before leaving the station his co-worker came and gave him his winnings.
Shaw always went out of his way to keep passengers informed about delays.  In the horrendous winter of 2014 when the railroad almost ground to a halt, he printed a one-page apology for the previous day’s delays and did his own seat-drop of 500 copies before the train left New Haven.  His regular passengers were so grateful for his candor they gave him a standing ovation as he entered each car to collect tickets.  His railroad bosses were not amused.
As Shaw approached an obviously “senior” citizen to collect his fare, the old timer asked he needed to show his ID to prove his age.  Shaw said that wouldn’t be necessary, The old timer asked “Are you saying I look old?” 
“No,” said Shaw. “You look honest.”
On another occasion he approached an elderly, gray-haired woman who wanted to buy a senior-discount ticket.  “Are you over 65?, he asked in a teasing voice. 
“Actually, I’m 82,” she said.  
“Well, you look marvelous!” said Shaw, asking “What’s your secret?”
Without a smile or batting an eyelash she said: “Rough sex.”

(Courtesy of South Dakota Department of Corrections)An inmate died in Department of Corrections custody this week, adding another name to a list of in-custody deaths that’s higher than the state has seen in recent memory.
Travis Long Fox, 33, died Friday in a Sioux Falls hospital. He’d been there since Tuesday, when he was found unresponsive in his cell at the South Dakota State Penitentiary.
The Division of Criminal Investigation plans to look into the death. Press releases from the Department of Corrections and Division of Criminal Investigation did not disclose further details.
Three inmates die in three days at Sioux Falls penitentiary complex

This will be the fifth inmate death investigated by the DCI since February. Two people have been criminally charged for allegedly supplying the drugs that caused the overdose deaths of two inmates. In addition to the death of Long Fox, there are two other ongoing investigations into inmate deaths.
Nineteen men have died in state prison custody this calendar year, the highest number in at least a decade. At least four of those men died by suicide. At least three overdosed.
The department tracks inmate deaths by state fiscal year, which ends on June 30. The state is currently in fiscal year 2026. 
By the fiscal year measurement, 2025 was the deadliest year in South Dakota’s prisons since at least 2018, with 19 total deaths. 
The death of Long Fox brings the number for fiscal year 2026 to seven.

(Photo courtesy of USDA)One day after saying it would pay full food assistance benefits on time this month, the South Dakota Department of Social Services said Saturday it’s pausing that plan because of a U.S. Supreme Court decision.
The department is reacting to federal government shutdown-related chaos that took several twists and turns in the last few days.
The Trump administration had said the ongoing shutdown meant it could not pay November benefits for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which helps 42 million Americans afford groceries. But a federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the Trump administration Thursday to pay roughly $9 billion for a full month of benefits by Friday.
US Supreme Court temporarily blocks November SNAP payments

The U.S. Department of Agriculture told states Friday it was releasing full November funding for SNAP. The South Dakota Department of Social Services responded with an announcement of its own, saying it would pay full benefits on Monday, which is the state’s regular date (the 10th day of the month) for loading money onto SNAP payment cards.
Then, on Friday night, the U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocked the Thursday order from the lower court, which the Trump administration had appealed.
The South Dakota Department of Social Services reacted Saturday with a new announcement saying it “has paused implementation of its plan to provide full benefits to SNAP recipients by November 10.” The department said it’s awaiting further instruction from the USDA Food and Nutrition Service and will provide updates as they’re received.
It takes about $15 million of federal funding per month to pay the SNAP benefits of roughly 75,000 South Dakotans. The average South Dakota household in the program receives about $390 per month.

BURLINGTON — Vermont’s state chapter of the Republican Party narrowly reelected its current chair, Paul Dame, to another two-year term on Saturday over a challenge from a sitting state senator. Dame won the election by just three votes, 50-47, over Essex County Republican Sen. Russ Ingalls.
The vote was held during the state GOP’s biennial convention at a hotel on the Lake Champlain waterfront in Burlington. Also on Saturday, the party voted in a new vice chair — Rep. Zachary Harvey, R-Castleton — as well as a slate of other statewide officers who oversee the party’s electoral strategy and manage its finances. 
Harvey beat out two other candidates for the No. 2 job: Gregory Thayer of Rutland and William Kolb of Northfield. Dame had endorsed Kolb, over Harvey and Thayer, for the vice chair role.
The roughly 100 people who voted in Saturday’s election, which was held by secret ballot, were mostly members of county Republican committees from across the state.
Dame, who is from St. George, campaigned for what will be his third term as chair largely on the sweeping successes Vermont Republicans saw in last year’s election. The party dismantled Democratic supermajorities in both state House and Senate; national data, meanwhile, shows about half of all state legislative seats the GOP won in 2024 were in Vermont.
To be sure, the state party owed much of its success at the ballot box last fall to Republican Gov. Phil Scott, who was notably absent from Saturday’s proceedings. Republican Lt. Gov. John Rodgers was the highest-ranking state official in attendance Saturday and oversaw the chair and vice chair election.

Ingalls, meanwhile, contended in recent weeks that Dame had not done enough to raise money for the party or recruit down-ballot candidates. He wasted little time criticizing Dame during a speech pitching his candidacy to the room ahead of Saturday’s vote, charging that the state GOP was “broke” and had “no plan” to win more legislative seats.
Dame said in an interview that the party has about $18,000 on hand, while federal filings show the party had $27,000 in its accounts as of last month.
“Once Paul is paid and this event is paid for, (it’s) more than likely that there will be no money left in the till,” Ingalls said ahead of Saturday’s vote, while Dame, sitting nearby among the audience, shook his head.
In his speech, the Essex County senator also criticized a campaign missive that Dame sent out Thursday in which Dame referred to “cowards who support my opponent” who “tear us apart and trash our party to the press.”

Ingalls was formally nominated for the post on Saturday by former state GOP chair Rob Roper as well as Joe Gervais, who chairs the Bennington County GOP committee. Gervais had briefly thrown his own hat into the ring for chair last month before dropping out and endorsing Ingalls. 
Dame was nominated by Terry Burke, vice chair of the Rutland County GOP, as well as Roy Spaulding, the party chair in Windsor County.
In his pitch to the room on Saturday, Dame said he had modernized some of the party’s back-end technology in recent years and described himself as an effective communicator for the party’s message in the press. 
He took credit, during his speech, for leveraging a relationship with a Fox News journalist to, in his telling, help make controversial remarks that Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., made about immigrant labor over the summer “go viral.” 
“We are on a better path — in a better position — than we’ve been, in 20 years, and if you join me and we work together, you’ll be amazed by the change we can make with just two more years,” Dame said Saturday.
Senate Minority Leader Scott Beck, R-Caledonia, said in an interview after the vote that he agreed with Ingalls that fundraising was “a notable area of improvement” needed for the state GOP. But he indicated that he did not think either Dame, or Ingalls, would have done a substantially better job at tackling that issue than the other.
“I think either one of them would have made a great chair,” Beck said. “I think it’s always good that you have contests, instead of just appointments — or anointments.”

(Nathaniel Herz/KYUK and Northern Journal)After a remnant typhoon hammered Indigenous communities in Western Alaska last month, the state’s elected leaders have been fielding questions about how to protect the region that faces growing threats from storms as the climate warms.
At a news conference last week, Gov. Mike Dunleavy answered the question with one of his own.
“It’s a complex question to get the answers to. Not only: What do you do to make a community prepared for the future? But: Where do you get the money and how do you do that?” he said.
In fact, that question had already been answered, in a report released a year earlier.
The 200-page document was published by the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium with contributions from Dunleavy’s own administration. And it contains both detailed recommendations to boost village efforts to protect themselves, as well as a specific request for cash from U.S. Congress: filling an estimated $80 million-a-year funding gap, with money prioritized based on the severity of communities’ environmental threats.
Others have floated different ideas about where the money should come from, including a tax on Alaska’s oil companies.
But it’s clear that bigger budgets are needed to meet the need, and that the damage that occurred last month is evidence of failure by both the state and federal governments, according to Charitie Ropati, a Yup’ik climate advocate with roots in Western Alaska.
“We have incredible, capable leaders in our villages — incredible youth from those communities who have the capacity and the knowledge to lead,” said Ropatie. “The issue is that the funding needs to get into their hands.”
Scientists say Western Alaska’s villages are increasingly vulnerable to events like last month’s storm amid a changing climate, and will have to either better protect themselves against floodwaters or relocate entirely. It could cost $4.3 billion to protect infrastructure in Alaska’s threatened communities over the next half-century, according to a 2020 estimate cited in the consortium’s report.

While the damage and destruction from the recent storm were painful to experience, some advocates and community leaders are now describing them as a wakeup call — one that could help focus attention, and public money, on a problem that they say has failed to draw an adequate government response so far.
“The time for climate commissions and committees and reports and things like that has come and gone,” said Rick Steiner, an Anchorage-based advocate who’s long pushed Alaska lawmakers to take stronger action in response to climate change. “What we need is tens of millions of dollars available for these communities to do what they know they need to do — to either stay, or pick up and leave and relocate.”
State and federal policymakers have long identified coastal erosion, flooding and permafrost thaw as major problems in Alaska. U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens hosted a hearing in 2004 where tribal leaders warned of government inaction and a lack of coordination between state and federal agencies.
Two decades later, the tribal consortium’s report suggests that little has changed.
Indigenous villages along Alaska’s coasts — with tight budgets, overburdened staff and spotty internet — still struggle to access government programs for relocation or protection. Federal support remains fragmented and inadequate, the report found.
Raising the money required to relocate Newtok, a single Yup’ik village near the Bering Sea coast, required more than more than a decade of effort and more than 40 grants from 35 separate state, federal and nongovernmental sources, the report said. The cost of that project is now estimated to exceed $150 million, according to ProPublica.
Other villages have been unable to make use of government programs because of local cost-sharing requirements they can’t meet, caps on grant sizes and wariness by agencies to fund protection projects when villages are also making long-term plans to move.
“Trying to navigate all potential government programs to address environmental threats can be like trying to assemble a 10,000-piece puzzle without a picture printed on the pieces,” the report said.

None of the three members of the state’s congressional delegation agreed to an interview about the long-term outlook for protecting Western Alaska’s villages.
A spokesperson for U.S. Rep. Nick Begich declined a request.
A spokesperson for U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan pointed to a recent address the senator made at the Alaska Federation of Natives’ annual convention, where he touted tens of millions of dollars that the delegation had secured in various bills to fight environmental threats. He also endorsed an idea from a Western Alaska tribal group, the Association of Village Council Presidents, to create a regional emergency response center.
“We think this is a really good idea and we’re looking into it,” he said, while also acknowledging, “We have more work to do.”
U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, in a prepared statement, said she could understand “why many feel they were failed by their government.” She pointed to a decision by the Trump administration earlier this year to revoke a $20 million grant for erosion control for the tribal government in Kipnuk — the Western Alaska village hit hardest by the recent storm, with nearly all of its buildings destroyed.
Murkowski said she’s been working with the tribal health consortium “to ensure that any new framework truly reflects the needs of Alaska and our diverse communities, with a strong focus on mitigation and long-term resilience.” After the storm, she said she spoke on the U.S. Senate floor “to remind my colleagues that our role in Congress is to provide protection and infrastructure to communities that cannot shoulder these challenges alone.”
“Every single displaced person is an American whom we have a responsibility to support,” she said. “Not only in the aftermath of a disaster, but by ensuring that the next ‘once-in-a-generation’ storm doesn’t tear another community apart.”
‘A recipe for disaster’
Advocates point out that the low-lying locations of many Alaska villages can be traced back to  the era of early colonization. At the time, Native people were drawn from more adaptable, seasonal settlements to permanent communities near schools run by the federal government or religious missions.
That history creates an obligation for the federal government to assist threatened Indigenous communities today, said Ropati.
“There needs to be some type of monetary reparations for what we’re seeing in our region. We didn’t choose to live in these flood-prone areas,” Ropati said. “Our children were forced to go to these schools, and it leads to realities like this.”

The tribal consortium’s report says that statewide, more than 140 Alaska Native communities face “some degree of infrastructure damage” from erosion, flooding and permafrost thaw.
The settlements in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta that were pummeled last month are among the most vulnerable. The region, a flat plain at the edge of the Bering Sea, faces an array of interconnected environmental threats stemming from climate change, according to scientists.
Sea level rise alone will cause monthly flooding in the delta within a few decades, and 10 of the 18 outermost villages face relocation, according to another major scientific study published earlier this year with federal, tribal and academic contributors.
“You throw on the permafrost collapsing and reducing the height of these plateaus these villages are built on, and it’s a recipe for disaster that just can’t be ignored,” Torre Jorgenson, a Fairbanks-based landscape ecologist who worked on the study, said in an interview. But, he said: “The magnitude of the problem and the magnitude of the costs are such that our institutions just can’t adequately grapple with it.”
The tribal consortium’s report, meanwhile, lays out three basic options for threatened communities.
They can better protect infrastructure in existing locations by building up shorelines, improving drainage and elevating buildings above flood levels. Where that’s not possible, villages can build new infrastructure at nearby sites, or move existing infrastructure there, in what’s known as a “managed retreat.”

Full relocation is a last resort.
All of those options are costly, and the report contains a litany of obstacles to communities raising the necessary cash.
Villages often have a small, overworked staff that’s mismatched to the huge amount of work that goes into grant writing and community decisionmaking around relocation, the report says.
Federal programs, meanwhile, prioritize grants to communities that can show they have bigger staff capacity. Some programs won’t fund larger regional or statewide partners that typically have the technical expertise to assist smaller villages with resilience and relocation projects, the report says.
“We should not (have to) be writing grants to protect our communities,” the report quotes one Nome-based tribal leader, Melanie Bahnke, as saying.
‘We know what the science says’
Meanwhile, Steiner, the Anchorage advocate, is pushing Alaska’s state government to take a more active role in supporting communities threatened by climate change.
The state’s commitment to that task has fluctuated over the years. Following a fall storm that forced the evacuation of the Northwest Alaska village of Kivalina in 2007, former Gov. Sarah Palin created a climate change team. But the administration of her successor, Sean Parnell, disbanded a key working group that was part of that effort, the consortium’s report said.
Parnell’s successor, Bill Walker, established his own climate leadership team after more than two years in office, and his successor, Mike Dunleavy, abolished the groupin 2019.
Steiner is now calling on Alaska leaders to convene a “climate disaster summit” in the next few months, where participants could draft a five-year plan to protect the state’s communities for the next century.
“We know what the science says. We know what the forecasts are. This is going to keep happening,” Steiner said. “The real tragedy of Halong would be if we fail to look forward and apply the lessons, prepare for the next storm and the next storm.”
Steiner also wants lawmakers to levy a 20-cents-per-barrel tax on Alaska’s oil industry to help pay for needed projects — a proposal he’s been pushing for decades that could generate some $35 million a year.
State leaders haven’t formally endorsed Steiner’s ideas. But they have expressed a degree of openness to longer-term planning for storms and other natural disasters expected to hit Alaska with increasing frequency.
“We’re trying to find the money to do these sorts of things, and it’s very important,” state Senate President Gary Stevens of Kodiak said in a brief phone interview this week. But, he added, “we’ve got limited funds.”
Bryce Edgmon of Dillingham, the House speaker, said it’s premature to comment on Steiner’s specific proposals. But he added that state policymakers do need to put a greater emphasis on planning for disaster management — particularly given the increasing likelihood of damaging storms in the future.
A spokesperson for Dunleavy did not respond to questions about Steiner’s ideas.
Ropati, the Yup’ik climate advocate, said the widespread damage caused by the most recent storm is evidence the state and federal governments are “failing”  communities like hers, “and have historically failed our people,” she said.

She pointed out that some of the evacuees from the region’s hardest hit villages may be forced to permanently resettle in urban Alaska communities, severing their ties to the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta and its subsistence traditions.
Averting those kinds of outcomes will require help from outside the region, Ropati said. But the work needs to happen in a way that “upholds our rights as Indigenous people.”
“We need everyone to work together,” she said. “And to do it in a way where communities on the front lines have the autonomy to make the decisions.”

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-11-08 17:58:02+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,The Red-Blue Connector: A half-mile of subway that benefits an entire region,"Will Palmer, Elias Fen and James Aloisi",,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/the-red-blue-connector-a-half-mile-of-subway-that-benefits-an-entire-region/,It’s easy to look at the short length of the proposed Red-Blue Connector – less than half a mile – and mistake it for a project with small impact. Nothing could be further from the truth.,"HOW LONG IS too long to wait for all subway lines on the MBTA to be connected?  
100 years?  
This December, it will be 101 years since the Boston Globe first reported on the idea to connect the MBTA’s Red and Blue lines, noting that riders “using either the East Boston Tunnel [the Blue Line] or the Cambridge Subway [the Red Line] could change cars at Charles St, instead of transferring at Scollay Square and Park Street, the most congested parts of the whole system … This would have a distinct tendency to remove this congestion and would therefore be a highly desirable end in itself.” 
A century later, the Globe’s description remains accurate: The Red and Blue lines remain the only two subway lines on the T that do not connect. Riders must make two zigzag transfers, using the Green or Orange lines, to travel between them. Not only is it inconvenient for riders, it also increases congestion and decreases capacity at Park Street and Government Center. These pressures on system capacity will only worsen with time.  
It’s easy to look at the short length of the proposed Red-Blue Connector – less than half a mile – and mistake it for a project with small impact. Nothing could be further from the truth. Connecting the Red Line and Blue Line is a small project with a huge impact, and the time to do it is now, as Massachusetts General Hospital is in the process of rebuilding its campus facing Cambridge Street above the proposed subway connection.  
Today, many of the region’s major job centers and key destinations, like the Longwood Medical Area, Back Bay, and Downtown Boston, can all be reached from every corner of the rapid transit network with at most a single transfer. Employers in these areas (and indeed anywhere along the Green and Orange lines) can therefore leverage excellent transit access to attract talent from across the region.  
Employers in Cambridge, however – including in Kendall Square, one of Greater Boston’s biggest job and innovation hubs – are systemically disadvantaged in this respect. Unlike their peers, these businesses, labs, and schools can’t effectively appeal to some of the densest neighborhoods in the region, in East Boston, Revere, and surrounding communities. Both employers and residents suffer from suboptimal access to transit and opportunities, due to the gap separating the Red and Blue lines. 
Many riders endure this tedious commute nevertheless, straining all other subway lines in the process. As described by the Globe a century ago, these riders have no choice but to squeeze on to already-crowded Green and Orange Line trains, and already-crowded platforms at Park Street and Downtown Crossing stations, all because of this 2,500-foot gap in our subway system. 
The Red-Blue Connector closes this gap. It balances capacity and mobility on our rapid transit network, gives Kendall employers the benefit of better access for potential employees, and gives Blue Line riders better access to jobs in Kendall and elsewhere along the Red Line. Even riders who never set foot on the Blue Line would benefit, as crowding is reduced on trains and platforms throughout downtown. 
The Red-Blue Connector also builds for the future. A total of 10,000 new units of housing are planned for Suffolk Downs, at the East Boston-Revere border: Red-Blue allows Cambridge employers to compete for those workers.  
Suffolk Downs also plans to have office space for 25,000 jobs. Red-Blue makes those jobs more readily accessible by transit to residents along the entirety of the Red Line corridor, from the South Shore, Dorchester and South Boston, to Cambridge, Somerville, Arlington, Belmont, and other communities west of Boston. Cities across Greater Boston are strengthened by connecting the Red and Blue lines. 
But Red-Blue – like all transit – isn’t just about jobs. Extending the Blue Line to the Red Line’s Charles/MGH stop provides patients and health care workers alike direct access to one of the best hospitals in the country.  
Connecting the Red and Blue lines would also cut down on vehicular traffic to Logan Airport. Many travelers using the Red Line, from the entire length of the corridor, are discouraged from seeking access to Logan Airport via the Silver Line bus from South Station as they must endure traffic in the Ted Williams Tunnel. These same travelers often opt for an Uber or Lyft to Logan today.  
With Red-Blue, they would have the benefit of a convenient and reliable two-seat ride to Logan terminal shuttles. No harbor tunnel traffic, no rideshare surge pricing, no missed flights – just convenience via transit. Reducing traffic congestion and emissions in East Boston, an environmental justice community, would be another signature benefit of this long-overdue connection.  
Red-Blue meets the MBTA’s short-term goals of increasing system capacity and resilience, and shouldn’t be thought of as a long-term project. Phil Eng, the MBTA general manager and the state’s interim transportation secretary, in a recent interview, said he supported investments “within our existing infrastructure, [to] build up more resiliency in our system.”  
A new connection at Charles/MGH unlocks additional capacity across the entire system, and enhances resilience by offering redundant transfer points, especially when the Green and Orange lines are suspended for maintenance and upgrades. Connecting the Red and Blue lines fits comfortably within Eng’s vision of supporting rider needs, regional access, and state of good repair. 
Beyond addressing the urgent needs of the present and building for the future, Red-Blue presents an unprecedented opportunity to integrate Mass. General Hospital directly with a new transit station. But Mass General Brigham, MGH’s parent entity, is moving quickly, with work on the second of the new MGH clinical care buildings on Cambridge Street likely to begin in the next 18 months – just around the corner. 
Fortunately, we are not starting from square one. Red-Blue has been well-studied for decades, including as recently as 2021, when its cost was estimated at $850 million.  
In 2018, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation released an update to the 2010 Draft Environmental Impact Report, finding that, unlike many expensive subway projects that utilize tunnel boring machines (TBMs), Red-Blue could instead leverage the cost-effective “cut-and-cover” method.  
Cambridge Street is nearly double the width of the proposed tunnel, significantly reducing utility relocation challenges and providing additional space at street level to accommodate construction. The 2018 update also found that using the top-down cut-and-cover method would enable the full restoration of the sidewalk and roadway early in the process, returning the street to normalcy while work continues underground.  
A well-designed, value-engineered Red-Blue Connector would most likely cost no more than $1 billion through completion. Its significant benefits in comparison – access to key destinations, economic growth, and reductions in emissions – make Red-Blue a low-risk, high-value proposition. 
Municipal and state leaders representing Boston and Cambridge should direct the MBTA to develop a credible plan for completion of the project by 2030. The plan should also aim for 100 percent design and preparation of construction procurement documents as soon as possible.  
Full funding for the project should come from the Commonwealth; waiting or hoping for federal funds, especially in the current political context, is unrealistic and simply a way to delay the project. The city of Boston and the MBTA also need to agree on a location for the connector’s ventilation system – a decision that remains a stubborn barrier to progress – as a matter of urgency. 
Red-Blue has been proposed for at least 100 years. Its profound impact includes better access to jobs, health care, and Logan Airport – a transit access trifecta – for everyone across the region. And the perfect time is now. We cannot afford to wait another hundred years to address a glaring and detrimental gap in our rapid transit network.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-08 17:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"Top PURA attorney accuses colleagues of defamation, threatens lawsuit",John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/08/pura-general-counsel-muska-defamation-letter/,Scott Muska sent a cease and desist letter alleging PURA's executive secretary and two commissioners on the authority damaged his reputation.,"A top attorney at the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority has accused three of his colleagues, including the agency’s executive secretary, of defamation following the release of private emails in which the attorney was accused of withholding public recordings and lying under oath.
Scott Muska, who serves as general counsel for PURA, sent a cease and desist letter on Oct. 30 to Executive Secretary Jeff Gaudiosi as well as Commissioner Michael Caron and retired Commissioner Jack Betkowski alleging that all three had damaged his reputation by spreading false and malicious statements. 
The letter specifically referenced an email sent from Gaudiosi to Caron and another commissioner, David Arconti, in early October in which Gaudiosi said he no longer felt comfortable reporting to Muska and asked to be able to report directly to the commissioners, instead. 
Gaudiosi went on to accuse Muska of engaging in “behavior that is not up to the ethical standards of a state agency” by withholding documents — which Gaudiosi said had prevented him from accurately responding to records requests — and giving “misleading and false statements” about those records while under oath.
The email was later published on a blog run by former state lawmaker Kevin Rennie on Oct. 24.
“These statements and are false and were made willfully and recklessly,” Muska said, adding “their subsequent publication and intentional disclosure to media outlets constitute defamation per se.” 
The letter further calls on each of the recipients to retract any defamatory statements within 10 days, or face potential “legal remedies.” The letter also directs the recipients to preserve any relevant communications in case they are needed as evidence in a future lawsuit.
The letter is the latest in a series of controversies that have rattled PURA, which is tasked with reviewing and approving rates paid by Connecticut customers of electric, gas and water utilities. In October, former PURA Chair Marissa Gillett stepped down after facing several lawsuits from utility companies accusing her of bias and wielding unilateral control over the authority during her 6-year tenure.
Her replacement, Thomas Wiehl, was tapped by Gov. Ned Lamont along with three other new commissioners last month. Still, the lawsuits and threats of more litigation haven’t stopped.
Betkoski, who retired in February after a lengthy career at the authority, said Friday that he believed Muska’s claims had no merit and that he was not involved in any of the statements mentioned in the letter.
“I am very saddened to see the turmoil at the place I loved for 27 years,” he said in an interview with the Connecticut Mirror. “I hope with the new leadership there that this will be something they put behind us.”
Caron, who was one of the recipients of Gaudiosi’s email, told CT Mirror he had not shared the email with anyone, or made other defamatory remarks about Muska. “I’ve never done anything the letter suggests,” he said.
Neither Muska nor a spokesperson for PURA responded to requests for comment. Attempts to reach Gaudiosi for comment were unsuccessful. 
Earlier this week, the Hartford Courant reported that state Attorney General William Tong’s office had hired an outside law firm, Shipman & Goodwin, to conduct a investigation into allegations of misconduct at PURA, including examining whether employees complied with the Freedom of Information Act and court-ordered discovery requests.
That contract was signed on Oct. 31, a day after Muska’s letter was sent. 
A spokesperson for the attorney general’s office declined to comment Friday.
Shipman & Goodwin is a Hartford-based firm with a $270,000-a-year retainer to conduct outside legal work for the state. Last year, the firm was hired to conduct an investigation into the misuse of state vehicles by staffers in the governor’s office.
The attorney general’s office is currently representing PURA in a pair of active lawsuits brought by utility companies.
One of those cases is joint lawsuit by Eversource and United Illuminating’s parent company, Avangrid, alleging that Gillett overstepped her authority while leading PURA. Commissioner Caron was deposed in that case on Wednesday, during which he revealed that he had been sent Muska’s cease and desist letter, according to a transcript of the deposition.
The other case — a challenge of PURA’s denial of rate increases sought by two gas companies owned by Avangrid — has hinged on allegations that Gillett helped to write an op-ed critical of the utility companies and then covered up her involvement. Gillett has repeatedly denied the allegations. 
The judge in that case, Matthew Budzik, has been probing whether attorneys representing PURA, including Muska, withheld information from the court about Gillett’s contacts with the authors of the op-ed and the auto-delete settings on her phone.
A hearing in that case is currently scheduled for Nov. 12.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1027_SR_Pura_042-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-08 12:57:45.572241

Here's how to help.","When Hurricane Melissa hit Jamaica and other parts of the Caribbean, the destruction rippled far beyond the islands. In Connecticut, where Caribbean ties run deep, people are stepping up to help.
Across the state, churches, nonprofits, and community groups are collecting supplies, organizing fundraisers, and coordinating with relief efforts to get aid where it’s needed most. Some are sending barrels of food and clothing. Others are raising money for rebuilding and recovery.
For many here, the response is personal. Friends, family, and hometowns are among those hardest hit. 
Sen. Saud Anwar, D-South Windsor, said at a Nov. 7 press conference:
“For the United States, our responsibility is perhaps a little bit more … if you look at the total impact on the climate by the Caribbean islands, it’s negligible, but the impact on the climate by the U.S. has been very high. We have a responsibility to react … because we are, collectively as a world, responsible for what’s happening now.”
Why Connecticut is responding
Connecticut has one of the largest Caribbean populations in New England, with thousands of residents tracing roots to Jamaica, Trinidad, Haiti and other islands. Many still have family and friends directly affected by Hurricane Melissa. Because of those ties, local organizations are mobilizing with urgency.
How to help
Experts say the best way to provide help right now is to donate to organizations that already have operations on the ground. Financial donations allow these groups to quickly purchase and distribute the resources most urgently needed.

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-08 16:19:54+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mississippi is among the states where people are waiting for SNAP food aid for November,Associated Press,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/08/snap-mississippi-wait-november-food-aid/,"People in some U.S. states are able to buy groceries with federally funded SNAP benefits, while those in other states — including Mississippi — were still waiting for November food benefits that had been delayed by a protracted legal battle over the federal government shutdown.","People in some U.S. states are able to buy groceries with federally funded SNAP benefits, while those in other states — including Mississippi — are still waiting for November food aid that is delayed by a protracted legal battle over the federal government shutdown.
“If you need more food resources during this shutdown, we encourage you to reach out to the food bank that serves your local area to locate food assistance near you,” the Mississippi Department of Human Services said in an Oct. 24 press release. The department had not updated that statement on its website by Saturday.
The Trump administration initially said last month that it would not fund Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits for November because of the shutdown. The twists and turns since have exacerbated uncertainty for the nearly 1 in 8 Americans who receive monthly SNAP benefits to spend at grocery stores and farmer’s markets.
On Friday, some states began issuing full monthly SNAP benefits to people, a day after a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to provide the funds.
But Friday night, Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson temporarily paused that judicial order to allow time for an appeals court to decide whether to issue a more lasting halt. Jackson acted because she handles emergency matters from Massachusetts.
How are SNAP recipients faring?
Nearly 42 million Americans receive SNAP benefits, formerly known as food stamps, for help buying groceries. Most have incomes below the poverty line, which is about $32,000 for a family of four.

An individual can receive a monthly maximum food benefit of nearly $300 and a family of four up to nearly $1,000, although many receive less than that under a formula that takes into consideration their income.
The delay in payments has led to a surge in demand at food banks and pantries across the country, as well as long lines for free meals or drive-thru giveaways.
Some states have provided emergency funding to food banks to help them respond to the increased need. Some states also used their own dollars to fund direct payments to people while the federal benefits were in limbo.
In Mississippi, leaders of the state chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics are calling on Republican Gov. Tate Reeves to put state money toward food aid. He has not publicly responded.
“Families already struggling to make ends meet will be forced to choose between food, utilities, and medicine,” chapter President Dr. Patricia Tibbs and Vice President Dr. David Reeves wrote in a public letter to the governor in late October. “Hospitals and clinics will inevitably bear the burden of increased malnutrition and preventable illness. Our children, the future of this state, will suffer the most.”
Where have people already received benefits?
Whether SNAP beneficiaries see money on their electronic benefits transfer cards depends on where they live.
In Hawaii, Oregon and Wisconsin, officials worked quickly after a judge ordered full benefit payments Thursday to instruct their EBT providers to process the full payments.

“We moved with haste once we verified everything,” Joseph Campos II, deputy director of Hawaii’s Department of Human Services, told The Associated Press.
Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, a Democrat, said state employees “worked through the night” to issue full November benefits “to make sure every Oregon family relying on SNAP could buy groceries” over the weekend.
Officials in California, Kansas, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Washington also confirmed that some SNAP recipients were issued their full November payments on Friday.
Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, said more than 250,00 households that missed their regular monthly SNAP payment during the first week of November received their full amount on Friday. The remaining beneficiaries would receive their November funds on their regularly scheduled dates later this month — if distribution does not remain blocked by legal challenges.
The Trump administration said in a legal filing with the Supreme Court that “there is no ready mechanism for the government to recover those funds” that already have been distributed.
How long might residents elsewhere wait?
Before Jackson ordered a pause, Colorado and Massachusetts had said SNAP participants could receive their full November payments as soon as Saturday. New York had said access to full SNAP benefits should begin by Sunday. New Hampshire had said full benefits should be available over the weekend.
And Arizona, Connecticut and Minnesota all had said that full SNAP benefits should be accessible in the coming days.
Whether people actually will receive those benefits on their EBT cards remains unclear.
For peoples in some other states, the wait appears likely to extend into next week. Numerous state officials said they had been waiting for further guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP.
What has been holding up November benefits?
Because of the federal government shutdown, the Trump administration originally had said SNAP benefits would not be available in November. After two judges ruled the administration could not skip November’s benefits entirely, the administration said it would use an emergency reserve fund containing more than $4.6 billion to provide partial benefits in November.
A judge on Thursday said that wasn’t good enough, and ordered other funds to be used to make the full monthly payment. The Trump administration appealed, asking a higher court to suspend any orders that require it to spend more money than is available in the contingency fund. That is what led to Jackson’s temporary hold issued late Friday.

(Photo by Jeff Morrison)Forty-three Iowa school districts held bond referendums Tuesday. According to unofficial results from the Iowa Secretary of State’s Office, 18 passed, 15 had a majority in favor but not the required 60% supermajority, and 10 failed to reach 50%.
The middle category has five districts of all sizes — Cedar Rapids, Easton Valley, Hinton, Independence, and Sergeant Bluff-Luton — receiving more than 58% but less than 60% support.
The 43 districts voted on a combined $1,435,950,000 in general obligation bonds. (That includes Atlantic’s $22.5 million bond for school construction, which passed, but not its $18.5 million sales tax revenue bond for a multipurpose facility, which failed.)
Gladbrook-Reinbeck’s third try in four years to pass a bond issue to replace the century-old school in Reinbeck succeeded by fewer than 20 votes Tuesday.
The $17.3 million bond issue will go toward construction of 15 classrooms, a media center, a family and consumer sciences room, secure entrances, and HVAC and electrical systems throughout the school complex in Reinbeck. It does not replace the auditorium or secondary gymnasium, which will remain in use.

Precinct-level returns starkly illustrate the continued schism in the district. In the Grundy and Black Hawk county portions, voters were about 9-to-1 in favor. In the Tama County precinct containing Gladbrook, voters were about 9-to-1 against. The vote in the northern tier of townships in Tama County, between Gladbrook and Reinbeck, was split exactly in half.
Overall, 1,934 votes were cast in G-R, with 1,177 in favor and 757 against. That total is about 500 votes fewer than last year.

Signs opposing the bond were plentiful throughout Gladbrook. Most were small. A few were big. Many were hand-written. Half a dozen were on the street connecting downtown with G-R’s football field. One particularly biting version had six big letters — VOTE NO — against the background of a photograph of the Gladbrook school building in mid-demolition in June 2022.
The Union school district of La Porte City and Dysart, trying a reduced version of a 2024 referendum that failed by six votes, did slightly worse this time around. The $18.5 million referendum was for HVAC improvements at the high school, classroom renovations, various infrastructure repairs at both the high school and middle school, and a bus barn.
Union had 1,954 votes cast overall, with 1,098 in favor and 856 against, which is about 56% in favor and 75 votes short of a supermajority. Turnout in the off-off-year election was drastically down from last year’s bond vote in a presidential election year.

Both East Marshall and West Marshall succeeded where last year’s referendums failed. East Marshall revised its proposal to include more definitive options for the Gilman site after students are relocated to Laurel and Le Grand. The century-old part of the Gilman school will be demolished. The section of West Marshall’s elementary in State Center that is also a century old will be replaced with a two-story structure. West Marshall will build a career and technical education addition at the grades 6-12 campus as well.
A western Iowa bond issue reflected a deep divide centered around loss of a building. The IKM-Manning district is trying, yet again, to facilitate construction of classrooms at the school in Manning that would result in tiny Irwin losing its PK-3 school. The easternmost part of the district — mostly Carroll County, where Manning is — carried the bond by a 9-to-1 margin. The western two-thirds — mostly the former Irwin-Kirkman-Manilla — rejected it nearly 3-to-1.

Multiple school bonds across the state included a component similar to Aplington-Parkersburg’s “secure front entry with pass-through visitor check-in.” This goes beyond simply relocating the main office to near the entrance or even buzzing someone in after seeing video. Visitors during the school day must enter the office and check in with a staff member in person before being granted access to the building.
For the fourth time in eight years, a district submitted the largest school bond referendum in Iowa history. Des Moines’ $265 million this year topped Cedar Rapids’ $220 million in 2023, Waukee’s $205 million in 2020 and Iowa City’s $191.5 million in 2017. All passed except Cedar Rapids’.
Cedar Rapids’ $117 million bond this year, substantially reduced from 2023, improved greatly in percentage of “yes” votes but fell short of a supermajority by 165 votes, less than 1%. Dubuque’s $70 million bond to build a replacement middle school failed as well, but the district says it will be closing Jefferson Middle School at some point anyway.
A variable introduced now that bond elections are restricted to November is the state volleyball tournament. Seven school districts with bond votes had teams in the tournament in Coralville. Three — Aplington-Parkersburg, Gladbrook-Reinbeck, and Hinton — played Tuesday.
It’s worth noting, then, that 141 absentee/early votes were cast in Grundy County on the G-R bond — 130 in favor, 11 against. (Absentee ballots by mail had to be requested by Oct. 20, but there was an in-person option at the courthouse in Grundy Center.) Hinton’s bond lost by 10 votes and wasn’t even the closest margin of the night. The Sergeant Bluff-Luton bond fell eight votes short of the 60% threshold, and Easton Valley, on the opposite side of the state, saw its bond fail by six votes.

(Photo by Gregory Adams/Getty Images)Will nuclear waste travel all the way from Ontario, Canada to a site about an hour drive from Salt Lake City? 
An interstate panel may consider a resolution later this month on whether to allow EnergySolutions to import up to 1.3 million cubic yards of low-level radioactive waste from Canada, a move worrying local advocates who argue this may be the stepping stone into accepting other types of nuclear waste.
Waste that is accepted to be buried at the Clive facility is Class A, the least hazardous radioactive waste under U.S. standards. That includes items that staff working with radioactive materials wear, like gloves, shoe coverings, cleaning materials and tools. But the proposal can still be hazardous, said Carmen Valdez, senior policy associate at the Healthy Environment Alliance of Utah.

“Any level of radiation can be harmful to humans. There is no safe level, frankly,” Valdez said. “And our concern is the lack of public transparency from the company in bringing in international waste, which can lead to international security issues.”
According to EnergySolutions, the type of material being proposed for this project is identical to the low-level radioactive waste the facility has managed for over 30 years.
“While located across the nations’ northern border, these facilities in Ontario currently provide electricity to customers in the United States,” the company said in a statement.
But, environmental groups are still hesitant about the proposal since public input hasn’t been extensive. Especially with this being an unprecedented situation for the compact. 
Public comment is allowed in the special meetings where the NorthWest Interstate Compact — a group of states that cooperates on low-level radioactive waste management — is considering EnergySolutions’ petition. But, not many people from the community are keeping tabs on the body, Valdez said. It was only after learning about the discussion from a mailer sent to a former executive that Healthy Environment Alliance of Utah advocates began watching the process.
“There was no announcement, there was nothing on the Division of Waste Management and Radiation Control Board’s meetings, things like that,” Valdez said. “So it was kind of per chance that we saw this and started watching it, and have been attending that.”
A big item on the advocates’ list of concerns, Valdez said, is public safety along the transportation routes for the waste, which is set to travel via rail. 
Dave Noriega, a spokesperson for the Utah Department of Environmental Quality, said that “no significant, additional safety measures are necessary with this proposed project since EnergySolutions has extensive experience disposing of Class A waste.”
The state, he said, has robust regulations that minimize risks to the public and the Department of Environmental Quality will continue to regulate all low-level radioactive waste.
Low-level radioactivity standards
Some aspects of the draft resolution are still uncertain, Valdez said. For one, will EnergySolutions classify waste coming from Canada according to U.S. or Canadian standards?
“We’re concerned about what that type of waste is because we’re just hearing that it’s related to the nuclear fuel industry,” Valdez said. “It’s mixed waste. But there’s no clarification on that.”



Let us know what you think...


 


Noriega said the arriving waste needs to be documented as Class A before it can be shipped to Utah. 
Casey Hill, a lobbyist representing EnergySolutions, said in a legislative hearing for a bill updating waste facilities’ licensing requirements that EnergySolutions’ Clive facility takes non-concentrated amounts of depleted uranium and has since it opened. But that wouldn’t change with an expanded Clive facility.
“Class A waste, as it’s currently determined, is what we can take in this facility. This would not be able to, as of right now, due to the fact that we don’t have a license to take concentrated depleted uranium, we would not be able to take that under this legislation,” Hill said.
This year the Utah Legislature also removed its specific nuclear waste classification to instead adopt federal definitions. According to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, depleted uranium is categorized as Class A. But, currently, there’s no indication that the material will be transported from Canada.
Still, advocates worry about the legislative change, especially now that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is reviewing its rules under a White House order.
“What happens with aligning to the (Nuclear Regulatory Commission) is now what we’re hearing is that the waste will be determined at the site,” Valdez said, “and if it meets Class A then it can come into Utah, no matter what.”
Six out of 8 states that make up the NorthWest Interstate Compact have to approve the plans. Utah would have veto power, Kristen Schwab, chair of the compact said in an October meeting.
In a presentation, EnergySolutions said the state supports the company’s desire to dispose of low-level radioactive waste from Canada at the Clive site.
The Utah Legislature approved an adjustment this year that would allow the state to get up to $30 million in tax for the expansion application, which would be deposited into the Energy Research Fund, and will support Utah’s big nuclear plans.
“The governor is in favor, the Legislature is in favor, and they want this to happen,” Valdez said about the proposal, “but there’s no talk about the general public and if they want this waste coming into our country and into our state too.”

This story was originally reported by Chabeli Carrazana of The 19th.  Meet Chabeli and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
For the past year, families in need of child care assistance in Indiana have been sitting on a waitlist that has ballooned from 3,000 to 30,000 kids. It’s still climbing — and no one is coming off of it.
Emily Pike, the executive director of New Hope For Families in Bloomington, which cares for children experiencing homelessness, can’t remember a time when no families were coming off the waitlist. Before this year, she said, low-income families could expect to be on the list just a few weeks before they found placement at a center that took child care vouchers, which for most brought their costs down to zero.
But now, state officials project that no kids will come off the list until at least 2027.

That isn’t the only drastic change. In September, Indiana moved to lower its child care reimbursement rates, meaning the state will pay providers 10 to 35 percent less to care for low-income kids. Centers have had to pass those costs on to parents through higher co-payments.
Already, centers have closed classrooms as a result. Workers have been fired. Parents have pulled their children out of care.
Versions of this story have quietly been playing out across the nation, including in Arkansas, Oregon, Maryland and New Jersey. The reasons appear to be the same: States used a historic infusion of COVID-19 relief funds to improve their child care systems over the past few years, and now that the money has run dry, some can no longer keep their child care reimbursement rates up. To keep funds going to families already receiving state assistance, states have stopped accepting new children into their voucher programs and implemented waitlists.
At the same time, they’re facing cuts — or upcoming ones — in federal funding.
President Donald Trump’s tariff hikes are constricting budgets in states, like Indiana, that rely on international trade, and his Big Beautiful Bill spending package will dramatically cut funding for Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Scrambling to fill those new holes in their coffers, states have looked to child care.
“A lot of states are facing major budget pressures for various reasons and those are unlikely to get better, and very likely to get worse, as a result of the Big Beautiful Bill, said Elliot Haspel, a national child care expert. “In some ways it’s all the more alarming that states are doing this before they are feeling the full effects.”
In Arkansas, where the state proposed leveling reimbursement rates, the waitlist for child care vouchers is frozen.
Maryland has stopped offering new applicants child care vouchers because it has more children enrolled right now than it can financially support. The state would need more funding to shrink its waitlist, and legislators have said that is not likely to come because of cuts in federal funding.
In Oregon, the legislature has slashed the budget for its free preschool program by 10 percent due to poor economic projections for the corporate tax that funds the state’s program. The reason for those poor projections? Tariffs hitting a state economy that relies heavily on international trade. An estimated 640 kids will no longer get free preschool.
Helene Stebbins, the executive director of the Alliance for Early Success, a group that brings together early childhood advocacy at the state level, said some states “did not prepare for the very predictable end for the COVID dollars,” while others, like New Mexico and Connecticut, have instead invested more state money in child care after the funds ended.
“It’s a choice about how they collect and redistribute revenue and budget,” she said.
In 2021, child care got a $39 billion infusion after 16,000 child care centers and homes closed during the pandemic and more than 370,000 workers lost their jobs. It was money states used for a whole host of things, including paying providers more, raising wages and improving infrastructure. The last of those dollars expired in September 2024. Many advocates in 2023 warned that a child care cliff was coming. Years later, it’s now here.
In Indiana, the state said its recent changes were largely due to a projected $225 million funding gap created by “unsustainable” use of COVID relief funds by the prior governor’s administration. In 2021, the funds allowed the state to pay providers about 20 percent more to care for low-income kids and expanded the eligibility requirements, which led to more families enrolling in child care vouchers. But after the funds expired, Indiana could no longer cover those rates, even after it invested an additional $147 million in child care earlier this year.
The state declined an interview on the changes, but a spokesperson for the Office of Early Childhood and Out-of-School Learning told The 19th that Indiana is also battling lower revenue projections in part due to tariffs. Indiana is the fourth highest exporter of goods to China in the United States. Cuts to Medicaid and SNAP that will take effect in 2027 are very likely also going to affect the child care budget, a spokesperson said.
In a news release, Adam Alson, the director of Indiana’s early childhood office, said the state decided to focus its funding on the families already receiving aid. He reasoned it out like this: “There is only one pot of money — we could either protect providers or kids, and we chose kids.”
But if centers have to fire teachers, close classrooms or close entire buildings, children will also be impacted, multiple Indiana child care providers told The 19th. Most of the children on vouchers in Indiana are Black or Latinx kids from single-parent households. About 60 percent of those families are living below the poverty level and nearly all are working. If those children can’t be in care, their parents face missing out on work or losing jobs altogether.
“When policymakers decide to cut something like this, what they’re saying is, ‘Oh people will figure it out.’ I think they expect caregivers to figure it out,” Pike said. “It’s a dramatic misunderstanding of what the field does, because at the end of the day, we as a society make choices about what’s most important to us. When we choose not to fund early learning we are demonstrating real short sightedness.”
Cori Kerns, an early childhood advocate and staff consultant at Little Duckling Early Learning Schools in Indianapolis, said families there are seeing their co-pays rise from $5 to $15 a week, and even that modest increase is having a big impact. So big, in fact, that the centers had to consolidate their two buildings into one because so many parents stopped bringing their kids in after the rate hikes. The center is surviving only because the community has chipped in to cover electricity bills and rent payments.
Across Indiana, at least 36 centers have closed entirely since the start of the year, said Hanan Osman, the executive director for Indiana Association for the Education of Young Children, which is tracking closures.
Arkansas faces a similar situation: Providers were staring down as many as 400 layoffs and potential closures due to significant reimbursement rate cuts proposed by the state designed to spread the money across more kids and lower the number of children on the waitlist. The list now numbers 1,100 and has also been frozen since the start of the year.
In September, the state notified providers that it would no longer pay out higher reimbursement rates to higher-quality centers. In Arkansas, centers are rated for quality from 1 to 6 — the higher their quality rating, the more money the state puts in to cover the cost of providing that care, often because the provider is also spending more on curriculum, teacher pay and materials. The state then proposed that every provider will get a flat fee. Higher co-payments for families kicked in October 1, and the reimbursement rate change was delayed to November 1 after significant public opposition to the plan.
Last month Arkansas Secretary of Education Jacob Oliva said uncertainty around the federal government shutdown was part of it, and so was an unexpected reduction in the federal funds the state receives for child care due to a change in how state allowances are calculated. That led to a realization that the voucher program was significantly over budget, to the tune of as much as $9 million more a month, because so many more children were receiving services.
In late October, a task force of child care experts presented recommendations to the state to scale back the cuts, most of which have now been implemented. Instead of a new flat reimbursement rate, providers rated 3 to 6 in quality will still get higher rates, albeit not as high as they were previously.
It’s all been incredibly stressful for McKinley Hess, the executive director of Conway Cradle Care in Conway, Arkansas, which primarily serves teen parents. In the past, those teens had been able to bypass the waitlist because they are considered a priority population, but Arkansas removed the exception at the end of August. The center is a level 3 of 6 for quality, but under the proposed cuts she would have seen a cut of $20 less per infant per day and $16 per toddler per day. Now, the cuts will be less dramatic: $5 a day each for infants and toddlers.
Still, “it is a disaster,” Hess said bluntly. The center had been covering all costs for eight families who are sitting on the state’s waitlist for assistance and plans to continue doing so until those families come off it.
“While the new reimbursement rates are not as detrimental as the initially proposed cuts, our most pressing challenge remains the number of adolescent parents who are waitlisted and unable to receive assistance,” Hess said. “For our adolescent parents, access to child care is the bridge between continuing their education and being forced to drop out of school.”
In Mountain Home, Arkansas, Jill Wilson, the executive director of Open Arms Learning Center, was looking at a $32,000-a-month shortfall from the rate changes. Now the shortfall will be more like $3,200. Her center is accredited 5 stars out of 6, a quality level that she earned through significant investments like specialized curriculum for each class room — $4,000 each for 17 rooms.
Already, she had to cut two staff positions and combine classrooms.
“I have been here for 20 years and it’s never been like this,” Wilson said. “I feel like the rug has been pulled out from under me.”
For Pike in Indiana, the situation goes far beyond the dollars and cents of a state budget. For the families she serves, access to child care is the key to retaining a job and moving out of homelessness.
“I have seen families make devastatingly difficult decisions when they don’t have access to child care. It makes me emotional to talk about it. I have seen families choose to leave their children with someone with an active substance use problem. I’ve seen families leave little kids home with big kids. And I’m using big kids pretty loosely there — they might be 8 or 9 or 10. I have seen families lose jobs,” Pike said.
She started her center 10 years ago when she encountered a crying mom with a 4-year-old girl and an infant in the parking lot of a shelter. The little girl had been bitten by a dog at an unlicensed child care home the previous day and received 17 stitches in her neck. The mom’s boss was threatening to fire her if she missed work, and so the mother had no choice but to send her daughter back.
Pike helped the family that day and later started her center, an experience that has fueled her belief that cutting access to child care funding does not mean children no longer need care. They still have to go somewhere.
Put simply, she said: “When we take away subsidies, we are taking away low-income families’ access to safe care.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Childcare-crisis-Indiana-for-Nov-8-2025-story-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-08 08:16:40.904957

No arrest, no indictment, no due process, no Miranda Rights, no nothing. Just suspicion.
Would that be OK, legally?
Of course not.
In the United States, people theoretically have inviolable rights, including the right not to be killed if they’re not immediately threatening anyone with lethal harm.
So, I ask, respectfully, how are suspected boat-borne alien drug traffickers on the high seas somehow not covered by that core American constitutional right when identified, targeted and killed by U.S. military aircraft packing deadly missiles? From Sept. 2 to this month, the U.S. military blew up 17 boats and one submarine carrying suspected drug smugglers in international waters of the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea in the vicinity of the Americas, killing 70 people aboard, according to news reports. Overall, two suspects survived, but instead of being charged and prosecuted, they were, very curiously, repatriated to their home countries scot-free.
US Senate fails to pass war powers resolution blocking Trump attacks on Venezuela

Simple logic tells us that all of these suspects, living and dead, should have been considered innocent until found guilty in a U.S. court of law. Still, no evidence of their guilt has been presented by the administration, and only Republican members of Congress — pointedly no Democrats — have been selectively briefed on these attacks. Mystery abounds.
Apparently, South Dakota’s all-Republican congressional delegation, with the possible exception of Rep. Dusty Johnson, hasn’t gotten very exercised about this very questionable Trump grab of congressional power. Declaring and authorizing war is Congress’s constitutional authority, not the president’s, and it’s hard to imagine that attacking boats of sovereign nations and arbitrarily murdering their citizens are not overt acts of war.
I sent online queries to each of our state’s federal legislators — Rep. Johnson, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Sen. Mike Rounds — asking them why they had not strongly and publicly condemned these extrajudicial (that means without legal due process) killings of foreign nationals and the destruction of their boats by the American military. They responded cautiously in the main, despite Congress’ authority being blatantly and unconstitutionally usurped.
Sure, the administration has tried to justify its war-like behavior with convoluted, specious arguments that make common sense mainly to those trying to make them. At least Rep. Johnson expressed “concern” about the attacks in an emailed response to my question. No such concern was seconded by Sens. Thune and Rounds, who’ve both voted against resolutions to stop Trump’s deadly strikes.
Rep. Johnson wrote in a brief reply, “Thank you for contacting me about the United States’ actions against Venezuelan drug smugglers via boat. I am concerned with the precedent of these actions by the administration. I will continue to monitor the situation as we learn more.”
Sen. Thune’s office responded with a long recitation of administration talking points justifying the attacks and denigrating any congressional attempts to stop them. He wrote, in part:
“While much progress has been made, dangerous cartels continue to traffic narcotics into the United States.  In response, President Trump has designated certain international cartels and other organizations as foreign terrorist organizations. The president is authorized by Article II of the U.S. Constitution to defend against threats as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Consistent with this authority, President Trump has ordered strikes against drug smuggling vessels transiting international waters toward the United States.”

For one thing, no evidence has been posited that any of these boats was bound for the U.S. or was carrying fentanyl, the main narcotic bugbear in the U.S., which mainly enters our country from Mexico. Also, President Trump simply labeling a group as “terrorists,” who he presumably believes can be killed on sight by the American military, doesn’t make it legally so. Drug cartels and their proxies are not “armed combatants” in any formal war sense.
Sen. Rounds didn’t respond to my query but told NBC News on Oct. 29 only that it was “unfortunate” congressional Democrats were not briefed along with Republicans about the administration’s continuing U.S. military airstrikes on suspected drug-running watercraft. He did not talk about the questionable legality of the attacks.

(Photo courtesy of the state Department of Children, Youth and Families.)Deaths and near-fatalities among children in Washington’s child welfare system have slowed, but are still expected to hit a record level in 2025.
Through the first nine months of the year, Washington saw 15 deaths and 30 near-deaths among these children, many of them infants and toddlers, according to state data shared Friday. There were 49 total such incidents all of last year, and 51 in 2023. 
Over half of this year’s incidents have been tied to opioids, especially highly potent fentanyl, according to the Department of Children, Youth and Families, the sprawling state agency that handles child welfare in Washington. At least some of the deaths and injuries involve parents repeatedly flagged over child welfare concerns.
The latest figures show improvement from the first three months of the year, which saw 22 of these incidents, the department said. In the second quarter, 14 were reported. And preliminarily, there were nine in the third quarter.
“Although the numbers have moderated, thankfully, quite a bit since quarter one of 2025, we do anticipate that 2025 will be a record year,” Vickie Ybarra, an assistant secretary at the agency, told reporters Friday. “We do not expect it to be double or triple, which was a concern in the first quarter.”
Declines in opioid overdoses could be helping the problem as the year goes on, according to the Department of Children, Youth and Families. 
State child welfare officials recently held listening sessions with staff to help identify roadblocks to working with families with substance use issues.
“The goal of our innovation is always to support families to be able to safely parent their children,” said Assistant Secretary of Child Welfare Natalie Green. 
The slowing rate of deaths and injuries hasn’t tamped down calls for changes to a state law that some say has contributed to the crisis.
The children most likely to be hurt are between the ages of 0 and 3. 
In one case, caseworkers received 85 reports over the course of a dozen years about the family of a six-month-old child who died in May, according to a child fatality review the Department of Children, Youth and Families conducted. 
The allegations included drug use, neglect, physical abuse, unsafe living conditions and sex trafficking. The child had three older siblings. 
Investigations found no proof of abuse or neglect, or evidence of imminent physical harm worthy of removing the baby from the home. 
The case is an example of the increase in families who are chronically enmeshed in the child welfare system. 
The data only covers cases believed to be related to maltreatment and that the agency had been involved in within the past year. A state ombuds office examines a wider range of cases, including those not directly related to maltreatment.
Over the summer, the ombuds reported at least 92 children had died or nearly died through June. The difference between that figure and the state agency’s has state Rep. Travis Couture, R-Allyn, skeptical. 
“Even if you took DCYF’s revised numbers at face value, they’re still incredibly high,” Couture said Friday.
Republicans like Couture have blamed a 2021 state law for keeping children in unsafe homes.
The Keeping Families Together Act raised the standard for separating children from their parents, and aimed to keep them with other relatives instead of foster care. The goal was to stop poverty from being used as a reason to take kids away from their parents, and to avoid inflicting the trauma of being separated from family. 
“What we’re doing right now, leaving them together and crossing our fingers and hoping for the best, is insane to me,” Couture said. “This hurts me on almost a personal level. I have to fix this.”
Some Democrats, including the chair of the state House committee that tackles these issues, have acknowledged the law may need to be further revised.
Rep. Steve Bergquist, who leads the House Early Learning and Human Services Committee, said he doesn’t “think we need to make wholesale changes this session, but look at opportunities to make it better.” These changes, for example, could focus on improving programs, like peer mentorship, to help parents.
The number of children entering out-of-home care fell after the law took effect, from nearly 4,200 in fiscal year 2021 to just over 2,800 in 2024. 
That figure is climbing back up after lawmakers tweaked the Keeping Families Together Act to instruct courts to give “great weight” to the presence of opioids in determining when children should be placed in foster care away from their parents.
Bergquist has urged colleagues in the Legislature to allow time for this change to play out before attempting any drastic overhaul of the law.

The Department of Children, Youth and Families isn’t planning to ask for changes to child welfare policy in the 2026 legislative session. 
The agency is asking Gov. Bob Ferguson to include $4 million in his upcoming budget proposal to help get drug treatment for parents before their child welfare cases are closed. 
The funding would also be used to help connect families to services after their cases close.

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-08 12:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,A tool tracking billion-dollar disasters is active again after being retired by Trump administration,"Héctor Alejandro Arzate, Mississippi Ag & Water Desk",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/08/tool-tracking-billion-dollar-disasters-active-again/,"After months of uncertainty over its future, an online resource for tracking high-cost disasters throughout the United States has been revived by the nonprofit group Climate Central.","After months of uncertainty over its future, an online resource for tracking the financial cost of weather and climate disasters throughout the United States has been revived.
The U.S. Billion Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters database was previously managed by a team at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA. Since 1980, the program has been responsible for analyzing wildfires, tornadoes, winter storms and other disasters that cause at least $1 billion in damage. But it was retired in May, one among several NOAA products and services to get shuttered by President Donald Trump’s administration this year. 
Now, a nonprofit called Climate Central, which communicates climate change science and solutions, has hired the scientist who led the project at NOAA, Adam Smith, and has taken on the responsibility of compiling and releasing the latest data.
In the first six months of 2025, there were 14 disasters with damages costing just over $101 billion in total. Many of them occurred throughout the Mississippi River Basin. Mississippi, where storms have caused $1.8 billion in damage, Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas and Tennessee were among the hardest hit by severe storms and tornadoes, which caused just over $40 billion in damage. 
The January wildfires in Los Angeles resulted in approximately $60 billion in damages — making it the most expensive wildfire on record. 
Zachary Labe, a climate scientist at Climate Central, said they brought back the database because they “were hearing from every single sector how important this data is for decision-making and understanding areas that are increasingly at risk for billion-dollar disasters.” 
Among those who have typically relied on the database are policy makers, researchers, and local communities. It’s especially important for planning disaster relief and emergency management efforts “because they can focus resources on areas that are seeing big trends in the number of billion-dollars disasters,” Labe said.
Bryan Koon, president and chief executive officer of the consulting firm Innovative Emergency Management, said the analysis is helpful. His company works with government agencies and other organizations to help with disaster preparedness, response and recovery. 
“These kinds of data sets are very important in the broad scope, at least from my perspective, for trend analysis,” Koon said. 
In states like Missouri, for example, he said his company and other interest groups can analyze previous billion-dollar disaster data on tornadoes and their frequency over the past decade or two. That information can be used to inform how insurance companies write their policies, how buildings are designed and how notification systems are structured.
“I want to make sure that we, as a nation, wrap our arms around as much information about these things as we can so that we communicate the threat of future disasters for Americans,” Koon said.

The Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative — a cooperative of more than 100 communities between Minnesota and Louisiana — pushed the Trump administration to keep the database open, according to executive director Colin Wellenkamp.
“It was a critical database that showed us where costs associated with disasters were most impactful. What sectors of the economy were hit the hardest by a disaster? Whether it be intense heat, flooding, drought, forest fire, named storm event or otherwise,” Wellenkamp said.
From a cost-benefit analysis standpoint, said Wellenkamp, the database can tell cities, counties and states how to spend resources on mitigation to avoid incurring similar costs from future disasters. But industries like manufacturing, construction and agriculture also want to see the data, he said. That’s because the database’s financial impact analysis includes physical damage to commercial and residential property, losses associated with business interruption and crop destruction, damage to electrical infrastructure and more.
Other stakeholders that see the value of the database are both the insurance and re-insurance industries.
Franklin Nutter is the president of the Reinsurance Association of America, one of the largest trade groups in the country. The goal of reinsurance is to provide insurance for the insurance companies, stabilizing the industry and playing a role in “the financial management of natural disaster losses,” according to the association’s website. 
“It’s like an iceberg: the public is made aware of the impact of extreme weather by seeing the graphics (the tip of the iceberg) but most commercial users value the underlying data (the body of the iceberg),” said Nutter by email.
While the billion-dollar disaster data is valuable to financial stakeholders, Nutter said he believes its greatest value comes from providing “public awareness of the increasing extreme weather risk.”
There are many factors that come together to make a billion-dollar disaster — such as weather, infrastructure, population and location. Labe said that the number of events has been increasing since 1980. 
“It’s very likely that 2025 will not be the costliest year on record when we look at the statistics, but it definitely falls into this long-term increasing trend,” he said.
Climate Central is not the only organization trying to pick up the pieces of a resource that was shut down by the federal government or is at risk. 
Last month, amid growing concerns over the future of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative announced it would be partnering with a nonprofit called Convoy of Hope to provide aid within 72 hours of disasters for communities along the Mississippi River. 
But Wellenkamp said  there aren’t many states that can afford the response and recovery efforts from a billion-dollar disaster.
“These (initiatives) are not meant to be permanent solutions,” Wellenkamp said. “These are not meant to replace federal capacity. They are meant to put our cities in a relatively secure position until the federal questions are answered. And the sooner that those answers come, the better.”
For many, the answers will require data. 
“Just because the federal government decided they’re not going to do it anymore doesn’t mean it’s not worth doing,” Koon said.

Webster/Verite News)NEW ORLEANS – A federal judge ruled Friday the state of Louisiana will be allowed to file a legal challenge to the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office’s longstanding immigration policy, which prohibits jail staff from honoring federal requests to detain people suspected of being in the country illegally past their release dates.
The jail’s so-called “sanctuary” policy, adopted more than a decade ago, resulted from a settlement in a federal civil rights lawsuit filed by two construction workers, Mario Cacho and Antonio Ocampo, who were picked up by New Orleans police on minor charges in 2009 and 2010, respectively, and sentenced to jail time.
Friday’s order, by federal Magistrate Judge Janis van Meerveld, the state as a named party, which will in turn allow state Attorney General Liz Murrill to pursue a motion to dissolve the settlement.
“It’s clear that the consent judgment in this case should be dissolved on its own terms, among other reasons,” Murrill said in a statement on Friday. “I look forward to ending it and encourage the Sheriff to adopt a policy that does not obstruct ICE or conflict with State and federal law.”
Following the lead of President Donald Trump, Louisiana Republicans, including Murrill and Gov. Jeff Landry, have targeted such sanctuary policies in New Orleans for years. During Trump’s first term, Landry, when he was attorney general, challenged a similar policy adopted by the New Orleans Police Department as part of its long-running federal consent decree, saying the limits it places on officers working with federal immigration authorities compelled the city to “violate federal law.”
The police policy is also likely in jeopardy now that the federal judge overseeing the NOPD consent decree has said she will allow the department to exit federal oversight earlier than expected.
In the 2010 lawsuit that led to the sheriff’s office policy, Cacho and Ocampo alleged that they were illegally held by the sheriff’s office for months past the completion of their sentences. The two were held on a hold request — also known as an immigration detainer — from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Such requests are only legally valid for 48 hours.
Attorneys for Cacho and Ocampo did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the order.
In 2013, then-Sheriff Marlin Gusman settled by agreeing to adopt a new policy placing restrictions on immigration investigations inside the jail. The resulting policy blocked the agency from investigating immigration violations and from detaining immigrants for ICE without a court order, except in certain cases where they are facing charges for a small number of serious violent crimes.
Murrill filed a challenge to the policy earlier this year, arguing that it conflicts with a new state law, passed in 2024, that prohibits local law enforcement agencies from prohibiting their employees from fully cooperating with ICE investigations.
Van Meerveld’s Friday order said the state has a right to pursue that challenge because it has demonstrated that the state has an interest in enforcing its laws.
Though the sheriff’s office is a political subdivision of the state, Sheriff Susan Hutson, van Meerveld added, has shown that she will not adequately represent the state’s interests in the case. The judge pointed to a provision of the 2013 settlement that allows the policy to be adjusted in the event of a change to state or federal law that applies to immigration detainers.
But despite the new state law, van Meerveld wrote in her opinion, the sheriff’s office “has undertaken no action to modify or rescind the policy.”
“Here, it has become obvious that the OPSO cannot represent the State’s interest.”
Hutson, who has previously maintained that the sheriff’s office has not hindered the work of federal immigration authorities, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday’s order. Sheriff-elect Michelle Woodfork also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Morsa Images/DigitalVision via Getty Images)We’ve all been there: You wait 45 minutes in the exam room when the doctor finally walks in.
They seem rushed. A few questions, a quick exam, a glance at the clock and then a rapid-fire plan with little time for discussion — and you leave feeling unheard, hurried and frustrated.
And what if you’re hospitalized? You may face a similar experience.
More than half of U.S. adults say their doctors have ignored or dismissed their concerns, or not taken their symptoms seriously, according to a December 2022 national poll.
It’s easy to blame the doctor. But the reality is, most doctors would like to sit down and have an in-depth conversation with patients and their families. Instead, your unpleasant visit may be the result of productivity pressures and administrative burdens, often shaped by health care systems, payment models and policy decisions that influence how care is delivered.
Patients are increasingly experiencing what’s known as administrative harm — those unintended but very real consequences arising from administrative decisions, made far upstream, that directly influence how doctors practice. Ultimately, these types of interactions affect the care patients receive and their outcomes.
As a doctor and researcher who specializes in business and health care delivery, I’ve studied how organizational decisions have ripple effects, shaping patients’ relationships with their doctor and the quality of care they receive. Patients may be unaware of these upstream administrative decisions, but they affect everything from time allotted for an appointment to the number of patients the doctor has to see and whether a visit is covered by insurance.
 
A look behind the scenes
Increasingly, health care organizations and physician groups face intense financial pressures. Many doctors can no longer sustain their private practice due to declining reimbursements, rising costs and increasing administrative burdens; instead, they’ve become employees of larger health care systems. In some cases, their practices have been acquired by private equity groups.
With this shift, doctors have less control over their workloads and the time they get with their patients. More and more, payment models fail to cover the true cost of care. The default solution is often for doctors to see more patients with less time for each, and to squeeze in additional work after hours.
But that approach comes with costs, among them the time needed to build meaningful connections with patients. That negative, impolite tone you may have experienced might be because the doctor has many patients waiting and a full evening ahead just to catch up on writing visit notes, reviewing medical records and completing other required documentation. During the work day, they’re often fielding over 100 messages and alerts daily, including referrals and coordinating care, all while trying to focus on the patient in front of them.
But the consequences go beyond their bedside manner. Research makes clear that doctors’ performance and the quality of care patients receive are affected by their workload. A similar pattern is true with nurses: Their higher workloads are associated with higher death rates among hospitalized patients.
Suppose you’re hospitalized for pneumonia, but because your doctor is caring for too many patients, your hospital stay is longer, which increases your risks of infection, muscle loss and other adverse outcomes. In the doctor’s office, a rushed visit can mean delayed or missed diagnoses and even prescription errors.
About half of U.S. doctors report feelings of burnout, and about one-third are considering leaving their current job, with 60% of those likely to leave clinical practice entirely.
Long work hours also brings higher risks of heart disease, stroke and other health problems for health care professionals. In the U.S., 40% of doctors work 55 hours per week or more, compared with less than 10% of workers in other fields.
 
A better way

The administrative harms stemming from upstream decisions are not inevitable. In large part, they are preventable. Overhauling the health care system may seem daunting, but patients and doctors are not powerless.
Patients and their families must advocate for themselves. Ask questions and be direct. This phrase: “I am still really worried about … ” will quickly get your doctor’s attention. If your visit seems rushed, share it with patient representatives or through patient surveys. These insights help administrative leaders recognize when systems are falling short.
Doctors and care teams should not normalize unsustainable work conditions. Health systems need structured, transparent mechanisms that make it easy and safe for doctors and care team members to report when workloads, staffing or administrative decisions may be harming patients.
Even more powerful is when patients and their doctors speak up together. Collective voices can drive meaningful change — such as lobbying for adequate time, staffing or policies to support high-quality, patient-centered care. It is also important for administrative leaders and policymakers to take responsibility for how decisions affect both patients and the care team.
More research is needed to define what safe, realistic work standards look like and how care teams should be structured. For example, when does it make sense for a doctor to provide care, or a physician assistant or nurse practitioner? At the same time, health systems have the opportunity to think creatively about new care models that address clinician shortages.
But research shows that the medical profession can’t afford to wait for perfect data to act on what’s already clear. Overworked and understaffed teams hurt both patients and their doctors.
Yet when doctors do have enough time, the interactions feel different — warmer, more patient and more attentive. And as research shows, patient outcomes improve as well.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner) OMAHA — Former President Joe Biden highlighted harsh economic realities facing American families under President Donald Trump. And Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear pitched a recipe for helping Democrats win in deep-red states. 
Both headliners for the Nebraska Democrats’ top annual fundraiser Friday rallied a downtown Hilton crowd of more than 600 people headed into next year’s midterm elections, in which the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District could play a crucial role.
Friday was Biden’s first public speaking event since dropping out of the 2024 presidential campaign under fire from some in the party about his electability following a shaky debate performance against Trump.

He criticized Trump on a variety of issues, from cutting Medicare in the “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill to Trump’s handling of the “strong economy” Biden said he left him. He said Trump had taken a wrecking ball to the Constitution.
“Folks, look, this isn’t a golden age,” Biden said. “The fact of the matter is that it is a very, very dark moment … But we’re in a situation where we had something very special happen just last Tuesday.”
The fundraiser followed strong national elections for Democrats on Tuesday. The party won most of its high-profile contests nationally, including the Governor’s Office in Virginia and the mayor’s race in New York. Some political observers have said the tone and mood of the electorate might hint at what’s possible in the midterms, when the party out of power typically gains seats.
Much of Biden’s speech focused on helping Democrats send a message to his successor: “You work for us, Mr. President. We don’t work for you. You work for us, not just billionaires and millionaires.”

Biden also touted some of his accomplishments as president, including working with Congress to pass the largest modern investment in American infrastructure, a bipartisan bill he passed with help from retiring Nebraska Republican U.S. Rep. Don Bacon and others.
Beshear, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential hopeful, spoke about how his approach to politics focuses on working for all Kentuckians, not just those who share his party. He said he governs in a way that can serve as a model for Democrats to win in deeply red, Republican states. 
Beshear’s approach tries to bring party members and others together — including progressives, union members, centrists and some Republicans — over economic concerns, which lets him sidestep many of the social issues distracting other campaigns.
“We’ve got to get back to the work of showing people that we are spending all day, every day, trying to make their life a little bit better and a little bit easier,”  Beshear said.
He visited Nebraska after having headed to South Carolina earlier this year to test the water for a potential bid. He also visited neighboring Iowa in 2024 to speak at a Democratic fundraiser.

Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr. set much of the evening’s tone when he warmed up the crowd by putting on a blue and white “Make America Humane Again” hat — poking fun at Trump’s bright red “Make America Great Again” hats. 
“Let’s make America humane again,” he said after being introduced as the first Democrat to lead Nebraska’s largest city in a dozen years.

Jane Kleeb, chair of the state party, said Friday that the blue “wave” Democrats want in 2026 started in May 2025 in Nebraska, with Ewing’s win over three-term Republican incumbent Mayor Jean Stothert.
Ewing criticized Trump’s handling of immigration policy and the ICE raids happening across the U.S. He mentioned the administration’s bulldozing of homeless encampments and sending the National Guard into cities. Democrats gathered as pro-Palestinian protesters demonstrated outside of the hotel. 
“We are going to stand with our immigrants when the national state is trying to create chaos,” Ewing said. “We are going to build a space and a city and an economy that works for everybody, not just the rich.”
Republicans took notice of the Biden and Beshear visits. U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts’ GOP campaign sent a truck with a digital ad on it driving through downtown Omaha during the fundraiser, attacking his registered nonpartisan opponent Dan Osborn by labeling him on it as the “future of the Democratic Party.”

The Nebraska Republican Party, in a statement, said, “If Nebraska Democrats think the presence of the former president will make people forget about the radical Democrats’ policies, inflation, open borders and out-of-control spending, they’re wrong.”
But local Democrats paid no mind, as many spoke in positive tones about the Democrats’ chances in future elections — especially in the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District. 
The Omaha-based district was the only swing district nationally to side with Democrats in 2024, when Trump won every contested swing state and won the presidency, except for the stray Electoral College vote that Nebraska allows its congressional districts to syphon off. 
Omaha, along with the rest of the 2nd Congressional District, voted for Biden in 2020 and sided with former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024.

And this year’s version of the 2nd District U.S. House race is shaping up to be another charged one, with a crowded Democratic primary vying to replace Republican U.S. Rep Don Bacon, who decided to retire early this year. Political experts view the seat as a possible pickup for Democrats. 
That 2nd District slice of the 2026 midterm elections is emerging as crucial for the state and national Democratic Party as it tries to find a path toward retaking the House from Republicans. Mid-decade redistricting efforts, including one being discussed in Nebraska, have made that effort more complex.
Nebraska Democrats have said they have designs on winning beyond the 2nd District, especially in legislative races that could spell the difference between the ability to filibuster conservative legislation or not.
The Nebraska Democratic Party’s top annual fundraising event has a history of drawing major headliners, including former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a former vice presidential candidate. One reason: Kleeb, the state party chair, serves as a vice chair of the party at the national level. 
The event is named for Ben Nelson, a former Nebraska governor and U.S. senator who cast a critical vote to help the party pass the Affordable Care Act under former President Barack Obama. His former vice president encouraged Democrats and others not to despair but to work.
“The American experiment is not going to end on our watch,” said Biden.

A press release earlier Friday from California Gov. Gavin Newsom said some Californians had begun to see full benefits on their cards, following an order from a lower court.High court challenge In a Friday evening brief to the Supreme Court that followed a day of conflicting messages from the administration, U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the high court should step in to protect the executive branch’s power from what he characterized as unprecedented overreach by McConnell.By demanding that the USDA transfer money from a $23 billion fund for child nutrition programs to pay for November SNAP benefits, McConnell substituted his judgment for the agency’s, a violation of the constitutional separation-of-powers doctrine, Sauer argued. The department’s decision to pay for partial November benefits, by using the roughly $5 billion remaining in a contingency fund, rather than by paying about $9 billion for a full month of benefits, was its decision to make and not reviewable by courts, Sauer said.“USDA reasonably determined that the best course was to combine partial SNAP payments with stable funding for Child Nutrition Programs—versus jeopardize the latter to guarantee full payments with the former,” Sauer wrote. “The district court would have done otherwise. But it had no legal basis to ‘substitute its own policy judgment for that of the agency.’”Confusion in states The lower court order — as well a midday Friday letter from the USDA to state SNAP administrators — had also led to confusion among states who started to demand SNAP funds in a way Sauer compared to a bank run.Several states announced full funding would be available and began sending money to beneficiaries.Immediately after McConnell’s order was published, Wisconsin demanded “100% of SNAP benefits,” Sauer wrote. Even though the USDA system rejected the file, the private-sector processor of the payment moved forward, moved forward, resulting in Wisconsin currently overdrawing its letter of credit by $20 million,” he said.Kansas made a similar move. And some California SNAP users received their full benefits, according to Sauer’s brief.16 million children on SNAPMcConnell on Thursday had ruled the department’s decision to withhold SNAP benefits arbitrary and capricious — the standard for judicial review of an executive branch action. The $23 billion fund could spare the $4 billion needed to make November SNAP benefits whole and still maintain its intended purpose well beyond the month, so there was no need to maintain that fund at that level, he wrote.Instead, the decision “predictably magnifies harm and undermines the very purpose of the program it administers,” McConnell wrote.While federal agencies are due discretion from courts, such a “poor” use of decision-making power must be remedied, he said.“Contrary to what the Defendants claim, 29 million children who participate in the Child Nutrition Program are not at risk of immediately going hungry in the event of a transfer,” he said. “Instead, SNAP recipients—16 million of whom are children—will go hungry if they do not receive their SNAP benefits this month.”‘Starve Peter to feed Paul’But Sauer responded that was not McConnell’s call to make. The trial judge’s ruling improperly assumed that Congress would eventually replenish the child nutrition program fund, but the USDA was within its right to take a more cautious approach toward protecting the child nutrition funding, said the solicitor general.“It obviously was not unlawful for the agency to see things differently—and refuse to starve Peter to feed Paul, by gambling school lunches tomorrow in exchange for more SNAP money today,” he wrote. “Indeed, that sort of hard tradeoff is precisely the sort of decision that Congress committed to agency discretion and placed beyond the reach of judges.”While the USDA had not denied that it was able to move money to different priorities after Congress had appropriated it, the government did not have to do so, Sauer said.Allowing McConnell’s ruling to stand would invite a stampede to litigation, the government maintained.“If allowed to stand, this decision will metastasize and sow further shutdown chaos,” Sauer said. “Every beneficiary of a federal program could run into court, point to an agency’s general discretion to prioritize funding, and claim that failing to prioritizetheir chosen program was arbitrary and capricious.”Trump social media postSauer also said McConnell read too much into Trump’s social media post this week that threatened to withhold SNAP funding for the duration of the shutdowns.McConnell cited in his order the post, in which Trump said SNAP benefits would “be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!” showed the true purpose of the USDA move was political leverage.Sauer said that was improper.“The court below had no basis to transfer of billions of dollars from school lunches to its preferred program based on its tendentious view of ‘the administration’s true motivations.’”In a statement, Skye Perryman, the president and CEO of Democracy Forward, an advocacy group that is leading the litigation to force SNAP payments, said the group would continue to work to “secure benefits for the American people”“The Trump-Vance administration continues to attempt — over and over — to take food out of the hands of families, seniors, workers, and children,” Perryman said. “And every time they tried, the courts told them what the law already makes clear: they cannot. American families should not be used as political props in a shutdown that this White House manufactured.”",,,,2025-11-07 22:16:51.473823

(Legislative Support Services)Eight Democratic state lawmakers in Washington retained their seats in this week’s election, with a ninth on the cusp of winning.
State Rep. Edwin Obras inched closer to success Friday in the tightest House contest. Sen. Deb Krishnadasan declared victory a day earlier in the year’s most expensive duel among a stack of special elections for legislative seats.
Obras led Kevin Schilling, a fellow Democrat, by a margin of 50.6% to 47.7% in the 33rd Legislative District. More votes will be counted in the days ahead. Located south of Seattle, the district includes Burien, Normandy Park, Des Moines, SeaTac and much of Kent.
Competing in his first general election, Obras trailed Schilling, the mayor of Burien, in early rounds of ballot counting. But the SeaTac lawmaker edged in front by 205 votes Thursday and increased his lead to 641 in Friday’s count.
“If the trends continue and Edwin is victorious, congratulations to him,” Schilling said Friday.
Meanwhile, Krishnadasan, of Gig Harbor, beat Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier in the 26th District that covers part of Kitsap and Pierce counties. Caldier, who is in her sixth term in the House, conceded Thursday. 
“I’m excited to continue working together in the year ahead to deliver practical, bipartisan solutions that make life more affordable, strengthen our schools, and protect access to quality health care,” Krishnadasan said in a statement.
This was the closest-watched legislative race of the year and, as of Election Day, had attracted roughly $4 million in combined spending by candidates and outside interest groups. Nearly one-third of those dollars were spent by independent committees opposing Krishnadasan.
Her win means Democrats will hold their 30-19 seat advantage in the state Senate heading into 2026. 
“The voters have spoken. While I’m disappointed in the outcome, I’m incredibly grateful for everyone who stood with me in this campaign to bring balance back to Olympia,” Caldier, a Gig Harbor resident, wrote in a statement.
In King County, Sen. Victoria Hunt defeated Republican Chad Magendanz of Issaquah, a former state lawmaker. This was the other contest GOP leaders viewed as an opportunity to slim Democrats’ advantage in the Senate. 
Hunt, also of Issaquah, was elected to the state House last year and appointed to the Senate following the unexpected death of Sen. Bill Ramos in April. The district covers Issaquah, Black Diamond, Covington, and part of Snoqualmie.
“I’m honored to have defended this seat and continue in the footsteps of my mentor and beloved friend of so many,” Hunt wrote on Facebook.
Also in King County, Sen. Vandana Slatter, of Bellevue, easily overcame the challenge of a fellow Democrat, state Rep. Amy Walen of Kirkland, in the 48th District. The two previously served together in the House. Walen was the race’s moderate, Slatter more progressive.
“The foundation of this win is community and this community showed up,” Slatter posted on social media. “We faced well-funded opposition, but we had something far more powerful: you.”
This contest, like the all-Democrat match-up in the 33rd District, vented the philosophical tensions between the party’s progressive and centrist forces. A  political committee, whose donors include campaign arms of House and Senate Democrats and labor unions, spent money opposing Walen and Schilling.
“Unfortunately, this election didn’t go our way,” Walen wrote on Facebook. She pledged to keep pushing for policies she campaigned on — increasing affordable housing, improving access to health care and making communities safer.
Like Caldier, she’ll continue serving in the House.
“While I didn’t win this election, I still have another year in my term,” she wrote.
Five other Democrats in safe western Washington seats sailed to re-election. 
Rep. Janice Zahn, D-Bellevue, trounced Republican John Whitney of Bellevue in the 41st District and Rep. Osman Salahuddin, D-Redmond, captured more than twice as many votes as Republican Dennis Ellis of Redmond in the 48th District.

Critics say he's playing political games, but Brown says he's merely protecting the rights of Maryland and its residents.","Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown in a conference room at his office in Baltimore on Oct. 22. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)When Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) walked to the podium Thursday to announce a lawsuit against the Trump administration’s plans to keep the new FBI headquarters out of Maryland, he might have had a sense of déjà vu.
Since President Donald Trump (R returned to office on Jan. 20, Brown has walked up to a lot of podiums to announce a lot of legal actions against the administration.
In less than 10 months, Brown’s office has filed or joined other Democrat-led states, in 43 lawsuits against administration actions and has filed or joined in about 70 legal briefs in support of lawsuits by others challenging administration policies — including one on Friday, when Maryland joined 25 states challenging an administration plan to cut food assistance during the government shutdow..
That’s more in less than a year than the 95 lawsuits that former Attorney General Brian Frosh (D) led or joined during fur years of the first Trump term, from 2017 to 2021.
“It’s voluminous. There’s no doubt about that,” Brown said during an interview last month in his Baltimore office.
“I committed to Marylanders I would only bring actions that I think directly impact their rights, their privileges, their benefits, their well-being, and that I would protect the sovereignty of Maryland when challenged by the administration,” he said.
Apparently, he sees a lot of those challenges.
The lawsuits started coming the day after Trump’s inauguration, when Maryland joined New Jersey and 16 other states to block Trump’s executive order ending birthright citizenship. The latest was an Oct. 1 lawsuit challenging a policy that would have denied victim assistance funds to anyone who cannot prove their citizenship status.
Maryland sues Trump administration for ‘illegal’ action to keep FBI headquarters in D.C.

They have continued in between, sometimes at a pace of several per week, with lawsuits that challenge the White House’s efforts to rescind previously approved money for schools, to share personal health care informaton with the Department of Homeland Security and to deploy National Guard troops in Illinois.
Maryland has been a supporting player in many of the actions, but he led in others, including lawsuits to restore funding for the AmeriCorps program and to block the mass layoffs of probationary federal workers, and a brief in support of other groups seeking to protect transgender rights.
Brown stresses that his office is not “attacking the president. We’re challenging the actions that he takes.” For instance, he pointed to a suit in May against the U.S. Department of Transportation and Secretary Sean Duffy who wanted to withhold funds from states that don’t comply with White House immigration policy.
“When the president says that he’s going to attach conditions to transportation funding that could jeopardize important projects like the Key Bridge, like the completion of the Purple Line … he’s tying conditions entirely unrelated to transportation, but pursuing his own agenda,” Brown said. “I think Marylanders recognize that their attorney general ought to, and we are in fact, stepping up to defend the interests of the state.
“I invite anyone to come and point out to me something that this [a legal action] is nothing more than a political attack. I think you’d be hard pressed to find one.”
Not everyone agrees.
Del. Lauren Arikan (R-Harford) said the actions of the attorney general’s office against the Trump administration are “politically motivated more than policy motivated.”
“We’ve dumped a lot of extra money into the AG’s office for all kinds of things. And what is the taxpayer seeing for it?” she asked. “We’re getting higher taxes. Housing crisis, an energy crisis. We’re not seeing the fruits of our taxpayer dollars being used efficiently,.
“Suing the Trump administration over and over again is a total waste of Maryland taxpayer money,” Arikan said Oct. 23.
‘Constitutional revolution’
Mark Graber, a constitutional law professor at the University of Maryland’s Francis King Carey Law School in Baltimore, said the lawsuits are political in the sense that only Democratic attorneys general are suing the Trump administration. On the other hand, Graber said those prosecutors are opposing certain actions by the administration.

Graber said some decisions in lower federal courts have favored the Democratic prosecutors in cases heard by judges appointed by Republican presidents. Some federal judges “are supporting these lawsuits in the sense that they’re finding the lawsuits are valid, have solid grounds,” he said.
He said the U.S. Supreme Court has been much more supportive of the president so far. “It’s rather interesting that the Supreme Court appears to be more partisan than the lower federal courts,” Graber said.
He cited the “Just Security” website, a  litigation tracker of legal challenges to the Trump administration, maintained by the Reiss Center on Law and Security at New York University School of Law. As of Friday, Just Security was tracking 515 cases pending against the administration..
“It’s clear the Trump administration is pushing on the borders of the existing understandings of constitutionalism. It is attempting a constitutional revolution every bit as revolutionary as the revolution that led to the New Deal and the post-Civil War amendments,” Graber said. “It simply has a very different understanding of the Constitution than has existed previously.”
When asked what can be done to ensure the constitution is adhered to, Graber summarized three actions: file lawsuits, hold peaceful protests “in the streets” and “most importantly, when the time comes, vote.”
‘Political publication’
Not all of the opposition to federal policy has come in the form of a lawsuit or a brief. The attorney general’s office, for example, released a guidance memo Oct. 15 to remind Maryland law enforcement agencies that they must adhere to state law when working with federal authorities.
The guidance was required in legislation approved on the last day of the 2025 General Assembly session dealing with immigration enforcement. Part of the law requires the attorney general to “develop and publish guidance that informs the public and relevant state agencies” about immigration enforcement.
The 11-page document lists what local police “must do, may do and must not do” in a range of interactions with federal authorities, from simple backup to formal joint task force agreements. More specifically, it states Maryland officers “may not enforce civil immigration laws or assist federal agents in enforcing such laws.”
Maryland leads multistate brief calling Trump deployment of Guard ‘unlawful’

The memo highlights the 287(g) agreements that some Maryland sheriff’s department have made with Immigration and Customs Enforcement that let the local law enforcement officials take on certain immigration enforcement abilities. In Maryland, those agreements are largely restricted to the jail-based model of the agreement, where jails can execute administrative immigration warrants on people already in their custody.
But the guidance from the attorney general’s office cautions that “prohibitions on participating in civil immigration enforcement apply even when Maryland officers are operating under an agreement with federal authorities, including an agreement with ICE under Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.”
Del. J. Sandy Bartlett (D-Anne Arundel), vice chair of the House Judiciary Committee, said the guidance was “well written” and “well researched,” and will not only benefit law enforcement agencies, but the immigrant community as well.
“I think that is exactly why we [General Assembly] asked for such guidance,” she said. “I’m very glad that the attorney general has been so explicit in explaining to us, or to the officers, and giving them the guidance that they need.”
But Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler, whose department has participated in a 287(g) agreement since 2016, called the attorney general’s guidance “more of a political publication tied to the national immigration debate than a practical law enforcement directive.”
“My concern is that it could be misinterpreted in a way that discourages law enforcement from sending aid to federal partners during real criminal emergencies, such as the assaults on federal officers and other acts of violence we have witnessed across the United States,” Gahelr said in a statement last month. “I hope that was not the intent, because the Harford County Sheriff’s Office will always respond when a crime is being committed or when anyone, to include local, state, or federal law enforcement, is under attack while doing their job.”
Brown said the guidance is nothing more than what it claims to be: A guide to help law enforcement agencies and to remind them of what the restrictions are, even with 287(g) programs.
“If you’re undocumented and you are a violent offender, you should be held accountable. And if that accountability means removal from this country, then that’s what it means,” he said. “What I don’t think is prudent with limited law enforcement resources available to any agency is to begin focusing on the enforcement of immigration law.”
On the question of politics vs. policy in the actions the attorney general chooses to take, Sen. Chris West (R-Baltimore County and Carroll), agrees with Arikan that at times it does “seem like a broken record, just day after day” suing the Trump administration.
But West, an attorney, said last month the Democratic attorneys general are not the only ones who play that game. He would like to see attorneys general, both Democratic and Republican, focus more on their constituents and less on the politics.
“Are they really spending their time and the money and the resources at their disposal effectively to represent their constituents? Or are they engaging in efforts which will benefit them politically, but won’t have much real impact on the people of their states?” he asked. “My feeling is what’s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. My message to both groups is stop it.”

(U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee video screenshot)The Alaska Supreme Court has disbarred former U.S. District Court Judge Josh Kindred, banning him from practicing law in the state, “effective immediately.”
The court’s decision was announced Friday, a little over three months after the Alaska Bar Association recommended the action.
Kindred, recommended by Alaska Republican Sens. Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski, was appointed by President Donald Trump to the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska in 2019 and confirmed to the office in 2020.
He resigned last year after investigators found that he had a “sexualized relationship” with a clerk who became a prosecutor and lied about it to a senior judge and investigators, and maintained a hostile workplace for law clerks.
Since his resignation, the outcome of dozens of criminal and civil cases has been called into question because of the relationship between Kindred and the prosecutor, and one conviction has already been tossed out.
After Kindred’s resignation, an attorney filed a complaint with the Alaska Bar Association, which regulates attorneys in the state. 
The association ordered an investigation that concluded Kindred’s actions had caused “grievous harm” to the practice of law in the state, and it voted to recommend that he be stripped of his license.
In Alaska, such an action requires approval by the Alaska Supreme Court.
Two of the court’s five justices — Jennifer Henderson and Aimee Oravec — recused themselves from the proceedings in order to avoid the appearance of impropriety. 
According to a court official, Henderson’s husband was friends with Kindred before his resignation, and Oravec’s husband was Kindred’s coworker for a time.
The remaining three justices — Chief Justice Susan Carney, Justice Dario Borghesan, and Justice Jude Pate — voted unanimously to “adopt the findings and conclusions of the disciplinary board.”
They ordered Kindred be “disbarred from the practice of law in Alaska, effective immediately.”
Kindred must also pay $1,000 in costs and attorney fees to the Alaska Bar Association within 60 days.
If he seeks to have his law license restored, he must undergo training “in the area of ethics, law office management, and management of law office accounts” as well as pay restitution in relevant matters.
Kindred did not appear before the Supreme Court or participate in its discussions; he also did not participate in the Bar Association’s investigation.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)The Trump administration told states Friday that it would be releasing funds to support federal food assistance during the government shutdown — just hours before winning a Supreme Court stay of lower court orders, apparently putting the payments on hold again.
It is just the latest example of the on-again, off-again policy changes that have left benefit recipients guessing on their status, and states, counties and local food aid organizations riding the policy “roller coaster”that has federal support for food assistance here one moment, gone the next.
It has also made it “difficult to know what to communicate” to recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, for the state and county officials who administer the program.
“I think the roller coaster is really with the federal government,” said Heather Bois Bruskin, director of the Office of Food Systems Resilience in Montgomery County. “First it was that the November benefits won’t be coming. Then with the court action, they were directed to release the funds that are set aside for SNAP benefits in situations just like this.
“At this moment, it is very uncertain when and how and in what amount the federal government will be contributing to SNAP benefits for November.”
Meanwhile, state and some county officials are moving funds around in an effort to mitigate the damage, regardless of how things shake out at the federal level.
Anne Arundel, Montgomery, Baltimore counties and the city of Baltimore have allocated additional dollars to support local meal assistance networks and help provide meals for families who may be struggling to put food on the table.
US Supreme Court temporarily blocks November SNAP payments

For example, Bruskin said that Montgomery County plans to move an additional $3.5 million next week for the local food network, adding on to county dollars already earmarked to help food banks and pantries.
Gov. Wes Moore (D) last week declared a state of emergency that allowed him to allocate $10 million for food pantries around the state. He followed that on Tuesday with the announcement that the state would budget $62 million under the same emergency order directly to SNAP recipients in the state for their November benefits.
Maryland officials said Friday that the $62 million earmarked in that executive order will still go out, paying for about half of the monthly SNAP benefits for the more than 680,000 Marylanders in the program. Those funds will be loaded into electronic benefit transfer accounts on Monday night and will be available Tuesday for those whose benefits have already lapsed.
“Maryland families shouldn’t have to suffer because the federal government chose to pause vital benefits,” Maryland Human Services Secretary Rafael López in a written statement. “We will move urgently to get Marylanders the SNAP benefits their families depend on to put food on the table.”
Since Nov. 4, an average of 30,000 Marylanders a day have seen benefits lapse as funds that would have refreshed their accounts were tied up in court and in policy fights,  That means that approximately 120,000 Marylanders this week have been waiting for their electronic benefit cards to be refilled.
“It’s tragic for those families,” Del. Emily Shetty (D-Montgomery) said. “We’ve heard anecdotally of families who have gone to the grocery store and found out subsequently that they didn’t have money on their cards.”
Shetty, who chairs the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees social services, said she grew up in poverty. She said that the days of uncertainty about the availability of federal SNAP funds is “problematic” for families that need the extra help.
“This is a life I am very familiar with,” she said. “Poverty is something that is often forced upon families, and this is why I feel so passionate that poor people cannot be pawns in these broader political games.”
SNAP mishaps
On Friday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture told states that it was working toward releasing total funding for SNAP benefits in November. That was a reversal from the outlook from just days before, when it was uncertain if funds would come down at all following recent court challenges and social media statements from President Donald Trump (R) threatening to withhold payments to punish Democrats.
Maryland commits $62 million to fund share of November SNAP benefits USDA won’t pay for

Even the Friday USDA letter that told states the agency was working to fill November SNAP benefits coincided with the Trump Administration’s effort to challenge its court-ordered requirement to fund SNAP.
The last twist in the saga came late Friday, when Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson granted the government’s request to temporarily block lower courts that had ordered the USDA to immediately fund 100% of SNAP benefits for the month. It was unclear what effect that would have on the government’s promise earlier in the day to start delivering the funds to states.
“It’s not something that is helpful to the communities that we serve to continue this back and forth, and to continue panicking the entire community that relies on hunger relief and hunger benefits,” Shetty said. “We were receiving an increase in constituent calls, not just from individuals who benefit from those programs. But also from our retailers and local food banks and shelters that were really concerned about the impact on the folks they were serving.
“This continued back and forth is par for the course for the administration, but it actually has a real effect on the people who are living in poverty,” Shetty said. “And we cannot continue using poor people as pawns in this political game at the national level. It’s just immoral.”

(Photo by Nicole Pilsbury/Maryland Matters)Todd Morman moved to Baltimore two years ago from North Carolina — a state he said Republicans “redistricted the hell” out of while he was there.
He thinks Maryland Democrats may now have a chance to counter what North Carolina Republicans did two years ago, but he is worried that Senate President Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) will stand in the way.
“I’ve seen this with politicians before — they get entrenched,” Morman said. “They fail to see the seriousness of the threat against the people at the bottom.”
Morman was one of dozens of people gathered on the first floor of the Maryland State House on Friday to call for Democrats to redraw the state’s congressional districts to counter partisan redistricting in GOP-led states — and specifically to rally against Ferguson’s opposition to redistricting.
Democrats in Maryland, as in other states, have been talking about the possibility of redrawing their congressional districts since this summer, when Republicans in Texas, at President Donald Trump’s urging, redistricted the state in a way that is expected to pick up five GOP seats.
But in an Oct. 28 letter, Ferguson said Senate Democrats would not be taking up redistricting in Maryland, where Democrats already hold seven of the state’s eight congressional seats. The letter said that redistricting mid-cycle could backfire on Democrats and end up costing them seats in the House for a variety of reasons.

Days later, Gov. Wes Moore (D) said he was leaning toward creating a commission to study redistricting in Maryland. He did just that on Nov. 4, the same day that California voters approved a redistricting that is expected to balance Texas’ plan.
That left Ferguson as the face of the opposition to redistricting, and the target of Friday’s State House rally.
“The abuse of power we are seeing is insane, and that starts with what we are seeing in Texas,” said Amar Mukunda, a rally attendant. “We cannot allow Trump to have a single additional vote in Congress.”
Protesters also raised concerns about the 287(g) program, which delegates Immigration and Customs Enforcement duties to local and state law enforcement officials. Sheriffs in eight Maryland counties currently participate in the program.
Volunteers from the protesting group read a letter to Ferguson that was organized by the Indivisible Maryland Coalition, the state chapeter of a national anti-authoritarianism protest group, that outlined their demand: a special session to redistrict Maryland and to eliminate the 287(g) program.
“Because of Maryland’s participation in the 287(g) program, ICE doesn’t pay for enforcement — local communities do,” one volunteer read from the letter.
Ferguson was not in Annapolis Friday. The protesters were met by his chief of staff, Sally McMillan Robb, who responded to their comments and questions about the two topics at hand.
“I think that what we heard from Sen. Ferguson’s representative — she was very gracious and very nice — but I think those were excuses,” Morman said. “His representative can say he really cares about that [threat of not redistricting], but he’s blocking the most important thing that we can do to get an extra vote in the House of Representatives.”
Robb explained that one reason for concern is that during the last redistricting, in 2022, a Dcmocratic plan was struck down by an Anne Arundel Circuit Court judge for “extreme partisan gerrymandering,” leading to the current 7-1 map that favors Democrats. If a new map landed back in court, the 2022 ruling could overturn it and, potentially, the current map, she said.
“A very real reality is with 31.5% of Marylanders registered [as Republicans], we are potentially turning it over for them, not only to strike down a new map, but to strike down the current map,” Robb said.

Protesters did not appear to be convinced, responding to Robb’s statement with comments about the power the Senate president holds and how the decisions should be debated, rather than blocked by Ferguson.
“I think it’s important, before any decisions are made, that he hears from constituents and allows constituents to have their say in public — a larger public forum would be wonderful,” said Theresa Delin, a Baltimore City resident at the rally. “Let the state senators discuss and vote rather than shutting down a conversation before it even starts.”
Dr. Margaret Winters, a Baltimore City resident and Indivisible Maryland Coalition member, helped to organize the event in hopes of letting Ferguson know that people are passionately opposed to his arguments.
“It [the rally] will give people the opportunity to go lobby their own senators in their own districts so that we can then pressure Sen. Ferguson from his peers,” Winters said. “When the people roar, the elected need to listen.”

Mohammed Rashid walked free on Friday for the first time since he arrived in the U.S. as a stowaway in July 2024, after fleeing Gaza to escape Hamas.
Judge Natalie Smith in Chelmsford Immigration Court, in Massachusetts, granted Rashid a $20,000 bond Thursday after the 29-year-old Palestinian man had been detained for more than 15 months. Most recently, he was held at Northwest State Correctional Facility in Saint Albans, Vermont.
Rashid never expected he would be detained for so long. Now, Rashid said he can’t wait to reunite with his relatives, who are driving from Ohio to reach him.

“Fifteen months, it’s been long time, and I lost a lot of things there: family, (a house), everything, friends,” Rashid said in an interview, referring to what he lost since the Israel-Hamas war started.  
What he most looks forward to doing now is talking with his mom. 
“I didn’t speak to her since I was locked up,” he said.
Rashid received asylum only four months after his arrival, but U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement appealed the judge’s decision, and Rashid remained detained. His case has been pending for more than 10 months with the Board of Immigration Appeals.

At the end of August, he was transferred to Vermont, and a group of lawyers with the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project found out about him during one of their regular legal orientations to inform people held in ICE detention of their rights. 
Andy Pelcher, one of Rashid’s attorneys, said he and his colleague, Emma Matters-Wood, were so shocked by Rashid’s story that they decided to take up the case with Nathan Virag, an attorney with the Association of Africans Living in Vermont.
The lawyers filed a habeas corpus petition to challenge the legitimacy of Rashid’s detention and went through two bond hearings in immigration court before ultimately obtaining his release on bond.
Going into Thursday’s hearing, Rashid said he was optimistic because he trusted his lawyers, but he was still nervous. He cried when the judge granted him bond.
Rashid said he hardly slept the night after the hearing. 
“I was like, ‘I’m waiting for the ICE decision to release me,’” Rashid said. “‘I can’t wait. I want to just be out. It’s America. Like, it’s a dream.’” 
After ICE processed the bond, Pelcher and Virag went to Northwest State Correctional Facility and waited for Rashid to be released on Friday.
“He went to hug Andy, and then he went to hug me,” Virag said. “No words even describe the moment. He just kept saying over and over that he’s free.”
Now, he’s ready to start his new life. 
“I actually want to look for a fashion job, model job, because it’s a dream for me to do this work. And I want to live in peace,” Rashid said. “I’m looking for this since I left my country, and I guess I’m gonna find it here.”

(Photo by Mike Clark for the Daily Montanan)The Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services anticipates the state will receive funding for a $1 billion Rural Health Transformation Program proposal it submitted to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, according to an agency official.
Montana submitted a five-year plan aimed at developing the rural workforce, stabilizing facility finances, expanding innovation, and increasing prevention, according to a presentation and news release this week from Gov. Greg Gianforte and health department Director Charlie Brereton.
The state anticipates it will learn whether Montana has been awarded funds in late December, although state officials said they are expecting success.
“The Rural Health Transformation Program is a historic investment in Montana’s future,” Gianforte said in a statement. “Since taking office, we’ve led on fixing what’s broken, making investments to improve access to quality health care. With the Rural Health Transformation Program, we will continue delivering better outcomes for families across Montana.”
The federal program is authorized to provide up to $50 billion nationally to participating states through 2030, according to the news release. The funding is specifically earmarked for stabilizing, transforming, and restructuring rural hospitals and other essential health care providers.
At a committee meeting this week, legislators asked questions about the proposal, including how much money would stay with the department versus be deployed, and raised concerns, such as that the funds are meant to appease people worried about federal cuts to Medicaid.
Sen. Cora Neumann, D-Bozeman, said she appreciates the amount of time DPHHS spent reaching out to stakeholders. She also questioned the program, although she said her skepticism was unrelated to the health department’s efforts.
“This is a Band-Aid coming from the federal government,” Neumann said. ” … This feels like a consolation prize to the states because we may lose a huge amount of funding, Medicaid funding.”
Neumann, who works in health care, said sustainable rural health care systems require investment, especially given the potential for rural hospital closures in Montana, and she wanted to know if the state planned to make investments.
At the Children, Families, Health and Human Services Committee meeting Wednesday, Brereton confirmed the plan includes direct funding to rural health systems.
He said specific ideas came from in-depth discussions with local health care providers, such as a roundtable in Glasgow with 30 law enforcement and local health care leaders.
“There will be money provided to critical access hospitals, other rural health care settings, in addition to quite a bit of purchasing,” Brereton said.
A DPHHS official said the state developed the plan with public input, including from a webinar with nearly 900 people, tribal consultation, 20 stakeholder groups, and other state agencies.
Brereton said spending details were laid out in “a very complex budget narrative document.” Neumann requested the information be shared, and Brereton said he would do so if CMS granted permission.
Rep. SJ Howell, D-Missoula, wanted to know what portion of funds would stay with DPHHS and what portion would go to stakeholders. Brereton said DPHHS has estimates, which he did not have immediately available but said he would provide.
One program that caught the attention of Rep. Jodee Etchart, R-Billings, was supporting emergency medical services in rural areas.
The program includes empowering EMS to “treat in place,” or deliver on-site care when feasible to reduce emergency room admissions. Money would go toward upgrading ambulances and other emergency equipment.
Etchart said one difficulty for EMS is some patients know that they can get help, but if they don’t get transported, they don’t end up getting billed, so they purposefully refuse transport. In the meantime, Etchart said, the company has to cover the costs of the staffing and products.
Rebecca de Camara, with DPHHS, said she doesn’t know whether people are intentionally declining transport to avoid billing, but she said it is the way the system is set up, and a need exists for treatment on site.
“The goal of this initiative is to expand the reimbursement that they can get,” de Camara said of EMS, noting that preventing unnecessary emergency department visits would save money.
The state submitted its plan to CMS on Wednesday, and de Camara said DPHHS believes it has a competitive application and will start working on next steps.
“We’ll continue our planning so that we are ready to go once the money starts rolling into the state,” de Camara said.
The news release said funding for the program will be allocated to states based on a formula: “50% divided equally among all approved states, 25% based on states’ rurality, and 25% based on how well each state’s proposed plan aligns with CMS criteria.”

Montana’s Rural Health Transformation Plan
Montana’s plan outlines five core initiatives, all designed to address the unique challenges of rural health care delivery in a sustainable manner:

Workforce Development: Focuses on increasing recruitment, expanding clinical training, and retaining various levels of rural health care providers in strong partnership with the Montana Department of Labor and Industry.
Sustainable Access: Stabilizes rural facility finances through restructuring recommendations and increased clinical and administrative partnerships. This component includes funding for the expansion of telehealth services, linking rural hospitals with statewide specialists and providing one-time-only awards for necessary telehealth equipment.
Innovative Care Models: Strengthens and expands value-based payment models and better leverages EMS and pharmacy services, with an emphasis on reducing emergency room admissions and other high-cost care interventions.
Community Health and Prevention: Provides for infrastructure upgrades and initiatives that incentivize healthy lifestyles, including expanding primary, behavioral, and dental health services in schools through partnerships with Federally Qualified Health Centers and other providers.
Technology Innovation: Focuses on using technology to increase access and improve data quality and sharing. This component includes funding for rural providers to modernize their Electronic Health Record systems.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/230426-CapitolStockPhotos09-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-07 19:56:33.497121

Through October, Kipp Bovey and her fellow nurse midwives closely tracked the patients whose due dates would come close to the Nov. 1 closure of the birthing center at Copley Hospital in Morrisville. They wondered who might be the one to see the final baby born before the center shuttered. When the last mother began her labor, it was only fitting that Bovey, as the nurse midwife who had worked there the longest, was the one to deliver the baby. 
“That was a blessing, and also tragic. And in the way that birth can be, it was so beautiful,” Bovey said, overcome with emotion at the significance of the moment.
Then, she immersed herself in the work as the birthing began. “The emotional piece of it got lost, because we were doing the work, and we were keeping people safe and healthy, and then it was done.”

When that last birth ended, so too did the nearly 100-year history of birthing at Copley Hospital after months of debate and efforts to preserve the beloved program.
As of Nov.1, not only has birthing ended at Copley, but so too has any prenatal and postpartum care, despite its statements made as recently as mid-October that those services would continue locally. On Nov. 7, a representative from Copley confirmed that at least for now the care is no longer available. 
The hospital said it has laid off the equivalent of 14 full-time staffers, including its three full-time nurse midwives, the part-time nurse midwife staff and its two obstetricians. The labor and delivery nurses have left for other hospitals, retired or been reassigned elsewhere in the hospital. The on-call pediatrician, too, is no longer retained, the hospital confirmed, meaning that person will no longer be able to consult on cases involving newborns and infants who come to the ER.
In June, the hospital’s leadership announced its decision to close the birthing center, citing low birth rates and high costs of keeping the service. A report produced by an independent consultant informed the hospital’s final decision. Birthing, which is widely considered an unprofitable “loss-leader” for hospitals, was costing the hospital an estimated $3.7 million a year, or $15,000–$30,000 per birth, according to the hospital.
Already, at least one other Vermont hospital, Northeastern Medical Center, in St. Albans, has confirmed that it is also looking at changes to its obstetric services due to a tight budget. The hospital’s board is considering a task force’s recommendation that NMC partner with an external organization to continue births and provide OB/GYN services at the hospital, the hospital’s spokesperson Kate Laddison confirmed to VTDigger. 
The fact that not very many babies are born at Copley, or in Lamoille County in general, has remained one of the hospital’s primary reasons for explaining the decision to close. For the 10 months of 2025 before the birthing center’s closing, Copley had 127 births. Since 2018, the hospital had seen around 160 births a year. Fewer than 50% of the births that happen in Lamoille County occur at Copley, the hospital cites.
Still, many feel that volume should not be the determining factor for something they feel is essential care to provide at a community hospital.
“Obstetrical care is, like, the one [part of] health care everyone uses at least once in their life. If that’s not essential health care, I don’t know what that is,” said April Vanderveer, one of the nurse midwives who had worked at Copley. 
‘Magical thinking’
Since the June announcement, Copley Hospital’s executives have engaged in a terse back and forth with the state’s health care regulator, the Green Mountain Care Board.
During their September budget decision, care board members requested more information from the Copley administration about the closure decision, and noted the hospital’s inability to comply. The transparency of the consultant’s report became a particular point of contention, with Copley agreeing to share it with the regulator only under the condition of confidentiality.
Ultimately, the hospital submitted responses to the care board’s August questions in a letter dated Oct. 17. Yet the report itself still remains inaccessible.
In the unsigned October letter, Copley writes that it “is collaborating with nearby hospital(s) to continue to provide prenatal and postpartum care locally along with continuing to provide care for their current gynecology services while providing navigation for birthing families to deliver at partnering hospitals.”
Carole Ferrante, Copley’s interim chief operating officer, confirmed to VTDigger that the hospital is not currently providing those services. However, staff have been in “close communication” with University of Vermont Medical Center, in Burlington, and Central Vermont Medical Center, in Berlin, about having a satellite pre- and post-natal clinic at the Morrisville hospital. 
Such a program is still in its nascent stages. “Those talks are just ongoing with them. They have their own challenges they are working through,” Ferrante said in a Nov. 7 interview. “They are just trying to work through the details to see if they can make a program like that viable.”
Former birth center staff have doubts. 
“There is no prenatal care happening or any plan to provide prenatal care in Lamoille County at this time,” Vanderveer said. “They can say that they want it to happen, but that’s magical thinking, because no one is doing that.”
Ferrante also added that though the hospital contacted Northeastern Vermont Regional Hospital, in St. Johnsbury and North Country Hospital, in Newport, neither community hospital was interested or able to take on a satellite service at Copley.
At Copley, both the hospital and the midwives, who collected patient data, expect nearly 40% of Copley’s patients will move their care to the University of Vermont Medical Center, while about 20% will go to Central Vermont Medical Center. Another 10% is likely to go to Gifford Medical Center, in Randolph, and another one-tenth will go to Northeastern. 
On average, patients will see a nearly 20-minute increase in drive times to reach care at any of these other hospitals. 
“What that means is people who are well-resourced and can drive to Burlington or Montpelier or St. Johnsbury, will for prenatal care,” said Vanderveer. 
She worries about the people who can’t take the time out of their work schedules to drive long distances for frequent prenatal appointments. 
“They’re not going to get adequate prenatal care. They are going to have higher risk pregnancies that are going to have complications that are going to be further along,” she explained. “If they get diabetes in pregnancy or high blood pressure, they’re not going to know about it until it’s extremely complex and that there is real risk involved.” 
A maternity care desert
With Copley’s closure and the 2022 closure of the Planned Parenthood clinic in Hyde Park, Lamoille County has become a maternity care desert, with no hospitals or birth centers offering obstetric care. 
Two gynecologists will remain at Copley, though Vanderveer adds that their responsibilities should encompass more complex reproductive care needs, rather than the day-to-day primary care that the midwives provided. In addition to birthing, nurse midwives’ services span a broad scope of reproductive health care: They insert IUDs, screen for STDs, help patients navigate menopause and more.
“It’s a huge loss that I don’t think people even realize goes beyond just the birth piece,” she said.
In an August study published in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology, researchers found that living in a maternal care desert, which they define as a county without obstetric care, was significantly associated with higher maternal mortality and pregnancy-related death, after analyzing more than 14 million live births between 2018 and 2021. 
“Ninety-five percent of the time [child birth] is totally straightforward, and you don’t need us [clinicians], but the 5% of the time you do, then it’s life saving,” Vanderveer said. “People do die in childbirth, and babies die.”
Copley’s own report to the Green Mountain Care Board cited three studies assessing distance from hospitals and maternal outcomes. A Pennsylvania-based study, also published in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology, was “the most applicable” out of the three, Copley wrote in its letter. They say that the study found a “statistically significant relative risk of maternal and newborn adverse outcomes when travel distances exceeded 50 miles.” In fact, the study actually found adverse impacts became more likely at distances starting at 37 miles, becoming an increasing risk factor at 49 miles.
The two other studies cited specifically in the letter both detail more risk found for both mothers and babies with increased driving time and distance. Copley’s letter notes one study found no associated risk, but which one is not clear.
In reference to the Pennsylvania study, Copley calculated that about 12 patients each year will have to travel more than 50 miles to the next closest hospital to deliver their babies. They did not specify the number of patients who would need to travel those shorter distances. 
“The decision was extremely difficult, and it is sad for the community. We recognize that it’s sad for us as well to have to let go of a service like this,” Ferrante told VTDigger. “It is a very difficult thing to do when you’re looking at the future of the hospital and maintaining its presence in the community.” 
Birth in the ER
In 2024, the state commissioned the consulting firm Oliver Wyman (as part of the 2022 state law Act 167) to report on the financial sustainability of Vermont’s hospitals. That report tackles the issue of low-volume care that rural hospitals all across the state are dealing with, in birthing and beyond. It outlines a vision for consolidating lower-volume care into regional “centers of excellence.”
The Oliver Wyman report suggested that Copley either scale up its birthing or shift it to other hospitals, as part of its “solutions for (a) long-term period,” in 2028 or beyond. In its response to the care board’s request for understanding the hospital rationale, Copley pointed to this report. 
In its mid-October analysis to the care board, Copley estimated that births would decrease in 2025 (to 115 or 120, though by the end of October, births already totaled 127). It also estimates that revenue loss with each birth averages to $16,885. Using those estimates of 2025 birth volume, the hospital found it would lose $776,000–$861,000 this year (though, at the time of report’s publication, it had already exceeded those low volume estimates). 
The letter also included financial estimates of what scaling up birthing services would cost the hospital — the other pathway outlined by the Oliver Wyman report. The hospital said a consultant estimated “cosmetic renovations” of the birthing center would be over $2 million and that the cost of building a satellite OB/GYN clinic would be $675,000 and the annual operating costs would come to $260,000 a year.
“Somehow we live in a world where, if it makes financial sense, that’s all you need to justify a completely unethical decision,” Erinn Mandeville, a former nurse midwife at Copley, said. 
Many former staff are frustrated about the speed of the closure and the fact that it occurred before the hospital had begun implementing that shift of birthing care to other hospitals the report outlined. Ferrante was unable to comment on why the hospital had felt the need to shutter the service so quickly.
“I understand if we can’t keep every little hospital delivering babies, but we need a creative way to offer prenatal care in the community. We need to have a good system where we work with our colleagues,” Vanderveer said. 
To help cover some of the gaps the loss of this service will leave, Copley’s emergency room staff and local EMTs have been preparing to deliver more babies. The ER doctors have undergone training with practitioners from UVM Health, as well as from the nurse midwives. 
“The ER is not a place where anyone wants to have a baby,” Bovey, the nurse midwife who delivered the last baby, said. She was involved in helping transition and train emergency room staff on birthing. “[The ER staff] are working really hard. This is not their choice. This is not what they feel comfortable doing.”
Also, without the birthing center, the hospital will no longer have some of the tools and resources that could be helpful in assessing a newborn who needs to come into the hospital. 
Health care for the people by the people
A group of midwives have also begun efforts to open a free-standing birthing clinic, in an effort to try to restore some of the services Copley had provided. 
However, “it 100% does not replace hospital births,” said Mandeville, who is also the founder and president of the Green Mountain Birth Center group. 
“It is basically home births, but at somebody else’s home,” she said, explaining that only extremely low-risk pregnancies are eligible for birthing center births. Copley, too, did not take high risk births. “[A birth center] doesn’t have anesthesia; it doesn’t have [pediatric] coverage. You can’t do a C-section; you can only do totally straightforward, low-risk births. So it’s not going to fix this problem.”
The group involved in creating the center is eying Waterbury for a potential location, so that they can quickly transport patients to CVMC in case they need labor induced or an epidural, or in case a baby needs emergency support. Locating closer to Morristown and transporting to Copley is not an option without the birthing center, Mandeville said.
Last year, the Legislature approved a law that would make it possible to open these freestanding birthing centers in Vermont. The Green Mountain Birthing Center would be the state’s first.
But, right now, the new center is in its very early stages, explained Mary Lou Kopas, another former Copley nurse midwife involved in getting the center off the ground. The group is still working to establish itself as a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization and is collecting donations small and large through the American Association of Birth Centers Foundation.  
Kopas estimates that buying a space and then building it out will cost upwards of $1.5 million. From there, she suspects that it will be able to pay for itself, since midwife-led births with low interventions are such inexpensive care. 
“My grand vision is that we’re kind of like the village midwives, and that it’s health care for the people by the people. I’m not interested in an administrative-heavy [enterprise]. This is not a money making venture,” Mandeville said. “We want to build it for the community. We want to keep the lights on and pay people fairly, and build a beautiful facility that provides amazing care.”
She and Kopas hope that someday, they could scale to have some sort of a satellite clinic that could offer pre- and postnatal care in Morrisville, or a mobile clinic to reach people up in the Northeast Kingdom or elsewhere in the Copley service area. Kopas envisions, eventually, being able to provide more “wrap-around services,” like childbirth education, lactation support and  parenting groups.
“We’re hoping that something good could come out of this. This is our phoenix rising out of the ashes,” Kopas said. 
But, for now, she will be working on a per-diem basis at Northern Vermont Regional Hospital and at Gifford Hospital, in Randolph, a nearly 90-minute commute for her. She will stay overnight at the hospital for her 56-hour on-call shifts.

While many state governments provided additional funding to food banks and local pantries, Vermont’s is only one of a few providing direct replacement benefits.

State funds for the first 15 days of monthly food assistance went out Friday to 36,000 Vermont households who participate in the federal program, the Department of Children and Families announced in a press release.
“We are deeply grateful for the commitment and teamwork that brought this complex process to completion,” said Miranda Gray, economic services deputy commissioner. “And most importantly, Vermonters can buy food today.”
Vermont is one of just a few states, including New Mexico and Virginia, where the state government moved quickly to provide direct replacement benefits for households enrolled in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also called SNAP.

November payments in the program, called 3SquaresVT, have been paused since Saturday due to the federal government shutdown, now in its fifth week, leaving local food shelves struggling to fill the gap. Most other state governments have focused on directing additional funding to statewide food banks and other social services organizations. (Vermont leaders authorized $250,000 for the Vermont Food Bank to distribute to meet the additional demand this week.)
Vermont’s department delivered roughly $6 million in benefits — approved by the state’s Emergency Board on Oct. 29 — as the Trump administration sent more mixed messages on when the federal government would provide partial emergency funding for the program required by orders issued by different judges in two federal court cases. 
The U.S. Department of Justice appealed an order a federal judge in Rhode Island District Court handed down Thursday demanding that the USDA fully fund November food benefits. A federal appeals  court denied that appeal late Friday and upheld the lower court’s order.
Later Friday, Politico and other outlets reported that the USDA had told states that it was working to comply with the order to fully fund the program, and that it would make the necessary financial shifts “later today.”
By early evening, the Trump administration had not appealed another order requiring at least partial payment, in Massachusetts District Court, that came as part of a multistate lawsuit joined last week by Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark.
The Vermont Emergency Board is expected to reconvene on or before Nov. 13 to determine whether further state action is needed.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The number of people approved for discretionary parole by the Alaska State Board of Parole has dropped significantly in recent years, and advocates are asking the board for explanations.
Last year, the board denied 59% of applicants for discretionary parole. In 2023, it denied 58% of applicants. In 2022, it denied 70%. An analysis by the Prison Policy Initiative, a non-profit research group, found that from 2019 to 2022, Alaska reduced the number of people released through discretionary parole by 79% — the largest percent change nationwide. 
In years prior, the grant rate was much higher: Only 25% of applicants were denied parole in 2015, and 30% in 2016. 	
Alaska inmates may be eligible for parole if the Parole Board determines a reasonable probability exist that:
1. the prisoner will live and remain at liberty without violating
any laws or conditions imposed by the board;
2. the prisoner’s rehabilitation and reintegration into society
will be furthered by release on parole;
3. the prisoner will not pose a threat of harm to the public if
released on parole; and
4. the release of the prisoner on parole would not diminish the
seriousness of the crime.


The five-member Parole Board is appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Legislature to serve five-year terms. They make decisions about parole and set conditions for release. Under law, they must consider four criteria when determining if Alaska inmates are eligible for parole, including evaluating whether the individual will pose a threat to public safety. For discretionary parole, applicants must have completed part of their sentence, be in good standing and have a plan for employment, housing and continued treatment, if needed, when they are released. 
How the board weighs these factors has been a focal point for advocates in recent years. Advocates want to help inmates better prepare for parole and reduce recidivism, or prevent people from re-offending and returning to prison. 
Advocates raised the issue again at the Parole Board’s annual public meeting on Wednesday. 
“Discretionary parole numbers, they’re going down… why do you think that is?” asked Christina Shadura, a coordinator for the Anchorage Reentry Coalition, part of a statewide network to support people exiting prison and connect with housing, community services and jobs. 
“Are people coming to you without a plan? Are folks coming to you not ready, not getting it, not taking it seriously? I guess I’m looking for a little advice here on the community side about how we can help further prepare folks,” she said. “If there’s one thing you could lock down for us to help support, what do you think it would be?”
Jason Wilson, a board member representing Southeast Alaska and the state coordinator for Village Public Safety Organizations with the Department of Public Safety, responded that many people don’t seem prepared. 
“I mean, there’s a lot of people that come before us that don’t even know what discretionary parole is, but yet they’re applying for discretionary parole,” Wilson said. 
“Having the proper programming, having the proper release plan, that’s going to help them to succeed,” he said. He suggested parole applicants consider community programs, like for addiction treatment, counselors and sponsors. 
Other board members did not respond to questions. Through board staff after the meeting, the board declined to say why parole rates are so low, or to name factors that would increase successful applications. 
In the meeting, Board Chair Leitoni Tupou said the board does not make public comments. 
“I think this board, as far as in my experience, we are just focusing on the week or two weeks out of the month on (parole) hearings,” Tupou said.

Tupou said he only provides public comment when called to testify by the Legislature. For example, he said eligibility for medical parole, or the release of an individual with severe illness, is very strict. “We are obligated to follow that law,” he said. “If we feel there has to be a change that has to come through the law. From our perspective…our hands are tied,” he said. 
Mike Garvey, policy director of the ACLU of Alaska, called the absence of responses from the board at the public meeting an illustration of the continued lack of transparency from the parole board. “Which we’ve long known is a problem,” he said.  
In a 2024 review by the Alaska Division of Legislative Audit, state auditors also found “the board was unable to provide specific reasons why its parole approval rate decreased.”
In an interview following the meeting, Garvey said the ACLU is continuing to call for more transparency. 
“It’s not about getting more people out (of prison), we want people to be successful when they are released,” he said. “We don’t want arbitrary denials, and so having more transparency from the board would help not just explain the denials. It can help explain the releases too.”
The ACLU has also pointed to the cost to the state of keeping people incarcerated, which is estimated to be $202 per person per day in Alaska, compared to an estimated $13 per day on parole. 
According to the Alaska Department of Corrections, the daily average prison population was estimated at 4,322 in 2024. There were 3,213 people under probation or parole supervision last year.
Alaska’s prison population is also aging significantly. The number of people 55 and over has increased by 50% over the last decade, according to data from DOC. Many may be eligible for geriatric or medical parole. 
Shadura, as a re-entry coordinator, conducts what she calls “in-reach” to jails and prisons to help inmates apply for parole or prepare to be released. She estimated 80% of people she works with have questions about parole, and they have a hard time getting them answered. 
“How do I fill out my parole packet? My probation officer hasn’t returned my communication for whatever reason,” she said, in an interview following the meeting. “I was denied, what do I do next? You know, that’s a big thing I come across for pretty much every institution I do in-reach at.” 
She said the parole application process is not within inmates’ own responsibility or control, but largely an internal process by DOC. Inmates also face challenges in preparing for parole because they may lack space or program opportunities for things like addiction treatment, counseling, life skills or other education programs that show an effort towards rehabilitation. She said the programs that are available vary widely by each of Alaska’s 13 prison facilities across the state.  
Successful re-entry into society is also a challenge. Alaska’s rate of recidivism is defined as when someone is paroled and then violates the terms of parole or commits a crime again. Almost half returned to prison over the last three years, or 47% of discretionary parolees and 67% of mandatory parolees.
Shadura said she understands privacy and safety concerns, and the gravity of decisions put before board members. But she hopes more insights from the board might better prepare inmates to apply for parole, and to be more successful once paroled. 
“It also seems like we’re doing a disservice to everybody, including the parole process, when we’re not allowing folks to at least have a basic understanding about how to go about qualifying for it, what steps you need to achieve to get there,” she said. “It makes people feel hopeless.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Nearly 40 fruit trees have taken root at Drake Park in what is the start of a community orchard in Des Moines.  
Once established, organizers hope the orchard will serve as another place in Des Moines to build up the city’s local food infrastructure. 
Chelsea Krist, chair of the steering committee for Iowa Food System Coalition, said community orchards create spaces, not only for food access, but also for communities to gather and connect over food. 
“It’s a really important and accessible way to literally change the landscape and the environment where people can interact with food more directly,” Krist said. 
She said spaces like a community orchard create a “touchpoint” for people to see food growing in their region. Grabbing an apple off the tree in a local park, or while on a neighborhood walk, could cause a “ripple effect” for community members to notice the nearby pollinators, talk to someone else who is harvesting from the tree, or become more interested in other local food sources.
That ripple effect toward local food procurement, and sense of community around food, can also be helpful during times of crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic, or the current government shutdown that led to suspended federal nutrition programming.
“The more spaces that we can create for people to connect with each other and food, the better,” Krist said.

City-led orchard 
Krist said while there are a lot of community groups that start community orchards and gardens, she said a lot of recent efforts have been led by municipalities across the state. 
This is the case for the project in Des Moines. Breann Bye, economic development project manager with the City of Des Moines, said the project in Drake Park shows that public spaces can fulfill “multiple objectives.” 
“It’s a park, so families can come there and play, there’s a splash pad, there’s a shelter you can rent, there are basketball hoops, but also it can be a great place for neighborhood residents to take a walk, collect some apples — when they’re ready for harvest — cherries, apricots, peaches, all that,” Bye said.

An orchard project had already been started in Drake Park, according to Bye, with fruit trees in various stages of development. The city approved a measure in May to plant more trees and reinvigorate the community orchard at the park, and by late October, a group of around 30 volunteers showed up to plant the fruit trees.
It will take a couple of years before the trees are mature enough to bear significant amounts of fruit. By the time that happens, Bye said the city hopes to have signage up explaining the types of fruit, when they’re ripe and maybe even QR codes that link to recipes. 
She said surrounding communities, like the Drake neighborhood and Sherman Hill neighborhood, have already shown interest in the orchard, but the city plans to continue public outreach to create a “community of care” around the orchard. 
“So that people understand the asset that is this orchard and then want to help care for it — hopefully they then feel a sense of ownership and connection,” Bye said. 
The city will work with the local Trees Forever group and volunteers to maintain the orchard. 
Dubuque also got a community orchard this year on city property, in an initiative led by the local Trees Forever group. 
Tom Kramer, president of Dubuque Trees Forever, said the group planted fruit trees this spring in a city-owned spot he said was previously a mostly unused green space. 
Trees Forever partnered with the city, exchanging maintenance of the area for the ability to plant fruit trees and establish some perennial beds. Kramer said it was a “win-win” situation. 
Now, he said the community will be able to enjoy the beauty of a blooming orchard in the spring, “versus just an empty lot with grass on it.” And later in the summer, they can stop by to pick some cherries, plums and apples. Plus, he said, the pollinators will enjoy the orchard too. 
Part of the local food ‘puzzle’
Krist said she sees more and more support for projects like community orchards, gardens and local food procurement. These projects, she said are being adopted as community leaders care more about the benefits, like providing fresh local food, than some of the downsides, like tree maintenance. 
An orchard, she said, is a “piece of a very complicated puzzle” that makes up a sustainable local food system.
Kathy Byrnes and Ed Fallon, of Birds & Bees Urban Farm in Des Moines, have been pushing for a city-led community orchard for years, as step toward their dream for Des Moines to be the “local food capital of the U.S.” 
They were among the volunteers planting trees in Drake Park. 
“It’s a good start, but we’ve got a long ways to go to accomplish the level of food security that we need,” Fallon said. 
In terms of fruit procurement, Fallon and Byrnes said they hope to see the city of Des Moines establish other community orchards and use edible fruit-bearing trees like serviceberries in lieu of plastic snow fences. 
Already, Fallon said, the city is moving in the right direction.
What does a community with 20 years of watershed work look like?  

Following building renovations several years ago, the city planted strawberry plants as groundcover surrounding City Hall. Each June when the fruit ripens, the plants are picked clean by citizens who stop by the massive patch. 
“We need more strawberries everywhere,” Fallon said. “There’s plenty of places where the city could plant strawberries.” 
Byrnes said local food is more than just vegetables and fruits. She said it’s about pollination, bees, backyard chickens, goats and “all the ways that people feed themselves.” 
Des Moines, Byrnes said, has some of the best local ordinances in terms of allowing backyard poultry and gardening, which also fits as a piece of the local food system. 
Once people start growing and producing their own food, she said, it also opens up opportunities for community, which is a “real benefit to a city.”
“People always want to look at what you’re growing, come in and talk about it,” Byrnes said. “You meet your neighbors, then you find ways that you can not just exist together, but help each other and just grow that connection.”
Fallon said another element to a food system is permanently dedicated land for food production within the city. He suggested the city identify land and then work with local farmers who are “getting out of corn and beans” and want to grow food for sale.
“We have so much opportunity for local consumption,” Fallon said.
According to Bye, conversations about these initiatives are happening at the city. 
She said the city plans to identify other sites around the city where it makes sense to establish more community orchards. As the city works orchards into its plans, “people are more aware about it as an asset” which could create a bridge for using more food-producing plants in other landscaping projects.
“Joy matters in our urban spaces,” Bye said.  “When we can work on projects that not only address food security and education around food production and sustainability, but also just make people smile and make people happy – that’s a good thing.” 
Bye said a core focus in her job is to support small businesses and entrepreneurs, and she hopes the city can do that by thinking differently about some of its land. 
That might mean dedicating land to urban agricultural production and bringing farmers in to make use of land that can’t be vertically developed. Bye said she also wants the city to think about using land in a way that can bring people together. 
“Being the capital city in Iowa, where (there’s) so much conversation around agriculture and food production, Des Moines has a real opportunity to, I think, enact those values and strengthen our residents’ connection to their food system,” Bye said. “We have an opportunity here for kids to grow up seeing food-producing plants right in their neighborhoods and have that connection and understanding about the environment and that desire to care for it.”

(Photo courtesy of University of Iowa)Business professor Kristina Gavin Bigsby says it’s harder now to be a student at the University of Iowa than when she was completing her own degree programs — four of them — at the university.
Costs are rising and students have more worries than ever, she said, and it’s not uncommon for Bigsby, director of undergraduate studies and associate professor in the Tippie College of Business, to get harried emails from students struggling to add coursework to what they’re already juggling.
Despite these issues, more and more students are turning to a UI education, with the university welcoming its second-largest incoming class ever of 5,561 undergraduate students this fall. Applications to the UI were also record-breaking, totaling more than 31,000.
When enrollment grows, class sizes — and the number of offered course sections — grow with it. While some departments might not be feeling the full brunt of the strain yet, faculty and graduate students say it’s getting harder to balance all of the work on their plates.

“We are going to do everything possible in our power to create value for students, because that is really our job,” Bigsby said. “But I think some people are starting to get burnt out, and I can’t blame them.”
Preparing for growth
Retention has grown alongside enrollment, with a 90.9% first-year retention rate representing a 5-percentage-point increase over the past five years, according to Tanya Uden-Holman, UI associate provost for undergraduate education and dean of the University College.
Uden-Holman said in an emailed statement that many university instructors, both faculty and graduate teachers, are using “evidence-based teaching practices proven to improve learning and engagement in large lecture settings.”
The UI’s Enrollment Management data team created “predictive dashboards” a few years ago, Uden-Holman said in her statement, that have helped the university prepare for enrollment growth by “anticipat(ing) student interest” and planning out staffing, course sections and classroom space.
“Guided by our institutional strategic plan, the University of Iowa has taken a proactive, data-informed approach to supporting student success in large-enrollment courses. This work includes advancements in predictive analytics, instructional planning, and faculty development to ensure that growing student demand is met with high-quality learning experiences,” Uden-Holman said. “We are deeply grateful to our faculty and graduate instructors, whose dedication ensures academic excellence across all course sizes.”
Support for both teachers and students is available through university programs like the Center for Teaching and Office of Teaching, Learning and Technology as well as supplemental instruction, Uden-Holman said, which are group study sessions led by students who already found success in the course before helping others.
Seeing student needs no matter the numbers
After Bigsby started as a full employee of the university in 2018, she taught a database management course with cohorts of between 100-150 students that is “pushing closer to the higher end of that range,” she said.
The Foundations of Business Analytics course Bigsby now teaches has just over 900 enrolled students — an increase of 300 students in just two years. No matter what struggles classroom leaders are going through, Bigsby said her first priority is to the students she’s teaching, whether there are nine or 900 of them in the course.
“How do I, even with 900 students, see them as individuals and see them as humans, and not just, you know, numbers that I have to get through the class,” Bigsby said. “Even in a quantitative field, I don’t see my students as just numbers and statistics.”
The differences between small and large courses are fewer than one would think, Bigsby said. She still approaches the course with the mindset of treating students how she wanted to be treated as a student, with flexibility and transparency. Overcommunicating with students about expectations, deadlines, course policies and the reasoning behind the concepts and skills she teaches them prevents panicked emails and other issues in the future.
Bigsby also makes all of the materials for the course, from instructional slides and presentations to data sets, practice problems and test questions.
Bigsby works with 10 teaching assistants for her Foundations of Business Analytics class, on whom she is “really reliant.” While no one teaches the teachers how to be managers when they have so many teaching assistants, Bigsby said she tries to make things as easy as she can.
In order to ensure there is consistency across the 20 discussion sections of the course, Bigsby started this semester filming herself going through the discussion topics for the assistants to reference or follow along with in their sections if need be.
“I try to lay out everything clearly for them the same way that I do for the students in the class, because at the end of the day, the teaching assistants are students as well,” Bigsby said. “This experience is a way for them to pay their tuition, but it’s also a way for them to learn and gain the skill set.”
Graduate student instructors deal with time constraints
For graduate students working as teaching assistants and in instructor roles, having more students could mean cutting back on other graduate work or working more than their allotted hours, all while many deal with financial and food insecurity, among other things.
Anne Moore, press and publicity coordinator of the Campaign to Organize Graduate Students (COGS), said the union has been hearing from its members “across the board” about increased expectations and workloads from more sections and more students. There is also the rule that most graduate workers are generally limited to 20 hours of work per week, but many employees don’t find it easy to stay within that limit.
“Part of that time is teaching, and then the rest of that time is meant to prepare for your teaching and to do grading and stuff. With these larger class sizes, people are finding that they can’t get the work done in 20 hours,” Moore said. “We’re only paid for 20 hours of work, so it’s sort of this Catch-22 for teaching assistants.”
Cary Stough, a teaching assistant in the UI rhetoric department, pointed out that graduate students are students as well as university employees and they have obligations outside of instruction in order to complete their degrees, like research or large projects.
In the rhetoric department, graduate workers teaching courses are “instructors of record,” Stough said, which means they create their own syllabi and other materials and don’t have the same relationship with overseeing faculty.
The idea of working just 20 hours a week is “kind of a joke” to graduate workers, especially those in rhetoric, as they steer more course sections and act as the first point of contact for more students, Stough said. The pay graduate workers receive is already inadequate enough to put students through financial uncertainty, Stough added.
“There’s no time to make a life, rather than make a living, outside of the university,” Stough said. “And those insecurity problems, those housing insecurity problems, those food insecurity problems, the lack of savings that we have because we’re paid so low is going to be exacerbated if the university decides to willy-nilly throw more work onto us.”
What UI instructors need to facilitate growth
As those tasked with teaching future courses brace for potentially higher enrollment in the future, Moore said she would hope that the university would grow graduate admissions alongside undergraduate, as well as raising graduate pay and hiring more faculty.
There are some “hard constraints” the UI is butting up against currently, Bigsby said, that would need to be dealt with if the university and its colleges want to keep growing.
The main one is simply space — where in the past university administration would aim for classrooms to be at around 90% capacity, now she said rooms are “busting to the gills” with students trying to find space. It’s not a problem that can be solved easily or quickly, Bigsby said, and so far everyone has been dealing with cramped conditions without issue.
In terms of offering support and resources, however, Bigsby said she’s much more interested in what would help students than what would help faculty. Bigsby said her department has used its own funds — and went over budget — to pay peer tutors to help students with certain introductory classes. It was good because it helped the students, she said, but the costs add up.
It would take thousands of dollars to offer programs like supplemental instruction and peer tutoring in every large class, but if the UI says it cares about students and wants to keep growing, Bigsby said they need to be “willing to put our money where our mouth is.”
“One thing about teaching a large class is you get ‘mean world syndrome,’ because you see a lot of problems, and it’s not that students in these classes are worse than other classes,” Bigsby said. “It’s not that they’re less prepared, it’s not that even a higher proportion of students in these classes are struggling, it’s just that there’s more students. And so if we can support the students, it helps me as the instructor, it helps everybody.”

Larsen has served as interim director since July 21, after former director K.C. Belitz resigned. During that time, Larsen has focused on career opportunities for Nebraska youth, expanding international trade and strengthening public-private partnerships, the Governor’s Office said in a press release.
“Maureen has demonstrated strong leadership and a strong desire to continue supporting my cabinet as director of DED,” Pillen said in the statement. “I have been impressed with her abilities in the short time she has been serving in the interim role, and she deserves this opportunity.”
Larsen’s nomination will require confirmation by the Nebraska Legislature. Prior to her role at DED, Larsen was general counsel to the governor and deputy director of the governor’s Policy Research Office.
Also on Friday, Pillen announced the appointment of Michael Donley to succeed Larsen as his general counsel. Donley has been with the Governor’s Office in an interim capacity during Larsen’s reassignment.
Donley served as general counsel to the Nebraska Department of Administrative Services before joining the Governor’s Office.
“Michael has aptly served my office as interim general counsel,” Pillen said. “He is keenly attuned to the various legal issues requiring attention by the Governor’s Office and has worked well with partner agencies to provide sound advice when needed. I look forward to having him join the team in a permanent role.”

“I am writing today concerning various incidents that have occurred on our campus recently, that have taken us some time to piece together,” Seidel wrote in a message to the campus community. “I recognize that this message comes later than some may have expected, but it remains important that I speak to these events and reaffirm our shared values, as outlined in our strategic plan.” 
Both incidents — a collection of jack-o-lanterns carved with Nazi and Ku Klux Klan imagery and a giant beachball bearing antisemitic and homophobic messages — were reported to and investigated by the University of Wyoming Police Department. They are now under review by the school’s Equal Opportunity Report and Response Unit, or EORR. 
“I want to again recognize that this event has caused significant hurt and anger for many in our community,” Seidel wrote. “I hope very much that we can come together as the supportive community that we are, that we must be, and consider how we can all do better in expressing ourselves and supporting one another.”
What we know so far
The most recent incident took place on Oct. 31, Halloween. 
Pumpkins carved with antisemitic imagery and placed at Simpsons Plaza, a high foot-traffic area outside the student union, were reported to campus police around 8:30 a.m., according to a police report. 
One pumpkin displayed a Nazi swastika and SS bolts, another “was carved with a KKK clan member in their hooded robe,” according to the police report. An additional pumpkin was carved with a jumble of profanity and apparent threats including “fuck,” “AIPAC,” the acronym for American Israel Public Affairs Committee and “Hitler.”

Police removed the pumpkins from campus and took photos before disposing of them, according to the report. Using security camera footage of the plaza, police connected the pumpkins back to a student group meeting in the Union the night before. UW redacted the name of the student group as well the individual students in the police report, citing the ongoing EORR investigation. 
“[REDACTED] said his group, [REDACTED], was not targeting any specific group of persons with the pumpkins and it was more about the concept of free speech,” the report stated.
No law enforcement action was taken, according to the report. 
The other incident occurred a week before on Oct. 24 and also involved a student organization, again at Simpson Plaza. 
“I arrived and met with [REDACTED] who is with the [REDACTED] that is doing an event where they have a very large beach ball and anyone can write anything on it that they want,” a police report stated. “He said that during this event they have had some people put some things on it that are distasteful.”
The ball included antisemetic statements and also referenced the infamous murder of gay UW student Matthew Shepard. The messages included: “Kill Jews,” “Matthew Shepard deserved it Gay Prostitute and drug dealer…Rest in Piss,” “Kill the Nazis,” “Where is Jill Kews,” and “Jews did 9/11,” according to the report. 
“I spoke to [REDACTED] about the difference between hate speech and free speech and how they need to be mindful about the difference,” the investigating officer wrote in the report. 
Response
Seidel, who is leaving the school next year, did not respond to the incidents until Friday, a day after the pumpkins had been featured in an Oil City News article. Other campus groups had weighed in earlier.
Seidel’s delayed response to the two incidents frustrated many on campus, including Jennifer Tabler, a professor. 
“When pumpkins carved with swastikas and other Nazi symbols were left in Prexy’s pasture—the most visible communal space on campus—the expectation of many was that UWPD would quietly remove the ‘abandoned property,’ but that the university would say nothing,” Tabler wrote in a letter to Seidel two hours before he made a public statement on Friday. 
“We are choosing to meet expectations, rather than rise above and display excellence in fostering a campus environment that includes all, that is committed to mutual respect,” she wrote.
In the letter, Tabler resigned from a university committee intended to help UW exceed expectations about the kind of place people would want to work, live and learn.
“While I appreciate and recognize the acknowledgements from [Associated Students of the University of Wyoming], faculty Senate and Provost [Anne] Alexander, we can do better,” Tabler wrote. “The tone is set from the top.”

Thursday morning, Faculty Senate Chair Rob Godby sent an email to faculty, informing them “current actions are underway to determine disciplinary actions both through law enforcement and also from any organizations they belong to who will also be looking at taking action.” 
“Education efforts are also underway,” he wrote. 
Godby wrote that it was an opportunity for members of campus to “remind ourselves” of several things including that “we are a community. We stand as one. We respect one another and we include all our members.” 
“This is an opportunity to express our values and to remind those who may feel threatened that we care,” Godby wrote. “I hope with some thinking, we will become better for being reminded of these values.” 
Godby also thanked campus police “for their immediate efforts to identify those responsible and to ensure there is no threat to campus.” He encouraged his colleagues to let their “constituents who may be concerned know there is no threat and also remind them that we care and support them” 
Paula Medina, president of the Associated Students of the University of Wyoming, informed the student body Thursday with an email of her own.  
“We remain deeply disappointed by this incident, recognizing the immense harm that such actions cause to our community,” Medina wrote. “The University of Wyoming should be a place where every student feels welcome. Actions like this compromise the sense of safety and respect that make learning itself possible.”
Both Medina and Godby wrote that the three campus organizations — staff, faculty and students — met with Seidel and his office on Wednesday.

(Photo by Anna Padilla for Source NM)","Approximately 460,000 New Mexico residents receive food benefits through the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. (Getty Images)While the federal government said Friday it will release food aid to states, New Mexico will still hold a special legislative session on Monday, the governor’s office confirmed to Source New Mexico.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced the special session on Thursday, amid ongoing legal wrangling about whether the United States Department would pay out Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits to the 42 million Americans—approximately 460,000 New Mexico residents—who receive them.
The state previously allocated $30 million to tide over New Mexico SNAP recipients for roughly the first 10 days of the month, which will run out Monday.
“Our responsibility is to ensure that families don’t go hungry waiting for this essential nutrition program to resume,” Health Care Authority Kari Armijo said in a statement when the session was announced. “This special session will allow us to continue serving New Mexicans while federal funding for the SNAP program remains uncertain.”
However, the USDA told states Friday it was releasing full November funding for the nation’s major food assistance program that helps 42 million people afford groceries, complying with a federal court order issued Thursday.
The governor’s deputy communications director, Jodi McGinnis Porter, confirmed to Source the state received the letter. Nonetheless, the session will continue.
“The special session is moving forward Monday because Republicans in Congress still refuse to end this needless government shut down,” a statement from McGinnis to Porter said. “While we are relieved that November benefits have been released, we are still cautious about relying on future SNAP funding being available. We’re not taking any chances with 460,000 New Mexicans’ food security.”
Democratic state leadership on Thursday praised the forthcoming special session, while their Republican counterparts criticized New Mexico’s congressional delegation—specifically U.S. Senators Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján, both Democrats—for not voting to reopen the federal government, which is now closed for the 38th day amid an impasse between parties over Democrats’ push to extend health insurance tax subsidies, among other issues.
Heinrich and Luján fired back Friday, saying via a joint statement that “Republicans control the White House, the House, and the Senate. President Trump and Congressional Republicans chose to shut down the government, chose not to lower health care costs, and chose not to use funding they already have — and were ordered by a court to disburse—for SNAP.”
New Mexico’s Republican state legislators, the statement continued, “have not called on President Trump and Congressional Republicans to comply with court orders to fund SNAP, have not called on them to work with Democrats to reopen the government and address skyrocketing health care costs, and have not condemned their party’s decision to block our legislation to keep families fed and pay service members and federal employees. Their silence speaks volumes, and their complicity in Trump’s government shutdown is infuriating.”
New Mexico Senate Republican Whip, Pat Woods (R-Broadview) responded via a statement calling “the irony from Luján and Heinrich is laughable… and predictable. President Trump doesn’t have a vote in the Senate. He can only take action when a bill comes to him. Senators in the U.S. Senate, those people have a vote. Why accuse Trump when it’s your own house that needs to get in order?”
House Republican Leader Gail Armstrong (R-Magdalena), similarly, said via statement: “The only thing blocking federal funding for SNAP, service members, and federal workers is their refusal to vote to reopen the government. Their press releases do nothing for hungry families or unpaid troops. If they are serious about helping New Mexicans, they should stop blaming others and cast the vote that ends the shutdown.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_0521-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-07 18:56:23.278486

The reductions would help ease the strain on air traffic controllers, who have been working without pay during the government shutdown that began Oct. 1. Duffy said controllers were taking second jobs to make ends meet and were experiencing fatigue and stress, leading to safety concerns. Shutdown delays in D.C., Chicago, Atlanta and moreSeven airports on the list of 40 had ground delays Friday, with staffing shortages at 18 air traffic control towers triggering delays at others, according to an FAA advisory. Departures at Washington Reagan National Airport, just outside the nation’s capital in Northern Virginia, were averaging a four-hour delay Friday afternoon, according to FAA data. The airport led the nation with 73 cancellations Friday, according to FlightAware. Chicago O’Hare, Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson, Denver International and Dallas/Fort Worth airports were also in the top five for cancellations.Duffy visited Washington Reagan National earlier in the day to check in with travelers and brief reporters. He said he couldn’t give an exact figure on the number of affected flights, but said he hoped the reduction in flights would help controllers miss less work.“I don't want to see the disruption,” he said. “I don't want to see the delays. Now, there could be a benefit if I can get the controllers to come back to work.”Duffy recommended Friday that travelers continue to book flights now, rather than waiting for the shutdown to end. He said in an ABC News interview that waiting to book a flight could put fliers in the position of paying higher prices.Regional carriers Nate Vallier, a partner at Alaska Travel Desk, a travel agency, said in a Friday press release the cancellations appeared to mostly hit smaller regional carriers. “We’re seeing a lot of randomness in the cancellations, as a way to spread the pain per se,”  Vallier said. “But the majority of canceled flights so far are with regional jets, such as those flown by SkyWest, Horizon, and American Eagle’s Envoy Divisions.” Alaska Beacon reporter James Brooks contributed to this report.",,,,2025-11-07 18:17:47.656041

(Photo by U.S. Department of Agriculture)The federal government fully funded the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, for November, complying with a court order issued by a federal judge in Rhode Island. 
Minnesota officials say the benefits could go out to recipients as soon as this weekend. 
Some recipients may get their benefits earlier than usual — a step the state Department of Children, Youth and Families said it is taking to “protect Minnesotans during the uncertainty of potential future court orders.”
For many Minnesota families dealing with the SNAP stoppage during the long government shutdown, the aid can’t come soon enough. Food shelves are taxed and one that the Reformer visited this week had to send people away empty handed. Gov. Tim Walz redirected $4 million in state funding to food shelves at the end of October to help bridge the gap, but the money still fell far short of the emergency food system’s projected needs. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP, sent a letter to state agencies Friday stating that the federal government would make funds available within hours for states to distribute to recipients. 
The two-paragraph letter did not mention the elaborate new formulas USDA sent states Tuesday to provide recipients with partial benefits, apparently rendering the new mandate moot — at least for now.
The federal government shutdown left SNAP without any funding after October. Friday’s court order requires USDA to use contingency funds to cover November benefits.

The top brass at Beta Technologies saw their collective net worth jump by nearly $1.4 billion following the electric plane company’s initial stock offering on Tuesday, according to a company filing with the federal government. Big investors, including BlackRock and an Amazon fund, also saw the value of their investments in the company soar.
Beta Technologies debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday, raising more than $1 billion as it offered 34 million total shares at an initial price of $34 per share. In the following days, the South Burlington-based company’s stock price has oscillated around that figure, dipping to roughly $32 as the market closed on Friday.

Beta’s filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission details the share ownership of directors and executives. Their shares can be sold on the stock market following the expiration of a “lock-up” agreement that lasts 180 days from after Nov. 3, the October filing said.
Kyle Clark, the company’s CEO and founder, directly owns 487,100 shares in the company — an asset now worth roughly $15.5 million at Friday’s share prices. But over $235 million in stock is also held between trusts in his name and the name of his wife, Katie Clark, which do not allow for immediate access.
Clark, who was born in Huntington and traces aspects of Beta back to early engineering projects at Harvard University, said this week that he planned to keep the growing company headquartered in Vermont for now. Beta will be making further investments in its South Burlington-based production facilities in an effort to increase control of its own supply chain, Clark said.
Beta’s public offering also added to the portfolio of John Abele, a member of Beta’s board of directors reported to be Vermont’s only resident billionaire. A Shelburne resident, Abele co-founded Boston Scientific, a medical device company.
Abele directly owns roughly $1 million of Beta’s shares, but also controls roughly $550 million in further company stock via 11 other companies, at Friday’s share prices.

Chuck Davis, the chair of Beta’s board, is another top shareholder with direct or indirect ownership of nearly 15 million shares, valued at around $475 million. Davis, who grew up in Burlington, is the founding CEO of the Connecticut-based investment firm Stone Point Capital.
Five other executives and board members own more than $100 million in stock between them, and Austin Meyer, a California-based engineer and early investor in the company, holds up to nearly $400 million worth of shares.
Directors and executives also hold options to purchase a combined total of 2 million additional shares in the next two months, the SEC filing said.
Some individuals in the company’s corps of over 800 employees may be granted equity-based compensation, with over 1 million shares in this offering being reserved for a “directed share program to our current employees,” according to the filing. The value of those packages combined could be in excess of $40 million at Friday’s share prices. Those shares would not be subject to the 180 day “lock-up” agreement constraining executives and directors.
Beta’s list of major investors includes BlackRock, as well as Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund. BlackRock, a New York-based wealth management company with over $13 trillion in assets under its management, is referred to as a “cornerstone investor” in the company’s filings, and has indicated interest in purchasing up to $300 million of Beta’s stock. The Climate Pledge Fund, created to drive Amazon’s goal of net-zero carbon emissions, was also an early investor in Beta before it went public.

Nearly 700 people sheltered there for two days after ex-typhoon Halong. (Photo by Eric Stone/Alaska Public Media)On a Sunday morning last month, James Taq’ac Amik was huddled on a small bridge with his girlfriend. At 4 a.m., they had scrambled into an 18-foot aluminum motor boat, fleeing floodwaters from a massive storm surge that inundated Kipnuk, a village of 700 in the heart of western Alaska’s sprawling Kuskokwim river delta.
“I couldn’t make it up. I tried, but the wind was too strong to try and go by boat, so we ended up staying on the bridge for five hours,” Amik said. Things only grew more dramatic. “The houses started drifting away around 5:30 a.m.,” Amik said. “There was still lights in them, there was people in them.”
When they set out, the couple were heading to Kipnuk’s public school, the largest building in the Alaska Native Yup’ik village. At least that building, they hoped at the time, would be secure.
The storm that hit Alaska’s west coast in mid-October was the remnants of Typhoon Halong, which picked up momentum in a warmer-than-normal Pacific Ocean. After the wind died down and the floodwaters receded, the village lay in ruins. But while the school still stood relatively unscathed on its steel pilings more than 20 feet above the muck and wreckage, there were other problems inside. District staff had been working on much-needed upgrades to its main generator. Then the school’s backup generator sputtered. Everyone in the community, including Amik and his girlfriend, stayed for two days until local leaders decided the storm had done too much damage and organized a mass evacuation.

When disaster strikes, public school buildings are integral as safe havens in hundreds of predominantly Indigenous villages scattered across Alaska’s vast landscape. In many remote communities, schools are some of the only buildings with flush toilets and their own generators. Schools are often the only buildings that stand on pilings — important amid the rising waters of climate change — and also the only buildings large enough to house dozens if not hundreds of people for days at a time.
“It is a known fact that if you need to evacuate, you evacuate to the elementary school,” said Alaska state Sen. Löki Tobin, a Democrat and chair of the Senate Education Committee, who grew up in Nome but now represents Anchorage.
“Those are lifeboats,” said Alaska’s emergency management director, Bryan Fisher. “They’re the last place of refuge.”
Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Republican and former educator, has declared more than a dozen disasters since August 2024, and in at least half of those cases, public schools were used as emergency shelters. The state reported damage in 52 communities in October, and the impacts forced  hundreds of residents to sleep in gymnasiums and on classroom floors in rural public schools. Since 1998, Alaska has seen more than 140 state-declared disasters, and dozens of those required schools to function as shelters.
But Alaska’s rural schools have been neglected for decades. Earlier this year, ProPublica, KYUK Public Media and NPR documented a health and safety crisis inside many rural school buildings across Alaska. In some cases, the buildings that function as safe havens in times of emergency are becoming emergencies themselves.
The state is required by law to fund construction and maintenance projects in rural school districts because they serve unincorporated communities where there is no tax revenue to help fund education. In the last 28 years, Alaska’s rural school districts have made close to 1,800 requests to the state for money to maintain and repair deteriorating schools, but only 14% of those requests have been approved. And as the backlog of major maintenance projects continues to grow, the state budget has been shrinking.
“Just the maintenance that goes in every day to keep up a building, that’s really where the flaw is,” said Alaska Education Commissioner Deena Bishop. For years, her department has struggled to meet the growing need for dollars to maintain school facilities, including more than 60 owned by the state. “The crux of the situation,” she said during an interview in Juneau last year, is that “we get to an emergency because we didn’t take care of it.”
The main generator that provides power to the school in Kipnuk was not working before hundreds of residents fled there during ex-Typhoon Halong. Lower Kuskokwim School District Superintendent Hannibal Anderson said the generator “was working well enough to provide what it needed for the school.” But it was quickly overwhelmed by the sudden increase in demand for power once the school became Kipnuk’s primary emergency shelter. A smaller backup generator also couldn’t meet that demand to charge cellphones and keep the building heated after the community’s residents piled in.

The school district waited 14 years for the state to approve funding to do a major renovation in 2015, but it has not asked for funding since then. Every year, the applications school districts submit for construction and maintenance funds are ranked. Data analysis and interviews with superintendents across the state indicate that submitting an application that ranks high enough to win funding is cumbersome, and they feel pressure to include professional inspections and surveys, which can be expensive. Anderson explained that although the generator required maintenance, he believed Kipnuk’s needs wouldn’t be considered urgent enough to receive funding. “Kipnuk is a relatively new school,” he said.
In Kotlik, a village of just over 650 residents almost 220 miles north of Kipnuk, 70 people spent two nights at the school. “We have a church and a community building, but those are seldom used in evacuations,” explained Principal Cassius Brown. “That’s because the school is situated higher and it’s not as close to the river.”
Since 2018, the Lower Yukon School District has made annual requests ranging from $2 million to more than $5 million to the state’s education department to make extensive repairs to the school in Kotlik and another in a nearby village. That work remains unfunded.
In Chevak, where about 950 Alaska Native Cup’ik people live less than a dozen miles from the Bering Sea coast, school Principal Lillian Olson said 65 people spent a few nights on the gymnasium floor. “Our community is kind of dependent on the school for shelter,” Olson said. “One time two years ago, we had an electric outage in one part of town that lasted for like a week, and because the houses didn’t have electricity and no heat, we housed them.”
Olson said a test of the building’s fire sprinklers failed in September. In a phone call last spring, Kashunamiut School District Superintendent Jeanne Campbell described a host of problems related to the Chevak school’s boiler and broken water pipes that impacted the fire sprinkler system. “And that’s just inside the building,” Campbell said.
Last year, that school district made its first request to the state’s education department since 2001, asking for $32 million to update and renovate the school. The proposal was one among 114 for fiscal year 2025. The state allocated enough money for only 17 of those projects. Work at the Chevak school was not one of them.
Just over a dozen miles west, in Hooper Bay, Mayor Charlene Nukusuk said between 50 and 60 people sheltered for two nights in that community’s public school. The village’s location makes it extremely vulnerable: Over the last few decades, fall coastal storms have devoured several rows of sand dunes that used to protect the community of 1,375 people. Now, the black and frigid Bering Sea laps at the beach only a few hundred feet from the far corner of the local airport runway. Nukusuk said the school is one of the safest buildings.
Hooper Bay’s school was rebuilt after it was destroyed by fire in 2006. Since then, the district has made 29 funding requests totaling more than $8.4 million in needed repairs to the state for a range of projects on the school including roofing, emergency lighting and siding. Last year, the district received money for one of those — just under $2.3 million for “exterior repairs,” according to state data. The superintendent did not respond to questions about specific needs in Hooper Bay.
Alaska’s emergency management division does not have formal agreements with the state’s education department designating schools as emergency shelters, and neither agency has funding to help maintain schools specifically as emergency shelters. However, a division spokesperson said there are some state grants that schools could access for emergency preparedness.
“Schools are built for educational purposes — other uses are incidental or secondary to design,” education department spokesperson Bryan Zadalis wrote in an email. He said no one from the education department visits schools “to ascertain whether a facility is in condition to serve as an emergency shelter.”
“I don’t know if people necessarily correlated together that if you’re going to use schools as multipurpose facilities, that you also have to maintain them for those purposes,” said Tobin, the state senator. “They’re not just institutions of learning. They’re also institutions of after-school activities, of community gatherings, and of evacuation facilities and disaster preparedness support infrastructure,” she said. In February 2024, Tobin, who also sits on the state Senate’s Military and Veterans Affairs finance subcommittee, put the question of funding schools for emergencies to Craig Christenson, deputy commissioner of the Alaska Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, during a budget meeting.
Alaska’s emergency management division falls under Christenson’s department. “From my understanding,” Tobin said to him, “if the school wasn’t available in some of these very small, rural, remote areas, we would be paying to evacuate people, versus using an asset that we have already put resources into but have already failed to maintain. Is that accurate?”
“I can’t comment on failing to maintain them,” Christenson responded. “Our department does not maintain schools.” (The deputy commissioner declined to comment further on last year’s meeting.)
“But you do utilize them?” Tobin asked.
“We do,” Christenson said.

Gavin Newsom is also facing pressure to oust Commissioner Ricardo Lara as insurance policyholders struggle with delayed and denied claims months after the Los Angeles fires.,"In summary
California Gov. Gavin Newsom is also facing pressure to oust Commissioner Ricardo Lara as insurance policyholders struggle with delayed and denied claims months after the Los Angeles fires.


Survivors of the deadly Los Angeles County fires, some of whom have been unable to rebuild because their insurance claims have been delayed or denied, are calling for California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara to resign.
Lara, a former state lawmaker, has one year left in his second term. 
A recent New York Times article detailing loopholes the insurance industry could exploit in Lara’s plan to try to improve California insurance availability was the last straw, fire survivors said. They said it proved Lara has helped the insurance industry more than he has helped policyholders. 
Lara and others said his plan, which officially rolled out just days before the L.A.-area fires in January, is in its early stages and will take time to work.  
Jill Spivack, a State Farm policyholder whose home burned in the Palisades Fire, said during a press conference Thursday that she has been unable to rebuild.
“We feel alone, we feel forgotten,” she said. She implored Gov. Gavin Newsom to replace Lara. “Californians deserve an insurance commissioner that protects families, not the insurers doing harm,” Spivack said.
Lara — who also faces accusations of improper spending of taxpayer dollars on travel — told CalMatters in an interview that he has no plans to resign.
“I understand the anger (of fire victims),” Lara said. “I’m frustrated with the pace of recovery that involves multiple agencies, multiple levels of government.” 
He mentioned the actions he has taken in response, which include the Insurance Department’s June launch of a formal investigation into State Farm over its handling of claims from the L.A.-area fires; a legal action against the FAIR Plan, the state’s fire insurer of last resort; and a bulletin requiring insurance companies to fully investigate and pay smoke damage claims.
Lara’s efforts aren’t helping survivors quickly enough, some of them say. On a website the group recently launched calling for Lara’s resignation, the Eaton Fire Survivors Network links to surveys that say 70% of policyholders face delays and denials, and that 61% expect to lose housing coverage within months. They want the investigations sped up. They want Lara to pause  approvals of rate increases in the meantime.
Why one survivor wants Lara out
Andrew Wessels is still waiting to move back into his Altadena home, which did not burn down but was damaged. He first spoke with CalMatters in May, as he was battling State Farm over getting his home tested for toxins because he did not want to move his two children back into a potentially unhealthy environment. 
He told CalMatters on Friday that he is still waiting for more tests the insurer ordered as it decides what it wants to pay for. He expects to have to wait until next year before he and his family can actually rebuild. But he feels lucky that he, his wife and kids found semi-permanent housing after shuffling among Airbnbs since the fire. They are now three months into an 18-month lease that State Farm is paying for, and he’s breathing a little easier because he’s “not boxing up things every few weeks.” 
He is joining the call for Lara’s resignation. He said the state’s insurance department recently closed his complaint about State Farm’s handling of his claims based on the company’s word alone — without asking him first. 
“Recent information provided by the insurer states that the matter you originally brought to our attention is currently in stable condition,” the department’s Oct. 8 letter states. 
“It was particularly concerning that it was closed without talking to me,” Wessels said. “They’re supposed to represent me. I think it speaks to who the Department of Insurance actually serves.”
He appealed and asked a couple of his state lawmakers’ staff to contact the department on his behalf, and it reopened his complaint. 
“It was also concerning that ‘if State Farm says it, it must be true,’ since the department is investigating (the insurer) for illegal practices,” Wessels added. That proves a change is needed, he said. 
Newsom spokesperson Tara Gallegos and the governor’s office did not return repeated requests for comment about the calls for the governor to replace Lara.
Nicole Ganley, a spokesperson for the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, said the industry group would have no comment on the effort to oust Lara. She pointed to a letter to the editor the group sent to the New York Times, which took issue with the story about insurers reportedly exploiting loopholes in the commissioner’s new regulations by avoiding writing policies in certain areas, then turning around to request to raise their premiums anyway. 
“The reforms are recent, and their impact is still unfolding,” the letter says in part. “Suggesting failure at this stage misrepresents the facts and risks undermining public confidence in a strategy designed to stabilize coverage in high-risk areas.”
‘No magic wand’ for insurance crisis
Carmen Balber, executive director of Consumer Watchdog, the Los Angeles-based nonprofit organization that is often at odds with Lara, was also at the press conference. Throughout his tenure, her organization has questioned his insurance ties, beginning in 2019 when Lara received and returned campaign contributions from the industry. He ran for office pledging not to take money from companies he’d regulate. 
The organization is also the main intervenor in insurance rate reviews, meaning it often submits challenges to insurers’ proposed rate increases and changes. On Nov. 20, a public hearing is scheduled to discuss Lara’s proposed changes to the intervenor process, which Consumer Watchdog has characterized as the commissioner’s revenge.
“What we’ve seen happen over the past couple of years is things getting worse for consumers, not better,” Balber told CalMatters ahead of the press conference. “We need someone new in charge who will hold the industry accountable to its promises.”
But Amy Bach, executive director of San Francisco-based consumer advocacy group United Policyholders, said she is “sorry to see energy being expended in this direction.”
She said there are legal, regulatory and other efforts underway to try to improve the state’s home insurance market, and that bringing in a different commissioner isn’t likely to speed things up. “​​There is no magic wand that will solve the insurance challenges that are plaguing L.A. wildfire survivors and causing premiums to rise untenably across the state,” Bach said.
Robert Herrell, a former deputy insurance commissioner under Lara’s predecessor, also used the magic-wand analogy. As climate disasters and risks proliferate, there is no easy fix to what ails property insurance in this state, nation and the rest of the world, he said.
Yet he said survivors need a strong commissioner who stands up to the insurance industry. “This is not that commissioner,” said Herrell, who is now executive director of the nonprofit advocacy group Consumer Federation of California. “Just because he says that every time he takes action it’s for the consumers doesn’t make it true.”
Bach said Lara has had to find a way to balance competing interests: “No prior commissioner faced the marketplace conditions he’s faced, so it’s hard to say whether a heavier-handed approach would have worked any better than what he’s trying to achieve.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/091924_Ricardo-Lara_FG_CM_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-07 17:57:11.809480
,DC,2025-11-07 22:37:00+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Struggle in US Senate over government shutdown likely to drag through the weekend,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/struggle-us-senate-over-government-shutdown-likely-drag-through-weekend,,"WASHINGTON — Senators on Friday said they plan to remain in town for the weekend, a sign negotiations may be picking up to approve a stopgap spending measure and end the government shutdown, now at day 38.A vote on a package of spending bills could come either Saturday or Sunday that would partially fund the government, Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters.“Our members are going to be advised to be available if there's a need to vote,” Thune said. “We will see what happens and whether or not, over the course of the next couple of days, the Democrats can find a way to reengage again.”Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer offered a proposal from Democrats to agree to reopen the government if health care tax subsidies are continued for a year. As open enrollment begins, people who buy their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace are seeing a drastic increase in premium costs.“We’d like to offer a simple proposal,” the New York Democrat said. “To reopen the government and extend the (Affordable Care Act) tax credits simultaneously.” Republicans have maintained that any discussion on extending the health care tax credits set to expire at the end of the year will only happen after government funding resumes. House Speaker Mike Johnson this week said he would not promise a vote on the GOP-controlled House floor regarding the issue. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in September found that if lawmakers permanently extend the enhanced tax credits for certain people who buy their health insurance through the ACA Marketplace, it would cost the government $350 billion over 10 years and increase the number of those with health insurance by 3.8 million.But it was unclear how much traction Schumer would get. Several Republicans called the proposal a “non-starter,” such as Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota. Rounds also questioned if the stopgap spending bill that Democrats agreed to support is the House-passed version that would extend government funding only to Nov. 21 or another that would run longer. “It’s good that they’re recognizing that we have to open up the government,” Rounds said of Democrats. Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin called the proposal from Democrats “absurd,” and said there was no way senators could negotiate a deal on health care quickly.He added that Trump also wants to be part of the negotiations on health care.“Whatever we do as Republicans, we've got to really work close with the president,” Mullin said. “The President wants to be involved in this negotiation.”Separately, senators are expected to take a Friday vote on a bill from Wisconsin GOP Sen. Ron Johnson to pay federal workers who Friday missed their second paycheck. President Donald Trump on social media said, ""The United States Senate should not leave town until they have a Deal to end the Democrat Shutdown. If they can’t reach a Deal, the Republicans should terminate the Filibuster, IMMEDIATELY, and take care of our Great American Workers!""Flight cutbacks, food aid disruptionThe Senate has failed 14 times to move forward on approving a stopgap spending measure to fund the government until Nov. 21. As the government shutdown has dragged on for nearly seven weeks, major airports have been hit as they struggle to maintain flight schedules, with air traffic controllers now more than a month without pay.Meanwhile, federal courts have forced the Trump administration to release billions in emergency funds to provide critical food assistance to 42 million people. On Friday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it would issue full November benefits for food assistance in compliance with a court order.As the debate in Congress goes on, Democrats have refused to back the House-passed version of the GOP stopgap measure over their concerns about the expiration of health care subsidies.Democrats also want to see federal workers laid off by the Trump administration amid the shutdown rehired. Major wins across the country for Democrats in Tuesday elections in the states bolstered their resolve to reject efforts to end the government shutdown that do not include certain policy wins.  Historically, lawmakers who have forced shutdowns over policy preferences have not been successful. In 2013, the GOP tried to repeal or delay the Affordable Care Act, which did not happen, and in the 2018-2019 shutdown, Trump, in his first term, insisted on additional funding for a border wall. But that shutdown — which set a record exceeded only by the ongoing shutdown — concluded 35 days later with the same amount of money included in the original appropriations bill. Thune lamentThune told reporters Friday that he thought progress was being made on striking a deal to resume government funding, but he said after Democrats’ Thursday caucus meeting, their tune changed. “Right now, we've got to get the Democrats kind of back engaged,” Thune said.Following Thursday’s meeting, Democrats remained tight-lipped and did not seem any closer to an internal agreement on how to move forward with resolving the government shutdown.“I thought we were on a track,” Thune, a South Dakota Republican said. “We'd give them everything they wanted or had asked for.”Senate Republicans have agreed to allow a floor vote on the Affordable Care Act subsidies and have opened the door to rehiring federal workers, but have not gone further.“At some point … they have to take yes for an answer, and they were trending in that direction,” Thune said. “And then yesterday, everything kind of, the wheels came off, so to speak, but it's up to them.”Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut told reporters Thursday that voters this week made a strong showing in rebuking the Trump administration and that Democrats need to continue their fight amid the government shutdown.“On Tuesday, all of us in the caucus heard that loud and clear,” Murphy said. “We want to stay together and unified. I think everybody understands the importance of what happened on Tuesday, and wants us to move forward in a way that honors that.”Bill to pay federal workersFederal workers going without salaries for more than a month now remains a concern, and Johnson tried to pass his bill through unanimous consent that would send them paychecks. Employees are paid after the end of a shutdown, under the law.Michigan’s Gary Peters objected to Johnson’s bill over concerns that the Trump administration would not use the funds to pay federal workers, and the measure would not prevent the firing of federal workers. Peters pointed to how the Trump administration initially appealed a federal court order that compelled the U.S. Department of Agriculture to pay $9 billion in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits. Peters offered his own bill to set “guardrails” on the president's authority to ensure that the funds are used to pay federal workers and not moved around. The Trump administration has moved around billions in multi-year research funds within the Defense Department to ensure that troops are paid. “He walks over Congress all the time,” Peters said of the president while on the Senate floor. Johnson objected to Peters' bill. He argued that his bill does not expand presidential powers.“We were very careful that it wouldn't do that,” Johnson told reporters of his bill.The American Federation of Government Employees, a union that represents 800,000 federal workers, urged Democrats Friday to support Johnson’s bill.AFGE National President Everett Kelley said in a letter to senators Friday that with Thanksgiving in less than three weeks, Congress needs to come to an agreement on funding the government. “Every missed paycheck deepens the financial hole in which federal workers and their families find themselves,” Kelley said. “By the time Congress reaches a compromise, the damage will have been done to their bank accounts, their credit ratings, their health, and their dignity.”",,,,2025-11-07 17:57:11.809480

Sign up for their newsletter here.
New York environmental regulators on Friday approved a major Trump-backed underwater gas pipeline in a U-turn for state energy policy. 
The state Department of Environmental Conservation issued crucial water permits for the Northeast Supply Enhancement project, which it had rejected three times in the past. 
At the same time, the DEC announced that the even larger Constitution pipeline, slated to cross New York into New England, would not move ahead. Both pipelines were priorities for President Donald Trump, who railed against Governor Kathy Hochul on social media earlier this week for moving too slowly on the projects.
Hochul said she stood by the DEC’s decisions.
“We need to govern in reality,” she said in a statement Friday. “We are facing war against clean energy from Washington Republicans, including our New York delegation, which is why we have adopted an all-of-the-above approach that includes a continued commitment to renewables and nuclear power to ensure grid reliability and affordability.” She said that DEC’s approvals followed the review standard she had spelled out to Trump in May during talks that many credited with reviving the two pipeline projects. (Hochul has denied any quid pro quo.) 
“While I have expressed an openness to natural gas, I have also been crystal clear that all proposed projects must be reviewed impartially by the required agencies to determine compliance with state and federal laws,” Hochul said, noting that the Constitution pipeline failed to meet the bar. 
NESE is set to be New York’s first new gas pipeline in at least a decade, and by far the state’s largest expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure since passing its flagship climate law in 2019. 
Climate advocacy groups pounced on the decision, calling it a betrayal.
“Hochul has shown New Yorkers she’d prefer to do Trump’s dirty work rather than protect our waterways from pollution,” said Laura Shindell, New York state director at Food & Water Watch.  “She hasn’t kept her promises to fight against skyrocketing energy bills or the climate crisis. But New Yorkers will fight Hochul’s dirty pipeline every step of the way — alongside our communities — until it is stopped for good.”
“Governor Hochul is turning her back on the same agency scientists that determined the NESE pipeline would cause unacceptable degradation of water quality and marine life to NY waters just a few years ago,” said Roger Downs, conservation director of the Sierra Club’s Atlantic Chapter.
The DEC’s cover letter for the NESE permits did not detail how the pipeline’s construction would meet state water standards when the agency found the opposite five years ago, except noting that burying the pipeline two feet shallower than previously planned would dredge up less toxic sediment. The main permit requires Williams, the pipeline builder, to pay about $24 million to compensate for damages to fish and clam habitats. The DEC stated outright that the project is “inconsistent” with the emissions requirements of the state’s climate law, but said that mandate was overridden by energy regulators’ September finding that the pipeline was needed to maintain a reliable gas system downstate. 
The pipeline is projected to cost upwards of $2 billion, adding an extra $7.50 per month to average gas bills for National Grid customers in New York City and Long Island, the utility has estimated. 
The Independent Power Producers of New York, a power plant trade group, cheered the decision.
““New York’s energy landscape is at a pivotal moment,” said the group’s president Gavin Donohue. “I commend the DEC for recognizing that natural gas will continue to play a key role in the State’s energy future.”

(Photo by Glen Stubbe/Minnesota Reformer)The sheriff’s offices in eight Minnesota counties have agreed to assist federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement in their effort to ramp up deportations around the country, which immigrant rights advocates say creates a dangerous risk of civil rights violations, among other problems.  
The counties are Cass, Crow Wing, Freeborn, Itasca, Jackson, Kandiyohi, Mille Lacs and Sherburne, according to a list of agreements posted on the ICE website.
Freeborn, Kandiyohi and Sherburne counties have longstanding agreements with immigration authorities to detain immigrants in their county jails. 
The 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act gave ICE permission to enter into contracts with local law enforcement agencies to assist with the arrest and detention of immigrants. The contracts fall into three categories: task force model, warrant service officer and jail enforcement model. 
Sheriff’s offices with task force model agreements — Cass, Crow Wing, Itasca and Millie Lacs — can enforce immigration law on the streets or during routine police work, like traffic stops. The program was discontinued in 2012 after several controversies and a federal court finding that officers committed racial profiling.
The Trump administration revived the task force model shortly after the president’s inauguration to a second term. 
Warrant service officer contracts — signed by the sheriff’s offices of Crow Wing, Freeborn, Jackson and Kandiyohi counties — allow local officers to perform immigration arrests within jails and correctional facilities when requested, though those officers cannot independently interrogate detainees on their immigration status.
The jail enforcement model contracts, like that in Sherburne County, permit local law enforcement officers to question the immigration status of people held in the county jail, and detain them for up to 48 hours.
The Minnesota Interfaith Coalition on Immigration, or ICOM, is a member of several coalitions opposing the deputization of local law enforcement agencies to carry out federal immigration enforcement. 
“I want my law enforcement to have healthy relationships with everybody in the community, regardless of immigration status,” ICOM advocacy director Greg King said. Immigrants are less likely to report crimes or ask for help when local law enforcement officers arrest immigrants. Using local police for immigration enforcement also directs resources away from more serious crime and creates an avenue for racial profiling, King said. 
ICOM and allied organizations have backed state legislation that would bar Minnesota law enforcement agencies from entering into agreements with ICE, but that bill never passed. King said he expects it to be re-introduced in 2026; Republican House Speaker Lisa Demuth, who is also a candidate for governor, will surely block it. 
Other states have passed the opposite legislation — requiring local agencies to support ICE.

(Photo courtesy Ian Philabaum)The contract between Torrance County and federal immigration authorities to house immigrant detainees at an Estancia jail has been expired now for a week, a lapse that immigrant legal advocates say necessitates detainees’ immediate release. 
The Torrance County Detention Facility in Estancia is one of three in New Mexico that has an agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to house detainees. But that agreement expired Oct. 31 and  has not been renewed, advocates for the detainees and Torrance County Commission Chair Ryan Schwebach told Source New Mexico on Friday.
Ian Philabaum, a program director for Innovation Law Lab, said Friday that the contract’s expiration means ICE and CoreCivic, the private company that owns and operates the jail, no longer can legally hold hundreds of ICE detainees. Innovation Law Lab attorneys conduct weekly legal aid meetings with detainees and also are seeking to shut the facility down. 
Philabaum cited a section of ICE’s standard operating procedures that says a contract expiration requires the removal of all detainees and ICE equipment on or before the expiration date. 
Torrance County’s ICE detention agreement set to expire in two days amid federal shutdown

“CoreCivic and ICE are detaining people in immigration custody without the authority to do so, and because they cannot detain people at [the facility], they should all be released immediately,” he said. 
County Manager Jordan Barela did not respond to Source’s calls and emails Friday about the status of the contract. Source’s calls and emails to CoreCivic and ICE officials also were not returned Friday.
Amid the fallout of the contract expiration, Source received an email Friday from Rogelio Izquierdo, a detainee at the facility, who wrote a letter alleging that CoreCivic is continually denying detainees access to their lawyers. Six other detainees signed the letter. 
Philabaum confirmed Friday that Izquierdo is one of the nonprofit’s clients but said he wasn’t authorized to comment further about his case. He said Innovation Law Lab also received the letter and confirmed its authenticity.
CoreCivic’s alleged failure to facilitate detainees’ legal assistance denies “access to a fair defense and violate[s] the fundamental principle of equality before the law,” Izquierdo wrote. 
The most recent example occurred Thursday, according to the letter, when Izquierdo prepared to meet with his lawyers to collect “important translated documents” he needed for a final court hearing Nov. 13. But Izquierdo said he was never called to meet with his attorneys and then, around 2 p.m., officers told him that his lawyers had already left. 
What actually happened, according to Philabaum, is that Innovation Law Lab lawyers had arrived at the facility for their usual Thursday legal appointments but were ordered to leave about 30 minutes afterward.
U.S. Sen. Heinrich: Torrance ICE lockup ‘inadequate’ and ‘inappropriate’

The reason officers told them to leave, he said, is that they were “investigating” a protest the day before.
According to Philabaum, a few dozen protesters organized into a caravan that drove past the facility on Wednesday. He described it as a peaceful protest over the expired contract, and said he has no idea why CoreCivic would investigate it or use it as a reason to deny legal aid attorneys access.
“The response of ICE and Core Civic, which was clearly coordinated, was to deny access to counsel, which is extremely problematic…and a clear demonstration that it is not business as usual,” at the facility, he said. “They are continuing to ramp up their actions of impunity with respect to how they navigate immigration detention.”
In addition to citing the Thursday legal meeting that CoreCivic canceled, Izquierdo said CoreCivic often abruptly cancels meetings with lawyers without explanation, that detainees don’t have access to the legal library, phone communication does not work well and detainees have little access to pro bono attorneys.
The Estancia detention center has increasingly been at the center of statewide debates about local immigration detention amid President Donald Trump’s mass deportation push. 
U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) in June called for the center to be closed after his staff reported seeing “troubling conditions” during a visit in late May. A local advisory committee to the United States Civil Rights Commission made the same recommendation in  September.
According to the latest figures from DetentionReports, the facility now has an average daily population of about 550 detainees, which is about 150 more than earlier this year. Most of them are brought to Estancia from other states, Philabaum said, though some are from New Mexico.
Barela and other county officials have said the center provides “millions of dollars” in salaries to local residents in an otherwise depressed area.
Schwebach, the Commission chair, told Source in a phone interview that he’s growing tired of the controversy, which he said has resulted in threats against his family. He blamed out-of-town activists who he said don’t understand the importance of the facility to the community or ICE’s role in keeping people safe.
“They are not willing to look at the whole picture. And quite honestly, I’m getting tired of it,” he said. “I mean, do we not need any prisons within this country? Is that the end goal?”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_9750-1024x866.jpg,,,2025-11-07 17:57:11.809480

SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC, had been operating without official, published rules for the last few legislative sessions. That led to public disagreements between some members of the committee, and created some confusion about what it takes to pass and advance a budget out of JFAC. 
JFAC’s procedures were so confusing that at one point in March, the committee appeared to deviate from its own procedures when the committee’s two co-chairs, Sen. Scott Grow, R-Eagle, and Rep. Wendy Horman, R-Idaho Falls, did not have a written script in front of them to guide them through the process. 
Almost every other Idaho legislative committee has clear consistent rules governing how it meets, how it votes and what it takes to advance a bill. 
Everything that happens in JFAC is watched closely because the committee sets all of the budgets for every state agency and department. Whether it is money for Idaho State Police, pay and benefits for state employees or the budgets for Idaho’s K-12 public school system, it all goes through JFAC.

On Thursday, Grow and Horman announced that they had reached agreements with House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, and Senate President Pro Tem Kelly Anthon, R-Rupert, on procedures to guide JFAC. The procedures are outlined in a letter that Grow and Horman gave the other members of JFAC and the Idaho Capital Sun on Thursday. 
Idaho DOGE Task Force shares potential list of state programs, agencies to combine or eliminate

JFAC is made up of 20 members – 10 each from the Idaho House of Representatives and Idaho Senate. 
The biggest change is that it will no longer take six votes each from the 10 House members on JFAC and the 10 Idaho Senate members on JFAC to pass a budget. 
Instead, it will take a simple majority of those members present from each legislative chamber to pass a budget. 
That’s important because in 2025 – even when members were absent during a JFAC meeting – it still took six votes from each chamber. For example, if there were seven JFAC members from the Senate present and seven JFAC members from the House present, it took six “yes” votes from each chamber to pass a budget in 2025. That gave enormous power and leverage to any JFAC members who opposed budgets or budget line items because of the high bar required to pass a budget. 
Under the new procedures unveiled Thursday, it would only take four votes from each chamber to pass a budget under a scenario where seven members are present from each chamber for a vote. 
“So that’s going to make it easier for us to get things out of JFAC,” Grow said Thursday. 
JFAC will still count votes separately between the House members and Senate members. And any budget that fails to receive a majority vote among those members present from both chambers will be considered dead. If a budget dies, it can be rewritten and brought back at a later date to be considered.
 Rules outline how the committee’s co-chairs will share leadership responsibilities during the legislative session

The new JFAC procedures also specify that chairmanship of JFAC will alternate daily between the Senate Finance chairman (Grow) one day and the House Appropriations chairwoman (Horman) the next day. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In March, Moyle told the Idaho Capital Sun that one of the reasons the Idaho House did not adopt joint rules during the organizational session leading up to the 2025 legislative session is because he disagreed with Joint Rule 11, which gave the chairmanship of joint committees like JFAC to the Senate chairman. 
“… We’re not going to give up the ability to set agendas and share the chair, basically, and that’s the problem,” Moyle said in March.
After meeting with Moyle and Anthon, Grow said “the preference” is to bring a formal joint rule forward for both chambers of the Idaho Legislature to vote on and adopt during the upcoming 2026 legislative session. 
Grow said he and Horman wanted to distribute a letter outlining procedures now because he isn’t sure when the joint rule will come forward. 
“So in the interim – because here’s the problem – we don’t want to wait because we don’t know when the joint rule will be able to come out in the session,” Grow said. “We hope it’s the first week. But in case it isn’t, this will give you a little clarification.”
Sens. Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, and Kevin Cook, R-Idaho Falls, asked Grow and Horman if JFAC could vote on accepting the new procedures outlined in the letter.
Grow responded saying he had been told just to pass the letter out and that a formal joint rule coming forward later would “solve all of our problems.” 
In the interim, Grow told Cook that the letter outlining the new procedures represents their best shot to provide some consensus.
The Idaho Legislature is not in session now, but JFAC conducted three days of budget meetings and workshops in Boise this week to prepare for the upcoming 2026 legislative session.
The 2026 legislative session is scheduled to begin Jan. 12 at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise. 
Sen. Scott Grow, R-Eagle, and Rep. Wendy Horman, R-Idaho Falls, shared a letter on Nov. 6 outlining how the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee will vote and conduct business.

Jim Runestad of White Lake, has resigned from her post, the party confirmed on Friday — and with that has come rumors that she is gearing up to run for Michigan’s soon-to-be vacant U.S. Senate seat.
Well-known Republican political consultants confirmed with Michigan Advance on Friday that the speculation over Smith resigning and seeking the Senate seat have been boiling over the past several weeks, and that she had been telling high-profile members of the GOP of her plans to seek Michigan’s U.S. Senate seat that will open up with the retirement of U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Township) next year.
Both Jason Cabel Roe, of Roe Strategic LLC, as well as Dennis Lennox, who has worked in strategic communications over the past decade, as well as for high profile party events, told the Advance that they were privy to that speculation, as well.
A message seeking comment from Smith was not immediately returned.

Runestad confirmed to Michigan Advance on Friday that Smith resigned, but could not say whether that resignation occurred on Thursday or today. 
Although the party won’t officially select a nominee until the August 2026 primary election, the Republican establishment in Michigan and abroad has been posturing as all in on Mike Rogers, a former mid-Michigan congressman and the only big name in the race. Rogers has also been endorsed by President Donald Trump.
For Smith, who is known by GOP grassroots activists throughout Michigan and was a party leader even before she was chosen by party delegates earlier this year to ascend as co-chair with Runestad, jumping into the race now may not bode well for Rogers, whose campaign has proceeded as if the nomination was secured.
Earlier buzz that U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Holland Township) would also seek the nomination ended in July, when he confirmed he would instead seek reelection to his West Michigan congressional seat.
But there have been some dissenting voices questioning whether grassroots Republicans were ready to bet on Rogers to the degree that national Republicans were.
A message was also left for the Rogers’ campaign, but has yet to be returned.
Adding fuel to the speculation is the fact that Smith’s personal website, which was used during her previous campaign for ethnic vice chair of the Michigan Republican Party and later when she ran with Runestad, has a registered cloned domain name of bernadettesmithforsenate.com.
That URL redirects to Smith’s existing website. The domain was registered on Oct. 22. 
No campaign committee information for Smith exists in the Federal Elections Commission candidate database, but new filings could be affected by the ongoing federal government shutdown.

(Photo courtesy of New Mexico Aging Services)New Mexico’s Aging and Long-Term Care Department launched its Kinship Caregiving Pilot Program this month, connecting grandparents, family members and family friends raising children not biologically theirs to services and monthly financial support.
House Bill 252 passed during the legislative session earlier this year established the pilot program to support New Mexico caregivers and children to thrive in their own homes. The bill authorized the department to create the program, establish participant eligibility and connect eligible families to monthly financial support. The program launched in Rio Arriba and San Juan counties on Nov. 1 and the department is now accepting applications.
HB252 notes that the three-year pilot will be offered in five to seven counties with up to 50 participants in each county. ALTSD Deputy Secretary Angelina Flores-Montoya told Source New Mexico that to start, the department chose two counties with some of the greatest need, and has plans to expand to more counties by spring 2025. 
According to a 2024 report by the LANL Foundation, about 36,000 children were in kinship care in 2023, though the report states that the number is likely an underestimate due to informal arrangements with families and close friends. The report also notes that the number of children in kinship care in New Mexico is much higher than the nationwide average of 3%, and is often caused by “parental alcohol and drug misuse.” 
“While grandparents and kin often play a pivotal role in raising children, offering cultural and linguistic connection, a sense of extended love, community, and support, many kinship caregivers are unexpectedly raising children due to difficult circumstances,” the report reads. “These caregivers are often unprepared emotionally, mentally, physically, financially or logistically to take on these new responsibilities.”
Kinship program will begin after rulemaking this summer

Flores-Montoya said the department is reviewing applications and starting to notify families of their status. However, the stipend for Rio Arriba and San Juan participants will not start until January 2026. Financial assistance is based on the caregiver’s household income and the needs of the child, according to the bill, and comes from private partnerships. The Los Alamos National Laboratory Foundation and the Anchorum Health Foundation will support participants in Rio Arriba County and San Juan County respectively. 
“Because this is a pilot program, we’re actually still testing sort of what our case loads will be for our case managers, but we’re going to start with 50 and we have the funding for 50 participants to receive the stipend, but anyone is eligible for the navigation services,” Flores-Montoya said. “The state will provide the navigation services, the staff, the evaluation, a number of the operational pieces, the legal services, but the private or foundational partner in that partnership will provide the financial stipend.”
She emphasized that families not chosen to participate in the pilot program and to receive financial assistance will still have access to state and local services.
“In New Mexico, we know that families take many forms,” Emily Kaltenbach, ALTSD Secretary, said in a statement. “Kinship caregivers help keep these children connected to their roots and their communities. This pilot program is about honoring that and helping provide the tools, support and stability these caregivers need to continue providing those safe and nurturing homes.”
Flores-Montoya told Source that the department is also working with school districts throughout the state, health clinics, family resource centers and other community partners “that might provide similar services to either foster families or other kinship families.”
How to apply, eligibility and how the program is going to help count among the most common questions, Flores-Montoya said. “We’re working with all of these different organizations and everyone is extremely excited that there’s just another opportunity and program that can help to support these families.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ESP06187-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-07 17:17:10.278602

Benjy Adler described an endless hiring cycle, long commutes for staff and compromised standards generally held for prospective employees. Still, he said the restaurant isn’t saying goodbye to Stowe quite yet.

Photo by Gordon Miller/Stowe Reporter
This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in the Stowe Reporter on Nov. 6, 2025.
The Skinny Pancake, a regional breakfast and brunch chain, will close its Stowe location for at least the winter season, blaming an inability to hire and retain enough staff to effectively run the restaurant.
In an open letter published on the restaurant’s website and on social media, Skinny Pancake owner Benjy Adler was unequivocal in pointing to Stowe’s housing and labor crises as the forces preventing him from keeping his Stowe location open.
Adler wrote that the entire state of Vermont, where he operates four restaurants, has a housing and labor shortage, but the problem is more acute in Stowe than anywhere else. He pointed to the long commutes employees have had to make to work at his restaurant to an inability to live nearby, a problem a July Housing Needs Assessment commissioned by the town of Stowe also identified as a primary contributor to the town’s tight labor market.
“Vermont has a very severe and different employment issue than Massachusetts or New York, and it is worse in Stowe than any of the other places we operate, by far,” Adler said.
He described an endless hiring cycle that frustrated any attempt to build a sustainable work culture, workers driving from an hour away, and a tight labor market compromising the standards he generally holds for prospective employees. He said both he and his regional manager have compromised their work-life balance just to keep the doors open on the weekends.
Adler acquired the former location of McCarthy’s, a restaurant that operated in Stowe for decades, at the end of 2019, and had managed to endure the pandemic, but has had a tougher time managing the problems created by the market forces that continued in its wake.
He also pointed to an inability to compete in Stowe’s shallow labor pool against restaurants that function more as hotel and resort amenities rather than standalone businesses, referring to them as “certain employers in town that don’t need to make money on food service.”
While he called on “town planners, community members and stakeholders to dig deep in addressing this issue in a long term and meaningful way” in his open letter, Adler admitted he has been busy trying to keep the doors open and manage his eight still-open restaurants while trying to open a new location in Albany, New York; he has not been, that is, watching the discussion and policy development currently underway in an attempt to address the town’s housing crisis.
After a short-term rental registry that went live this spring revealed that a large majority of rental owners don’t live in the town, the town has begun taking steps toward encouraging the building of more affordable housing and limiting rentals.
The Stowe Selectboard recently began drafting new policy that would place a cap on short-term rentals. The planning commission has also recommended the town hire a consultant and lawyer to draft an inclusionary zoning ordinance that could encourage the development of more affordable housing in Stowe. Other discussions indicate an interest in potentially establishing a housing reserve trust to manage funding meant to address the town’s housing issues.
The Skinny Pancake isn’t saying goodbye to Stowe quite yet, and Adler plans to take some time to reset and reconsider how the restaurant operates, including organizational structure and compensation, but the problems plaguing his restaurant and others in Stowe are unlikely to be solved in a season.
“If this town wants a sustainable tourist industry, it needs housing in town, not people driving from an hour away,” he said

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-07 21:58:40+00:00,CT Mirror,"Gov. Lamont calls special session, lays out agenda","John Moritz, Katy Golvala and Emilia Otte",,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/07/gov-lamont-calls-special-session-lays-out-agenda/,"Beyond housing, CT lawmakers will take up immigration, food assistance, a hospital acquisition and other issues when they convene next week.","Gov. Ned Lamont released a call, and an agenda, for a special session of the Connecticut General Assembly Friday afternoon after revealing a re-worked version of a housing bill that he spent months negotiating with lawmakers and municipal leaders.
In addition to taking a second bite at the apple of housing reform, Connecticut lawmakers will take up immigration, food assistance, a hospital acquisition and other issues when they convene in Hartford next week for a two-day session.
Among the most pressing issues is the ongoing federal government shutdown that threatens to cut off funding for food stamps, energy assistance and other programs that send federal money flowing into Connecticut. In addition, Democrats want to pass new protections for immigrants that would prevent their data from being shared by state agencies with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The session agenda also includes a bonding package that would provide funding to expand the UConn Health system, as well as a bill to replenish the state’s firefighter cancer relief fund with a new surcharge on monthly phone bills.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said lawmakers will take up those items through several separate bills rather than combining them into one omnibus measure.
The special session will take place over two days to pass the bills, with the House meeting on Nov. 12 followed by the Senate on Nov. 13. While Republicans are expected to voice opposition to some of items on the call, Democrats control both chambers and are expected to send the entire slate of bills to Lamont’s desk.
“It’s going to be a long day, but it should be relatively smooth,” Ritter said. 
Budget reserves
In order to prepare for the loss of federal funding due to the ongoing government shutdown — which became the longest in U.S. history this week — or other cuts that may emerge from the Trump administration, Lamont and lawmakers have agreed to direct another $500 million into the state’s rainy day fund.
That fund is currently full at it’s statutory limit of $4.3 billion, or 18% of the general fund. The special session legislation will temporarily raise that limit to $4.8 billion through the end of the fiscal year on June 30, 2026.
Lamont will have broad discretion over how to spend the additional $500 million, Ritter said, as long as it is related to the loss of federal revenues. 
In particular, lawmakers in both parties have been pushing Lamont to use the state’s ample budget reserves to prevent the loss of any federal benefits through programs such as food stamps or the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which provides provides winter heating assistance. 
“Generally I am supportive of doing something to mitigate the impact from the government shutdown, including the loss of SNAP and LIHEAP,” said House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford. 
Speaking to reporters on Friday, Lamont said that he had already authorized the Department of Social Services to fully fund SNAP benefits through the end of this month by using up to $72 million from the state’s rainy day fund. 
The announcement came after the Trump administration sought permission from a federal appeals court to only partially fund the program, then reversed course. Roughly 360,000 Connecticut residents rely on SNAP benefits to purchase food.
“This herky-jerky back and forth is driving people crazy,” Lamont said. “Let’s take care of people. We can afford to do it.”
Immigration
In response to a months-long push by Democrats and local activists, the special session will also include legislation prohibiting immigration officers from wearing masks while making arrests, and limiting when state agencies such as the Department of Motor Vehicles can share residents’ data with federal officials.
In addition, the bill is will codify a policy put in place by the Connecticut Supreme Court earlier this year preventing federal agents from making immigration related arrests within state courthouses without a warrant.
Those changes are aimed at bolstering an existing state law, the Trust Act, which generally prohibits local and state law enforcement from arresting someone solely on the basis of a request from ICE to do so. There are some exceptions, such as when ICE presents a judicial warrant, if the person is on a terrorist watch list or if they have been convicted or pleaded guilty to certain felony crimes.
The Trust Act has been the subject of intense debate in the state legislature, and changes were eventually passed that expanded the list of crimes for which police officers could hand someone over to ICE and opened an avenue for people to sue cities and towns that cooperated with ICE in violation of state law.
But in the wake of high profile detentions by ICE, including enforcement activities in the courthouse in Stamford, in downtown Danbury and at a car wash in Newington, advocates have been calling on state lawmakers to further limit federal officials’ ability to access information or enter certain facilities.
In September, 92 organizations wrote a letter to Gov. Ned Lamont asking that the state limit the amount of personal data shared between state agencies and the federal government, prohibit ICE from making arrests at courthouses and continue to offer state health insurance to unauthorized migrant children and pregnant women.
“Now is the time for our elected officials to meet this moment with the urgency it requires,” the letter said. “This moment makes it clear – Connecticut must not be complicit in the federal government’s abusive immigration enforcement tactics or its creeping authoritarianism.”
The latest bill is expected to attract pushback from Republicans, who have accused Democrats in Connecticut of hindering federal law enforcement operations. 
“By not allowing arrests in courts, and not cooperating with the federal agencies, ICE has become sort of a lone ranger,” Candelora said.
Hospital money
The legislature will vote to authorize a bonding package to fund the expansion of UConn Health. The planned expansion includes the purchase of Waterbury Hospital from bankrupt hospital operator Prospect Medical Holdings, as well as the acquisition of two other private, independent hospitals that are also struggling: Bristol Hospital and Day Kimball Hospital in Putnam.
If approved by the legislature, the state could borrow as much as $390 million to invest in the hospitals over a five-year period, according to a presentation during an Oct. 3 meeting of the University of Connecticut’s Board of Trustees and the UConn Health Board of Directors.
The debt would be added to the “UConn 2000” bonding package and go towards the acquisition of Waterbury Hospital and capital improvements projects at all three facilities. The financing to purchase Bristol and Day Kimball Hospitals would be handled separately, State Comptroller Sean Scanlon told The Connecticut Mirror last month. He said Waterbury Hospital, in particular, would need a major influx of capital funding to bring it up to the state’s standards for medical facilities.
On Friday, UConn Health submitted a $13 million offer to acquire Waterbury, including $4 million for the operating assets and $9 million for the real estate. The state will also assume a limited set of the hospital’s liabilities, bringing the deal’s total value up to $35 million, according to the terms laid out in court documents.
During a press conference, Lamont highlighted the effort it took to find a buyer for the struggling hospital.
“We had to work really hard after what Prospect did to that hospital. We’ve got a strong bidder,” Lamont said. “I want people to know Waterbury Hospital is going to thrive under new leadership.”
Firefighters and other items
The session will also include an update to recently-passed legislation imposing a 5-cent fee on monthly phone bills to provide a steady revenue stream to the Connecticut firefighters cancer relief account. The account provides wage replacementbenefits for both paid and volunteer firefighters diagnosed with cancer. 
While the fee was originally approved by lawmakers as part of budget legislation earlier this year, the language included an opt-out provision that has been difficult for the phone companies to implement, according to Todd Murphy, a spokesman for the House Democrats.
As a result, lawmakers are planning to remove the opt-out provision and delay the implementation of the fee until a later date, Murphy said. 
Republicans had voiced opposition to the fee when it was first proposed, and some may do so again when it is brought back up in the special session. The Senate Minority Leader, Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, called the firefighters fund a “noble cause,” but suggested the roughly $3 million that is expected to be collected from the fees could come from other areas.
“I’d much rather see that in the confines of the state budget than to see it off budget and collected as some kind of fee,” Harding said. 
Lawmakers will also take up a childrens’ behavior health bill that passed with bipartisan support in the House in June, only to die in the Senate. There are also smaller changes having to do with applications for the Temporary Family Assistance program as well as clarifying procedures around the creation of electoral districts.

“Plastic fields are a particularly harmful plan in a town like Hinesburg that relies on well water,” said Jennifer Decker, a self-described “clean water activist” who sits on the Hinesburg Planning Commission.

This story by Jason Starr was first published in the Williston Observer on Nov. 6, 2025.
Night games. Outdoor assemblies. Alumni events — members of the Champlain Valley Union High School community are thrilled at the possibility of adding an artificial turf field to the high school grounds in Hinesburg. 
But a group of residents tasked with protecting the town’s natural resources is coalescing in opposition to the project. 
In August, Charlotte parent Eli Lesser-Goldsmith approached the Champlain Valley School Board with an idea to privately fund a replacement of the school’s natural grass soccer-lacrosse field with synthetic turf, new bleachers and lights. Lesser-Goldsmith, CEO of Healthy Living market, is leading a fundraising group that intends to secure donations to cover the estimated $5.5 million installation cost.
Residents of the school district voted down a bond proposal to build a turf field at the high school about a decade ago. An Oct. 30 news release distributed by Lesser-Goldsmith says his plan revives “a long-held vision without burdening taxpayers.” 
But it’s not the cost that Hinesburg environmentalists are wary of. It’s the material that the turf is made from and its potential impact on natural resources, particularly the watershed. 
To PFAS, or too PFAS
During an Oct. 14 meeting of the Hinesburg Conservation Commission, members cast doubt on artificial turf manufacturers’ claims about the presence of what are known as “forever chemicals” — perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) — in their product. They expressed concern about the synthetic grass and underlying rubber pellets degrading over time and affecting groundwater, from which town residents and schools, including Champlain Valley Union, get drinking water.
A week after the meeting, commission members Meg Handler and Bill Scott sent a letter to the school board asking it to abandon the project. 
“It is widely known and well documented that artificial turf contains PFAS, as well as microplastics and numerous other chemicals that are hazardous to human health and the environment,” they wrote. “The installation of artificial turf in Hinesburg is … a very serious health and environmental issue that should worry members of the CVU community and all town residents.”
Lesser-Goldsmith said his group plans to use the same product — from the FieldTurf company based in Montreal — that has been installed in multiple municipalities throughout Vermont in recent years, including Burlington, Rutland, Middlebury and South Burlington.
“We are not reinventing the wheel,” he said. “The same product is going in at CVU that has been put in across the state. It meets the letter of the law for the State of Vermont.”
FieldTurf released a report in November 2022 addressing the question of PFAS in its turf. The detection of very low levels of a limited number of PFAS in the synthetic turf components does not represent a human health risk to those using the synthetic turf ballfields,” the report summary reads.
“We believe wholeheartedly in the safety of our products,” FieldTurf Executive Vice President Darren Gill added.
The FieldTurf report doesn’t address potential environmental and broader human health impacts, which is the main concern of Hinesburg environmentalists. 
“Plastic fields are a particularly harmful plan in a town like Hinesburg that relies on well water,” said Jennifer Decker, a self-described “clean water activist” who sits on the Hinesburg Planning Commission. “The toll of microplastics, PFAS, and carcinogens in the (turf) may not be seen for years, but will be very costly to the town schools, and will increase healthcare expenses over time.”
In the three years since FieldTurf’s PFAS tests, the State of Vermont passed Act 131, a law banning the manufacture or sale of artificial turf known to contain PFAS. The law goes into effect this January. Decker believes any future installation of FieldTurf at CVU would violate the law. 
Lesser-Goldsmith said he’s not yet sure if the project will require a permit from the Town of Hinesburg. He said a state stormwater permit will be required. Decker said that, while the change of field surface would not necessitate a town permit application, the addition of lighting above the field may require approval from the town’s Development Review Board. 
“We’re just starting our (engineering) drawings and the permitting process now,” Lesser-Goldsmith said.
Weighing the benefits
The impetus for going from grass to turf is to increase practice and game opportunities for CVU athletes. Outdoor sports teams are affected by cancellations caused by saturated fields during rainy stretches of weather. 
“When it rains, we can’t use our field, so getting turf would provide consistency and be a great way to improve the experience for players and the community that supports us,” CVU sophomore soccer player Elliana Antonucchi said in the Oct. 30 news release. “Plus, we want to have night games with all our fans cheering and having fun.”
School district leaders envision uses beyond athletics, noting that the field would be the only outdoor space large enough to host the entire student body. 
“Having one space where everyone can connect will be immensely impactful in terms of engagement and opportunity,” CVSD Superintendent Adam Bunting said in the release. “I see this as more than just a field as it will benefit so many more people than our student-athletes. It’ll be a point of pride and connection for our whole community.”

((Photo by Sam Bailey/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — After days of uncertainty about whether the federal government would release funding for food assistance, the Department for Children and Families announced Friday that it issued November benefits.
Kansans should have full access to their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits by the end of the day Friday, the state agency said on its website.
“All current Kansas beneficiaries will receive benefits on Nov. 7 instead of the typical monthly issuances that are staggered over a 10-day period according to last name,” the site said.
In a news release, Kansas Appleseed, which advocates to fight food insecurity, said “SNAP is one of the most effective tools we have to prevent hunger and strengthen local economies.”
“Every $1 spent through SNAP generates $1.50 into Kansas grocery stores, farmers markets, and small businesses, helping communities thrive while ensuring that families have access to healthy, affordable food,” the statement said.
The total November benefit distribution is more than $31.6 million to approximately 86,000 Kansas households, the DCF website said.

“This is great news for the thousands of Kansans who rely on this assistance to help put nutritious food on their tables,” said DCF Secretary Laura Howard in a news release. “I’m incredibly proud of how quickly the DCF team has been able to process multiple changes to the November benefits amount, work with our benefits processing partners to make adjustments and ultimately get this critical assistance out to Kansans as quickly as possible.”
On Oct. 28, Gov. Laura Kelly joined a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture for unlawfully suspending the SNAP program. The issuance of full November benefits comes after a federal judge on Thursday ordered USDA to full fund SNAP for November.

That’s exactly what’s already playing out as a key member of the House prepares to advance a plan to ease 2030 climate targets and cut the budget for the state’s energy efficiency program.  
Rep. Mark Cusack, co-chair of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy, told CommonWealth Beacon that he is planning to use Gov. Maura Healey’s energy affordability bill filed earlier this year as a vehicle to achieve those policy points and others. He is aiming for his redraft of Healey’s legislation to receive a floor vote before lawmakers break for the year on November 19.  
Cue the outrage. 
“We will fill the Statehouse,” said Larry Chretien, executive director at Green Energy Consumers Alliance. “This is going to be one of the bigger deals for the environmental community in a long time. We’re going to give it everything.” 
The effort is bound to divide the Democratic supermajority on Beacon Hill and test officials’ willingness to defend the state’s climate policies just as winter hits and Healey mounts a reelection bid.  
Cusack is arguing that because of a seismic crackdown on clean energy from the Trump administration, the state is likely to miss its goal to halve its emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. Keeping those short-term commitments on the books, then, is political and legal malpractice, he said, opening the state up to legal challenges. 
Plus, fury over sky-high energy bills last winter proved to Beacon Hill that officials need to do everything in their power to lower gas and electric costs, Cusack said. Those factors triggered Healey’s energy package, which aims to save ratepayers $10 billion over a decade, and pushed the state into “all-of-the-above” energy mode as the White House works to choke off new offshore wind and solar power.  
“We’re looking at the real possibility here, in the objective analysis, that we are not going to make our greenhouse reduction mandates,” Cusack said. “I have not found anyone who says that we are going to make our mandates.”  
But Chretien, who successfully sued the state a decade ago along with other groups for Massachusetts’s failure to do more to combat climate change, said Cusack’s concern over litigation is a “boogeyman.” 
“At this point, we want Massachusetts to give its best effort,” he said. “We’ve got five years to go to move the needle on emissions. It’s way too early to think about that. I’m just looking for effort. We understand what the Trump administration is doing to climate policy and that makes it harder. So talk to me seven years from now.” 
Part of the pushback, too, is rooted in pure shock. 
“I never would have thought that we would ever, ever say that we were going to, based subsequently on something that is happening federally, turn and say, ‘Oh, well, maybe we need to delay or rethink.’ People are looking to us as to what to do because we have the trifecta,” said Cabell Eames, an environmental policy consultant with Castling Strategies. “If our state decides that it’s going to delay or rethink its climate targets, that is going to send shockwaves and a ripple effect across the United States that we just do not need at this time. There’s a whole economy that’s attached to this. This just isn’t the Massachusetts that I know.” 
Cusack is also proposing to cut Mass Save’s budget by $500 million as a way to save customers money, since the program is funded by ratepayers and appears as a line item on bills.  
He couched his actions by vowing not to touch the state’s larger commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 85 percent by 2050 and not wanting to hamstring Mass Save’s substantive work, instead focusing on reigning in its advertising and administrative budget. 
But advocates warned that reducing the program’s budget will only exacerbate the state’s affordability crisis in the long run, not alleviate it. Mass Save is a collaboration among the state’s utilities to electrify and weatherize homes and install technologies like heat pumps that can significantly reduce energy bills.  
The program provided $2.8 billion in total benefits in 2024 and installed nearly 90,000 heat pumps over the past three years. 
“Massachusetts is starting to head somewhere where we should not head, which is trying to say that energy affordability and climate goals are competing goals and that we need to have either/or,” said Mary Wambui, co-chair of the Energy Efficiency Advisory Council’s energy equity working group, and a fellow at MassINC. (MassINC publishes CommonWealth Beacon.)  
Even with Mass Save’s issues – explored in a state auditor report that found that denser communities contribute more into the program but reap fewer benefits – such a cut is “penny wise and pound foolish” that would harm some of the most energy-burdened households in the state, said John Walkey, director of climate justice and waterfront initiatives at environmental justice organization GreenRoots.  
Cusack said he has House Speaker Ron Mariano’s support for his plan, though Ana Vivas, a spokesperson for Mariano, said he hasn’t yet taken an official position.  
“The speaker looks forward to reviewing the bill and discussing with his colleagues in the House,” Vivas said in a statement. 
Cusack appeared to recognize that his counterpart in the Senate, Michael Barrett of Lexington, isn’t likely to go along with the House redraft. Barrett declined to comment on the House effort, as did Senate President Karen Spilka.  
And Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Rebecca Tepper told CommonWealth Beacon last month that pushing back the state’s climate goals is “not our focus right now.”   
But in a sign of how far the pendulum has swung since the state adopted near-term climate targets just four years ago under Republican Gov. Charlie Baker, the Healey administration didn’t offer a robust defense of the clean energy commitments when asked on Friday. Karissa Hand, a spokesperson for Healey, simply said that “the governor will review the final version that reaches her desk.” 
“This is a big moment of truth” for Healey, Chretien said. 
The looming battle over the climate commitments, which could derail Healey’s energy agenda and dominate the final weeks on Beacon Hill before the new year, also shows that even deep-blue Massachusetts will have to contend with a shifting national mood around energy policy.  
Kyle Murray, Massachusetts program director at the nonprofit group Acadia Center, said in a statement that while the state must adapt to new roadblocks posed by the federal government, policymakers should “redouble efforts” to meet the climate targets. 
“Simply put, weakening targets is essentially granting the state permission to fail, and failure is not acceptable – certainly not five years before a deadline,” he said. 
While Chretien argues there’s growing public support for clean energy in general, the repercussions of Trump’s victory last year are giving officials pause. 
He said there is a real economic benefit to keeping the state’s climate targets in place given its valuable scientific and climate tech sectors that can flourish based on an economywide transition off fossil fuels that serves as the backbone of the green commitments.  
But there’s some symbolism in there, too. 
“If Massachusetts pulls back – let’s be honest, we don’t want to inflate our position in the world – but we are one of the most affluent, progressive places in the world,” Chretien said. “It sends an awful message to move the goal posts. There’s an opportunity for us to stay the course, do what we can on clean energy, and that will not happen if we backslide.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/climate-protests-2-1-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-07 17:01:24.081763

(Screenshot from livestream)The two million Pennsylvanians who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) could have their benefits restored by midnight, Gov. Josh Shapiro said Friday in a Philadelphia press conference. 
“When SNAP was taken away from our fellow Pennsylvanians, we saw an immediate impact. Folks came knocking on the doors here at Share,” said Shapiro, speaking at hunger relief organization Share Food Program. “One out of every eight of our neighbors relies on this funding, and it was taken away.”
Uncertainty over SNAP benefits hits home in Pa.’s coal region

Benefits are awarded on a rolling basis, meaning that only a fraction of residents were due to receive their SNAP dollars sometime this week. Shapiro praised the Department of Health Services for quickly processing roughly $100 million in funds awarded “within the last few hours,” saying a full accounting could be released Saturday. 
Two million Pennsylvanians, equal to more than 15% of the state’s population, receive a combined $366 million in monthly SNAP benefits. 
It was unclear late Friday afternoon when additional funding would become available for payments typically made later in the month.
“So if you’re one of those people that had a zero on your SNAP card because you were supposed to get your benefits on the first of the month, go check it out,” Shapiro said. “Those dollars are flowing. We are hoping that by this evening, maybe midnight or so, that all those individuals who were owed money over the first week or so of this month — who haven’t gotten it from the federal administration — are going to get their money.” 
 Court battle background

As the longest-ever federal government shutdown stretches into its sixth week, the billions sent out in food assistance have appeared to be at risk. Shapiro joined a lawsuit suing the Trump administration, attempting to pressure the U.S. Department of Agriculture to release the funds after the agency said it couldn’t tap contingency funds. Additionally, Shapiro earmarked $5 million in state funds for food banks and encouraged people to donate to a private sector fundraising campaign, saying $2 million had been contributed so far.
Friday’s announcement comes one day after a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to pay the full $9 billion in nutritional assistance benefits for the month of November by the end of the week in a separate case. 
Initially, the court ordered the Trump administration to make partial November payments, which would have required recalculating benefits through a formula and could have delayed delivery, by Wednesday. After failing to meet that deadline, the judge ordered full payments.
Shapiro pinned the blame on President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, saying “we’ve got an administration in Washington, (D.C.) that doesn’t give a damn about their neighbors in need.” 

He noted that the administration had filed an appeal in an attempt to reverse the judge’s order. 
“We stood together as Pennsylvanians, donating money, donating time (and) donating canned good to be able to be in a position to love thy neighbor, as is commanded in our Bible,” said Shapiro. “And my appeal to the Trump administration is just do the right thing. Give up. You’re going to lose again in court. And the only thing you’re fighting for — think about this — the only thing you’re fighting for is to make Americans hungry.”
Shapiro, who’s rumored to be exploring a presidential campaign in 2028, continued to criticize both Trump and Vance — calling the latter a “total phony.” At one point, Shapiro got emotional, invoking scripture as his impetus for aiding Pennsylvania’s hungry.
“I’m sorry that the federal government has held you captive; I’m sorry the federal government has quite literally taken food out of your children’s mouths,” said Shapiro, when asked what he’d say to SNAP recipients. “We’re going to do everything we can here in Pennsylvania to love thy neighbor.”

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Virginia Democrats’ effort to jump-start the process of redrawing the state’s congressional maps is already tied up in court — but so far, judges don’t seem eager to stop it. 
A trio of court clerks voluntarily dismissed their lawsuit Thursday, three days after Richmond Circuit Court Judge Tracy Thorne-Begland said they lacked standing to block the redistricting process as it currently stands. 
And in a separate case in Tazewell County, Republican lawmakers dropped a portion of their lawsuit aimed at thwarting Democrats’ redistricting push after Judge Jack Hurley Jr. similarly declined to interfere in legislative proceedings.
Republicans have remained tight-lipped about their next steps in court. But University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias said lawyers could regroup after the rush of pre-election legal challenges, which he said may have also been directed at persuading voters.
“They may try other judges, or they may try other theories, or there may be a way to to live a fight another day,” Tobias said.
Top Democrats in the General Assembly surprised their GOP colleagues last month by calling an 11th-hour, pre-election special session with the goal of advancing a proposed amendment to the Virginia Constitution. The amendment would allow the legislature to redraw the state’s Congressional seats in the middle of the decade in response to similar actions by other states.
Democrats said they made the move reluctantly, to counter gerrymandering in Texas and other GOP-led states done at the behest of President Donald Trump.
While the state Senate approved the proposal on Oct. 31, the process is far from over. Lawmakers will need to approve it again when they meet in January before sending the amendment for final consideration by voters, likely in the spring of 2026.
The two lawsuits sought to block the process before it could make it that far. In both complaints, attorneys argued the special session itself had not been properly called. 
The trio of circuit court clerks who filed the Richmond case — Heidi Barshinger of Henrico County, Christalyn Jett of Spotsylvania County and Gordon Erby of Lunenburg County — also argued Democrats had failed to follow the procedure laid out for constitutional amendments by holding their first vote on the proposal in the midst of early voting in the House of Delegates election. 
The clerks claimed lawmakers had put them in a bind by failing to provide copies of the proposed amendment 90 days before an election, as required by a section of state code Democrats argued is antiquated. 
On Oct. 29, midway through the special session, Hurley declined to issue the emergency injunction sought by Republican lawmakers.
The second lawsuit, filed minutes after the state Senate gavelled out on Oct. 31, got an emergency hearing on Nov. 3. 
But in a ruling from the bench and later written opinion, Thorne-Begland denied the clerks’ emergency restraining order and preliminary injunction, writing that any harm they might face was “entirely speculative,” given the General Assembly clerks had yet to pass them copies of the proposed amendment to post at courthouses. 
Thorne-Begland also said it was not the judiciary’s place to interfere in constitutional amendments under consideration by the General Assembly. At the Nov. 3 hearing, he seemed pained that the redistricting wars had arrived in Virginia.
“This is just another symptom of how strained our democracy is becoming,” he said.
A trio of Republicans who are plaintiffs in the Tazewell case — Sen. Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin, and Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott — did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment. 
Attorney Brad Marrs, who represented the clerks, and Del. Tom Garrett, R-Buckingham, House Republicans’ point-person for the legal battles, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. 
John Lichtenstein, an attorney representing the clerks of the House and Senate in both Tazewell and Richmond cases, praised Thorne-Begland’s decision.
“We are pleased the Courts denied the attempt to interrupt that constitutional legislative process, which now has the chance to move through its proper stages,” Lichtenstein said in an email.

Kelly Ayotte’s decision to veto similar legislation earlier this year.
The House Education Policy and Administration Committee voted, 10-8, Wednesday to recommend an amended version of Senate Bill 33, which would require school boards to adopt policies allowing parent challenges to books and other materials. 
But unlike the vetoed bill, the new proposed bill does not allow parents to appeal decisions over book removals to the State Board of Education, a significant concession. 
And the newly amended bill has removed explicit mention of penalties against school districts that don’t comply; the previous bill had allowed the state attorney general, Department of Education, or any aggrieved parent to file a lawsuit against a district that violated the required policies. The new bill also does not include potential disciplinary actions against teachers deemed to violate the proposed obscenity law.
Republicans said the legislation will allow for quicker removal of content they say is obscene and pornographic. 
Democrats say the move will override school boards’ ability to set their own curricula, and could unfairly allow a small group of parents to remove books for all students. 
Under the bill, school boards would be required to install a complaint resolution process that would allow parents to raise objections to material deemed obscene. After receiving a complaint, the school principal would be required to conduct an investigation and make a determination whether the content should be removed within 15 days. 
At that point, the parent could appeal any decision to the local school board, which would make the final decision. That is a departure from House Bill 324, which allowed the State Board of Education, whose members are appointed by the Governor and Executive Council, to override school boards’ determinations over content removal.
The bill defines obscene materials as those depicting nudity, sexual content, sadomasochistic abuse, or sexual excitement, in a manner “patently offensive” to prevailing attitudes over what is appropriate to minors. To be eligible for removal, the material would also need to predominantly appeal “to the prurient, shameful, or morbid interest of minors,” lack “serious literary, scientific, medical, artistic, or political value to minors,” and be “inappropriate to the age of the minors to whom it is being made available or presented.”
Ayotte vetoed HB 324 in June, arguing that it was unnecessary because state law already allows parents to opt their own children out of instructional material they disagree with as long as they provide an agreed-upon alternative. 
The House committee’s change would address some critics’ concerns about the loss of local control in HB 324, including the New Hampshire School Boards Association. 
And by removing HB 324’s explicit language allowing civil action against schools, the new version of the bill appears to resolve an objection listed by Ayotte in her veto message of HB 324.  
But the amended version of SB 33 may not address all of the governor’s concerns. In her veto message, Ayotte wrote that because parents have an opt-out option specific to their child, “I do not believe the State of New Hampshire needs to, nor should it, engage in the role of addressing questions of literary value and appropriateness” of school materials, she wrote.
Speaking in the committee Wednesday, Democrats urged their Republican colleagues to follow the governor’s position, and said the state should not make it easier for parents to remove books from all students. 
“I completely oppose banning books in any form, and so I cannot possibly support something that suppresses free speech,” said Rep. Loren Selig, of Durham.
Republicans countered that they have presented passages from books and materials that they said should not be allowed in schools. 
“Nobody wants to look at some of the samples that we have tried to provide,” said Rep. Kristin Noble, of Bedford. “Looking at that, it is unbelievable to me that anyone could think that that material was good for minors.” 
The veto of HB 324 will be taken up by the House in Dec. 17, and will need a two-thirds majority vote in both the House and Senate to be overridden. 
SB 33, meanwhile, will come before the House on Jan. 7.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/booksbanningnh-1024x717.jpg,,,2025-11-07 17:01:24.081763

The ECO Edison will be the floating home base for offshore wind technicians at Ørsted's Northeast offshore wind farms. (Tyler Kaufman for Ørsted)President Donald Trump’s anti-wind energy agenda is harming Louisiana businesses that form the backbone of America’s offshore oil and gas industry, which stands to lose billions if the president fulfills his campaign promise to end construction of offshore wind turbines.
In recent years, offshore leases have opened in state and federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico for offshore wind farms to be built. Wind technology has advanced, allowing for taller turbines to capture more of the Gulf region’s wind power higher up in the air. A trained workforce, built off the back of oil and gas, provided a wide base of support for the industry to expand. 
On his first day back in the White House, Trump signed an executive order halting construction on all offshore wind projects. The president has long expressed a dislike of wind turbines, sometimes making dubious claims that they “destroy everything,” are the “most expensive energy there is” and that they produce noise that causes cancer.
These actions and statements have slowed supply chain investments and threatened the jobs of blue-collar workers in Louisiana and nationwide, all while electricity demand is growing, in large part because of increasing numbers of large, power-hungry data centers.

There are no offshore wind projects under construction off Louisiana’s coast, but the state is deeply entwined with developments in other parts of the country. Most of the businesses working on offshore wind farms on the East Coast come from the oil and gas sector in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Even without a single industrial-scale wind turbine generating electricity in Louisiana, offshore wind has so far spurred over $500 million worth of supply chain investments in the state, according to Oceantic, an offshore energy trade association with about 400 members worldwide. Almost all of Oceantic’s members work in both the wind and fossil fuel sectors, spokeswoman Stephanie Fracoeur said.
It’s the same across the Gulf South. The offshore wind sector has spurred roughly $14 billion in investments into U.S. supply chain and manufacturing companies, with nearly two-thirds coming from businesses in Republican congressional districts, according to Oceantic. 
But those investments have grown risky as many offshore wind projects that were planned have been paused or scrapped altogether. 
“Oil and gas hasn’t been exceptionally busy over the last decade, so offshore wind was helping keep many of these companies in business,” Francoeur said. “Unfortunately, these policy changes have put a pause on things … The federal actions have been crippling for hundreds of American businesses that were planning on this work.”
State Rep. Joe Orgeron, R-Golden Meadow, represents an area of the state that has invested and made a lot of money in the wind industry. Lafourche Parish is home to shipbuilders, metal fabricators, ocean crane operators and many other companies in the offshore energy sector. Having once built and serviced the oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, these businesses on the bayou were called on to do the same thing for offshore wind farms along the East Coast, Orgeron said.
Orgeron, a former Nicholls State University professor with a doctorate in experimental physics, once managed his family’s offshore vessel business and helped it expand into the wind sector. Like other companies, they didn’t abandon oil and gas; they expanded into wind energy because it offered a stable revenue stream to offset volatile fossil fuel commodity prices, he said. While an abundant oil supply and low fuel costs are good for consumers, Louisiana’s energy service sector hits the doldrums when profit margins lead exploration companies to press pause on their Gulf drilling plans.
“For 60 years, we went through economic booms and busts, and it’s just so nice to know there’s an alternative market where your identical expertise is required and appreciated,” Orgeron said. “I really don’t wanna see one of our down-the-bayou operators lose an alternative revenue stream that’s not tied to the price of oil.”
A handful of offshore wind projects are still in progress on the East Coast, where dozens of Louisiana oil-and-gas service companies are now working. 
Jake Cheramie is the general manager of Encore Group, a company in Houma that provides cooks, cleaners, crane operators and other personnel to offshore work sites. Just a few years ago, all of Encore’s clientele were in the oil and gas sector, but Cheramie said Encore gravitated to East Coast wind energy development in 2021. It now encompasses roughly 20% of their business, he said. 
“Most of the major vessels in lower Lafourche are up in the Northeast working now, and that’s cool to see,” Cheramie said. “It’s been good to us. I certainly don’t wanna see offshore wind go away.” 
Oceantic categorizes Encore as one of many auxiliary services businesses that work for one of Louisiana’s 42 offshore energy companies that currently hold active wind contracts.
Much of the work has gone to shipyards that build vessels that specialize in offshore construction. For instance, Edison Chouest Offshore in Cut Off spearheaded construction of the $97 million Eco Edison vessel for Revolution Wind, a wind farm project off the Rhode Island coast, and other East Coast projects. That single contract, one among several others like it, employed nearly 600 Edison Chouest workers across multiple states. 
About a year ago, Encore opened an office in Rhode Island to support its personnel working on the Revolution Wind project. That wind farm made headlines Aug. 22 when the Trump administration rescinded its federal permit and issued a stop-work order, citing vague national security concerns. Scheduled to come online in early 2026, the $5 billion project was about 80% complete at that time.
Revolution Wind sued the Trump administration, and a federal judge sided with the company a month later, ruling the government’s actions “arbitrary and capricious” and unsupported by any evidence of national security concerns. 
The judge’s temporary injunction allowed the company to resume work for the time being, but the order is temporary and could change if the Trump administration succeeds on appeal. The setback  has already cost Revolution Wind $77 million, according to company officials who also blamed Trump’s anti-wind policies and tariffs for increasing the cost of steel and other construction materials.
It’s a new reality that Encore and other businesses are having to grapple with. The part of their business model that was the most stable just a year ago has suddenly become shaky. 
“Louisiana is going to be one of the hardest-hit areas,” Francoeur said. “Once the current projects are completed, some of those companies will have idle shipyards or idle vessels.”

Cheramie said Encore is working on other offshore wind projects in New Jersey and Virginia but worries about losing them if the Trump administration continues to target the industry. If things stay on track, Encore should have steady work for another two to three years, he said, admitting new contracts for future jobs are now hard to come by. 
“There’s been quite a few projects that aren’t being permitted or may be canceled,” Cheramie said. 
The pause is largely due to Trump’s executive orders, pausing all wind leases and permitting. He has followed those up with actions that have made business particularly difficult for wind and solar companies, including directing his Commerce Department to investigate the wind sector for any national security implications and directing his Interior Department to block the nation’s largest solar project, which was planned for federal land in Nevada.  
“Things are likely not to move forward in the next couple of years because of the actions by the Trump administration to essentially put a pause on federal permitting for offshore projects,” said Madelyn Smith with the renewable energy industry group Southeastern Wind Coalition. 
One example is RWE Wind, a German company that held the first federal wind lease off the coast of Louisiana in addition to leases on the East and West coasts. It scrapped all three projects this year and laid off 73 of its U.S. employees after Trump started his assault on the wind sector, according to a Reuters report. The company said it is focusing on onshore wind and solar for the time being while still holding onto its offshore leases.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Many Louisiana-based offshore energy businesses with wind interests refused to speak on the record for this report. The same was true for some trade groups, including the National Ocean Industries Association, which represents members in the offshore wind and fossil fuels sectors. 
Orgeron said he has noticed the same pattern among some of his constituents who prefer to not say or do anything that draws attention from the White House.
“I have friends who know they’re in the crosshairs of the Trump administration,” he said. “They’re kinda in a holding pattern.”
There is one active lease in Louisiana state waters for a wind farm, according to the state Department of Energy and Conservation. The Cajun Wind project is proposed by the North American arm of Vestas, a Denmark-based renewable energy company. It’s planned off the coast of Cameron Parish and would generate enough electricity to power 144,000 Louisiana homes at peak output, according to the project’s webpage. It’s unclear when or if Vestas plans to start construction. The company didn’t respond to a request for comment. 
Diamond Offshore Wind, backed by the Mitsubishi Corp., initially planned to build a wind farm in Louisiana waters. It abandoned its lease at the beginning of 2025 but terminated its operating agreement in March. 
Offshore wind farms are “enormous infrastructure projects,” Smith said. Such projects can take eight to 13 years and millions of dollars to build. Any permitting delay, political uncertainty or disruption in supply can be significant enough to chase off investors, she added. 
“It has definitely given some developers pause that there have been so many changes,” she said “They are going to be looking for more stability and clarity in the federal regulatory landscape in order to move forward.”
Simon Mahan, executive director of the Southern Renewable Energy Association, said he doesn’t expect much expansion in offshore wind over the next few years unless the Trump administration’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which has paused offshore wind leases, reverses its current stance. 
That could be detrimental for other industries that need new sources of energy to operate, such as artificial intelligence. The AI sector has been building data centers across the country that require massive amounts of power to operate, such as Meta’s proposed facility in North Louisiana. Data centers will need an estimated 22% more electricity by the end of this year and nearly three times as much in 2030, according to a report by S&P Global.  
“We are facing a pretty severe energy crunch, not just in Louisiana, but nationally,” Mahan said. “Any sort of delay that we’re seeing, that is only going to hamper our energy dominance agenda.”
For the time being, many of those in Louisiana’s offshore energy sector are counting the days until the next presidential election, Orgeron said. 
“Everybody’s just waiting it out until Trump leaves office,” he said. “I just hope that the president I voted for doesn’t, because of his little idiosyncrasies, destroy it completely.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-07 21:25:06+00:00,CT Mirror,Lamont pledges to restart SNAP benefits in days – even if CT pays,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/07/ct-snap-benefits/,"SNAP benefits will be available in next few days with CT funds, possibly by Saturday, but the USDA also plans to restart payments soon.","Thousands of Connecticut households will see their SNAP benefits restored within the next few days, possibly as early as Saturday, Gov. Ned Lamont’s office announced Friday.
The governor, who has been reluctant to spend state funds on the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also pledged to keep the program running for the next three weeks, even if federal funding stalls again during that period.
The governor addressed reporters following an 11:30 a.m. press conference in East Hartford on housing issues and said that he’s directed the state Department of Social Services, which administers the nutrition assistance program, “to fully fund SNAP through the end of November.”
“Stop dragging it out,” a frustrated Lamont said Friday, referring to President Donald Trump’s administration and its freeze of SNAP benefits since the partial federal government shutdown entered its second month on Nov. 1. 
“They’ve been on again, off again, on again, off again, on, snapping it in partial payment, a full payment. I just authorized our department. We’re going to fully fund SNAP through the end of November. We’ll see what happens from there.”
It was unclear later Friday afternoon, though, how much state funding, if any, would be needed to cover the $72 million in SNAP benefits normally distributed here each month.
About 90 minutes after Lamont committed Connecticut funds, if needed, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service notified states it would begin the process of again funding benefits with federal dollars.
“Later today, FNS will complete the processes necessary to make funds available to support your subsequent transmission of full” benefits, it wrote in a memorandum.
But that memo is just part of a confusing stream of often contradictory signals from the Trump administration over the past week when it comes to funding nutrition assistance.
FNS told a federal district judge on Monday it would comply with a court order and utilize SNAP contingency funds. These would be sufficient to fund partial benefits for one month.
Then the Trump administration indicated it would pay full benefits, which would exhaust the contingency sooner, at some point in the future — while simultaneously challenging the district court ruling in a federal appeals court.
A decision on that appeal was expected late Friday afternoon. But even if the Trump administration loses there, it could appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Lamont spokesman Rob Blanchard said the governor is committed to restarting full SNAP benefits in Connecticut and keeping them in place at least through the end of November, regardless of whether the Trump administration follows through the federal funding.
“Ensuring that those who count on SNAP will receive their full benefits was a priority for the governor, and he was growing impatient by the lack of action by the federal government,” Blanchard said.
Lamont has been criticized over the past two weeks both by his fellow Democrats in the General Assembly’s majority and by Republicans who said he did too little to safeguard the roughly 360,000 Connecticut residents who normally receive SNAP benefits.
The governor did contribute $3 million from state funds to Connecticut Foodshare, a nonprofit that distributes surplus groceries from the food industry to pantries, meal programs and other related services across the state. But Foodshare’s president and CEO, Jason Jakubowski, said on Connecticut Public Radio this week that the state’s network of food pantries is equipped to cover roughly one-eighth of the need created by the suspension of SNAP benefits.
The average Connecticut household receives an average of $324 per month from SNAP, according to social services officials.
The General Assembly will meet in special session next week to reserve $500 million from last fiscal year’s $2.5 billion state budget surplus to bolster SNAP and other federal human service programs facing funding restrictions related to the ongoing government shutdown.
And some state legislators were frustrated to hear that measure would not mandate the use of state funds to bolster these programs — rather, it only would reserve them and leave the decision whether to spend them up to Lamont.
The governor, a fiscal moderate, has traditionally objected to using state funds to supplement programs normally funded by the federal government.
But Lamont won praise Friday for committing state funds to combat hunger, especially given the uncertainty of federal funding.
“I think its welcome [news] for the residents of the state, for my neighbors, who have been without food for a week in some cases,” said state Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, co-chairman of the Human Services Committee and one of the lawmakers who argued Lamont’s original response to the crisis was too modest.
“It’s a very good sign and unfortunately very necessary because of the volatility of the responses from the Trump administration,” said Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven.
“Relief for vulnerable Connecticut families is what matters most,” said Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding. “We must prioritize people, not politics.”
CT For All, a progressive coalition of more than 60 faith, labor and other civic groups, often has charged Lamont with refusing to tap Connecticut’s great wealth to better fund human services, education, health care and other core programs.
Besides the $500 million left from last fiscal year’s surplus, Connecticut has $4.3 billion in its rainy day fund, one of the larger emergency reserves of any state. Analysts also are projecting another big surplus, almost $1.8 billion, this fiscal year.
CT For All’s director, Norma Martinez HoSang, said Friday that “Gov. Lamont is finally listening to the thousands of phone calls, emails, and visits to his office. And while we applaud the decision to fund SNAP for 30 days, the 7 extra days it took the Governor to come to this decision represented a week of unnecessary anxiety to CT families. “",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/LAMONT-WIND-0825-CANNON-113-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-07 17:01:24.081763

UCHCFC Waterbury Hospital Corp., a corporation sponsored by UConn Health, will serve as the “stalking horse bidder” for the hospital in the court-supervised sale auction, according to court documents filed Friday morning. The “stalking horse” serves as the first bidder in a bankruptcy auction whose offer serves as the minimum bid. 
“We are pleased to have reached this important milestone in our sale process through a stalking horse agreement with UCHCFC Waterbury Health Corp., a Connecticut nonprofit sponsored by UConn Health. We look forward to completing the process efficiently and to the future partnership ahead,” Deborah Weymouth, CEO of Waterbury Health, stated in emailed comments.
The $13 million cash offer includes $4 million for the operating assets and $9 million for the real estate. The state will also assume a limited set of the hospital’s liabilities, bringing the deal’s total value up to $35 million, according to the terms laid out in court documents.
Other bidders can submit offers through November 14. A sale hearing, where the bankruptcy court judge will approve the sale, is scheduled for November 17. 
During a press conference on Friday, Gov. Ned Lamont highlighted the effort it took to find a buyer for the struggling hospital.
“We had to work really hard after what Prospect did to that hospital. We’ve got a strong bidder,” Lamont said. “I want people to know Waterbury Hospital is going to thrive under new leadership.”
In a series of unannounced visits over the last two years, state health inspectors found deteriorating conditions at Waterbury Hospital, including a nurse staffing crisis, rusting equipment in operating rooms and alleged patient abuse.
The purchase of Waterbury Hospital by the state is part of a broader plan to expand the footprint of UConn Health and make it more competitive with other academic medical institutions around the country. The state is also in talks to acquire two more private, independent hospitals that are also struggling: Bristol Hospital and Day Kimball Hospital in Putnam.
Prospect originally paid $31.8 million to acquire Waterbury Hospital in 2016. While the state is purchasing Waterbury for less than half of what it was worth almost a decade ago, the facility will require deep investments to address significant quality issues, State Comptroller Sean Scanlon told The Connecticut Mirror last month.
“There are significant capital expenditure needs to maintain what I would say is the level of public health care that our citizens deserve and expect. And, frankly, that’s not possible in the condition that this hospital is in right now,” Scanlon said.
During a special session of the state legislature, scheduled for next week, lawmakers will vote to approve a bonding package to fund capital improvements at Waterbury, Bristol and Day Kimball Hospitals.
If approved by the legislature, the state could borrow as much as $390 million to invest in the hospitals over a five-year period, according to a presentation during an Oct. 3 meeting of the University of Connecticut’s Board of Trustees and the UConn Health Board of Directors. The debt would be added to the “UConn 2000” bonding package, the state’s financing program for capital projects at its flagship university. 
UConn Health will also separately invest $31 million in the hospitals over five years, CEO Andrew Agwunobi said.
The funding will cover the purchase of Waterbury Hospital, but the acquisition of Bristol and Day Kimball Hospitals will be handled separately, according to the state comptroller.
Some level of forgiveness for the taxes Prospect owes the state will also be a part of the deal. However, those negotiations are happening separately and not explicitly included in the bid submitted on Friday.
“The tax negotiations are ongoing. We’ll have more to share in the coming days,” Comptroller Scanlon said on Friday. 
Court records show that Prospect owes the state $127 million in hospital provider taxes going back more than three years.
Once approved by the judge, any acquisition would have to go through the state’s approval process, overseen by the Office of Health Strategy, known as Certificate of Need. The state would have to approve the deal within 60 days of receiving a completed application, according to the guidelines of the emergency approval process reserved for hospitals that are involved in bankruptcy proceedings. 
Waterbury was the last of the Prospect’s three Connecticut hospitals that needed a buyer. 
Last month, the bankruptcy court judge approved the sale of the other two Prospect-owned facilities — Manchester Memorial and Rockville General — to Hartford HealthCare for $86.1 million. HHC submitted the sole bid. The transaction is currently under review by the state’s Office of Health Strategy.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023_0927_SR_WaterburyHospital_027-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-07 17:01:24.081763

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)The state of South Dakota opened its $20 million, 400-acre shooting range complex Friday.
Members of the state Game, Fish and Parks Commission and other dignitaries were on hand for a grand opening ceremony.
“On behalf of the commission, we are excited for what the Pete Lien and Sons Shooting Sports Complex will mean for South Dakota’s outdoor future,” Commission Chairwoman Stephanie Rissler told South Dakota Searchlight in advance of the event. 
The complex, located about 10 miles north of Rapid City, is one of the largest public shooting ranges in the nation. It includes rifle, pistol, shotgun and archery ranges, and will host recreational shooters, safety programs, marksmanship competitions and law enforcement training. 


 The location of the Pete Lien and Sons Shooting Sports Complex.
The complex is open seven days a week from 8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. May through August, and from 8:30 a.m. to sunset September through April. 
The facility’s 50-, 100- and 300-yard shooting bays and archery range are free to use on a first-come, first-served basis. Memberships are required for the long-range bay, shotgun area, sporting clays course and north range. An individual membership is $100, a family membership is $150 and a day pass is $20. 
Rissler said the facility gives new and experienced shooters a place to learn and practice in a safe environment. 
“This complex will serve outdoor enthusiasts today and for generations to come,” she said. “A big thank you to all the partners and sponsors who helped make this vision a reality and continue to showcase the incredible outdoor opportunities South Dakota has to offer.”
The project did not have a smooth path. Lawmakers refused to appropriate state money for it, and some were angered last year when they learned that then-Gov. Kristi Noem gave the project $13.5 million from the governor-controlled Future Fund.

South Dakota employers pay a fee to the Future Fund when they submit payroll taxes to the unemployment benefits program. State law says the Future Fund must be used “for purposes related to research and economic development for the state.” Unlike other funds administered by the Governor’s Office of Economic Development, Future Fund expenses don’t go through a board of citizen appointees for vetting or approval.
An additional $6.6 million of funding for the shooting range complex has been given or pledged by a total of 58 donors. The Department of Game, Fish and Parks said this week that $3.4 million of the donations are in hand, and $3.2 million are pledged. 
The donations include about $2 million from gun-industry companies or organizations, including Smith & Wesson, a Tennessee-based gun manufacturer, and Glock, an Austrian gun manufacturer.
Pete Lien and Sons Inc., a mining, concrete and construction aggregate company based in Rapid City, obtained naming rights for the facility with an $800,000 donation and an additional $1.2 million pledge, to be paid within three years.

Wilmington, Del. — Small businesses are the backbone of Delaware’s economy — employing over half of all working Delawareans, serving as community anchors, and driving innovation across industries. On November 6, that spirit was celebrated as more than 500 business and civic leaders gathered for the 27th Annual Marvin S. Gilman Superstars in Business Awards Luncheon, hosted by the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce’s Small Business Alliance.
The Small Business Alliance of Delaware State Chamber of Commerce Presents the 27th Annual Superstars in Business Awards
Michael Quaranta, President of the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce, shared why this event is so important to the Chamber and the State of Delaware as a whole:
“The Superstars in Business Awards remind us that small businesses are the backbone of not just the US economy, but of Delaware’s, too. Small business owners don’t always have the time or resources to make their voices heard. Being that voice is one of the pillars of what we do at the Delaware State Chamber. This event is really about celebrating that community by highlighting some of the best, and that’s why it’s so popular and so important to our mission and community.”
This year’s keynote speaker, Robert L. Siegfried Jr., CPA, CEO & Founder of The Siegfried Group, spoke to the importance of personal growth, character-based leadership, and making space for entrepreneurial thinking.
“I’ve got to keep challenging myself and keep asking myself the question of how I get better. Better questions lead to better thinking. Better thinking leads to better actions. It leads to success. This character thing, I realized, it’s not just going to elevate your company, it will elevate your life.”
Siegfried encouraged leaders to embrace reflection as part of their decision making:
“You’ve got to find the time to be thoughtful. So, it’s like, hey, what advice do you have for people? What I wanted to talk about today is find quiet time, spacious time, rhythmic time to be more thoughtful about the why in your life. And listen to your gut feel. Listen to your head and your heart about what you should be doing. And then answer these questions about it: What, why, how, when, how often, and with whom should I best be doing this?”
A Celebration of Small Business Excellence
This year’s honorees represent diverse industries — finance, real estate development, home services, and nonprofit community development — but share a common purpose: creating a stronger Delaware.
Below are the 2025 award recipients:

 **Grey Fox Wealth Advisors** — Winner, 1–24 employees category
 **Jack Lingo Asset Management (JLAM)** — Winner, 25–150 employees category
 **Boulden Brothers** — Award of Excellence recipient
 **Habitat for Humanity of New Castle County** — Nonprofit Award winner

Each organization demonstrated impressive leadership, growth strategy, and community commitment through its applications and interviews.
Grey Fox Wealth Advisors: A Mission Rooted in Trust
Founded with the goal of bringing personal, relationship-driven financial guidance to Delaware families and businesses, Grey Fox Wealth Advisors has experienced rapid growth in both clients served and community visibility. The team emphasizes education and transparency — qualities that led them to top honors in the small employer category.
Co-Founder and Partner Ted Lauzen said the recognition represents a milestone in a long-term mission:
“This award acts as an inspiration to the future. Our team is excited to earn the opportunity to serve more friends, more families and more communities in our great state.”
Their growing involvement in nonprofit partnerships and community events helped distinguish their nomination as a business dedicated to lifting others with them.
Jack Lingo Asset Management: Development with Staying Power
As a full-service real estate investment and development firm, JLAM focuses on projects that support economic growth while enriching the fabric of Delaware’s communities — from multifamily and mixed-use developments to commercial assets that bring new opportunity to the region.
Managing Principal and Co-Founder Doug Motley described the meaning behind the achievement:
“One thing about the business that we’re in is that what we’re creating is enduring. This is going to be a part of the community for the long term. So winning this award and being able to put our stamp on it is really satisfying.”
JLAM’s team was praised for leveraging industry expertise to create lasting impact across Sussex County and beyond.
Boulden Brothers: A Family Legacy of Service
Boulden Brothers, a beloved home services company providing plumbing, HVAC, and electrical solutions, is no stranger to the Superstars in Business spotlight — having previously won 18 years ago. Their ability to evolve with changing technology and customer expectations while maintaining a people-first culture made them a standout Award of Excellence recipient this year.
President Tim Boulden credited the company’s continued success to its team:
“There’s been a lot of changes in the world, in the business industry since we won 18 years ago. What I will tell you, what hasn’t changed is you can’t do this alone. It’s the reason why we continue to be successful and it’s because we have a very talented dedicated team that always puts our clients first. If you put your team first, and they put the clients first, you’re going to be successful.”
Habitat for Humanity of New Castle County: Building More Than Homes
Habitat for Humanity of New Castle County has built more than 300 homes in partnership with local families and transformed entire neighborhoods through community investment. In addition to construction initiatives, Habitat programs provide financial education, home repair assistance, and youth engagement — expanding their mission beyond housing access to long-term empowerment.
CEO Kevin L. Smith said the Chamber’s recognition reinforces the leadership role nonprofits play in the economic ecosystem:
“I think most people recognize us as a home builder. It’s a great honor to see that the chamber recognizes non-profits as businesses, as entrepreneur, as leaders in our communities.”
A Program That Continues to Inspire
The Superstars in Business Awards has become one of the Delaware business community’s most anticipated annual events — not just for the celebration itself, but for the inspiration it sparks.
This year’s winners exemplify what’s possible when organizations — large or small, for-profit or nonprofit — pursue innovation while investing in the people and places they serve.
As the program moves toward its 30th anniversary, the Small Business Alliance continues to champion the entrepreneurs who drive Delaware forward — with determination, creativity, and deep community roots.
And if the success stories recognized this year are any indication, the First State’s future remains bright — powered by those who are willing to lead, build, and believe in what comes next.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0975.jpg,,,2025-11-07 16:17:10.371060

The Montgomery Police Department said in a statement posted to Facebook Friday that Ivan Floyd, 22, was charged with certain persons forbidden to carry a firearm. He was taken to the Montgomery County Detention Facility, according to the statement.
Floyd was also charged with robbery in the first degree, theft of property in the first degree, and theft of property in the second degree, which happened on Sept. 29, according to the statement. Police said those crimes were not connected to the shooting. 
“MPD extends its gratitude to local and federal law enforcement partners for their continued support and collaboration, which have been instrumental in advancing the case,” the statement said.
The shooting, which took place during celebrations after a football game, killed Jeremiah Morris, 17, and Shalanda Williams, 43. 
Four others were arrested last month. Kemontae Hood, 21, an unnamed juvenile and Dantavious McGhee, 19, were charged with one count of capital murder, nine counts of first-degree assault and three counts of second-degree assault. Javorick Whiting, 19, was charged last week with one count of attempted murder. Whiting was later released on bond, which sparked criticism from city leaders.
The shooting sparked a war of words between state Republican leaders and city officials, who tend to be Democratic.

Norton I State House News Service and Sam Drysdale | State House News Service,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/marijuana/social-pot-consumption-vote-could-come-by-christmas/,"Chair Shannon O'Brien offered the latest timeline at the end of a meeting on Friday, as commissioners also learned that a new member, Carrie Benedon, is joining the commission.","THE CANNABIS CONTROL COMMISSION could vote by Christmas on regulations governing social consumption sites.
CCC Chair Shannon O’Brien offered the latest timeline at the end of a meeting on Friday, as commissioners also learned that a new member, Carrie Benedon, is joining the commission.
Commissioners in late July outlined three social consumption license types: one for existing marijuana establishments like retail stores and cultivation facilities that want to offer their customers the ability to consume products purchased on-site, a “hospitality” license category that would allow for on-site consumption at new or existing non-cannabis businesses like yoga studios or theaters, and an “event organizer” license category that would allow for temporary on-site consumption at events like rallies and festivals. 
Social consumption sites were envisioned under the 2016 marijuana voter law but have yet to launch. 
Benedon works in Attorney General Andrea Campbell’s office as director of the Division of Open Government. She previously worked as an assistant attorney general in the Constitutional and Administrative Law Division. Prior to the creation of the CCC, she “successfully represented the Department of Public Health in several cases challenging its medical marijuana registration and licensing authority,” Campbell’s office said.
Under state law, the three statewide officials appoint two of the five CCC commissioners by majority vote, and Benedon was selected to fill a seat designated for someone with “legal, policy, or social justice issues related to a regulated industry.” Benedon will fill the seat left vacated by Nurys Camargo. 
A possible vote on the social consumption sites was on the agenda for Friday’s meeting, but Commissioner Bruce Stebbins told reporters after the meeting that Benedon’s start date delayed the timeline. Earlier this year in September, O’Brien’s return to the CCC pushed back the finalization of the long-awaited rules.
“We want to give her the opportunity to get caught up to speed on the [social consumption] regulations and be part of the conversation, so that will obviously shift our timeline,” Stebbins said of Benedon on Friday.
He also suggested additional meetings could be scheduled before the end of the year. The next commission meeting is scheduled for Nov. 18.
“[I] really hope that we can get this done by Christmas,” he said. He added that the commission is now focused on fine details: “What you see us doing is getting down into some real granular questions…as much clarity as we can offer on those helps our licensees at the end of the day.”
Asked what people should make of the delays, Stebbins said he “completely understands” why O’Brien pushed back the finalization in September and why they are now waiting for Benedon to get up to speed.
“We want their input. We want their voice. We want to hear their concerns, because we are rolling this out on behalf of the entire commission, and we want to make sure everybody feels comfortable with the regulatory framework,” he said.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Another independent candidate has entered the race for Maine’s next governor. 
Derek Levasseur, who describes himself as a small business leader and published a memoir earlier this year about overcoming adversity, announced his plans to run for governor as an independent in a Facebook post Thursday. He filed paperwork with the Maine Ethics Commission the same day listing a Benton address. 
Levasseur said his focus is lowering the cost of living and reforming the state Department of Health and Human Services to increase accountability. He proposes eliminating property taxes on people’s primary homes and increasing government transparency. 
Levasseur, who doesn’t have a storied political career, said Maine needs leaders with lived experience. 
“I’m not a career politician,” he said, in his campaign announcement. “I’ve lived through real struggles. I’ve built businesses, worked with families, and faced life’s hardest moments head-on. That’s why I’m running — because I understand what Mainers are going through, and I’m ready to fight for them.”
Though he’s running as an independent and said “uniting Maine across party lines” is part of his platform, Levasseur challenged U.S. Sen. Susan Collins in 2019 as a Republican. At the time, he criticized Collins for not supporting President Donald Trump enough, according to the Portland Press Herald.
In his campaign announcement, Levasseur also addressed previous charges of domestic violence, including one in 2012 when he was a reserve police officer for the town of Clinton. He was also acquitted in 2021 on separate charges of domestic violence from 2019, according to news reports.
“Like many Mainers, I’ve faced challenges that tested everything I believed in,” Levasseur said. “I was accused of something I didn’t do, and I was found not guilty — but the experience forever changed me. It taught me humility, compassion, and the importance of fighting for truth, even when the odds are against you.”
He went on to say that his experiences in life inspired him to write a memoir about overcoming adversity and finding strength through faith. It’s titled “Derecho: Scars on the Soul.”
Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, is termed out, leaving an open race for her seat. Levasseur joins a crowded field with nearly two dozen candidates, including four other independents.

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)LAFAYETTE – After firing dozens and imposing sweeping cuts, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette has cleared all but roughly $2 million of a $25 million recurring deficit, according to the university’s interim president. But officials still must extinguish an accumulated debt of at least $10 million from prior years.
Earlier this month, 51 people were terminated and 19 others were reassigned, the largest loss of personnel since the deficit came to light. In an interview with The Current, interim President Jaimie Hebert said officials have made a lot of progress in shoring up the university’s finances but left the door open for more cuts or layoffs.
“We haven’t determined that yet, but we said all along [that] we want to minimize the human impact if at all possible. If we can do this without losing another person, we will,” Hebert said.
UL launched a new site this week, documenting ongoing budget moves. It includes a feedback form for faculty and is billed as a “living resource.” In a message announcing the page, Hebert said 120 feedback forms had been submitted so far.
Departments across the campus were mandated to slice 10% from their budgets, except Academic Affairs, which is being cut by 5% to limit the impact on instruction.
Budget cuts to date have trimmed all but $2 million from the $25 million figure Hebert has described as a “structural deficit” — essentially recurring expenses that have outgrown revenues. But he clarified that the full target has been $35 million: The structural deficit plus $10 million of debt carried over.

News of the financial straits came after UL’s longtime CFO Jerry Luke LeBlanc stepped down in May, followed by the early retirement of President Joseph Savoie in July. Savoie assumed the role of president emeritus and will join the faculty next year after a seven-month sabbatical.
In June, UL delayed paying $15 million into the university’s retirement system to the following month, punting the cost into the next fiscal year. Hebert said the delay did not reflect a delinquency on the payment. “[The payment] was never in arrears,” he told The Current.
And while Hebert has thus far declined to publicly recriminate how UL’s finances deteriorated, the former provost acknowledged austerity was in the university’s future.
In town halls and media appearances, he has pointed at rising costs over the last decade, coupled with a decline in full-time enrollment, as major factors in the crisis. Meanwhile, UL added 267 new positions since 2015 to its payroll, he said, clarifying a report disclosed to The Current earlier this month tabulating 467 net positions. That figure included replacement hires.
Still, the added manpower grew UL’s annual personnel costs by $40 million, he noted. UL’s payroll is about $10 million a month.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
At least some of those positions were in research. But UL’s pursuit and maintenance of the R1 research designation was not a key factor in the crunch, Hebert said. “Can I point to R1 as one of the causes of this? No,” he said.
With more debt to clear up, Hebert nonetheless insisted UL has come a long way in closing the budget gap.
“I’m not trying to make light of this,” the interim president said of the structural deficit. “It was a significant issue. But the fact that, in three months time, we’ve been able to address a huge portion of a $25 million deficit tells you that it was not insurmountable.”
Hebert deferred some questions to CFO Edwin Litolff, the “numbers man” spearheading cuts and adjustments, a role he has also played recently at UNO. Litolff, who also previously served as vice president of finance at Grambling State University, has not had a public-facing role.
It remains unclear to what extent the ongoing deficit in the athletics division, for instance, is squeezing overall finances. Some of the terminations in the October cuts were in the athletics department. (The Current is awaiting confirmation of the number of athletics staff reductions from the university.)
UL football has accounted for the overwhelming bulk of the athletic division’s $50 million deficit over the last decade. In the last year alone, football lost more than $10 million, according to UL system financial reports.
“We froze 24 [athletic] positions coming into this fiscal year, and while those don’t contribute directly to savings this year, it removed 24 positions from their overall budget,” Hebert told The Current. He said nearly $4.5 million has been eliminated from the athletics budget, which had about $46 million in expenses in the fiscal year ending June 2024. “So the impact is hitting athletics as well.”


Let us know what you think...


 

Hebert is a numbers man himself, with bachelor’s, master’s and doctorate degrees in statistics — all from UL Lafayette. He joined UL as provost and vice president of Academic Affairs in 2018, the top spot over instruction and faculty, after previously serving as president of Georgia Southern University, and before that as the Sam Houston State University provost and vice president of academic affairs.
Hebert told The Current he has not decided whether he will seek the permanent president’s post: “I’ve not given any thought to it, honestly. At this point, I’m focused on the problem that’s at hand. I really am.”
Hebert also had no information on the status of the search. “That’s run by the system,” he said.
More than three months have passed since Savoie left his post, yet there is still no plan in place for the search, The Acadiana Advocate reported in October. “There are no next steps, nor is there a finalized timeline for finding a permanent leader for the school,” the newspaper reported, citing comments from a system official. The system oversees nine universities.
While signalling that UL is not yet out of the woods, Hebert sought to quiet anxieties about the university’s long-term health, reiterating his commitment to protecting academics.
“We’ve worked our fingers to the bone for the past three months. We’ve looked at all of the data. We’re uncovering everything we have,” he said. “We’re trying, trying our darndest to keep the student experience whole and wholesome at the front end. I feel like for the most part, we have done that.”

Jerry Moran of Kansas walk to a Senate Republican meeting Oct. 8, 2025, at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. Moran says a proposal from President Donald Trump to change Senate rules to eliminate the filibuster can backfire if Republicans lose majority control of the chamber to Democrats. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)TOPEKA — U.S. Sens. Jerry Moran and Roger Marshall of Kansas reiterated opposition to altering Senate procedure so President Donald Trump’s agenda could advance with simple majority votes rather than meet a 60-vote threshold.
Marshall and Moran, both Republicans, expressed concern such a change in Senate legislative rules regarding the filibuster could backfire if Democrats in the future had a partisan majority in the Senate.
Moran said he had rejected an idea broached in 2022 by U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, for ditching the filibuster barrier to gain traction for voting rights legislation.
“When Sen. Schumer proposed eliminating the filibuster, I opposed that idea, and my views on the importance of the filibuster have not changed,” Moran said. “The filibuster provides senators, even when in the minority, the ability to stop bad policies and forces us to find common ground to better serve our constituents.”
On Wednesday, Trump invited Senate Republicans to the White House to lobby for a rule change so the existing 60-vote requirement could be bypassed. The idea has been referred to legislatively as the “nuclear option.”
The GOP holds 53 seats in the Senate, while Democrats have 45 and the support of two Senate independents. Republicans need backing of seven non-GOP members to proceed with legislation, including budget measures tied to the federal government shutdown.
The U.S. House hasn’t been in session since Sept. 19. The U.S. Senate remains in Washington, D.C., but hasn’t reached consensus on a short-term funding extension allowing the government to operate normally.
Marshall told the NewsNation outlet there was no doubt ending the filibuster would help Trump’s agenda reach the finish line.
“If I had to vote today, I would vote no,” Marshall said. “I would vote to keep the filibuster in place, but I’m reserving the nuclear option. We do need to open the government. There needs to be a day and time when the Democrats quit holding these Obamacare Biden funds hostage and set America free.”
He was referencing demands by Senate Democrats for extension of soon-to-expire Affordable Care Act subsidies designed to control consumer health care costs.
“The Democrats very clearly feel the longer they keep the government shut down, the better they’re going to do next November,” Marshall said. “So, like we’ve always said, this is a political shutdown, and that’s why it’s so hard to solve. They’re using this as leverage.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2239994726.jpg,,,2025-11-07 16:04:21.091063

The new round of funding is the most substantial FEMA aid North Carolina has received since the beginning of the government shutdown. It includes $54 million for the NC Department of Transportation to continue rebuilding roads and bridges.
Another total $40 million will go to two utilities — French Broad Electric Company and Rutherford Electric Membership Corporation — to make repairs and prepare emergency protective measures.
And an array of counties and local municipalities are also seeing grant money:

$14.8 million to Henderson County for debris removal.
$9.6 million to Buncombe County for debris removal, emergency protective measures and road repairs.
$3.3 million to the village of Sugar Mountain to repair recreational facilities.
$1.6 million to the town of Boone for road repairs.
$1.4 million for repair work at Paddy’s Creek Beach and Catawba Beach.
$1.3 million to the Buncombe County school board to repair two schools.

State officials continue to wait on other key avenues of federal funding for Helene recovery.

Democrat Mark Mullet and Republican J.T. Wilcox each exited the Legislature at the end of their term in January. Both found success Tuesday in bids for nonpartisan posts.
Mullet spent Wednesday morning picking up campaign signs in Issaquah, where voters elected him to be the city’s next mayor.
The ex-state senator and 2024 gubernatorial candidate said he’s looking forward to reengaging in “public service that solves problems” minus the partisan bickering of the legislative process. 
“My focus will be on making sure state policies don’t have a negative impact on the local level,” said Mullet, who served on the Issaquah City Council before winning his Senate seat in 2012.
Mullet fell well short in his bid for governor, losing the primary to a fellow Democrat, Bob Ferguson, who is now governor. Ferguson endorsed Mullet for mayor.
Tuesday won’t serve as a springboard back into any state office, Mullet insisted.

“This is setting me up to hopefully be a really good mayor of Issaquah,” he said. 
In Pierce County, Wilcox, who led the House Republican Caucus for five years, won a seat on the nonpartisan Port of Tacoma Commission.
He said he was somewhat surprised because he is known as a Republican, and his opponent, Cyrus Donato, is recognized as a Democrat. 
“It didn’t seem like a very good year to be a Republican” on the ballot, he said. 
He was alluding to how the unpopular policies of President Donald Trump hurt GOP candidates in western Washington in Tuesday’s contests.
Wilcox won his House seat in 2010 and served seven terms in the 2nd Legislative District that encompasses parts of Thurston and Pierce counties. He served as House minority leader from 2018 to 2023.
He said the part-time commission post will allow him to serve the public, work on salmon recovery and strengthen the port’s relationship with local governments and tribes, as well as state and federal agencies. And to do the work collaboratively, not confrontationally, he said.
“This is an important part of the economy. It doesn’t deserve to be ruled by activism or ideology,” Wilcox said.
Also Tuesday, two Republican state lawmakers were re-elected to local positions.
Rep. Sam Low of Lake Stevens won a third term on the Snohomish County Council. It will be his last due to term limits.
He led Democrat Kelli Johnson by a margin of 54.2% to 45.7% on Thursday. His performance stood out as a rarity on Tuesday: a Republican getting above 50% against a Democrat. for a partisan office.
“I have a good, strong track record of working in a bipartisan way,” he said Wednesday, shortly before attending a council meeting where he would be voting on a 2026 county budget.

Crews have already begun work on the second assembly facility that mimics the complex’s existing final production line.
Dignitaries, including Gov. Henry McMaster, members of South Carolina’s congressional delegation and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, were on hand Friday to officially celebrate the much-needed buildout as global demand for the 787 takes flight.
“This expansion enables us to go to (production) rates that we only dreamed of in the past,” said Lisa Fahl, engineering vice president for the 787. “It’s huge. We’re doubling the size of the flight line. We’re doubling the size of the factory. We could one day have four production lines running concurrently.”
The company headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, also announced it is doubling the number of jobs associated with the expansion since it was first announced last December. It’s now pledging to hire 1,000 people in the next few years.
Production in the new building is expected to begin in 2028.
The latest expansion will bring Boeing’s total capital investment in South Carolina to more than $3 billion since the company opened its Palmetto State location in 2011. As of 2024, the company employed more than 8,250 workers in the state across its North Charleston and Orangeburg facilities.
The North Charleston factory recently raised its production pace to seven Dreamliners a month, up from five per month in the first half of the year. The company expects to reach a monthly rate of eight planes by the end of December, CEO Kelly Ortberg told investors on a quarterly earnings call last week.
Boeing is aiming for 10 planes a month in 2026 as it works to fill its growing backlog of orders, Ortberg added, though supply issues may make that a struggle. And the new assembly building will eventually push that even higher.
“If we thought capping at 10 was as far as we go, we would not be investing in expanding Charleston,” Ortberg said in response to analysts’ questions.
Boeing’s 787 production peak was previously 14 jets a month in 2018, when the work was split between North Charleston and the company’s original Seattle-area facility. South Carolina became the company’s 787 hub in 2021, after the Seattle line closed.
Meanwhile, new orders for the commercial aircraft have soared to 314 through Sept. 30, compared to 64 for all of 2024. The backlog was up to 1,048 planes at the time of the last earnings announcement.
Boeing gets largest ever order of SC-made planes during Trump’s Qatar visit

Boeing inked a record-breaking deal with Qatar Airways for 130 Dreamliners in May, as well as a smaller with British Airways for 32 of the planes.
Gulf Air signed on for up to 18 Dreamliners in July.
And the day of the groundbreaking, Boeing rolled out even more deals: 15 Dreamliners for Kazakhstan’s Air Astana, four for Tajikistan’s Somon Air and Uzbekistan Airways exercised an option to add eight more Dreamliners to a previous order.
Bessent, a native of Little River, credited President Donald Trump and the administration’s trade policies with aiding Boeing in its recent success.
“If you follow trade news, you’ll notice a constant trend,” he told the crowd of Boeing employees Friday. “Where there’s a Trump trade deal, there’s a Boeing sale.”
Boeing signed the Qatar contract on the heels of Trump’s visit to the country.
“That deal set the tone for those that have followed,” Bessent said. “At the president’s urging, South Korea announced it would purchase 103 Boeing aircraft, Japan announced it would purchase 100 and countries like Malaysia, Indonesia and Cambodia announced they would purchase dozens of their own.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/BSC_Final_Assembly_Building_Rendering.jpg,,,2025-11-07 16:04:21.091063

DOVER, Del. — Two measures that could significantly affect state spending and legislative procedures are set to be heard in House committee hearings Friday, ahead of an extraordinary session of the General Assembly scheduled for next week.
The House Rules and House Administration committees, both made up of the five members of House leadership, will take up House Bill 255 and House Resolution 19.
House Bill 255 – Investment Tax Credit
House Bill 255 addresses the impact of the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), signed into law in July. Because Delaware’s tax code is linked to the federal code, tax cuts and incentives in the OBBBA could affect state tax collections. The bill focuses on two provisions related to tax breaks for large businesses, specifically for research and development expenses and equipment investments. The new federal law allows business owners more flexibility in claiming deductions for these expenses, retroactive to 2022.
The Delaware Division of Revenue estimates that, without action, the state could lose $410 million in revenue over the current and next two fiscal years. HB 255 would “decouple” Delaware’s tax code from these federal provisions, reducing the projected three-year revenue loss to $73.8 million.
Gov. Matt Meyer called the General Assembly into an extraordinary session to address the issue, saying, “Washington keeps handing out tax breaks to the wealthy while working people get left behind.”
Not all lawmakers and stakeholders agree. The Delaware BioScience Association noted in a recent post that the OBBBA allows companies to deduct domestic R&D costs upfront, rather than over five years. Supporters argue the change will boost advanced manufacturing and biotech startups, which many officials see as key to future job growth and new revenue sources.
Marie Holliday, a tax expert with the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce, called the legislation an investment in the long-term growth of emerging industries. “I believe this is a win for our state,” Holliday said.
State Rep. Danny Short, R-Seaford, a member of the budget-writing Joint Finance Committee, questioned the governor’s urgency. Short pointed to earlier projections from the Meyer administration showing slowing revenue growth and rising expenditures, predicting a budget deficit of nearly $408 million by fiscal year 2028. He also criticized the lack of accountability for increased state spending, noting that General Fund appropriations rose by more than 53% from fiscal year 2021 to 2025, not including an expected 7% increase this year.
House Bill 19- Remote Voting for Special Sessions
The second measure, House Resolution 19, would amend House rules to allow members to vote remotely when the House meets outside its regular session, which runs from January to June. The rule would require at least 21 of the 41 House members to be present in the chamber, and members wishing to vote remotely would need permission from the Speaker.
If approved next Thursday, the rule change would allow up to 20 members to vote from anywhere in the world.
Rep. Short noted that HB 255 requires a three-fifths supermajority, or 25 votes, to pass. With 27 Democrats in the House, the absence of just three members would prevent the measure from passing on Democratic votes alone.
“While it’s not explicitly stated, I believe there is an expectation for lawmakers to meet in person at Legislative Hall, debate bills face-to-face, allow the press and the public to witness, and be available for questioning afterwards,” Short said. “The only time we should be casting votes remotely is under the most dire of circumstances. I view this rule change as not only a political convenience for the upcoming session, but also as the camel’s nose under the tent. If we pass this, I predict it will not be long before this rule is again modified, further expanding the use of remote voting.”
Committee action on both measures is scheduled for 11 a.m. Friday in the Joint Finance Chamber of Legislative Hall in Dover. The proceedings are open to the public and will be streamed online.

(Kentucky Justice and Public Safety Cabinet)An oversight agency has filed a federal lawsuit against Kentucky’s Department of Juvenile Justice, alleging it is wrongly refusing to release records of two teenage boys it says experienced abuse and neglect at a state facility.
The lawsuit was filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Frankfort by Kentucky Protection and Advocacy, part of a federally-authorized, nationwide system charged with oversight of individuals with mental illness, intellectual or developmental disabilities or other conditions.
That includes some youths in custody of Kentucky’s juvenile justice system, the lawsuit says.
“Given the ongoing reports of abuse and criticism of the care and treatment of DJJ youth, it is unacceptable that DJJ refuses to comply with federal law and is blocking this investigation,” Jeff Edwards, Protection and Advocacy director, said in a statement.
A spokeswoman for the Kentucky Department of Justice and Public Safety, which includes DJJ, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The lawsuit is the latest allegation against the problem-ridden agency which has been buffeted for several years by accusations of abuse and neglect at the detention centers for youths charged with offenses and residential facilities that house those found to have committed crimes.
Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice launched a civil rights investigation into the conditions at eight of the state’s youth detention centers and one residential center. Also last year, Kentucky Republican Auditor Allison Ball, released an audit of DJJ she said revealed “harsh and alarming conditions” in facilities.
Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, recently announced new policies meant to improve treatment of youths placed in isolation he said were recommended by federal justice officials.
The current lawsuit involves Protection and Advocacy’s efforts to get access to records of incidents involving two male residents, both 16, at the Adair Regional Youth Development and Detention Centers. Both have mental health diagnoses and are under jurisdiction of the oversight agency, the lawsuit said.
One went without medical care for two days despite suffering pain and swelling  after he suffered broken bones in his arm and wrist in a fight with another youth, the lawsuit said. The other was sprayed by staff in the back of the head with pepper spray as he was walking away from an altercation with another youth, in violation of state policies on use of the chemical irritant, the lawsuit said. The youth overheard staff say, “Spray him, get him,” the lawsuit said.
Protection and Advocacy learned of the incidents from the youths during an Oct. 1 visit to monitor conditions at Adair. But when it asked for incident reports from the facility, the state denied the request, claiming the youths must authorize the release, the lawsuit said.
The oversight agency responded that under state law, youths under 18 cannot authorize release of such records and that federal law clearly states Protection and Advocacy shall have access to all records of a minor who has a state guardian and abuse or neglect has been alleged. Both youths are in custody of the state.
The lawsuit asked a federal judge to find the state’s refusal to release the records in violation of the law and order “full and immediate access” to the material.

(Photo by Anne Marie-Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)Nearly 3.6 million New Jerseyans voted in this year’s gubernatorial and legislative races, a level of turnout not seen in any non-presidential race this millennium.
About 54% of the state’s registered voters cast a ballot this year. That’s the highest percentage in a New Jersey state election year since at least 1998, and it exceeds turnout in every congressional midterm since then except 2018.
Those totals include 114,766 untallied mail ballots and 58,998 provisional ballots. The number of mail-in ballots will rise over the coming days as ballots postmarked by Election Day continue to reach officials.

Democrat Mikie Sherrill defeated Republican Jack Ciattarelli Tuesday, 57%-43%, to become the state’s new governor-elect. Sherrill, a congresswoman since 2019, is set to take office on January 20, succeeding fellow Democrat Gov. Phil Murphy. Democrats also flipped a handful of Assembly seats in longtime Republican districts, while Sherrill won Morris County, a longtime GOP stronghold in governor’s races.
Turnout this year far eclipsed that of the state’s two most recent gubernatorial races. In 2021, more than 2.6 million voted, or about 40%. Four years earlier, that number was just under 2.2 million, or 39%.
Democratic State Chairman LeRoy Jones said his party has President Donald Trump to thank for the turnout, arguing the administration’s tariffs, prosecutions of political foes, and deployment of military forces into American cities animated voters to respond.
“All those things created a perfect storm, and the turnout was just not in New Jersey,” Jones said, adding, “This whole Donald Trump rollout over the last 10 months has been the gift that gave to the turnout.”
Democrats surpassed expectations in races nationwide Tuesday, winning the governor’s seat and a slew of legislative offices in Virginia, securing a redistricting measure in California, and maintaining Supreme Court seats in Pennsylvania, among others.
Trump was also a major factor in 2018’s elections despite being off the ballot. Those midterms saw Democrats claim four of the five New Jersey House seats then held by Republicans, the party’s gains fueled by animus to the president.
New Jersey voters were split on how they cast their ballots this year. About 2 million voted in person on Election Day, while 739,702 did the same during the state’s nine-day early in-person voting period.
The number of New Jerseyans who cast ballots by mail reached 759,582 this year. Not all those outstanding ballots will be counted. Some mail-in and provisional ballots will be rejected because of procedural defects or because the voters who cast them had already voted or were otherwise ineligible.
Trump at center of GOP loss in NJ governor’s race, Republicans say

By raw votes, turnout was highest in Bergen County, where 407,154 residents cast ballots. Bergen is the state’s most populous county and has more registered voters than any other New Jersey county.
Three other counties — Essex, Middlesex, and Monmouth — turned out more than half a million voters.
Ocean County, the state’s largest Republican stronghold, turned out 478,999 voters.
Hunterdon County saw the highest rates of turnout. There, nearly 63% voted this year. Bergen (60%) and Passaic (61%) were the only other two counties to exceed 60% turnout.
Turnout rates were lowest in Cumberland County, where about 43% of registered voters cast ballots this year. Essex County wasn’t far behind. Despite strong raw turnout numbers, just 43% of the county’s voters cast ballots.

By Jamie Kleman | Contributing Writer Delaware Live | November 2025
A city-owned 20-acre field at the corner of New Road and Park Road will be transformed into a mixed forest and meadow after the Lewes City Council voted unanimously on November 3 to apply for a grant from the Delaware Forest Service to fund the project.
Under the proposal, the grant would cover 90 percent of the cost and the city’s share would be about $8,000 from its newly established resiliency fund. The field lies between the Canary Creek and Pilottown Reserves subdivisions and is zoned open space, having been deeded to the city in 2010 as part of a development agreement.
Deputy Mayor Khalil Saliba described the plan as a smart investment in both nature and finances. “It’s a very cost-effective way to plant trees that are going to be resilient themselves,” he said.
About ten acres of the parcel will be planted with trees around the perimeter, and the remaining acreage will be managed as a native-grass meadow, with up to 40 percent of the site designated meadow. The city emphasized there will be no sports fields, parking lots, or lighting installed at this time.
Local residents voiced strong support for keeping the land natural. Doug Spelman of Canary Creek said, “Thirteen years ago we fended off soccer fields with lights and trucks and parking, and a lot of things that were not part of the arrangement with the city.”
Another resident, Russell Small, whose grandfather farmed the land, reminded the council of its cultural importance. “It’s a cultural site where Native Americans lived and died. My grandfather excavated a site. The artifacts are in the Smithsonian today,” he said.
City staff intend to submit the grant application in the coming weeks. If approved, the planting phase could begin in spring 2026 and continue through 2028. The project aligns with the city’s broader resiliency strategy, using nature-based solutions to manage stormwater, stabilize soils, and enhance habitat.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/LewesOpenSpace-002.jpg,,,2025-11-07 15:17:19.907341

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A federal judge has declined to require daily monetary penalties against the state’s mental health department for failing to meet certain benchmarks.
The benchmarks are a part of an agreement to begin providing timely competency restoration for indigent defendants.
U.S. District Court Judge Gregory Frizzell directed the parties to use a dispute resolution process outlined in a consent decree to resolve differences.
The Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services has begun implementing a settlement agreement stemming from a 2023 lawsuit that alleged the agency failed to provide timely competency restoration services, leaving some inmates, who were ordered by a court to receive competency restoration services, languishing in jails.
The agency entered an agreement with the plaintiffs to resolve the lawsuit. It set out certain benchmarks for the agency to meet.
A September report from the court-appointed consultants determined the agency had not met those benchmarks. 
Plaintiffs in the case sought monetary penalties of $10,000 a day against the agency.
Frizzell with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District disagreed with plaintiff’s allegations the noncompliance was willful, adding that the consultants said the agency was acting in good faith.
But he was also critical of the agency.
“It is true that Class Members continue to endure long wait times for restoration treatment, often in conditions that exacerbate their mental illness,” his Wednesday order said. “The continued delay in the provision of restoration treatment by the Department should be and is of great concern to this court, as well as the general public.”
The agency issued a statement saying it welcomed the decision.
“We remain mission-driven and steadfast in this long-term process, supported by all of our facilities and state partners, to meet the consent decree’s requirements and strengthen Oklahoma’s competency restoration system,” the statement said.
Paul Demuro, the plaintiffs’ attorney, said the ruling was not what they wanted, but he appreciated the court’s quick action to decide the motion.
He said they’ll use the dispute resolution process before asking the court to intervene again.
“We’ve already initiated that process,” he said. “We won’t stop fighting until the competency restoration system is fixed.”
The agency has been in financial turmoil. It received a $27.4 million supplemental appropriation from lawmakers. The agency is requesting an extra $79.5 million for the upcoming fiscal year. Agency officials said some of that funding would help the agency comply with the settlement agreement.
Lawmakers in May removed former Commissioner Allie Friesen from her post, saying they had lost confidence in her. 
Gov. Kevin Stitt appointed Gregory Slavonic as interim commissioner.
The agency has launched a search for a new permanent commissioner of mental health.

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-07 20:09:52+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Student enrollment is up for most of Mississippi’s public universities, including Delta State and The W",Candice Wilder,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/07/ms-student-enrollment-increases/,Most Mississippi public universities saw increased student enrollment for the fall semester.,"Most Mississippi public universities saw an increase in student enrollment for the fall semester compared to last year, according to an annual data report the Institutions of Higher Learning board released Monday. For regional institutions like Delta State University and Mississippi University for Women, that growth means victory. 
Overall, the state’s public institutions saw a 2.7% increase in enrollment with more than 81,961 students on campuses this fall compared to 79,817 students enrolled last year. 
The W, located in Columbus, had the largest enrollment increase of the eight public universities: 8.1% or 2,371 students. That’s the university’s largest enrollment growth in over a decade. 
“We had increases in both new students and in continuing students, so recruitment and retention strategies are having a positive impact,” Nora Miller, president of The W, said in a press release. 
Delta State, another regional institution located in Cleveland, enrolled 2,791 students this fall — a 5.2% increase from 2024. The university also had its highest freshman enrollment growth since the pandemic: a 38% increase from fall 2024. 
“This milestone reflects the exceptional value of a Delta State education, the dedication of our faculty and staff, and the growing confidence families place in our mission to transform lives through innovative, student-centered learning,” Delta State President Dan Ennis, said in a press release. 
Delta State also enrolled 18% more transfer students this year than in 2024, and has 33% more first-time graduates, according to the university. 
For Delta State, that growth occurred after years of  declining enrollment. 
Last year, the university cut $3 million from its budget, which included more than a dozen faculty layoffs and reductions to 21 academic programs. This year, as Delta State celebrates its centennial, administrators said they are focusing on increasing enrollment through intentional recruitment and admissions marketing.
“That kind of momentum signals that more students and families are seeing the value of a Delta State education and the opportunities it provides,” university officials said in a statement to Mississippi Today. 
Two of the state’s flagship institutions, University of Mississippi and Mississippi State University, saw another year of record-breaking student enrollment. Ole Miss had the largest number of students this fall: 25,222. Mississippi State’s enrollment grew by more than 400 students this semester, totaling 23,563. 
The state’s third largest public institution, the University of Southern Mississippi, enrolled 13,191 students, only 0.2% more than last year. 
For the state’s historically Black universities, Mississippi Valley State University had the highest increase in student enrollment, 3.2%, or 2,276 students. Jackson State’s enrollment by 2.2% this fall, totaling 6,464. 
Alcorn State University, an HBCU near Lorman, was the only state institution that saw a slight decline in enrollment, falling to 2,900 students this fall from 3,000 in 2024. 
Edward Rice, vice president of student affairs and enrollment management, said the university plans to do an audit to assess enrollment over the last five years. The goal is to develop data strategies to improve student retention and assess admissions applicants. 
Rice expressed disappointment in the enrollment decline but said the university’s enrollment team hopes to expand Alcorn’s footprint with a new outreach campaign to target prospective students in neighboring states. 
“As we look ahead to the upcoming freshman class, our focus will be strategic and centered on student support and success as well as enhancing our onboarding process to better support incoming students,” Rice said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/01101220/3X0A8846.jpg,,,2025-11-07 15:17:19.907341

And late Friday, the administration resumed that position, asking the Supreme Court to overturn a lower court’s ruling that compelled the earlier memo.Payments would be sent to states Friday, the department’s Food and Nutrition Service said in a letter to state directors of  SNAP, which is funded by the federal government and administered by the states. Patrick A. Penn, the deputy under secretary for food, nutrition and consumer services, wrote the two-paragraph letter.“Later today, FNS will complete the processes necessary to make funds available to support your subsequent transmittal of full issuance files to your EBT processor,” Penn wrote. “We will keep you as up to date as possible on any future developments and appreciate your continued partnership to serve program beneficiaries across the country.”The move undermined an appeal President Donald Trump’s administration made following Thursday’s order from Chief U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell Jr. of Rhode Island. The appeal said the government shutdown, and the resulting lack of funding for SNAP, was Congress’ fault and that the department could not be compelled to transfer other funds to pay for SNAP benefits.A Department of Justice spokesperson said in a Friday email to States Newsroom the government must comply with McConnell’s order until and unless it is given relief by a higher court.The shutdown, which started when Congress failed to pass annual spending laws by Oct. 1, left SNAP without any appropriated funding for November and beyond. The administration reversed its own guidance and declined to use a contingency fund and other accounts within the USDA held more than enough to cover some benefits.Appeal in limboThe move from the USDA was in contrast to an appeals court brief the Justice Department filed on USDA’s behalf Friday morning, leaving the future of that litigation unclear.The appeal asked the 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals for an emergency freeze on McConnell’s order, which it characterized as a wild overreach to a reasonable agency decision.A three-judge panel for the appeals court denied the government’s request for a stay on the merits late Friday, while saying it would soon decide on a motion for an administrative stay.The judges — David J. Barron, Gustavo A. Gelpí and Julie Rikelman — were all appointed by Democratic presidents, though Gelpí was appointed to a lower court by Republican President George W. Bush. The agency said it complied with a Nov. 1 McConnell order to either pay full benefits by Nov. 3 or partial benefits by Nov. 5 by sending states a memo and tables to calculate partial benefits. The USDA had the power to decide to pay only partial benefits from a contingency fund that held about $4.5 billion, the government argued. SNAP benefits cost the government about $9 billion per month.In McConnell’s Thursday order, he rejected that argument, saying the partial payment had to be made by Nov. 5 to be in compliance with the Oct. 31 order. The judge said Thursday that because the department had not met that deadline, it must transfer money from outside the contingency fund to make November SNAP benefits whole.The administration argued to the 1st Circuit that order was beyond McConnell’s power.“There is no lawful basis for an order that directs USDA to somehow find $4 billion in the metaphorical couch cushions,” the appeal said.The administration has resisted suggestions, including from McConnell, that it tap a $23 billion fund meant for child nutrition programs in order to pay November SNAP benefits.The administration asked the appeals court to pause McConnell’s order by 4 p.m. Eastern time Friday.Problem of government’s 'own making'The coalition of nonprofits and city governments that sued to force the administration to pay November benefits responded later Friday morning that USDA was to blame for the tight timeline that provoked the department’s complaints.The department chose, between the two options offered by McConnell, to pay partial benefits “but with complete disregard for the conditions the district court had attached to it,” the coalition wrote Friday.“Defendants’ current situation, therefore, is entirely the product of their own making,” they wrote. “They purported to comply with an order of the district court in a manner that was not compliant; having done so, they cannot complain that the district court ordered them to take the other path.”The coalition also sharply criticized the administration’s decision not to use the child nutrition program fund. The fund had enough money to pay benefits until at least May, the coalition lawyers wrote Friday. But denying SNAP benefits for November would leave 16 million children hungry this month, they said. Major shutdown issueThe issue has become a focus of the shutdown, with each party in Washington blaming the other for denying food assistance for low-income people and those with disabilities.Friday’s rapid turnaround by USDA appeared to take even lawmakers by surprise.Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, posted to social media after the notice had gone out that Trump was “trying to weasel his way out of a court order requiring him to help millions of hungry Americans.”Rep. Angie Craig, the ranking Democrat on the U.S. House Agriculture Committee, said in a late Friday statement the administration’s mixed messaging led to mass confusion, leaving some states to fully fund SNAP while others have not. “The Trump administration needs to tell American households and states in plain language whether it is continuing to appeal the Rhode Island court order or if it is fully funding November SNAP benefits,” she said. “Americans are still living with the uncertainty around what the hell is happening here. The incompetence is stunning.""Republicans have also highlighted the issue while urging Democrats to accept a stopgap funding measure to reopen the government at fiscal 2025 spending levels.“There are people going hungry right now because Democrats refuse to agree to a clean, nonpartisan funding extension,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said on the Senate floor Friday.Democrats have blocked a House-passed bill to reopen the government, seeking assurances that Republicans will work to address expiring tax credits for people who buy health insurance on the Affordable Care Act marketplace.",,,,2025-11-07 19:56:33.497121

“We didn’t have a lot of money or time,” Miller said.
Miller, who was 24 at the time, said the event came together with just a month’s planning. She’d considered scrapping it entirely because she was so broken up over the recent loss of her grandparents (her grandfather had planned to walk her down the aisle). Her compromise was to fast-track everything and “just get it over with.” In the end, festivities ended up being a bit too abbreviated. 
A bright spot, however, was the wedding cake. To start, Miller said, Jim and Janet got it just right, pulling together and interpreting photos and descriptions from Miller. 
And Miller said a big bonus was that the proceeds helped support the couple’s mobile soup kitchen: God’s Chuckwagon, run out of a retrofitted school bus since 2005 in Pennsylvania’s Coal Region. 
“It was helping them, and helping us,” she said. “We got the cake and they got the money to help the community.” 
The need is great in the area, where the population, economy and overall quality of life started declining decades ago when mines closed. The degradation worsened when factories shutdown and snowballed, culminating in relatively high unemployment and poverty rates as well as environmental degradation, healthcare deserts and more. 
“We used to not come out. We didn’t really need the help,” Miller said. “It’s just gotten hard lately, probably over the last three weeks.”
Miller said she and her family have become regulars as they tighten their belts in every way possible due to the prospect of losing $800 in monthly grocery assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) amid the ongoing, historically long federal government shutdown.

Normally, recipients get SNAP benefits payments on a designated business day within the first half of each month. Even with a federal judge ordering the government to pay them in full, November’s already have been missed. 
The Trump administration, meanwhile, is fighting the court ruling. And there’s no timeline for when payments would resume. Other officials – including state Department of Health Services Secretary Val Arkoosh – have highlighted a relatively efficient process used during the COVID-19 pandemic, to no avail. It would move faster, they say, than the 9 to 22 days  estimated for the approach that the feds want to use to disburse SNAP payments from a contingency fund. 
“I did not expect any of this to happen,” said Miller, who is 27 years old . “A lot of people are on SNAP. And it doesn’t just affect [them]. It affects all the stores, it affects the truckers who drive [for] the stores. It affects everyone.”
In Pennsylvania, about two million people get a collective $360 million-plus each month in SNAP support. More than 18,000 people use the program in Northumberland County – that’s 20 percent of the county, among the highest rates in the commonwealth.
“I’m more worried about it for my children than I am myself,” Miller said. “I can go without eating if need be. But my kids? They’re babies, they’re toddlers. They can’t go without eating.”
Miller spoke as she and her husband Zach waited with three of their five young children (four under the age of six) for hot meals from God’s Chuckwagon on a sunny, windy afternoon in Shamokin, recently  – when the federal government officially stopped sending out SNAP payments.
The chuckwagon served nearly 100 takeout meals within an hour from two locations in the city that day – on top of another 50 in Sunbury the day before. That’s about quadruple the usual demand, according to Janet Bowers.
The uptick matches what local food pantries report seeing during the past couple weeks, according to Megan Bair, who’s executive director of Central Susquehanna Opportunities Inc., The group is the Community Action Agency for Northumberland, Columbia and Montour counties.
“People are scared,” Bair said. “SNAP’s really a lifeline for them. They use their other household funds to cover other essential bills like rent and utilities and gas.”
Bair and Jim Bowers both said they’re concerned that the loss of social benefits would drive people out of their homes.
“We’re already seeing an increase in homelessness, in our counties, and of people who can’t pay their rent. And a lot of these families are working families,” Bair said.
Bowers said he fields calls with increasing frequency from people looking for guidance on finding an affordable place to live.

Stretched safety net
The SNAP lapse coincides with the onset of more stringent requirements to qualify for the program. And it’s but one component of the nation’s social safety net – others include the Low-income Heating Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and Women, Infants and Children (WIC) – stretched during the federal government shutdown. A major sticking point: extending tax credits to prevent health insurance premiums from spiking so high next year that millions would likely be forced to go without it.
In Pennsylvania, the shutdown and its impact on social services and the economy has exacerbated a state budget impasse now in its fifth month. The commonwealth’s schools, nonprofits and county governments have gone without state funding during that time.
Schools have missed $5.3 billion in state payments. And at least three districts have warned they might close as a result after the end of January, absent changes at the Capitol: Morrisville (Bucks County), William Penn (Delaware County) and Northwest Area (Luzerne County) ,, according to the Pennsylvania State Education Association.
“We know that childhood hunger is already a major issue facing our public schools and that the loss of SNAP benefits will only make success at school harder for students facing food insecurity,” said PSEA President Aaron Chapin in a statement. “Hunger in children impacts their ability to learn and perform in the classroom because it hinders their concentration, memory, mood and motor skills.”
Similarly, counties have gone without state funds that account for a third, on average, of their revenue. To compensate, they  are employing a number of measures including furloughs and incurring debt totaling in the tens of millions, collectively and conservatively, according to John Buffone, spokesman for the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania.
Not to mention losing out on interest – reportedly $875,000 in Luzerne County so far – and delaying programs. 
Despite being stretched, Delaware and Northumberland counties are running food drives; Montgomery has diverted $500 million in emergency funding to food pantries.
“How we get things done”
Northumberland is one of six counties where at least 20 percent of people use SNAP benefits.
The others are Erie, Luzerne, Fayette, Cameron and Philadelphia. Setting aside the Democratic stronghold of Philadelphia, voters in each of those counties have overwhelmingly supported President Donald Trump during his campaigns. They went for him all three times he ran except once, in Erie, where former President Joe Biden narrowly won in 2020. 
Three of the six are rural, where experts say SNAP utilization rates tend to be higher, and communities tend to lack access to private capital, philanthropy and other resources that can be tapped to at least help make up for government lapses. 
“We’re not getting a million dollars in donations from companies, but we’re getting donations that are allowing us to serve more people. People are doing food collections. One of the local technical schools is doing a hygiene collection for us,” Bair said. “So, we don’t see the big donors. What we see are many people stepping up. That’s how we get things done here.”
Scicchitano’s Pizzeria, for example, gave away free slices for a week from its location in Berwick, Columbia County.  
“We know times are tough for many right now, and we want to do what we can to help,” read a Nov. 3 Facebook post. “This week only, anyone with a SNAP card is welcome to stop by for two slices of cheese pizza on us. No purchase necessary, just bring your card with you.”
Joey Scicchitano has been operating the pizza shop with his wife Mari for 30 years. He said the offer grew out of the couple’s conversations during the past couple weeks as they’ve followed the news about the looming loss of SNAP benefits that so many people rely on.  
“We’re like, ‘Well,what can we do?’ We’re food people. We knew it was probably going to be overwhelming. And it has been. It’s been a lot. But it’s been worth it,” said Scicchitano, noting that his family used SNAP when he was a small child – something the 58-year-old had forgotten until his older sister reminded him recently.
The response has meant producing twice as much pizza as usual – a challenge considering their small staff and timing considerations for dough made fresh on site, he said.  
It also has left him concerned that people going hungry is a true possibility – at the hands of elected officials who can’t agree. 
“They need to do their job,” he said. 
Businesses stepping up like that supplements the more established meal calendar in the area, expanded during the past month by Central Susquehanna Opportunities adding five locations to its mobile food pantry route. 
For its part, God’s Chuckwagon makes four stops per week, two each in Sunbury and Shamokin – scaled back from 11 pre-pandemic. That’s partly due to reduced contributions and, according to Janet Bowers, she and her husband are getting older.

Looking ahead
Zach Miller, who works as an IT support specialist for U-Haul, said he feared it was basically just a matter of time before the federal government would cut SNAP and other social services after watching the Department of Government Efficiency’s approach earlier this year. 
“Also, a lot of Republicans see  (social services) as government waste,” said Miller, who told the Capital-Star he identifies politically as a moderate Independent and has not voted for Trump. “That people should be working other than collecting benefits. Even though most people work, there’s the misconception that everybody that’s on SNAP is kind of like a freeloader.”
Faced with the loss of SNAP and LIHEAP, the 29-year-old said he could tap investments or family members for help to a limited extent. Part-time work is an option– but not a long-term solution because it would mean even more time that Alexis is left on her own caring for their five kids including supporting two who are autistic. He’s also says that could be tough in an area where many people “are in the same boat.”
“It really depends on how long the shutdown is actually going to last,” he said. “It’s discouraging.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/gods-chuckwagon-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-07 14:57:26.059169

(John Gray/Verite News)Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson successfully argued Friday that she shouldn’t have to pay the full fine for missing a campaign reporting deadline because her attorney was incarcerated at the time. 
The Louisiana Board of Ethics voted to reduce Hutson’s fine for filing the annual report for the Orleans Jedi Guardian political action committee, where she is the chairperson, three weeks late earlier this year. 
Her original fine was $2,800, but the board lowered it to $500. The ethics board staff had recommended that the fine, at a minimum, be reduced to $2,000, according to board documents. 
The board was apparently swayed by Hutson’s explanation that she didn’t realize the PAC’s attorney, Jimmy Burland, was behind bars and couldn’t file the paperwork on time. The report was due Feb. 18 but but wasn’t filed until March 11. 

“Unfortunately, this was one of the PACs that was being handled by Jimmy Burland, who my client found out was in prison, so my client was not aware the filing had not been completed,” wrote Alesia Ardoin, Hutson’s new attorney, in an email to the board staff. 
A longtime Louisiana lobbyist, Burland pled guilty to federal charges of possessing child pornography in November 2024, three months before Hutson’s PAC’s campaign report was due. Both his conviction and a federal raid on his office in downtown Baton Rouge, which took place in April 2024, were well-publicized.
Hutson, who lost her reelection campaign earlier this month, will step down as sheriff in June. She is in the process of dissolving the Orleans Jedi Guardian PAC, Ardoin told the ethics board Friday. 

The PAC only took in one donation during the entirety of 2024 — $275 from Hutson herself — and only had $97 available in its account at the end of last year, according to campaign finance documents.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/OPSO_02-2048x1365-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-07 14:57:26.059169

Sharice Davids in the November 2026 election. This March 2025 image is of Hawkins speaking to a GOP colleague. (Photo by Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas House Speaker Dan Hawkins stripped three Republicans of committee chairmanships for refusing to sign a petition calling for a special legislative session to redraw congressional boundaries in a bid to block reelection of Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids and to tackle a handful of unrelated bills.
Hawkins relied on his unilateral power as the House’s top leader to alter committee assignments and remove as chairmen GOP Reps. Steven Howe of Salina, Nathan Butler of Junction City and Jesse Borjon of Topeka. At least one committee vice chairman, Rep. Clarke Sanders of Salina, also was removed from the position by Hawkins.
Sanders, who was vice chair of the House Higher Education Budget Committee, said Hawkins called him Friday with the news. Sanders said Republicans in committee leadership positions who wouldn’t sign the special session petition were targeted.
“Those of us who were chairs and vice chairs … have been relieved because we didn’t agree to sign on for a special session,” Sanders said. “I understand it. I knew that not signing it came with a risk. I just didn’t think it was the right thing to do. I hope to maintain a good relationship with the speaker, but this was something he felt he had to do.”
It’s likely additional committee vice chairs could be removed from leadership positions by the House speaker. Rank-and-file members of the House also could face sanctions in terms of committee assignments ahead of the 2026 legislative session in January.
The committee leaders demoted by Hawkins were among 10 Republican House members who declined to sign the petition for the special session. Neither Howe, Butler nor Borjon could be immediately reached for comment.
“I’m not shocked. It wasn’t too much of a surprise to me,” said Rep. Mark Schreiber, an Emporia Republican who was among the GOP representatives who didn’t sign the petition. “I’ve been there quite a long time as a lobbyist and legislator. I’ve seen that from leadership.”
He said the Republicans who lost committee assignments wouldn’t be deprived of an opportunity to represent their constituents in the House.
“They still have votes on the floor and can speak from the (House) well,” Schreiber said.
Hawkins was able to convince 78 of the 88 GOP members of the House to sign, which fell below the two-thirds requirement of 84 signatures from 125 House members to authorize the special session. Kansas Senate President Ty Masterson was able to secure the necessary 27 signatures to complete special session requirements in that chamber. The special session had been scheduled for Nov. 7.
On Tuesday, Hawkins threw in the towel on a special session but vowed to take on congressional redistricting in 2026. Under legislative rules, he said, once the Nov. 7 deadline was breached the original House and Senate petitions would be voided and the signature search would have to start over.
“To say I’m disappointed would be an understatement,” Hawkins said in his newsletter posted Friday. “At this late date, the only option was to wait until we return for the regular session on January 12.”
In terms of Kansas’ four congressional districts, President Donald Trump urged GOP-led legislatures in Kansas and other states to redraw boundaries to promote election of more Republicans in November 2026 so the U.S. House might remain under GOP control.
Hawkins wanted the Legislature to gather in November to address Trump’s plea for mid-decade redistricting and to consider how to handle federal funding of rural health care and a court decision allowing Kansans to change gender information on a driver’s license. There also were discussions about taking up property tax legislation during the special session.
He said in a statement Tuesday that scheduling conflicts and competing agendas made planning a special session an “uphill battle.”
In the House speaker’s newsletter Friday, he said delaying decisions until January meant Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly would have “full discretion” on allocation of new federal funding for health care in rural Kansas. Without advance guardrails, he said, funding accepted by Kelly couldn’t be returned to the federal government.
“Those who refused to sign a petition played right into the governor’s hands by giving her free rein without oversight on hundreds of millions of dollars. Sad,” Hawkins said.
Hawkins said delaying passage of a gender identification bill meant the Legislature’s action to nullify the court decision would be “very costly and difficult.”
The timeline for imposing new congressional districts on Kansans — the focus has been on splitting voter-rich Johnson County among multiple districts — would be “greatly shortened,” Hawkins said.
He also disclosed there were “valid” complaints about the cost to taxpayers of a special session, especially since the regular session would begin in two months on Jan. 12. The GOP-controlled Legislative Coordinating Council voted in October to allocate $460,000 to the special session.
“It’s also important to remember that the Legislature did their business in record time this (2025 regular) session saving a significant amount of money,” Hawkins said. “These savings would have been more than enough to cover the cost of a special session.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hawkins-1-3.24.25-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-07 14:57:26.059169

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)According to Gov. Tony Evers’ administration, over 330,000 Wisconsin households were paid their November Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits by Friday morning. 
The release of the funds comes as the federal government shutdown entered day 38 on Friday; it’s the longest shutdown in American history.
The lapse in federal funding for SNAP, known as FoodShare in Wisconsin, took effect on Nov. 1 — leaving nearly 700,000 Wisconsinites, including 270,000 kids, without access to food assistance. Two court orders last week directed the Trump administration to pay SNAP benefits by a Wednesday deadline.
This week food banks across the state, including in Milwaukee, have seen a spike in need.
Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr., a federal judge in Rhode Island, ordered the Trump administration Thursday to pay the full month of food assistance benefits for November. McConnell said the Trump administration missed its chance to make partial payments after it failed to release funds by the deadline.
Shortly after the court decision was released, the Evers administration announced it was taking steps to get the funds out the door as soon as possible.
“My administration worked quickly to ensure these benefits could be released as soon as possible so that our kids, families, and seniors have access to basic food and groceries without one more day of delay,” Evers said in a statement Thursday evening. “But let’s be clear — it never should’ve come to this. Wisconsinites should’ve never been without food assistance, period, and they wouldn’t have been if President Trump and the Trump Administration had listened to me and so many who urged them to use all legal funds and levers to prevent millions of Americans from losing access to food and groceries.” 
The Evers administration said Friday morning that it used the same process it typically uses to process benefits, submitting information to its SNAP payment vendor, which processes payments to QUEST cards, a few hours after the court decision to ensure payments would go out as soon as possible. 
The funds became available to households at midnight. According to the administration, a total of about $104.4 million was issued for 337,137 households. It said the payments went out before the Trump administration requested that a federal appeals court block the order from McConnell on Friday morning. The emergency stay has not been granted as of Friday afternoon. 
The administration received notification from the federal Food and Nutrition Service on Friday morning that it was working to implement November benefits in accordance with the Thursday court order.
The Evers administration said it is still monitoring the situation for any issues that may arise related to processing last night’s payments. 
Evers said the actions of the Trump administration are “contemptible” and called on federal Republicans to work with Democrats to end the government shutdown. Last week, Evers had also declared a state of emergency due to the lapse in funding for food assistance, directing state agencies to do everything they could to support Wisconsinites.
“Wisconsinites simply cannot afford another month of Republican dysfunction in Washington,” Evers said. “It’s time for Republicans to get back to work and do the right thing by working across the aisle to end the federal government shutdown to ensure Wisconsinites continue to have access to basic needs, including affordable healthcare and food assistance, moving forward.”

As of Friday, 31 people were in quarantine, down from more than 150 a month ago. Health officials are expecting more cases in friends and family members of those in quarantine, according to a Friday news release.
The decrease in recent cases shows that 21-day quarantines are effective in stopping the disease from spreading in the community, said Linda Bell, the state epidemiologist.

“We’ve got a positive sign,” Bell told reporters Wednesday of the decrease in new cases. “It is too early to say, however, that the outbreak is waning.”
For officials to declare the outbreak over, the state would need to go 42 days without a new case reported in the community, Bell said. That represents two incubation cycles for the virus.
Measles could continue to spread throughout the state during the upcoming holidays, Bell said. During the busy travel season surrounding Thanksgiving and Christmas, the disease could spread quickly in airports or on crowded flights, she said.
Symptoms sometimes take weeks to show up, so people may not realize they’re sick when they travel. The state could see its case count rise in the weeks after Thanksgiving, Bell said.
“This is a risk that takes us through the Thanksgiving holidays, into the Christmas holidays, that could keep rolling along into the early part of next year if we don’t increase our vaccination rates now to get people protected before these potential exposures,” Bell said.
Quarantines show effectiveness as measles cases continue to rise, SC health officials say

Early symptoms include a fever, cough, red eyes and a runny nose. A rash typically follows those symptoms, starting on the face before spreading to the rest of the body. Severe cases can cause pneumonia or brain swelling, which can be fatal, especially in young children.
Vaccination is the only sure way to stop the virus from spreading, Bell said. One dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine is about 93% effective at preventing infections, and two doses is about 97% effective, she said.
Immunizations are available for free at mobile health clinics in Spartanburg County, as well as through state health departments and other clinics. Since the state’s mobile clinics launched Oct. 16, they have administered 30 shots, Bell said.

(Photo via Google Earth)First impression of Keokuk: beautiful and blighted, drained away with the currents of time at the confluence of the Mississippi and Des Moines rivers on Iowa’s southeastern tip.
You could forsake it were it not for the stubborn and resilient people who have laid claim to the place since 1837.
It was a major-league city with major-league ambitions. It was the Gate City to the river trade. It was a milling and foundry town. In 1875, the Keokuk Westerns played in the National League, compiling a 1-12 record and hanging up their cleats by June, never to play the Chicago White Stockings again.
The town boasted industrialists like J.C. Hubinger, a miller who had a huge mansion and amusement park overlooking the river and died poor in a boarding house. Now you could buy a manse along the river for $300,000. Forty percent of the historic brick buildings downtown are vacant.
In 1960, just before the fathers of industry were selling out to corporations, the population was 16,000. It dropped in the last census to under 10,000.
Keokuk has taken its lumps, like so many other working-class towns: Fort Madison, Ottumwa, Fort Dodge, Clinton. Keokuk got a rap. It rubs the wrong way.
“We know we have a chip on our shoulder,” said Teamsters union business agent Drake Custer at the Keokuk Labor Temple. “We also know what we are capable of.”
We spent four days in Keokuk shooting video for a series of documentaries about the real issues eating at rural Iowa. We will have episodes on water, cancer, agriculture and rural consolidation.
Keokuk helps you appreciate what Iowa is up against. We are letting the state decay while the politicians fly over. Keokuk is ready for anyone who will lend a hand.
City Councilman Mike Greenwald said the town realizes that if it wants to get things done, they have to do it themselves.

Downtown vacancies were 60% five years ago. The Main Street Alliance has invested over $1 million. (You could own two buildings three stories high on the main drag for just $55,000.) It’s getting better. The old railroad depot is restored to glory with private fundraising. New field turf was laid down for football and soccer, and the high school grandstands are next.
Mayor Kathy Mahoney believes Main Street will fill up again.
Maybe. It was built for a town twice its size, and before Amazon and Walmart.
“We have top-dollar employers, we just can’t get the workers,” said Roslyn Garcia, who moved home to Keokuk from Austin, Texas, with her husband Jonathan. She served a four-year term on the city council during which the broken-down road leading to Iowa’s only national cemetery was finally rebuilt.
There is justifiable optimism that Keokuk and Fort Madison may have bottomed out, but you cannot know when the calls are made in a faraway corporate boardroom. The Case-IH plant at Burlington upstream is threatened. These towns are forced to constantly pull themselves up with little outside help. Des Moines might as well be on the moon.
The county flipped from blue to red, from Obama to Trump. Anyone who wants to understand should listen.
Keokuk officials did listen when Custer and his union brethren launched the Iowa Dignity Project. The group surveyed 400 residents to identify the major issues and held town halls in 2022. Abortion and transgender issues did not make the cut. Streets remain the top complaint. Health care is right up there, since the hospital closed three years ago because of low reimbursement rates. Wages. Child care. Public transportation. The report card was redlined with Fs.
The people were heard.
The city lobbied for help to fix the embarrassment of a road leading to the National Cemetery, planted during the Civil War for soldiers who died in the local hospitals. Finally, the city got a federal earmark in the infrastructure bill through Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks after her opponent, Democrat Christina Bohannon, enjoined the crusade. Eight blocks cost $3.2 million — money that the city just doesn’t have.
When the people stood up, the politicians had to listen.
“If everybody does their part, we can do great things,” Garcia said.
The city got EPA brownfields grants to clean up the site of an abandoned carbide factory. A group is raising money for a library park. The town rehabbed the opera house into a performing arts center. It raised funds for riverfront amenities. Boosters acknowledge that local donors are getting tapped out. But there is an attitude that things can change.
A construction company bought the vacant mall and intends to bring back the movie theatre. Cheap property is at the ready. Electric rates are high because the hydroelectric dam sends the juice downriver to feed St. Louis. People are nervous about discussions on the board of supervisors about losing the courthouse — Lee County is Iowa’s only county with two courthouses, the other being in rival/twin Fort Madison. The radio station is back on the air thanks to new local owners after going silent for awhile.
People cling to a place. Fort Dodge is coming around after 40 years of hard work when the meatpackers shut down. Dubuque is back on its feet following a pummeling in the 1980s. Storm Lake grows because of immigrants. So could Keokuk. Each of these places need strategic investments from state and federal government, not simply more tax cuts. Everyone talks about housing needs yet a huge Plaza Hotel in downtown Fort Dodge has been home to pigeons for decades.
“We have river, road and rail. We have to forge a new path,” Garcia said.

Carol Hagan McEntee, a South Kingstown Democrat, will become the next chair of the House Committee on Judiciary. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi announced Friday that he is elevating Rep. Carol Hagan McEntee to be the next chair of the panel responsible for shaping Rhode Island’s penal code and judicial system.
McEntee, a South Kingstown Democrat, will succeed Rep. Robert Craven, who announced Oct. 6 that he’s stepping down from the House Committee on Judiciary — and elected office altogether when his term ends following the 2026 legislative session.
Craven bowed out from his committee position after launching a brief run for Rhode Island attorney general that ended in early October amid renewed scrutiny of domestic assault charges from two decades ago.
Craven will remain on the committee, House spokesperson Larry Berman confirmed.
McEntee spent the last five legislative sessions as first vice-chair of the Judiciary Committee, presiding over hearings in Craven’s absence. In a statement Friday, McEntee called her appointment a “tremendous honor.”
“At a time when countless rights are being trampled upon and disregarded, the House Judiciary Committee stands as a crucial line of defense for all Rhode Islanders and that will not change,” McEntee said in a statement. “I look forward to working with other members of the committee and the entire House of Representatives to ensure that the people of Rhode Island are cared for, supported and protected.”
In addition to giving McEntee the chairmanship, Shekarchi has appointed Rep. Jason Knight, a Barrington Democrat running for attorney general next year, from second vice-chair to first vice-chair. Rep. Matthew Dawson, an East Providence, will take over as second vice-chair.
McEntee was elected to represent House District 33 in 2015 and has been a champion of legislation assisting victims of domestic assault and sexual violence. In 2024, she was the lead sponsor of a law that now allows sexual assault victims use a medical forensic exam instead of a police report to qualify for the State Crime Victim Compensation Program.
She was also one of the proponents of the newly enacted law banning the purchase and sale of assault-style firearms starting in July 2026.
McEntee works as an attorney, licensed in both Rhode Island and Massachusetts, at her private practice in Wakefield and Warwick. She is also a former special assistant attorney general in Rhode Island and a former assistant city solicitor and prosecutor for the City of Warwick.
Shekarchi said of McEntee in a statement that he has “no doubt that her dedication and compassion will continue to serve all Rhode Islanders well as the Judiciary Committee.”
“I have the utmost confidence in her ability to lead this important committee,” Shekarchi said. “As one of the House’s leading voices to protect and deliver justice for victims of childhood sexual abuse, she truly understands how this committee helps and protects the people of Rhode Island.”

Sept. 5, 2023. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)With Maine Gov. Janet Mills set to term out after eight years, the field for the November 2026 gubernatorial election is packed with candidates with a spectrum of experience and views. 
Those running as either Democrats or Republicans will first face off against each other in the June 9, 2026 primaries in an effort to win over their base and secure their party’s nomination.
Open to all Maine voters, the primaries will be a ranked-choice ballot, though the general election in November will not. With at least one political heavyweight, Maine Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, opting out of either major political party, it remains to be seen how that could influence Maine’s historically independent electorate.
The field is already crowded with several well known names vying for the Democratic Party nomination, including Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Senate President Troy Jackson, former speaker of the Maine House of Representatives and daughter of a U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, Hannah Pingree, and Angus King III, son of Maine’s independent U.S. senator.
Whoever becomes Maine’s next governor will take the helm for the remaining two years of President Donald Trump’s second term, and will have to navigate massive cuts in funding, the dismantling of federal agencies and programs, and greater pressure on states to conform with his agenda amid increased economic uncertainty.
Here’s the latest on the race for Maine governor.

Maine House Speaker Fecteau backs Pingree for governor


By: Lauren McCauley and AnnMarie Hilton - Friday November 7, 2025 1:44 pm





The Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives announced his top choice for Maine’s next governor.
At the former Biddeford Courthouse Friday afternoon, House Speaker Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford) said he is backing Hannah Pingree in next year’s gubernatorial election.
He said Pingree, who also previously served as the leader of the legislature’s lower chamber and most recently as head of the state’s Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, has the leadership necessary to defend Maine from federal attacks and continue the work the state has done in recent years under a Democratic trifecta.
“As we watch the dysfunction and cruelty coming from Washington, it’s clear that we need leaders that will stand up for Maine people, for the food assistance they need, for the health care every person deserves, for smart forward-looking policies that will protect our state from climate change,” said Fecteau, who was flanked by roughly 20 current and former legislators.
“We need someone who will stand up to the Trump administration and the ridiculous ongoing attacks on the most vulnerable Mainers,” he continued. “Hannah Pingree is that person.”

Former Maine CDC director Nirav Shah joins governor’s race


By: AnnMarie Hilton - Monday October 20, 2025 10:50 am





The doctor who led Maine through the Covid-19 pandemic and later moved to a national public health position is running for governor. 
Nirav Shah announced Monday he will throw his name into an already crowded field of Democrats vying for the Blaine House. Shah was appointed as the director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention in 2019. He held that role until he became principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2023.
“As Maine CDC Director, I saw how we could get through incredibly tough times together with empathy, resilience, and vision,” Shah said in a news release. “I’ll bring those same values as governor to tackle big challenges: the unsustainable increases to the cost of living and housing, an economy that’s not delivering for people, and a rural health care system that’s struggling and will only get worse because of [President Donald] Trump.”

Republican Jonathan Bush launches bid for governor


By: Lauren McCauley - Wednesday October 8, 2025 4:49 pm





Jonathan Bush, nephew of the late President George H.W. Bush, officially launched his campaign for governor on Wednesday, running as a Republican to replace outgoing Gov. Janet Mills in the 2026 election.
Branding himself as a “disruptor, a job creator and a fanatic Maine optimist,” the health care entrepreneur launched his campaign at the Belfast headquarters of athenahealth, a company he founded in 1997 but was eventually ousted from.
In a launch video, Bush outlined some of the changes he hopes to make as governor, including auditing the government, investing in trade schools and jumpstarting the economy “by getting rid of silly regulations.”
“To change things, I’m going to have to break a few eggs along the way,” he said in the video.

State Rep. Ed Crockett enters Maine governor’s race as independent


By: Emma Davis - Thursday September 25, 2025 5:07 pm





Rep. Ed Crockett of Portland has entered the race for Maine’s next governor. And, he’s the second sitting legislator who has unaffiliated from a political party to run as an independent.
Crockett, who until recently had been a Democrat, announced his intention to run for higher office in an op-ed earlier this summer, in which he condemned what he described as a Legislature “stuck in a morass of partisanship.” Crockett is approaching his eighth and final year serving in the Maine House of Representatives before he’ll be termed out.
That critique echoes why Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, formerly a Republican, similarly said he decided to run as an independent for governor earlier this year
With Crockett in the running, there are now 17 candidates in the open race to replace Gov. Janet Mills, who terms out in 2026. Crockett is the third independent, along with Bennett and John Glowa, a retired environmental specialist.

Gubernatorial candidate Troy Jackson joined U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and U.S. Senate candidate Graham Platner at a packed rally at the Cross Insurance Arena in Portland on Labor Day.
Addressing the crowd of 6,500, Jackson used his speech to differentiate himself from other Democratic candidates.
“We have tried it their way and it doesn’t work,” said Jackson, a fifth-generation logger from Allagash. “It’s time for regular folks to take the wheel. Hell, we built the wheel.”
Sanders, an independent who ran twice for the Democratic nomination for president, endorsed both Jackson and Platner in their respective races.

Former Maine CDC head Dr. Nirav Shah considering bid for governor


By: Lauren McCauley - Friday August 15, 2025 2:53 pm





Another popular figure in Maine is considering a run for governor. 
Dr. Nirav Shah told the Portland Press Herald in an interview Friday that he’s considering entering the race as a Democrat, which would have him joining a field already crowded with well-known players in Maine politics.  
Shah became a household figure as head of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic, holding daily briefings during which he would answer questions and provide updates on the public health crisis. He often appeared alongside Maine officials, including Gov. Janet Mills. 
He told the paper that experience gave him an appreciation for the impact state government can make on people’s lives.
“What attracted me in particular to the governor’s office is the impact you can have in the executive branch,” Shah said.
In January 2023, he was appointed as the principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under former President Joe Biden. Recently, he returned to Maine to launch a public health education program at Colby College, where he is a visiting professor.









Retired DEP employee is third independent to join the race for governor


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Thursday August 7, 2025 5:44 pm





A former longtime state government employee is running for governor as an independent.
John Glowa of South China is the most recent candidate to add his name to the growing list of gubernatorial candidates. So far, 16 people have entered the race, including three independents.
The most prominent of those is State Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, who left the Republican Party earlier this year to announce his run, in addition to Dover-Foxcroft resident Alexander Murchison, according to the Maine Ethics Commission website.
Glowa worked for the Maine Department of Environmental Protection as an environmental specialist from 1987 until 2016, according to his campaign website. He then retired and ran for state representative as a member of the Democratic Party, and then for a seat in the Maine Senate.
He also founded the Maine Wolf Coalition, which advocates for wolf recovery in the northeast, and has accused state wildlife officials of deliberately downplaying evidence of wolves’ presence in the state.

Here are the Republicans vying to replace Gov. Janet Mills next November


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday August 6, 2025 8:04 am





Ben Midgley, a fitness executive from Kennebunkport, on Tuesday officially became the seventh Republican candidate in a crowded race for Gov. Janet Mills’ seat.
Midgley is the latest of 17 officially registered candidates vying to replace Mills, a Democrat who terms out next year. Both the Republican and Democratic primaries, slated for June 9, 2026, are open to all Maine voters. The primaries will be a ranked-choice ballot though the general election for governor in November will not.
Most of the Republican candidates listed on the Maine Ethics Commission website have not held public office at the state level, with the exception of state Sen. Jim Libby (R-Standish). Bobby Charles, a lawyer who served under former Republican presidents, and former Paris selectman Robert Wessels have also been involved in politics in different capacities.
In contrast, the Democratic field is stacked with party leaders, including Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Senate President Troy Jackson, and former Speaker of the Maine House of Representative and Mills administration official Hannah Pingree, among others.
Other GOP candidates, including University of Maine System trustee Owen McCarthy, tout their financial credentials while framing themselves as political outsiders. All seven appear to have varying stances on issues including the economy, education and immigration, but almost all have expressed concern about the increasing cost of living in Maine, which according to a Pan Atlantic Research poll conducted this year was the biggest concern expressed by voters.

Republican Sen. Rick Bennett announces independent bid for Maine governor


By: Emma Davis - Tuesday June 24, 2025 12:03 pm





After decades of public service as a Republican, state Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford announced on Tuesday that he is running for governor as an independent.
“My candidacy is not an indictment of either party,” Bennett told Maine Morning Star in an interview. “It’s an indictment of the party structure and parties as the solution to solving our problems.”
Calling his independent bid liberating, Bennett said he intends to take his message — one of fiscal responsibility — directly to Maine people and not a subset of the electorate, an approach he sees as a return to Maine’s independent tradition.
“I see politics beginning to slide more towards the politics of Washington,” Bennett said, “and I think we have the opportunity as Maine people to say no to that.”

Hannah Pingree officially launches bid for governor


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Tuesday June 10, 2025 7:02 am





Hannah Pingree officially launched her campaign for governor after months of speculation about the candidacy of the former Mills administration official and speaker of the Maine House of Representatives.
She kicked off the campaign with several planned stops around the state on Tuesday, starting with a rally in Rockland, scheduled meetings with local leaders in Lewiston and Biddeford before capping off the day with a celebration in Portland.
Pingree left her role as head of Gov. Janet Mills’ Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, also known as GOPIF, which she held since 2019. The office was created to recommend policy solutions for some of the state’s biggest issues including climate change, housing, workforce development, the opioid crisis and more.

Republican state senator enters race for governor


By: AnnMarie Hilton - Thursday May 22, 2025 12:01 pm





State Sen. James Libby is running in the 2026 gubernatorial race.
Libby, who represents parts of Cumberland, Oxford and York counties, is one of five Republican candidates contending for the Blaine House, according to filings with the Maine Ethics Commission.
The race is already starting to get crowded, with the Democratic ticket drawing notable names including Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who announced her bid in late March, as well as Angus King III, the son of independent U.S. senator and former governor Angus King Jr., who announced his run earlier this month.
Libby is in the middle of his second consecutive term in the Senate, but he has also spent time as a state representative after being first elected to the Legislature in 1992. He also ran in the 2002 Republican gubernatorial primary.

“I know what it’s like to punch a clock, live paycheck to paycheck, be treated like I didn’t matter while some billionaire got rich off my back – and how to turn that feeling of powerlessness into action,” he added.

“I’m so grateful to Governor Mills for the tremendous opportunity she gave me to dive into Maine’s biggest challenges and lead work across her administration to chart a path to solutions,” Pingree said in a news release from the governor’s office Thursday.
Though the release didn’t specify what Pingree plans to do next, she said she will “remain relentlessly focused on the future of the state we all love.” The Bangor Daily News has reported that Pingree is expected to throw her hat in the ring for the Democratic gubernatorial primary next year.

During her address early Wednesday at the official launch event at the Hancock Community Center, Bellows said “we need leaders who will meet the moment.”
“Because while we’re paying our taxes or helping our parents measure out their medication, our country is being demolished by a greedy, unelected billionaire who thinks his dollars are more powerful than our voices…Who thinks the value of his stock portfolio matters more than the values of our community.”

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital will have enough money to stay open till the end of the month under a short-term financing agreement between their bankrupt owner and the Rhode Island Attorney General’s office.
The deal approved by a federal bankruptcy judge in Dallas Friday morning attempts to cure what looked like a fatal prognosis a week earlier. Prospect Medical Holdings, the LA-based hospital chain operator, sought court permission to close the safety net hospitals in Providence and North Providence by the end of the year amid delays in the sale to a new owner. 
The $80 million sale of the hospitals to The Centurion Foundation received conditional approval from state regulators in June 2024. Despite multiple revisions to the 85 conditions, the Atlanta-based nonprofit remains unable to secure the $150 million in bond financing needed to close the deal.
Meanwhile, Prospect, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January, continues to rack up losses on the hospitals to the dismay of its many creditors.
The compromise: The state will put up half of the $6 million cost to keep the hospitals operating in November, using money from an AG-controlled escrow account funded by private equity firm Leonard Green as part of its 2021 exit from the hospital ownership group. The remainder of hospitals’ November costs will be put up by Prospect’s legal bankruptcy estate.
“Maintaining access to care is critical for the communities that Roger Williams and Fatima Hospital serve, as well as our statewide health care system,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement Friday. “This temporary funding solution will ensure that until the transfer of the hospitals to new ownership, patients will continue to receive care from the dedicated health care professionals at both facilities.”
The two hospitals offer 500 beds between them, including 104 beds for behavioral health patients, which represents more than one-fifth of the state’s behavioral health beds. They accounted for more 50,000 emergency room visits in 2024 and Roger Williams houses the only fully accredited bone marrow transplant unit in the state. 
Providers and elected officials warn that closing the hospitals and laying off its 2,400 workers would have catastrophic consequences for the state’s fragile health care system.
Neronha was initially reluctant to deplete any of the state’s $51.5 million escrow balance, wanting to preserve the money for daily operational costs once a new buyer takes over, according to court filings. But following a day of in-person negotiations with attorneys for Prospect and Centurion in Dallas Tuesday, Neronha softened. 
If the hospitals close, preserving the hospital fund balance becomes meaningless.
“Rhode Islanders are counting on these hospitals for life-saving care, and the Office is committed to keeping them open,” Neronha said Friday. 
‘Rhode Islanders are counting on these hospitals for life-saving care, and the Office is committed to keeping them open,’ Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi in a statement Friday thanked Neronha for his work and attention on a “critical” issue, calling it an “all-hands-on-deck approach.”
The state’s financial contribution won’t be permanent. Under the terms of the agreement, the new buyer will be required to repay Prospect’s estate for the money it is contributing to cover the hospitals’ November expenses, and simultaneously replenish the state escrow account, “or other consideration acceptable to the RI Attorney General.” 
Megan Skinner, a spokesperson for Neronha’s office, said the stipulation is meant to address “a rapidly evolving situation” but did not specify what alternative conditions the AG’s office might impose on a buyer.
“We will keep the public apprised of next steps in this proceeding or any further actions involving the hospitals,” Skinner said in an email Friday afternoon.
Andrew Troop, a New York attorney hired by Neronha’s office to represent the state in the bankruptcy case, stressed the importance of acting quickly during the court hearing Friday.
“What I think everyone is saying very politely is we continue to be off to the races to get to the end, which is a real solution to transfer these hospitals from Prospect to new owners,” Troop said. “Time is of the essence.”
Primed for purchase?  
Centurion appeared for years to be the only interested buyer for the struggling community hospitals. But earlier this week, an alternative option was publicly acknowledged for the first time: Prime Healthcare. 
The California for-profit owns 51 hospitals nationwide including Woonsocket’s Landmark Medical Center. Rhode Island Health and Human Services Secretary Richard Charest, had reached out to Prime within the last couple months to inquire about its interest in buying the hospitals. Charest previously served as CEO and president of Landmark during its bankruptcy and 2013 sale to Prime. 
Noel True, a spokesperson for Prime, confirmed in an email Friday morning that the company’s nonprofit arm, Prime Healthcare Foundation, has begun “rapid assessment” of an acquisition deal at the request of state officials. True declined to provide details on the status of the review.
Otis Brown, a spokesperson for CharterCARE Health of Rhode Island, Centurion’s local subsidiary, did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Friday. Earlier this week, David Wender, an attorney for the foundation, said it may be able to delay bond financing and secure a short-term loan through Bank of America instead, with the goal of closing the sale in early or mid-December.
Chief Judge Stacey Jernigan of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas reiterated her prior frustrations with the delays in closing a deal on Friday morning.
“We’re 10 months into this case now, and as we all know, we had Centurion in place for months, pre-petition,” Jernigan said. “If it’s not going to be them, it’s got to be someone else.”
The United Nurses and Allied Professionals, which represents more than 1,200 union workers across both Roger Williams and Fatima, maintains that Centurion presents the best hope for survival, given that its offer is already on the table. The union is also pressuring a local charitable foundation formerly tied to the hospitals to “return” $6 million in donations to the facilities. CharterCARE Health first asked the unrelated Chartercare Foundation in early October to reimburse the hospitals for donations made before the entities separated in 2014. Its request, backed by state lawmakers, is still pending before the foundation’s board of directors more than one month later. 
An alternate hospital buyer would still need the sign-offs of Neronha’s office and the Rhode Island Department of Health. It took over a year, and multiple failed applications, before Prospect and Centurion secured state regulators’ approval.
An update on the sale proceedings is scheduled for Nov. 18 in Dallas bankruptcy court.

Connecticut does not have the biggest income inequality in the nation, but it ranks among the highest.
The state consistently appears near the top of national rankings for income inequality, often in the top five. According to 2023 U.S. Census data, Connecticut’s Gini coefficient is 0.4989, placing it fourth in the country behind Puerto Rico (0.5338), the District of Columbia (0.5244), and New York (0.5186). The Gini coefficient measures income inequality on a scale from 0 to 1, where higher numbers reflect greater disparity.
The state’s sharp divide stems largely from Fairfield County’s concentration of wealth, contrasted with struggling urban centers like Bridgeport, Hartford and New Haven. While Connecticut’s poverty rate is lower than many states, its top earners make more than 37 times what the bottom 99% earn. This gap fuels deep disparities in housing, education and opportunity, making inequality a defining issue across the state.

(Photo by Lauren McCauley/ Maine Morning Star)The Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives announced his top choice for Maine’s next governor. 
At the former Biddeford Courthouse Friday afternoon, House Speaker Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford) said he is backing Hannah Pingree in next year’s gubernatorial election. 
He said Pingree, who also previously served as the leader of the legislature’s lower chamber and most recently as head of the state’s Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, has the leadership necessary to defend Maine from federal attacks and continue the work the state has done in recent years under a Democratic trifecta. 
“As we watch the dysfunction and cruelty coming from Washington, it’s clear that we need leaders that will stand up for Maine people, for the food assistance they need, for the health care every person deserves, for smart forward-looking policies that will protect our state from climate change,” said Fecteau, who was flanked by roughly 20 current and former legislators. 
“We need someone who will stand up to the Trump administration and the ridiculous ongoing attacks on the most vulnerable Mainers,” he continued. “Hannah Pingree is that person.”
More than 100 current and former state leaders are backing Pingree’s campaign, including former Senate President Mark Eves, former Senate Majority Leader Eloise Vitelli, and current House Majority Leader Matt Moonen, who all spoke at the event.
During her speech, Pingree thanked her friends and colleagues, saying they represent “leaders that know what it takes to govern, to listen and to deliver real results for the people who they serve.”
Late last week, Pingree was also endorsed by a broad coalition of health care providers and two former commissions of the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, Brenda Harvey and Jeanne Lambrew. This came after she published an op-ed in the Portland Press Herald outlining her plan for a public health insurance option that she argues could lower premiums and ensure accountability to patients.
Fecteau and Pingree spoke about the need to address rising costs, especially for housing, so that Maine can continue to be a place people want to live and work. As part of her campaign, Pingree has been on a statewide housing tour to identify solutions for the state’s housing shortage and affordability challenges. She plans to make stops throughout western Maine this month, including Rumford, Bethel, Norway and South Paris.
Pingree, who is the daughter of 1st District U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, will first face a crowded primary with plenty of name recognition in June. Other Democrats vying for the Blaine House include former Senate President Troy Jackson, current Secretary of State Shenna Bellows and the son of one of Maine’s U.S. senators, Angus King III.
The gubernatorial primary will be ranked-choice, though November’s general election is not. Asked if he would be making other endorsements, Fecteau said that if this were the NFL draft, Pingree would be “his top five picks.”

Ned Lamont to file papers today to run for third term,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/07/ned-lamont-governor-third-term/,"Ned Lamont, a Democrat who has left no question of his intention to run for another term as governor, still plans a formal public kickoff.","Gov. Ned Lamont is filing papers Friday that will make him an official, if still unannounced, candidate for governor, an anticlimactic start to a campaign for a third term as Connecticut’s 89th governor in 2026.
Lamont, 71, a Democrat who had left no question in recent months of his intention to run while lining up a manager and a campaign consultant, still plans a formal public kickoff, a spokesman said.
The creation of a campaign committee is a step allowing Lamont to begin making expenditures and accepting contributions, though the independently wealthy governor has largely self-funded his previous campaigns.
By state law, he will be a candidate the moment his papers are filed with the State Elections Enforcement Commission. 
Lamont said at a press conference Friday that there would be more details about the plans for the campaign next week.
“[Lt. Gov.] Susan [Bysiewicz] and I are ready to go,” he said.
Asked why they waited so long to file, Bysiewicz said they were waiting for municipal elections to end.
“We had some really impactful municipal elections, and we’re glad they’re over with,” Bysiewicz said. “The people of Connecticut have spoken very loudly, and now we can think about what’s next.”
Lamont backed into his campaign for a second term with a similar filing Nov. 8, 2021, though he initially confused reporters then by saying the filing “facilitates” his getting into a campaign, but he’s got to “make up my mind formally in the months to come.”
Bysiewicz quickly clarified they were running at the time.
On the form he is filing Friday, Lamont must choose if he once again will opt out of the state’s voluntary system of publicly financing campaigns.
The public grants for a gubernatorial race are $3.2 million for a primary and $15 million for the general election. Lamont spent $15.1 million on his 2018 campaign and $25.7 million on his 2022 reelection.
Lamont could face a primary. Rep. Josh Elliott, D-Hamden, opened a gubernatorial campaign over the summer, saying the governor is too conservative on taxes and spending.
The contenders for the Republican gubernatorial nomination are Sen. Ryan Fazio, 35, of Greenwich and Mayor Erin Stewart, 38, of New Britain. Fazio opened his campaign in August, and Stewart has been raising money through an exploratory campaign committee since January.
“Gov. Lamont’s first eight years in office have seen Connecticut’s electricity rates rise to the third highest in the nation and our economic growth plummet to fourth worst in the country,” Fazio said in a Friday press release. “Two terms are more than enough.”
Connecticut, which has no term limits, is one of only 13 states that allow a governor to seek three consecutive terms. Over the summer and into the fall, Lamont had been a running a soft campaign, holding events publicizing the state’s fiscal stability and economic growth. 
A month ago, he acknowledged in an interview he soon would have to have to shift to outlining a third-term agenda.
“You can’t sit around and talk about the past,” he said. “That’s for damn sure.”

The state’s final ResilientCoasts plan, unveiled on Thursday after a draft strategy was released earlier this year, calls for such a program to be stood up within three to five years, once a study currently underway is completed.  
Talk of a statewide buyout program has been bubbling up from the shores of coastal communities battered by storms — and bedeviling state and local officials who recognize the economic risks posed by increased flooding resulting from a warming planet but balk at the political and logistical hurdles of roping off sections of shoreline property for human living.  
Now, those tradeoffs are set to ramp up as the state pursues the buyouts, a form of managed retreat in which people, buildings, and infrastructure are relocated from hazardous areas. 
“There was a lot of enthusiasm for this as an option during our public engagement process,” Deanna Moran, chief coastal resilience officer at the state Office of Coastal Zone Management, said in an interview in Chelsea where the plan was announced. “It really does come down to both community choice and also individual choice. It’s a voluntary program, so the homeowners who want to participate are the ones for which it would be available.” 
Other states, like New Jersey, have established buyout programs to keep residents out of harm’s way and allow them to relocate with some free will and with payments resembling the fair market value of their homes — before the seas swallow up what is for many people their largest investment.  
Doing so, however, isn’t cheap. Massachusetts will likely need to confront a hefty price tag if it is to help make residents whole who are living on eroding cliffs in Nantucket or in low-lying flood-prone areas in Marshfield or Winthrop, for instance. And forbidding development on certain properties or moving people away from their homes could also disrupt the local tax base. 
“That’s one of the things that we’ll be looking at in the study,” Moran said. 
Still, all of it may be worth it to avoid the economic consequences of sky-high insurance rates and communities upended as a result of the encroaching ocean.  
Every $1 invested in resilience and disaster preparedness can yield up to $13 in cost savings, according to the report, which was prepared by the state’s Office of Coastal Zone Management. And the state could experience over $1 billion in coastal property damage each year by the 2070s, the report found.  
“Sitting around doing nothing is going to cost more than taking action,” said Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Rebecca Tepper.  
Massachusetts will now be forced to confront these and other thorny issues.  
The plan also calls for the state to adopt flood risk disclosure requirements so that would-be homebuyers and renters are aware of the property’s potential flood risks — something that Gov. Maura Healey proposed in her environmental bond bill but could face resistance from the real estate industry. Massachusetts is one of just 14 states not to require flood disclosures.  
The plan establishes 15 coastal resilience districts ranging from Cape Cod to the Boston Harbor Islands to Buzzards Bay and the North Shore, assessing in each the number of structures exposed to flood risk and shoreline type from coastal dunes to salt marshes. Since 2000, Massachusetts has spent $194 million in coastal resilience investments, with the dam and seawall repair and removal program accounting for $66 million in spending.  
But no one expects the scope and scale of past investments to come close to matching the need. “New sources of revenue from a variety of stakeholders including local, state and federal governments and private property owners are needed to meet the full scale of the challenge,” the report said. 
The plan also proposes a statewide home elevation grant or loan program to assist low-income homeowners, incentivize municipalities to prioritize development in higher-elevation areas, prepare guidance for insurance companies to offer discounts for homeowners that undertake resiliency efforts, and give municipalities the authority to raise more money for coastal projects. 
The state’s vision outlined in the new plan is a big lift. So is the harm if sea level rise projections come to pass. 
“People always need to eat,” said John Lucero, general manager of the Chelsea-based New England Produce Center, the largest privately owned terminal market in the country. “That’s why it’s so important to protect this area from flooding. The problem is getting worse. An interruption in service would be absolutely devastating to the region, our economy and the health of 9 million people.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0338-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-07 14:01:55.079404

The site is the most significant site at Chaco Canyon National Historical Park, which Pueblos and advocates say remains under threat from continued oil and gas development, and worry protections could by scaled back by the new administration. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)In a letter Thursday, New Mexico’s congressional delegation continued exhorting U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to change course on plans to rescind federal protections around Chaco Culture National Historical Park.
In 2023, under the Biden Administration, the federal government issued Public Land Order No. 7923, banning further oil and gas development on federal lands within 10 miles of the historic site for 20 years. Advocates celebrated the move, as did numerous tribal governments, as the area around Chaco Canyon holds paramount spiritual and cultural significance for numerous tribes and pueblos.
The delegation’s letter follows an Oct. 30 letter from the U.S. Interior Department to pueblo and tribal governments, announcing that BLM would be considering a revocation of  the land order creating the buffer.
New Mexico’s congressional delegation also issued a statement last week condemning the Trump administration for seeking to remove the protections. Native activists also referenced the threats to Chaco during a protest over forthcoming oil and gas lease sales in the Greater Chaco landscape held Wednesday at the Bureau of Land Management’s Santa Fe office. The delegation also introduced legislation last spring to try to make the buffer zone permanent.
In their letter Thursday, all five members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation, all of whom are Democrats, noted they have been in ongoing communication with Burgum since his confirmation regarding the importance of protecting Chaco Canyon.
“We have invited you to follow in your predecessors’ footsteps and visit New Mexico to conduct robust Tribal consultation and community outreach before taking any action on the existing mineral withdrawal around Chaco,” the letter says. “Tribes are sovereign governments, and you have a legal trust obligation to Tribal leaders to operate with the highest responsibility and trust, which is not reflected by your expedited actions and unclear directions.”
The letter also contends the National Historic Preservation Act requires the Interior department to consult with tribal governmentsin order to consider how the agency’s “actions will affect historic properties.”
“Chaco Canyon is a sacred cultural landscape central to the identity of Tribes throughout New Mexico. The value of this living landscape does not end at the park boundary,” the delegation writes, concluding that “your legal and moral responsibility as trustee to these Tribes requires your direct attention and involvement in this issue and for meaningful engagement with the Tribes before any action is taken.”
At least 10 pueblo governors went to Washington D.C. in September as part of a week of advocacy to press for protections for Chaco.

On Oct. 2, 2025, the Iowa Board of Veterinary Medicine issued an emergency order indefinitely suspending the license of veterinarian Jerry Couchman, 80, who practices in and around Appanoose and Decatur counties.
At the time, the board charged Couchman with five counts of violating laws and administrative rules governing veterinary medicine, and alleged his conduct posed an immediate danger to the public health, safety and welfare.
According to the board, the disciplinary charges stemmed from a report received from a drug distributor alleging Couchman had been ordering a significant amount of xylazine, which the board describes as “a powerful non-opioid sedative commonly mixed with fentanyl for illegal drug use,” as well as ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic with hallucinogenic effects that is categorized as a controlled substance.

The board says it then reviewed Couchman’s drug purchasing records from several drug distributors and determined that between January 2024 and June 2025, Couchman had purchased approximately 1,545 50-milliliter bottles of xylazine, plus 1,128 10-milliliter bottles of ketamine.
On July 7, 2025, the board served Couchman with a subpoena for his veterinary records. According to the board, Couchman responded to the subpoena for his drug log by providing a copy of “a handwritten document created in response to the subpoena that contains some, but not all, of the information required by Iowa’s rules.” Couchman also refused the board’s request that he identify all of his clients, the board alleged.
The board charged Couchman with knowingly assisting a person in unlawfully practicing veterinary medicine; failing to properly document and prescribe controlled substances and prescription drugs; failing to keep adequate records; dispensing controlled substances and prescriptions in cases where he had no valid veterinary-client relationship; and dispensing drugs used by laypersons to provide unlicensed veterinary medical services.
The board also charged Couchman with failing to comply with the requirements of an investigatory subpoena from the board, which the board says impeded its ability to investigate the matter.
Board: Couchman lacked records to support his claims
According to board records, Couchman attempted to explain the “large quantities of ketamine and xylazine” he purchased by asserting that he used the drugs for surgeries on dogs. The board noted that Couchman owned a kennel with approximately 70 bulldogs and also provided veterinary services for other kennels that had 1,100 bulldogs and other mixed-breed dogs.
According to the board, Couchman claimed he also provided the drugs to various dog-grooming services, which he allegedly said might number “anywhere from 1,500 to 2,000 per year,” and claimed to have used the drugs for the neutering or castration of roughly 1,200 to 1,500 horses per year, which would equate to an average of 23 horses per week.
The board alleged Couchman failed to provide records corroborating those claims.
On Nov. 4, 2025, Couchman and the board agreed to resolve the disciplinary case with a settlement agreement that calls for Couchman’s license to be suspended for nine months, after which it will be placed on probationary status for three years.
Couchman must also pay a $3,000 fine and meet at least once with a practice monitor to discuss the settlement agreement and the circumstances that led to the disciplinary action. In addition, he must complete 10 hours of educational training related to controlled substances, veterinary ethics and recordkeeping.
Couchman declined to comment on the case when contacted by the Iowa Capital Dispatch on Friday.
State and federal records indicate Couchman has done business with two Iowa dog kennels accused of “puppy laundering” — a practice that involves a repeat violator routing dogs to an associated kennel that’s operating under a different license so the animals can be sold in jurisdictions that ban the retail sale of dogs from repeat offenders.
In December 2023, a federal inspector from the U.S. Department of Agriculture visited a dog-breeding kennel, in the Van Buren County town of Cantril, that is on property owned by Steve Kruse, one of Iowa’s largest dog breeders. The kennel was operating under a license held by a Kruse associate, Wuanita Swedlund.
The inspector cited the kennel for a number of violations, some of which were tied to the death of six puppies that appeared to have died due to a lack of shelter from the cold.
State records indicate the attending veterinarian for the business at that time was a “Dr. Couchman” who had not “examined dogs or been available when needed.” Board records indicate Jerry Couchman is the only licensed veterinarian in Iowa with that last name.
After the inspection, state officials instructed Swedlund to hire a new veterinarian.

The group gathered at the Plumbers and Pipefitters Local 5405 hall for a panel hosted by Michigan’s 7th Congressional District Democratic Party on impacts of the Trump administration’s policies on local residents. 
One focus of the panel was the impact of layoffs of federal employees — a key piece of the administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE — in Michigan. 
Andrew Lennox, a 10-year Marine Corps veteran living in Hamburg Township who was fired from an administrative position at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, said that he was notified of his layoff in a late-night email in February. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“We’re saving money to help veterans, by firing veterans,” he said. 
Though Lennox was eventually re-hired, he criticized the government providing limited resources — including mental health resources — to veterans being laid off, who already face higher rates of suicide. 
“We risk our lives to further the American ideals. Not that this is a perfect place, but that we can work towards something perfect, that we have the tools and the resources to do it. And then you come home, and that image of truth and justice is just thrown out the window,” Lennox said. 
“The MAGA playbook is to fire, intimidate and harass federal employees,” Kelly added.

Unlike Lennox, Nicole Rice, a former researcher with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Great Lakes Environmental Research Lab in Ann Arbor, did not get her federal job back after being laid off. 
She warned of the bigger environmental impacts that could happen without teams like the one she was laid off from. 
“There’s about 100 employees right now who are scrambling to try to figure out how to continue their research,” Rice said. “Decades of research are sitting inside of that building. Data is being turned off. Satellites are being turned off.”
“We are in the world’s largest freshwater system,” she added. “We are in a vital resource that is becoming more and more scarce across the world.”
“What kind of talented people want to work in a place where you’re not sure if you’re going to get an email?” Lennox continued, noting that VA hospitals train a large proportion of medical professionals — and without job stability, it will harm the health care industry overall. 
But the impacts of federal policies go far beyond layoffs in the 7th District, panelists said.

Mark Zacharda, a third-generation farmer in Shiawassee County, said that the Trump administration’s tariff policy has harmed his family’s farm — specifically their soybean crop, in which China had previously been a major trading partner prior to retaliatory tariffs going into place. 
“Farming has, for a long time, not been a super profitable industry, especially for a smaller scale or mid sized farmer, as we are, but we were getting by for a long time,” he said. “But the past few years, we certainly have been operating in the red, and that’s in no small part, because of the Trump administration policies in the first one, and certainly now in the second one.”
Zacharda noted that many essentials for farming — from fertilizer to replacement parts on machinery —have seen prices more than double because of tariff policies. As for the idea of bringing that manufacturing back to the U.S., he said that globalization has made it a different market than it was half a century ago. 
“This is a modern world,” he said. “Things have shifted. We can’t just snap our fingers and bring all this stuff back, even though we would like to see more here.”
Peggy Vaughn-Payne, executive director of the NorthWest Initiative in Lansing which works towards food access and re-entry services for folks coming out of prison, said that her organization’s staff was more than halved after elimination of funding for Americorps and other jobs programs. She also lost around $300,000 in federal grants from funding cuts. 
“We’re hurting, and we still have people who come to us and call us every day, every week for services,” she said. 
But as much as she said that has impacted her own finances — cutting her own hours and salary, while also trying to keep providing services — Vaughn-Payne said that her heart goes out to the community members losing access to SNAP benefits.

Liam Richichi, chair of the 7th Congressional District Democratic Party, noted early in the panel that the party had extended an invitation to the district’s representative, U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte), who was not present. 
Zacharda also criticized Barrett’s lack of responsiveness to constituents, especially constituents across the aisle from him. 
“Tom Barrett was elected to represent us here in the seventh congressional district, we’re supposed to be able to appeal to him,” he said. “That’s where Tom really dropped the ball, because you’ve got to be listening to everybody.”

McIver’s filing, made on Thursday, is the latest salvo in a battle over how U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials have described the conduct of three New Jersey congress members during an unannounced inspection of Delaney Hall, an immigrant detention facility in Newark, in May. McIver (D-10) is accused of assaulting federal agents during that visit.
“DHS has slow-walked the removal of clearly prejudicial statements, issued new ones, and continued to maintain others on its website,” McIver attorney Lee Cortes said, adding that absent a court order McIver must continue playing whack-a-mole over federal officials’ statements about her.
‘Supposed assault’ at center of charges against NJ congresswoman

U.S. District Court Judge Jamel Semper last month ordered the administration to remove a series of posts made to the Department of Homeland Security’s X account that said McIver and Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-12) and Rob Menendez (D-08) stormed the facility during their May visit.
Body camera and other surveillance footage released in discovery show Delaney Hall officials let the House representatives into the facility for an inspection.
Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (in tan coat) and Reps. LaMonica McIver and Rob Menendez enter a gate to visit Delaney Hall in Newark on May 9, 2025.
The three-count indictment against McIver alleges she assaulted federal officers during a scuffle outside Delaney Hall. McIver has pleaded not guilty.
McIver argues the charges are politically motivated and the prosecution is selective. The court heard arguments over McIver’s motions to dismiss the case on those grounds last month, though Semper has yet to issue a ruling.
McIver’s Thursday letter notes some prejudicial statements about her remain online despite Semper’s order that they be removed, including a May Department of Homeland Security press release that accuses McIver and others of “storming Delaney Hall” and a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement social media post that says McIver “attacked ICE officers.”
The letter also notes that Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman, is quoted in an October Politico article saying Democrats are no longer able to “storm ICE facilities.”
McIver’s attorneys argue the statements are part of a pattern meant to prevent fair trials in criminal cases. U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche has told Semper his office has had trouble getting the Department of Homeland Security to remove posts deemed prejudicial to McIver.
At least one judge has issued an order that threatened sanctions on similar grounds. Last week, U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw filed an order warning federal officials could face sanctions if they continue to make prejudicial statements about Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who administration officials have repeatedly claimed is an MS-13 gang member.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota Supreme Court Chief Justice Jon Jensen has announced he will step down as head of the court when his term ends this year.
Jensen will continue serving as a justice.
“The position of Chief Justice, for me, has not been about a title, it has been about service and making our judicial system as great as it can be,” Jensen told the North Dakota court system in a Wednesday letter. “It has been an honor to serve.”
Jensen was elected chief justice in December 2019 and reelected to another five-year term in 2020. 
In his letter, Jensen highlighted accomplishments but did not cite a reason for not seeking another term. He said one of his priorities as chief justice was growing resources for state district courts.
Jensen noted that the court system has added three new judges and 29 full-time employees under his tenure. District court judge salaries have also gone up by $30,000 since 2021, he added.
The chief justice is selected by a vote of the five North Dakota Supreme Court justices and state district court judges.
Jensen’s predecessor as chief, former Justice Gerald VandeWalle, led the court from 1993 until he decided not to seek another term as chief in 2019, citing his age. VandeWalle retired from the North Dakota Supreme Court in 2023 for health reasons.
North Dakota voters generally elect state Supreme Court justices for 10-year terms. In Jensen’s case, he was appointed by former Gov. Doug Burgum in 2017 to fill a vacancy on the high court left by former Justice Carol Ronning Kapsner, who retired. Jensen was then elected to a 10-year term on the court in 2020.

Democratic candidate for the 7th Congressional District William Lawrence announced his endorsement Thursday by Track AIPAC, noting he was 100% free from donations made by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobbying group. “This campaign will not be taking any AIPAC money and in Congress, I will be a voice and a vote for Palestinian rights,” Lawrence said in a social media post.
On Wednesday, former Maryland Governor and former commissioner of the Social Security Administration Martin O’Malley endorsed Haley Stevens in her bid for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate.
Meanwhile, fellow U.S. Senate candidate Abdul El-Sayed on Thursday announced the endorsement of Bay City Commissioner Chris Runburg.

 
Announcements

Former Michigan House Majority Floor Leader Abraham Aiyash (D-Hamtramck) has filed paperwork to run for Michigan 1st Senate District seat, currently held by state Sen. Erika Geiss (D-Taylor), who cannot run in 2026 due to term limits. Also in the running for the Democratic nomination is Justin Onwenu, who is Detroit’s first director of Entrepreneurship and Economic Opportunity.
Former state Rep. Ryan Berman (R-Commerce Township) on Monday announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination for Michigan’s 13th State Senate District, currently held by state Sen. Rosemary Bayer (D-West Bloomfield). Bayer is not seeking reelection and has endorsed Oakland County Deputy Executive Sean Carlson for the Democratic nod.
Waterford School Board Trustee John Paul Torres has announced he is seeking the Democratic nomination for Michigan’s 11th Congressional District seat, currently held by U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), who is running for U.S. Senate. Torres joins a Democratic field that already includes state Sen. Jeremy Moss (D-Bloomfield Township), Sterling Heights attorney Aisha Farooqi and former Ford Motor Co. engineer Don Ufford, also of Bloomfield Township.

 



Also of note
A poll released on Sunday showed Democrats Bridget Brink and Matt Maasdam, each running for the nomination in Michigan’s 7th Congressional District, leading the incumbent, U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) in head-to-head matchups.
“Despite little name ID for either challenger, they both start out with 4-point leads,” Jim Williams of Public Policy Polling stated in a release.
While Brink led Barrett 45-41 points compared to Maasdam’s 43-39 lead over Barrett, Williams noted that would increase by two points once voters heard more about Maasdam’s background as a former Navy SEAL. Brink saw a one point bump when respondents learned about her background as the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.

When directly pitted against each other, however, the poll found 42% said they prefer Maasdam’s background as a combat veteran and local small businessman, while just 14% said they prefer a career State Department diplomat.
To no one’s surprise, Brink’s campaign used the poll to emphasize her lead in a straight matchup against Barrett as well as her fundraising lead, while Maasdam’s camp touted his biographical advantage as well as dominance with respondents who didn’t support Kamala Harris in 2024.
The Democratic primary, set for Aug. 4, 2026, is just under 9 months away.

The task force charged with assessing State University System efficiencies released a 26-page report that found the University of Central Florida, the school with the largest enrollment, had the lowest cost to produce a degree from start to finish at $46,548, while New College of Florida had the highest at $494,715. New College has the fewest students in the state university system.
Presented to the Board of Governors, the report said the cost of university operating expenses per degree is the “key metric for measuring overall institutional efficiency.”
Universities’ annual operating expenses per student across the system increased from $16,792 in 2017-2018 to $22,217 in 2023-2024, or nearly 25%, not accounting for inflation. The report cites increase in payroll and labor costs as the main cost drivers.

The report tracks the universities’ success in getting students into jobs. For purposes of the report, job placement is defined as those who within a year of graduating with a bachelor’s, earn more than $40,000 annually or are in graduate school.
It found that New College of Florida has the lowest placement rate at 65%, followed by Florida A&M University with 70%. Conversely, Florida Polytechnic University ranks highest in the report for job placement with 81%, followed by University of West Florida with 80% and University of Florida with 79%.
FAMU graduates had the lowest median starting salary in the SUS at $45,800. The next closest is New College at $46,100. Florida Polytechnic had the highest at $66,800, followed by University of Florida at $58,200, each school with emphasis on science and technology. 
There were 657,000 applications to attend Florida universities in 2024, a 41% increase from 2018 when 466,000 students applied.
In 2023-2024, 27% of students took out student loans. That’s compared to 40% of students in 2017-2018.  Tuition did not increase.

The University of Florida had by far the most research revenue generation during fiscal year 2024, with $2.03 billion. The next closest was the University of South Florida at $612 million.
“Really good insight and information, a lot for the universities to take in and consider and note that the BOG also is taking this quite seriously and we know there’s a chance to get better here,” Board of Governors chair Brian Lamb said during the meeting at University of South Florida.
The report is an attempt to bring transparency to the SUS given about two-thirds of the $5.8 billion SUS budget is paid by state dollars. Student tuition accounts for just $2 billion.
New College of Florida spending called into question

The report also stems in part from a dispute between BOG member Eric Silagy and New College of Florida President Richard Corcoran. Silagy claimed New College was spending more than $91,000 annually to educate each student while Corcoran said it was $68,000 annually.
The report’s findings weren’t lost on Silagy Thursday.
“Thank you for your team’s work on this, for pulling together the data, so there can be really no question anymore about what the numbers really are and that’s not an excuse anymore,” Silagy said, a reference to his prior math disagreements with Corcoran.
The report recommended that universities improve budget and financial reporting and suggested requiring universities to track and report on “key metrics.”
New College questions
In September 2024, Silagy questioned the financial future of New College. 
Those questions rose again during the board’s January meeting this year. 
During that meeting, Vice Chair Alan Levine acknowledged during his tenure on the board, balance sheets and other financial metrics were not actively reviewed. He suggested putting together “a more transparent scorecard of university finances and some of the metrics that we look at in terms of cash management and things like that.”

In February, Gov. Ron DeSantis called for a “deep dive” into state universities and looked to eliminate spending that decision makers deemed unnecessary. 
Florida DOGE to ‘deep dive’ into state universities, ‘prune’ ‘ideological study stuff’

“This is the DOGE-ing of our state university system,” DeSantis said in February during a news conference in Tampa announcing the audit. “And I think it’s going to be good for taxpayers and it’s ultimately going to be good for students, as well.”
The report Thursday did not include detailed information about particular programs.
In other business
Also during the BOG meeting, governors extended University of Central Florida President Alexander Cartwright’s contract for another year, through the end of 2026. 
The BOG will vote on University of North Florida President Moez Limayem’s move to be president of University of South Florida during its next meeting. 
SUS Chancellor Ray Rodrigues said he will provide an update on DeSantis’ call to “pull the plug” on H-1B visas in January.
Regarding the safety summit last month, following the shooting at Florida State University, stakeholders recommended universities identify doors without locks and plan to “address these vulnerabilities” and “address rooftop access to ensure these areas are secure.” That comes after Charlie Kirk was killed on a college campus in Utah. His alleged assassin was on a rooftop of an academic building. 
The recommendations also focused heavily on communication protocol in times of emergency. 
Lastly, Lamb did not seek another term as chair of the board. Levine was voted chair for 2026 and Tim Cerio voted vice chair.

Doug McCrory involved Sonserae Cicero in a $300,000 plan to create the agency. Federal investigators are probing their relationship.","In early 2022, Doug McCrory wanted to launch a program to train minority contractors to install heating and cooling systems for schools — and he made it clear who he thought should be involved. 
McCrory, a Democratic state senator from Hartford, called several meetings with the leaders of three Connecticut state agencies to discuss the details, according to emails obtained by The Connecticut Mirror. 
He also invited Jennifer Little-Greer, the director of the Minority Construction Council, and Sonserae Cicero, a nonprofit director who, along with McCrory, is now under federal investigation. 
The state legislature then committed $300,000 in COVID relief funds for an “HVAC training agency” in May 2022 — at McCrory’s behest, one top state official said.
That money was never spent and was eventually returned to the legislature. But McCrory’s orchestration of the plan — and Cicero’s involvement in the discussions — fit a pattern.
Since 2020, records show, McCrory pushed for Cicero and her companies to receive several state grants for education initiatives, economic development programs and other projects. 
Not all of those efforts paid off, but in the span of a several years, Cicero’s businesses went from unknown entities to organizations that netted millions of dollars in taxpayer money.  
It’s not uncommon for state lawmakers to assist their constituents or to direct them to state agencies for help. But McCrory’s work on Cicero’s behalf could be problematic if the two were in a personal relationship, as federal investigators are looking into. 
Cicero did not respond to text messages or emails for this story. McCrory, who has served in the legislature for two decades, also did not answer questions that the CT Mirror sent to him over the course of several days.
McCrory answered a phone call from the CT Mirror on Thursday, but the state legislator said he was too busy to answer questions about the meetings he arranged between Cicero and the commissioners in 2022. 
Gov. Ned Lamont’s policy director at the time, Jonathan Dach, was included on emails regarding the meetings among his cabinet members and McCrory, but a spokesperson for the governor declined to comment for this story on Thursday.
When Lamont was asked at a press conference on Wednesday about the federal corruption probe targeting McCrory, he said people should let the investigation play out. 
“I think this thing is under investigation,” said Lamont, a Democrat who is preparing to announce a campaign for a third term as governor. “Let’s see how things sort out over the course of the next few months.” 
The emails from early 2022 show McCrory repeatedly contacted the commissioners of the state Department of Labor and Department of Administrative Services, as well as the state Office of Workforce Strategy, asking them to work with Cicero and the Minority Construction Council on the HVAC program. 
“I’m respectfully requesting another meeting, as soon as possible, to discuss the direction of the program as a follow to the last meeting you held with SHEBA Consulting and Minority Construction Council,” McCrory wrote to the commissioners in April 2022. “It is imperative that we address the effectiveness of our current apprentice programs as it relates to racial equity and diversity.”
The emails also show that McCrory wanted to be included in all of the discussions between Cicero, Little-Greer and the state agencies. And he found an ally in Michelle Gilman, the commissioner of the Department of Administrative Services, who in the emails appeared eager to help advance his cause. 
Gilman told the other commissioners that the HVAC training program was a “priority” for McCrory, who has served as the chairman of the legislature’s education committee for several years. 
At that time, McCrory was also negotiating with Lamont’s administration over whether the state should spend hundreds of millions of dollars upgrading the HVAC systems in Connecticut schools following the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Gilman, who oversees the state’s school construction grant program, explained that McCrory wanted to create some type of pilot program to make sure minority contractors were capable of securing some of that future work. 
And that is where SHEBA and the Minority Construction Council would come into play, Gilman explained. 
“What I’d like to ask for is your help in discussing options for a pipeline program pilot or connecting the Minority Contracting Council and SHEBA to the trades/education sector to discuss workforce training and growth,” Gilman wrote to the other agency heads in early April, 2022. 
The CT Mirror contacted Little-Greer, the head of the Minority Construction Council, this week to ask how she became involved in the discussions about the HVAC training program with McCrory and Cicero. 
“I wanted to discuss a program. They’re not discussing,” Little-Greer said, referring to Cicero and McCrory. “We’re the Minority Construction Council. It was a program I wanted to get implemented, and I still want to get it implemented.” 
Little-Greer then refused to answer further questions about why Cicero was looped into the meetings, and she asked whether the CT Mirror reporter had money for her to start the HVAC training program. 
“Do you have money that I could implement it?” she asked before ending the phone call. 
Danté Bartolomeo, the state’s labor commissioner, participated in at least one of the follow-up meetings with Cicero and Little-Greer, but she later explained to McCrory that her agency, while involved in apprenticeship programs, did not directly run them. 
“Please remember that CTDOL does not place apprentices in (registered apprenticeship programs), nor do we hire instructors,” Bartolomeo wrote. 
In a separate email, Bartolomeo told Gilman that she and Todd Berch, the state’s apprenticeship director, had numerous connections in the construction trades. But she said she had never heard of SHEBA or the Minority Construction Council. 
“I don’t know Jennifer Little-Green (MCC ED) and Sonserae Cicero (SHEBA CEO),” she wrote. 
The emails show Kelli-Marie Vallieres, the state’s Chief Workforce Officer, was more amenable to the proposal that McCrory was putting forward. 
Vallieres told her staff she was frustrated that she wasn’t more informed about the proposed training program during the first meeting with McCrory in March. 
The Office of Workforce Strategy was a relatively new agency at the time. It was only officially recognized by the legislature the previous year. And Vallieres and her staff said they were eager to become “the go-to agency for workforce development.” 
As a result, Vallieres told Gilman that OWS might be able to create a “pre-apprenticeship program.” And she said that “could attract workers into this field with a ladder to a full apprenticeship.” 
But Vallieres’ staff expressed concerns, as well.
Niall Dammando, her chief of staff, noted that the office might want to avoid anything to do with the state’s school construction program, which at the time was the subject of another federal criminal investigation.
“This might be an area that we want to stay away from. School construction is super politicized,” Dammando wrote, adding that he would reach out to Lamont’s office for advice. 
It’s unknown whether Lamont’s office provided guidance to the staff at OWS and the other agencies. But the emails show that Vallieres continued to schedule meetings with Cicero and Little-Greer as the legislative session wound down. 
Before one of those meetings, Vallieres was informed that Cicero’s company was also partnering on another state grant application for $5 million. And they debated whether she should continue to hold meetings with Cicero on the HVAC program. 
Vallieres decided to keep the lines of communication open, however. 
“Let’s keep this meeting,” she told her staff. “It is focused specifically on a request from Sen McCrory on attracting more minorities to HVAC careers.” 
Vallieres told the CT Mirror that McCrory was responsible for directing the $300,000 that eventually was sent to her office. 
But she said the federal funds were never spent because McCrory didn’t explain his intentions for the money and because her small staff didn’t have the capacity to run another program at the time.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0530_SR_Session_058-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-07 11:58:58.575442

As of Friday morning, the Secretary of the State reported that 788,511 of 2.18 million registered Connecticut voters had their votes counted — either after showing up to the polls on Tuesday, during early voting or through a mail-in ballot. With 99.85% of precincts reporting, 2025 voter turnout was nearly four percentage points above 2021 municipal election turnout.
While the results for this year’s municipal election resulted in a “blue wave,” flipping 29 Connecticut towns and cities to Democrat control, voter turnout for the Democratic primary earlier this year was nearly 3 points below Republican primary turnout. Historically, fewer Democrats have showed up to the polls during primaries than Republicans.
Despite higher voter turnout this municipal election cycle, in some of the state’s most populated areas, less than 10% of eligible voters cast a ballot.
Hartford and Bridgeport saw some of the lowest turnout numbers state-wide, with less than 5% voter turnout in Bridgeport and less than 7% voter turnout in Hartford.
In Hartford, the only races on the ballot were for school board candidates. But in Bridgeport, there were city council races for various districts as well as school board and city sheriff races.
This was the first municipal election with early voting after a law was passed in 2023 creating a system of early voting rules. The law requires 14 days of early voting for general elections.

He said so at the group’s Monday meeting.
“We asked for that position when this committee first started,” Rupnick said during testimony.
But the 16-member task force contains only legislators and legislatively appointed members, none of them representatives from any of Kansas’ four federally recognized tribes.
As Kansas navigates water quality and quantity issues and plans for the future, the state’s Native populations don’t have a seat at the table.
The task force has met five times in rotating locations across the state since its creation through legislation that passed in April, hearing about water quality and quantity issues. It must submit a preliminary report by the end of January and a final report to the governor and the Legislature by the end of January 2027. The document will guide water policy and funding priorities.
There should be Native representation on the task force, Rupnick argued, because of the Winters doctrine, which ensures reservations are vested with the water rights necessary to support tribes’ activities on a reservation.
Rep. Ken Rahjes, an Agra Republican, responded to Rupnick’s concerns, saying if everyone who wanted a seat at the table received one, the task force could fill an arena.
“This is the size that we came up to,” he said
Rahjes, who said he wrote the bill that created the task force, vowed not to limit debate or conversation.
“Just because you don’t have a seat here,” Rahjes said, “doesn’t mean you’re not listened to and being taken care of.”
 
Maximizing sovereignty
The Prairie Band Potawatomi’s goal is to become water sovereign, Rupnick said.
That would involve creating its own water source and treatment plant and factoring in local, state and federal interests. Rupnick highlighted Native water rights, which predate the state of Kansas and have been strengthened through courts and legislation over the past century, as key to understanding how a tribe could become water sovereign.
One way to achieve that goal is with federal action creating a settlement meant to resolve water rights disputes The payments could then be used to create water resource infrastructure on tribal land.
One Kansas tribe, the Kickapoo, is currently negotiating to obtain a Congressionally recognized water rights settlement. It’s at step two in a four-step process.
Tribes must go through pre-assessment, pre-negotiation and negotiation before reaching a settlement and subsequent implementation.
“The federal negotiating process is decades long,” said Stephanie Zehren, special water counsel to the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation.
Of the United States’ 584 federally recognized tribes, 39 tribes — largely in the northwest and southwest — have sanctioned water rights through Congressionally or administratively approved settlements.
“That leaves the vast majority unquantified,” said Zehren. “The fact that a water right is not quantified does not change the fact that it exists.”
Tribes inherently have water rights, Zehren said, which often precede any existing rights. But the federal process is a major undertaking that requires time and money. Often, navigating the checkerboard of governance, which includes tribal, state, municipal and federal jurisdictions, is the best available option for urgent needs.
Government-to-government relationships are much more effective “because we are hamstrung by how much progress we can make,” said Missty Slater, chairwoman of the Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska.
She said the tribe would like to continue its partnership with other governments, including the task force and the state of Kansas, “so when the water comes to us, we might have less work to do to improve its quality.”
Slater said the tribe has taken proactive measures to improve water quality, including treatment, testing and a transition to regenerative farming, which reduces the need for water treatment.
“We are committed, as water is sacred, to doing what we can to make sure all of our water is the highest quality,” Slater said.
Both she and Rupnick said their tribes were considering pursuing a federal settlement.
“I cannot commit to anything right now,” Slater said, “but we are exploring that, as it would maximize our tribal sovereignty.”
Sen. Michael Fagg, an El Dorado Republican, asked earlier in the meeting how much land in Kansas is tribal and didn’t receive a definitive answer. In many ways, tribal land extends beyond the bounds of a reservation, Rupnick said.
Zehren later said that tribes need to be factored into the task force’s work regardless of what percentage of Kansas land is tribal.
“Trying to suggest that in order to protect and preserve these rights in the future requires a quantification is fairly offensive,” she said
The task force’s next meeting is scheduled for Nov. 19.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MG_6246_1-1024x735.jpg,,,2025-11-07 11:58:58.575442

The committee has yet to vote on Robert Chamberlin and James Maxwell, both nominated by Trump in August to fill open federal judge positions in Mississippi’s Northern District. Both are current justices on the Mississippi Supreme Court. 
The committee also has not taken up Trump’s nominations in early July of Scott Leary and James Kruger, his choices for U.S. attorney for the Northern and Southern districts of Mississippi, respectively. Leary declined to comment. None of the other three nominees responded to a request for comment. 
The committee must vote to advance the nominees before the full U.S. Senate can consider them. The committee has met several times, including on Thursday, and has not voted on the nominees. 
The committee cancelled its Oct. 23 executive business meeting entirely when the four men were the only nominees the committee was to consider that day.
A spokesperson for Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley told Mississippi Today that the delay in advancing the Mississippi nominees out of committee is unrelated to the nominees themselves. 
“They’re caught up in a dispute between on-committee and off-committee senators,” the spokesperson said. “The chairman will plan to advance them when the issue is resolved.”
Most judicial nominees receive committee votes within a couple of weeks of their confirmation hearings, depending on the Senate schedule. The delays involving the Mississippi nominees are unusual because the committee has repeatedly delayed voting on them without explanation. 
Both of Mississippi’s U.S. senators, Roger Wicker and Cindy Hyde-Smith, support the nominees’ confirmation and spoke in support of them at the confirmation hearing.

(Photo: Getty Images)A government shutdown that lasts beyond November would be “incredibly harmful” to efforts to provide safe and affordable housing to the nation’s most vulnerable citizens, U.S. Rep. Alma Adams (NC-12) said Thursday.
The record-breaking government shutdown has already been “devastating” for citizens who have trouble accessing healthcare and food assistance or paying rent, Adams said.

“We’re talking about thousands of residents who will not be receiving the essential rental assistance payments that they’re due and unhoused people will not receive the housing support that they need,” said Adams, adding that she hopes the shutdown doesn’t go beyond next week.
Adams noted the threats the shutdown poses to U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) rental assistance programs such as Housing Choice Vouchers, Projects-Based Rental Assistance and public housing. Citizens who receive such assistance are expected to have rent paid through November.
But assistance from HUD will come more slowly due to Trump administration-ordered firings and furloughs, Adams said. Since January, roughly 2,300 HUD employees have been laid off, she said, and staffing at HUD’s Fair Housing Office has been “significantly reduced,” which gives citizens less recourse to address housing discrimination.
“People who need that kind of support from those agencies, will continue to face delays in receiving the services, because if you go into an agency and you fire half the people, then the people who are depending on getting access to services, they don’t have access to a person who can help them, so that becomes a problem as well,” Adams said.
She said Congress must come together and pass a bipartisan solution to the problem, because “people need housing, people need health care and we’ve got the resources to take care of both.” 
The congresswoman made her remarks during the final installment of her “Charlotte Matters” webinar series, which was put together to discuss how the government shutdown is impacting Charlotte and the rest of North Carolina. Previous topics included healthcare, education and hunger. 
Adams said President Donald Trump is being dishonest when he says there’s no money to provide America’s most vulnerable citizens decent housing, health care and food assistance.
“You’ve got money to send $40 billion over to Argentina or some other place,” Adams said. “You’ve got money to tear down half of the White House to put up a ballroom.”
Housing, health care and hunger are not partisan issues, Adams noted.
“It’s about being human and everybody needs a decent, affordable place to live,” she said.
 Skyrocketing rents, increasing evictions 
Karen Pelletier (Photo: Screenshot from housing webinar)
Adams was joined by a panel of housing experts and advocates for people experiencing homelessness.
Karen Pelletier, division director of Housing Innovation and Stabilization Services for Mecklenburg County, said the county has been able to help cover rents for about 200 households that receive HUD subsidies.
“We’ve been able to provide that support and continue to pay the salaries of staff that are also federally funded,” Pelletier said. “And so what this shutdown has created is great stress in the community between staff that are wondering when those payments are going to run out, landlords wondering when the rent payments are going to stop.”
She said individuals with long histories of homelessness, seniors, children and other vulnerable citizens who live in subsidized housing programs are now at risk of losing housing because of changes to HUD policy.
O’Shauna Hunter, director of Housing Solutions for A Home for All with the United Way of Greater Charlotte, noted that the Charlotte area has more than 2,000 people who are unsheltered . Evictions are increasing and rents are skyrocketing, she said.

Hunter said more resources are needed to ensure homelessness is “rare, brief and non recurring.” 
“We need case management and support to those who are on their journey to housing stability,” Hunter said. “We need efforts to prevent people from becoming unstably housed or losing their housing, and then we need the production of more housing and all types of housing.”
Latonya Agard, executive director of the North Carolina Coalition to End Homelessness, said she’s concerned about Trump administration plans to end funding for Housing First initiatives, which prioritize providing permanent housing to people experiencing homelessness.

“This is the program that works, the evidence is there, and it is distressing to know that the current administration is deciding not to fund Housing First programs and then to turn to other programs that really do place more obstacles, rather than abilities to help in front of people,” Agard said.
Adams began the housing webinar discussing housing issues in Charlotte, which she said is one of the greatest challenges facing the city. That was true, she said, even before the Trump administration’s “reckless federal cuts to housing and the government shut down.”
She noted that 157 people move to Charlotte-Mecklenburg everyday, which has placed pressures on the region’s housing supply.
“We simply are not building enough housing to meet our housing demand and this, of course, has led to housing prices skyrocketing in the Charlotte region,” Adams said. 










Housing prices in the region have increased 72% since 2017, compared to 41% nationally.


“Charlotte is experiencing a significant rise in gentrification as a result, pushing out residents of historically Black working-class neighborhoods, because they are some of the only affordable locations in our city,” Adams said.
Adams said corporate home ownership continues to be a serious problem. In 2023, 26% of all single family homes in Charlotte were owned by large corporations, she said.
“I believe a home should be a place for you to start a family, build your life, but unchecked corporate housing ownership is really making that less and less attainable for Charlotteans,” Adams said.
She noted that she introduced the American Neighborhood Protection Act to address the problem of mass corporate ownership of housing.
“My bill requires any corporation that owns more than 75 single family homes to pay an additional $10,000 per home annually,” Adams said. “These funds would be placed into a housing trust fund for down payment assistant grants to families who are purchasing homes.”
The law would lower housing costs, increase housing supply and provide financial assistance for families looking to buy a home and start their lives, she said. 
“As Charlotte navigates our housing issues, the government shutdown and federal cuts made this year are only worsening the problems facing our residents,” Adams said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1496483184-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-07 11:58:58.575442

Green International Airport website showed five flights coming from or heading to the Washington, D.C., area were canceled as of Friday morning with delays listed for another nine flights involving various Midwest and East Coast destinations.
The Rhode Island Airport Corporation announced the delays on the first day of major air travel restrictions at about 40 major airports imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to ease pressure on air traffic controllers as the government shutdown continues.
Air traffic controllers have been working without pay since the federal government shutdown began Oct. 1.
T.F. Green was not included on the list of 40 airports but relies on flights to and from many of those major hubs.
Nationwide, the Associated Press reported that more than 800 flights had been canceled Friday.
“Yesterday operations were normal at the airport; today we are experiencing our first flight cancellations,” airport spokesperson Bill Fischer said in a statement issued at 6:26 a.m. “Again, this is a fluid situation that may vary day-to-day as airlines make decisions to comply with the reduction mandate.”
The airport website lists flight arrivals and departures for today and Saturday. One United flight departure and one United arrival connecting T.F. Green to Washington Dulles early Saturday evening were canceled.
“We are urging passengers to continue to check with their airlines regarding flight status before arriving at the airport,” airport spokesperson Bill Fischer said. “Impacted passengers should contact their airline for rebooking options.”

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Bill DeLong knows first hand that people’s beliefs can evolve. Describing himself as a “recovering Republican,” tears welled up in his eyes as he described how after someone close to him came out as gay, he thought, “Wait, have I been on the wrong side this whole time?” 
So when the Biddeford resident heard about U.S. Senate candidate Graham Platner’s controversies, he was initially worried. But now he feels reassured by how the political newcomer has handled it, viewing the fact that Platner has taken responsibility and apologized as a welcomed rarity in politics. 
The daily headlines about the sexist, racist, homophobic and other offensive statements unearthed from Platner’s Reddit history and the candidate’s now-covered tattoo that resembled a Nazi symbol — a connection he denied knowing until recently — may have led many looking from afar to believe that his quick rise was coming to an end. Some of Platner’s opponents in the Senate primary race, former state officials and members of Congress outside of Maine have called for him to drop out. 
But Maine Morning Star’s conversations with left-leaning Mainers across the state show a more complicated picture.
That’s not to say everyone is convinced to back Platner, a 41-year-old from Sullivan who was recruited by labor unions and community groups to run against long-time Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican. But for people like DeLong, who is still entertaining other options, Platner’s past doesn’t change how he’s evaluating his candidacy. 
“People have a past, and the purity politics that the Dems play really irks me,” DeLong said. “The other side doesn’t play by the rules.”

DeLong was one of more than 700 people who turned out on Nov. 2 to an event Platner headlined in Portland, a joint effort to also rally voters against a state referendum that sought to change election laws. Platner, an oyster farmer and veteran, has continued to draw crowds to his town halls and other public events since the controversies have come to light: more than 500 spilling into an overflow room in Ogunquit on Oct. 22, the day he announced he’d covered his tattoo, more than 700 in Damariscotta less than a week later, and a packed house at a 300-capacity theater in Bath Thursday evening. 
The first public polling of the race, based on surveys taken while the revelations were being reported, showed Platner as the frontrunner, with wide margins over Gov. Janet Mills — a candidate DeLong said he’s not considering. 
“I’d like to see politics more in the hands of younger generations of people. It’s not working right now,” he said. If elected, Mills, 77, would be the oldest incoming freshman senator in history. 
Many Mainers said their frustration was only heightened by the fact that Platner’s controversial past came to light shortly after Mills entered the race. Mills is backed by the Democratic establishment in Washington, D.C., and while she’s gained a progressive persona nationally for standing up to President Donald Trump, the governor is known as a moderate Democrat among Mainers. 
While Platner continues to turn out crowds of defiant supporters, conversations beyond those hubs also show there are still Mainers who barely know his name. That includes Democrats and independents who will shape the primary outcome in June, and also Republicans, some who are already certain they’ll be voting for Collins.
Regardless of how they feel about Platner at this moment, Mainers said they want those “from away” to back off. 
“We take care of our own business,” said Freeport resident Phil Moen, a staunch supporter of Platner. “We’ll handle this one, thank you very much. Washington need not apply.”
A story of redemption 
Mainers who remain supportive of Platner painted his story as one of redemption, echoing how Platner’s strategist is approaching the controversies, knowingly or not. 
The first two people in line to hear Platner speak at Portland’s State Theatre last weekend, Dale Stephenson and her husband Frank Smith of South Portland, said they had no reservations about continuing to show up for him. 
“I needed to question this notion of: Is he authentic or not?” Smith said. “When I heard his responses, I mean, he owned what happened. He dealt with it honestly. He didn’t misdirect or obfuscate, and I think that says a tremendous amount for an individual, especially politicians.”
Stephenson said of his past Reddit posts, which spanned Barack Obama’s presidency into Joe Biden’s, “He was much younger then. He’s been honest and owned up to the things that he’s done and felt remorse for. You’ve got to respect that. I don’t hold it against him.”
Some Mainers said regrettable online comments and thoughtless tattoos may be par for the course if Maine wants to elect someone who hasn’t been a more calculated career politician.
“Everyone has skeletons,” Phil Moen said. “There are things that I did at that age that I was certainly not happy about and not proud about.”
His wife, Cathy Moen, chimed in, “Thank God we lived before the internet and social media.”

Adding to anecdotal evidence in Maine, a Democratic win in Virginia in the Nov. 4 election may suggest the party is in a post-cancellation era, as Politico put it. Virginia voters selected Democrat Jay Jones for their attorney general despite his scandal of sending violent text messages about political rivals. 
Some of Platner’s past Reddit posts suggested violence is necessary for political change. In one, he wrote, “an armed working class is a requirement for economic justice.”
Platner has attributed many of his past comments to disillusionment after his time serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, which Cathy Moen brought up when defending the candidate. 
“How dare someone criticize somebody with the military background that he has, the things that he saw,” she said. 
Outside the polls after casting votes in the Nov. 4 election, several voters told Maine Morning Star they already knew their next vote would be for Platner in the Senate primary in June 2026. 
“Everyone has a history,” said Doug White, a Democrat from Poland. “In the current presidency, nothing’s off the table.”
Although, White said he is concerned about the turnover in Platner’s staff. Several have resigned since the controversies came to light, including his national finance director Ronald Holmes III who said he felt his “professional standards” were “no longer fully aligned with those” of Platner’s campaign.
Gabby Riggieri, an independent from Oxford, said she isn’t writing Platner off because she believes people can be a product of who they are surrounded by.
“When you’re around other people, you might feel differently,” Riggieri said. 
That’s the story Platner himself has told, specifically when it comes to his past use of anti-gay slurs, which were among the most recent of his Reddit comments between 2016 and 2021, after his military service but during his time as a military contractor in 2018. 
“These were words that I used for a long time in ways that I did not take seriously,” Platner told The Advocate, which first reported those posts. “Because of personal relationships that I’ve developed over the years, I do not use [them] now and find [them] to be quite offensive.”
Not all are convinced 
Others don’t think voters should accept Platner’s offensive comments. 
Jordan Wood, the only gay candidate in the Senate race, called for Platner to resign. Wood previously told Maine Morning Star he thinks the worst thing the Democratic Party can do “in the opposition to Donald Trump is somehow give permission to looking lightly on what I believe are both offensive and threatening symbols and words.”
Other high profile LGBTQ people in Maine politics have also been critical of Platner.
Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford), the youngest and first openly gay person to serve in the position, weighed in with an Instagram story, pointing out that Platner deleted his Reddit comments before launching his bid “because they were considered a liability.”
“It is on us as primary voters to determine how much or how little we care about this liability he tried to avoid anyone knowing about,” Fecteau wrote in the post, which disappears after 24 hours. 
On Facebook, former State Treasurer Henry Beck wrote that voters should care about it. “If Graham Platner was a Republican, so many of us would be protesting in the streets for his resignation,” he wrote.
In another post, Beck said he’s not interested in excusing Platner’s past comments because he knows people who fought in the same wars, and “they all seemed to have known better and had better self-awareness, restraint and a genuine caring for fellow men important in their life who happened to be gay.” 










People have a past, and the purity politics that the Dems play really irks me. The other side doesn’t play by the rules.


– Bill DeLong of Biddeford


Mills said she “vehementally disagrees” with Platner’s past comments and “abhorrent tattoo,” but hasn’t said he should drop out. 
“What he should do in the future is not my business,” she said. “It’s up to the people.”
When Politico asked Platner’s strategist Morris Katz if he should have weighed Platner’s online history differently before launching the campaign, Katz essentially echoed Mills’ statement. 
“I think these decisions should be made by voters and not ‘What do five a*****s in D.C. think is disqualifying and not,” Katz said. “Because I think if we’ve learned anything from having lost the White House, lost the Senate, and lost the House, it’s that maybe the people who’ve been in these positions of power don’t have the greatest read in the world on what voters care about.”
Sophie Creamer, a 25-year-old who has organized for LGBTQ+ issues in the state, wants Platner to explain how and why his views changed over time to assure voters that he doesn’t still harbor any of those beliefs.
An independent absentee voter who grew up in Brunswick and now attends college in Massachusetts, Creamer first spoke with Maine Morning Star shortly after Platner’s campaign launch at his Labor Day rally with Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders. Then, Creamer said they feared he could be another John Fetterman, the plainspoken former steel town mayor who has walked back his progressive stances since Trump was reelected.
“I’m feeling a little wary about this rural white man,” Creamer said of Platner when Maine Morning Star followed up recently. “I don’t know his experience. I don’t know who he is as a person, but with the recent controversies, I just feel more — what’s the right word — frustrated? No. On the fence, I suppose.” 
But Creamer isn’t entertaining other candidates. Through their work in state-level organizing, Creamer has closely followed Mills as governor and disagrees with many of her stances, including her opposition to closing the state’s youth prison and piecemeal approach to tribal sovereignty. “I don’t agree with her more reformist tendencies,” Creamer said. “I’m definitely more radical.”
If it comes down to Platner and Mills, Creamer said they’d vote for Platner. Dresden resident Alfred Beattie, a registered Democrat who leans more left, is considering the opposite. With Mills, he said he knows what he’s going to get. 
Beattie, a music teacher and freelance sound engineer, also heard Platner speak at the Labor Day rally. After that, he said he had thought his mind was made up. He liked that Platner didn’t speak like a politician and understood the average working person’s struggles. 
But when Maine Morning Star followed up with Beattie after the controversies came to light, he said, “I’m not looking forward to the amount of work that I’m going to have to do” to decide who to vote for.
Beattie found some of Platner’s past comments to be “pretty deplorable stuff,” he said, but he left space for redemption. “I’m not seeing it as a collapse of Platner’s character,” he said. For him, the offensive posts and tattoo underscored just how “green” Platner is.
Beattie is considering other candidates, such as Wood, but he said he may ultimately back Mills. “She’s been through the ringer,” Beattie said. “She knows how to deal with this kind of stuff. He doesn’t have any experience.”
In Beattie’s view, he said, “What we need to change anything right now is just a Democratic majority.”

Is the movement bigger than the person?
Platner’s candidacy is not just about flipping the Senate for the Democrats, or beating Collins, so he’s said. 
“We are going to build power again with working people,” Platner said at the Nov. 2 rally in Portland. “We are going to build power again in our communities.”
That’s already started. 
While Platner headlined the event, it was organized to rally people against Question 1, a referendum Maine voters ultimately rejected days later that sought to require identification at the polls and remove several means of absentee voting. 
In the lead up to the Nov. 4 election, volunteers, including those who signed up at that event, canvassed under Platner’s campaign against the referendum. According to his campaign, they contacted more than 40,000 voters during more than 2,000 canvassing shifts all over the state.  
While Platner often repeats that the extent of his political career was serving as harbormaster of Sullivan, he has years of experience in grassroots organizing, previously leading efforts through a local progressive political group called Acadia Action. 
As Phil Moen waited for Platner to take the stage, he said Platner’s past is not what he or others should be focused on.
“It absolves people from actually thinking about the issues,” he said. “We can’t do that anymore.”
Beyond Question 1, Platner also used his speech to call on the crowd to support food assistance since the federal government withheld payments during the government shutdown. 
“The federal government is not going to show up and save food banks in Maine, not now. We’ve got to do something vastly different in our politics before that happens again,” Platner said. “We need to make up the difference.”
Food donations were collected at the event for the food hub on Preble Street and monetary donations for the Midcoast Hunger Prevention Program, Platner announced to a cheering crowd, also urging people to continue to support their local food banks. 
“Hopefully, in all of this work,” Platner said, “we are going to learn that we all need each other, and that it is in each other, it is in the people of Maine that we are going to find the energy, we are going to find the time, we’re going to find the solidarity to build the power we need to change politics in this country.”
Phil Moen said if another candidate were to come out with a more enticing message than Platner, he’d pay attention, “but that’s a high bar.”

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)We may think of a government shutdown as something that happens in Washington, with gridlock between legislators, press conferences on the U.S. Capitol steps, and federal agencies grinding to a halt. But after more than a month of the federal government lacking operating funding, the impact is no longer confined to images from the District of Columbia.
The effects of this shutdown are reaching into every New Hampshire community and altering our state’s economy.
First, the federal government shutdown is hitting many Granite State workers directly in their wallet. For thousands of Granite Staters, the shutdown isn’t a distant debate; it results in a missed paycheck. About 9,100 federal jobs are based in New Hampshire, and those jobs paid close to $1 billion in wages last year. Even when paychecks stop coming, bills and other expenses don’t.
Second, the shutdown has already put a key resource for thousands of Granite Staters at risk. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, helps approximately 76,000 New Hampshire residents buy groceries each month. That’s about one in every 19 people in the state and includes 26,000 children. But as of Nov. 1, those benefits ended as previously transferred federal funds for the program ran out. The impact of this disruption to food assistance is being felt in rural areas in particular, as nearly two-thirds of New Hampshire’s SNAP recipients live outside the state’s five most populous communities.
Finally, with a prolonged federal government shutdown, the strain can spread through the state’s economy. The impacts of missed paychecks don’t stop at household budgets. A federal worker who can’t afford gasoline or groceries means one less customer at a small business.  SNAP dollars move quickly through New Hampshire’s economy: an estimate from 2021 indicated the economy missed out on the approximately $1.61 in economic activity for every dollar in SNAP spending. When SNAP spending stops, it doesn’t just hurt families — it impacts local grocers, farmers, food suppliers, and other Main Street businesses. Uncertainty can be a drag on economic activity, as families pull back on spending, and businesses hold off on hiring. The result is slower growth and fewer opportunities.
While the federal government shutdown centers around Washington, the impacts are felt in every state in the country, including right here in New Hampshire.
In 2024, the federal government awarded $14.8 billion in contracts, grants, and direct payments for work and services in New Hampshire, or the equivalent of about 12% of the state’s entire economy. Federal funds support child care, housing, transportation, public health, and education among other critical services. When that federal support becomes unreliable, New Hampshire has to either pick up the slack or risk weakening or stopping key programs, potentially leaving thousands of Granite Staters further behind.
Even when the federal shutdown ends, federal support may not be as reliable going forward as previously assumed. To keep our families and economy stable, lawmakers could build more fiscal resilience so that critical programs and local economies can withstand future external shocks.
A government that is able to serve Granite Staters in a reliable manner, even if resources from Washington are unreliable, can offer greater certainty for the state’s economy and residents.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/capitolsunsetsept302025-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-11-07 10:59:09.491231

But after months of heated debate, the ballot measure to fund the project was voted down by the community. Some say the outcome is a testament to how limited fiscal capacity, insufficient state funding, and local tax constraints work to prevent Gateway Cities from building equitable, modern school fac[...]","ON AUGUST 25, over 500 middle school students in Holyoke filed into the newly built William R. Peck Middle School – the first new public school built in the city since 1989 – to start their first day of classes.  
The facility’s modern amenities – a science lab stocked with 3D printers, a media center with a library that will soon be filled with books, and a new fitness center – are providing learning and enrichment opportunities to kids in one of the state’s most disadvantaged school districts, where nearly 84 percent of students are low-income and 90 percent are considered high-need. 
The expansive courtyard, newly constructed classrooms, large windows, and wide, spacious hallways are just some of the brand-new building’s features.

“There’s a sense of pride that kids have when they walk into Peck. Like, ‘Oh my god, my community cares about me,’” said Anthony Soto, interim superintendent of Holyoke Public Schools.  
But as those students enjoy a state-of-the-art facility, the other half of the district’s middle school students aren’t so lucky. Instead, they file into Clare P. Sullivan Middle School, a building constructed in 1961 that was originally built as an elementary school. 
In 2019, Holyoke set out to build two new middle schools for all of the students to replace their dated facilities. After months of heated debate, the ballot measure to fund the project was voted down by the community, and the city was forced to continue with the construction of just one school – all they could afford. Some say the outcome is a testament to how limited fiscal capacity, an insufficient state funding formula, and local tax constraints work to prevent Gateway Cities like Holyoke from building equitable, modern school facilities. 
But many community members and local officials also argue that racial bias has long prevented the city from investing in its public schools, and it wasn’t the first time property tax overrides have been divisive for the community.  
Former superintendent Stephen Zrike, who led the district at the time of the 2019 debt exclusion, lamented the fact that only half of Holyoke’s middle school students ended up in a new building.

“I’m sure it creates inequities that I know many people in Holyoke would like to see addressed,” Zrike said. “All those kids deserve the state-of-the-art schools that more affluent districts have around the state.” 
The Massachusetts School Building Authority’s 58 percent reimbursement rate for the 2019 construction plan for two new middle schools fell short of the 80 percent guaranteed in state law. The city’s anticipated contribution of $54 million for the nearly $130 million project required an increase in local property taxes. The total cost of the new Peck school was $85 million, with the MSBA ultimately reimbursing 68 percent of project expenses.  
The state has generally failed to meet the 80 percent contribution outlined for urban districts, which have, on average, received a smaller share of their statutory reimbursement rate than suburban districts, according to an October report by the MassINC Policy Center. (The MassINC Policy Center is part of the same organization that publishes CommonWealth Beacon.) The report also found that wealthier districts accounted for a disproportionate share of school building projects approved by the MSBA over the last decade.

Proposition 2½, a 1980s-era state law asserting that property tax levies in cities and towns can’t rise faster than 2.5 percent per year, ultimately required the city of Holyoke to go to local voters to approve or reject a debt exclusion – a temporary increase in the tax levy that allows a city to borrow for a specific capital purpose – to fund the construction of both schools in 2019. The measure was defeated by a two-to-one margin. 
City officials, school leaders, and some residents assert that decades of racial bias and poor perceptions of Holyoke’s public schools played a role in the failed debt exclusion. More than 81 percent of students in the district are Latino, and less than 11 percent of its middle school students met or exceeded expectations on statewide MCAS exams in 2025.  
“There might have been, over the course of our history, some institutionalized and structural racism involved in the disinvestment in our school district,” Mayor Joshua Garcia said. 
A Proposition 2½ override vote in 1992 similarly caused controversy in Holyoke. The proposed tax increase for schools failed, while increases for other city departments passed.  
“Our schools are becoming predominantly Hispanic, and we’re seeing these kids get out of school – for the most part, they’re not doing anything,” a Holyoke police officer said during a 1992 news segment. “The people that are paying the bill are not Hispanic and are looking at it saying, ‘Why should we be paying to have some kids that can’t even speak English when they get out of school?’” 
Three decades later, local leaders say not much has changed.  
“This stuff that you heard back then you still hear today. Voting down those two buildings is when it reared its head again,” Soto said. “You have that loud minority that’s saying, ‘Why do we have to build schools for these kids?’”

While overall voter turnout was just 29 percent in the 2019 local election, the two highest-income wards in Holyoke had the largest turnout at 40 percent and 46 percent. Both wards voted the measure down by three-to-one and two-to-one margins.  
More than 400 students per year have been opting out of the Holyoke school system through school choice, according to the district. The students who leave are far more likely to identify as white and far less likely to identify as low-income. Those students most often choose to attend Easthampton Public Schools, where two new school facilities have been built.  
“In Holyoke, there’s a lot of homeless families, there’s a lot of families who are renters … These folks are recent arrivals, they’re immigrants. But those kids deserve a brand-new school as much as anybody,” Zrike said. 
Latasha Hinton, a mother of two middle school students in Sullivan, said her children feel left behind, and have asked if they can attend the new Peck school.  
“For a kid, it kind of feels like, ‘How come we don’t deserve the same thing?’” Hinton said. “They didn’t do anything to not deserve to have everything that is in that new middle school. They kind of feel like they don’t deserve it, and they want to know why.” 
The school library in Sullivan had to be converted into classroom space – a key learning feature Hinton said her daughter misses out on. The hallways are narrow, and other amenities are dated. The school was built for elementary school students, meaning building features like the cafeteria stage are smaller in size.

Hinton wasn’t surprised when the plan to build two schools was voted down. She even considered leaving the district like other families did, she said. 
The city, in partnership with the MSBA, has spent millions in the last few years on repairs and upgrades to Sullivan, including new windows, doors, roofing, and heating and cooling systems. The district has also made efforts to provide more amenities at Sullivan, such as an outdoor basketball court. But some have argued that investing in dated buildings that already don’t meet modern needs may not be the most efficient use of public funds.  
“If we wanted to do a complete renovation project for this school through the MSBA to bring it up to code, it would cost just as much money as tearing it down completely and building brand new,” Soto said of Sullivan.

According to the MassINC report, Gateway Cities have been significantly underrepresented in the MSBA’s Core Program, which distributes large grants to help districts build new schools or fully replace or renovate existing buildings. The authority approved Core Program awards for an average of 17 projects each year between 2008 and 2024 – a pace that would take nearly 50 years to rebuild all 276 high-need schools in Massachusetts. 
“There’s huge risks in not investing in the … program that the MSBA has,” Zrike said. “That was a concern we had all along – that it didn’t matter what you did to Sullivan or any other school. It wasn’t going to provide the same facility that a brand-new school would provide.”

The MSBA’s funding is tied to sales tax revenue growth, which has not kept pace with the rising cost of school construction in Massachusetts. State law also places a cap on the authority’s borrowing authority, which was raised to $1.2 billion in the 2024 state budget. 
Five of Holyoke’s 11 schools received low building condition ratings in a 2016 MSBA survey, yet just one has been rebuilt since then.  
Without “more money in the pot,” school leaders like Soto are skeptical that the MSBA can keep up with the need for modernized buildings in Gateway Cities like Holyoke. Tweaking the formula to require 80 percent reimbursement in urban districts without increasing the MSBA’s overall spending authority would only further limit the number of projects they can fund, he said.

Debt exclusions and overrides aren’t easy to pass in low-income cities like Holyoke with limited room to generate tax revenue, and as construction costs have soared following the pandemic, Zrike estimates it has become even harder. Even in a world where Proposition 2½ didn’t exist, Soto said Holyoke would still be between a rock and a hard place. 
“If it goes to a vote, it won’t be successful, and if it didn’t have to go to a vote, and it was just a mayor’s choice, at some point families are going to move out of Holyoke because they can’t afford it,” he said. “It would still be an increase in in taxes to the local community who doesn’t have much.” 
The district has struggled with staff retention, which Soto believes better building conditions could help solve.  
“A community investing in those spaces I would imagine has an impact on a teacher being like, ‘I want to work here and stay here,’” Soto said. “That has an impact on student outcomes.”

School conditions also matter to parents deciding which districts to send their kids to, Zrike said. Desegregating the urban district and increasing enrollment depends on its ability to build facilities that families want to choose.  
“The building doesn’t teach kids directly, but I do think it sends really important messages to kids and families about how much a community values education,” Zrike said.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/outside-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-07 10:59:09.491231

(Photo courtesy of Great Plains Food Bank)The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services said some North Dakota residents enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will be able to access partial November benefits as early as Friday.
The program started the month without funding due to the ongoing federal government shutdown. A federal judge last week ordered the executive branch to resume at least partial benefits. On Thursday, the same judge directed the President Donald Trump administration to fully fund the program for November.

“We know how important these benefits are to families and individuals across North Dakota,” Interim Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Pat Traynor said in a Thursday evening announcement. “Our team has been working diligently to update systems, recalculate benefits and ensure households receive their adjusted benefits as quickly as possible.” 
The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services is distributing partial benefits to the roughly 28,000 North Dakota households on SNAP based on a formula set by the federal government that funds the program at 65%.
Under that formula, some households will receive less than their typically monthly benefit and some will receive no funding, according to the agency.
The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services acknowledged in the Thursday announcement that the formula could soon change given the judge’s recent court order. 
The agency said it is “prepared to comply with any new federal guidance from the USDA pending the outcome of ongoing court proceedings and once systems are updated.”

North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong last week announced the state had granted $915,000 to the Great Plains Food Bank to address food insecurity amid the funding distribution.
The federal government is now also fully funding the Women, Infants and Children program for November. North Dakota had previously planned to use $600,000 in Department of Health and Human Services general fund money to sustain the program through the month if no federal money was available.

John Cavanaugh picked up two more endorsements from local unions in his bid to be the Democratic nominee in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District.
The two endorsements came from the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen and the Nebraska State Legislative Board and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. This brings Cavanaugh’s union endorsements to six.
Cavanaugh is in a six-person Democratic primary race with business owner and political action committee co-founder Denise Powell, Douglas County District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades, Navy veteran Kishla Askins, former congressional staffer James Leuschen and Evangelos Argyrakis. 
The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen chairman, Adam Hausman, said Cavanaugh “has consistently stood up for organized labor and advocated for rail safety.”

“John has been a true friend of labor and consistently fights for workers,” said Hausman, “Labor can trust him to keep his word and do right by us.” 
Cavanaugh has also received endorsements from seven current state lawmakers and Bob Kerrey and Ben Nelson, who served as Nebraska governors and U.S. senators. Rhoades received an endorsement from Omaha Mayor John Ewing 
Rhoades has announced the endorsements of three local unions and said she is working to get more by year’s end.  
Powell has received endorsements from an influential abortion-rights group, former Omaha State Sen. Tony Vargas and two state lawmakers. 
The Omaha-based 2nd District is typically competitive. But Democrats are feeling optimistic about picking up a win in the midterms, when the out-of-power party typically gains ground, especially with Republican U.S. Rep. Don Bacon retiring.
Cavanaugh said he has “stood with labor and working people in the legislature and will do the same in Washington.”
Cavanaugh, in a statement, said, “I promise that I won’t just be at your union hall during election season, but will show up and listen to you at every turn.”

After months of negotiations, the governor and state lawmakers have reached compromise on a new version of sweeping housing legislation, which they’re expected to take up in a special session next week.
The replacement for House Bill 5002, which passed the legislature in June but was then vetoed by Gov. Ned Lamont over the summer, uses opt-in measures and incentives to push municipalities to allow more housing — rather than the requirements included in the previous version of the legislation. It also strikes a provision known as “fair share.”
Lamont is expected later today to announce the details of the new bill and call a special session for next week to pass it, among other measures.
A summary of the bill obtained by the Connecticut Mirror says municipalities can choose between three options to allow more housing. They can sign a contract with the Connecticut Municipal Development Authority, zone for more housing near train and bus stations or develop what’s called a housing growth plan, according to a summary of the bill obtained by The Connecticut Mirror.
Selecting one of these three options makes towns eligible for new state funding.
Towns can sign contracts with the Connecticut Municipal Development Authority and develop plans to increase housing in downtowns or near train and bus stations. The authority was established in 2019, funded in 2024, and started work earlier this year.
They can also opt to participate in what’s known as Work, Live, Ride, which pushes towns to allow more housing density near train and bus rapid transit stations. It’s a concept more broadly known as transit-oriented development that has grown more popular nationwide over recent years.
The summary also says towns can create housing growth plans by working with their councils of government or on their own. The plans have to be approved by the Office of Policy and Management.
If towns choose not to create these plans, they are not eligible for temporary pauses from being sued by developers whose affordable housing plans are denied under statute 8-30g.
Since the veto, Lamont has faced criticism from his own party and housing advocates. His office negotiated House Bill 5002, and the governor had been expected to sign it. He first publicly showed signs that he was wavering on his support for the bill the day after the legislative session ended in June.
He ultimately vetoed the bill saying he wanted to get local leaders on board with the measure. Behind the scenes, he and advisors fretted over the political implications of signing the measure as they received thousands of calls from opponents and Lamont considered a third-term run next year.
In a statement Friday morning, the governor said, “Over the last several months, I have consulted with bipartisan state lawmakers, municipal officials, housing advocates, and nonprofit partners to craft policies that will have a real-world impact and implement the tools we need to succeed in building more housing. This comprehensive proposal takes strong steps toward addressing this crisis and will help Connecticut reach these goals. I appreciate the collaborative input of everyone involved in this process and I urged lawmakers to approve this proposal.”
Lawmakers have long been working to address the lack of housing in Connecticut, particularly housing that’s affordable and available to the state’s lowest income residents. Multiple estimates show the state lacks upwards of 100,000 units of housing to meet residents’ needs. H.B. 5002 was the most wide-ranging housing bill to cross Lamont’s desk since he came into office in 2019.
The new bill, slated to be taken up in a special session of the General Assembly next week, includes many of the same measures as the old bill. The starkest difference is the opt-in measure. Previously, towns would have been required to plan and zone for a set number of housing units based on regional housing needs. The bill also previously prioritized existing state infrastructure money for towns that opted to increase density near public transit.
The question of how much the state should intervene to force towns to allow more housing has been central to the debate about Connecticut’s housing policy. Many town leaders say they want to preserve local control and create solutions that make sense for them, while housing advocates say towns have had plenty of time to build more housing and simply won’t do so without requirements from the state.
The new bill leans on incentive and opt-in structures.
H.B. 5002 also would have removed minimum off-street parking requirements for new housing developments with 24 units or fewer. The new bill lowers that number to 16 units or fewer and allows towns to possibly exempt two contiguous zones amounting to not more than 8% of the land.
In those zones, towns could require a parking needs assessment and developers would have to build no more than one parking space for each studio or 1-bedroom apartment and two spaces for each unit with two or more bedrooms, or the number recommended by a parking needs assessment paid for the developer. The requirement would be for whichever number is lower.
Parking reform was one of the most controversial topics in H.B. 5002. Opponents feared it would mean there weren’t enough spots to park and would have negative consequences for residents. Supporters said it would allow more flexibility and make it cheaper for developers to build housing.
The other controversial piece of the bill, known as fair share, has been removed. It would have required towns to plan and zone for a set number of units based on an assessment conducted by an outside consulting group. The group analyzed regional housing needs to figure out the numbers, and H.B. 5002 would have required that towns plan for a quarter of the recommended numbers.
Fair share has been utilized with some success in New Jersey.
The bill establishes a Council on Housing Development with legislative and executive branch appointments. The council would approve or deny towns’ housing growth plans if OPM fails to act on them within 120 days.
It also says that the Department of Housing can act as a statewide housing authority to develop more affordable housing. The department can partner with municipal housing authorities on projects and can build housing on state land, according to the document.
Other pieces of the old bill, including pieces that ban types of architecture that make it hard for people experiencing homelessness to remain largely intact, according to the summary. The House is scheduled to be in session Wednesday, and the Senate is scheduled to be in Thursday to vote on the housing bill and other measures.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lamont-Veto-0623-DE-056-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-07 10:59:09.491231

A recent analysis by the Movement Advancement Project estimates the loss of annual household income in the hundreds of millions (Illustration by Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).When Rob Connoley shut down his award-winning St. Louis restaurant last year, business was thriving.
Tourists and locals alike lauded Bulrush as a destination for Ozark cuisine, making its way into local and national publications as a top restaurant. Profit margins were beyond national averages, and Connoley was a newly awarded James Beard Award finalist.
But it didn’t feel right.
During a trip to London to represent Missouri in an international food festival, Connoley realized he couldn’t be an ambassador for a state that didn’t respect him.
“It felt egregious and awkward to be promoting a state in a region that was actively working against my own personal interests,” he told The Independent.
Connoley, who is gay, pointed to an onslaught of anti-LGBTQ+ laws. The final push was when the Missouri Attorney General sought out transgender kids’ medical records.
So he packed up and made a home in Oregon.
“It made more sense for me to take my entrepreneurial skills and go to a community that I think would be more supportive of what I’m trying to accomplish,” he said.
For years, Missouri lawmakers have heard warnings that enacting policies targeting the LGBTQ+ population could drive individuals and businesses out of the state. Local officials and chambers of commerce raised red flags about potential impacts on recruitment and retention of employees, as well as the ability to lure businesses to the state.
Now, studies are showing that the state’s actions have already pushed LGBTQ+ Missourians to move — taking their tax dollars, and even businesses, elsewhere.
Analysis by the Movement Advancement Project estimates that around $362 million to $879 million in household income has left the state, a number that is expected to increase.
The estimate is based on a survey conducted by MAP in collaboration with The Trevor Project, a mental health nonprofit for LGBTQ+ youth. Their research shows that among LGBTQ+-identifying people ages 13 to 24, around 39% have considered moving to a different state and 4% have already moved because of policies targeting gay and transgender people.
“There is good reason to suspect this 4% estimate may be even higher in Missouri,” the report says.

A separate study conducted by the National Center for Transgender Equality and released in 2024 found 47% of transgender people have thought about moving to a different state because of discriminatory state laws, and 5% had completed a move for that reason.
Missouri is one of 10 states highlighted in the study as having a higher proportion of respondents moving away.
“When people feel unwelcome or uncertain about their future in a community, they often take their skills and their families elsewhere,” Tracey DeMarea, executive director of the Mid-America LGBT Chamber of Commerce, told The Independent. “That loss affects our workforce, our businesses and our shared sense of community.”
A St. Louis University study released in April found that 32% of parents of LGBTQ+ children have considered leaving Missouri, and 48% of LGBTQ+ adults have considered moving. Political climate was the top reason for their desire to leave.
Analyses at the national level affirm a correlation between LGBTQ+ inclusion and economic success. A 2023 Wells Fargo report showed that states with larger LGBTQ+ populations had higher rates of economic growth between 2010 and 2019. The analysis notes that people identifying as LGBTQ+ tend to be younger and higher educated, but it still found a correlation between representation and economic growth when the data was controlled for age and education variables.
“The responsibility of lawmakers is to represent communities across the state and when they pass laws that target already vulnerable communities, they should consider their actions,” Naomi Goldberg, MAP’s executive director, told The Independent. “When families choose to leave the state, the loss is not only in the vitality and diversity of the community, but also in the economic power and resources that families provide.”
Each year, Missouri lawmakers file dozens of anti-LGBTQ+ bills, with some — like gender-affirming care restrictions — becoming law. And as they make their way through committee hearings, local chambers of commerce have raised red flags about the unintended consequences. .
The harshest warnings came in January 2024, in an eight-hour hearing on multiple bills including proposed regulations on restrooms in private businesses. Lobbyists stayed past 10 p.m., telling lawmakers the bills were a threat to “free enterprise” and “business development.”
Kara Corches, president and CEO of the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry, told committee members at the time that the legislation would impact communities statewide.
“We hear every day from businesses… that their ability to recruit and retain talent is their top concern to the business and economic growth in the state,” she said. “Businesses want to ensure that people feel comfortable and safe in their workplaces.”
Henry Eubank, governmental affairs coordinator for Greater St. Louis Inc., said discriminatory legislation depicts the state as unwelcoming.
“It sends a powerful negative signal to potential residents, investors, businesses and workers,” he said, “That the state of Missouri is not a place that they would want to visit, live, to do business, to start a business or move their family.”
And for some, the state no longer feels like home.
Connoley lived in the Ozarks and St. Louis areas for the majority of his life, and he saw the regional cuisine as something to highlight and promote internationally. Missouri was home until state officials went “too far.”
Rising extremism, he said, has removed a sense of community and cooperation crucial to thrive as a local business.

She visits them regularly, takes her daughter to storytimes and listens to audiobooks on Hoopla, an app that provides free access to ebooks, audiobooks, movies and other library material.
“Having a young toddler, it’s nice to be able to listen to audiobooks while you’re driving in the car, doing stuff like that,” said Tramel, 30, who works at Greater Belhaven Foundation in Jackson.

Back in April, a halt to federal funding caused many libraries to temporarily suspend or limit access to Hoopla. Though Tramel did not lose access, she said losing the app means she wouldn’t be able to read as much.
“It would make me very sad,” she said.
The Trump administration’s efforts to eliminate the Institute of Museum and Library Services caused the funding pause. The institute provides federal funding to museums and libraries across the country and is the largest source of federal funding for America’s libraries.
Funding was restored months ago, and federal courts blocked the administration’s efforts. But the federal government shutdown means that the agency’s future is still at risk.
“Sometimes you don’t know what you had until it’s gone,” said Jennifer Lena, deputy executive director of the Mississippi Library Commission. “And I don’t think a lot of people realize how many people don’t have access to the internet at home, especially in rural areas. I don’t think they understand how many people go to their libraries for support, for job searches, again to check out materials for those who can’t afford them.”
If the Institute of Museum and Library Services shuts down, libraries and their users in Mississippi would lose important services.

The Mississippi Library Commission distributes some of the money from the institute as subgrants. It uses the rest to help pay for many of the services libraries and their users rely on.
During the 2025 budget year, the Mississippi Library Commission received $2.1 million from the institute through the Grants to States program. 
Without the federal infusion of funds, library users could lose free access to Hoopla, Talking Book Services, summer reading programs and more. Libraries could lose important resources such as consultants, training and professional development for library staff and technology support.
“Most of the cases … for them (libraries) to try to independently get those services, they would be significantly higher in cost,” Lena said. “So for many of them, the ability to get them back would just really not be there.”
If federal funding sharply decreases or goes away altogether, the commission would have to evaluate its services and decide what it can and can’t keep, based on what would have the most impact.
Mississippi’s libraries receive funding from state and local governments, as well as the federal government. Total funding for each library and library system varies, but small, rural libraries would be hit the hardest by potential cuts.
Patty M. Bailey, director of the Yalobusha County Public Library System, explained that the federal grant is “vital” to her library.

“In small, rural communities like those we serve, the library serves as a community center, a gathering spot for all ages,” she said.
It’s also a place where residents can access computers and the internet.
Emmaline Smith, 41, is a board member of JXN Friends of the Library. She said she and her family often use Hoopla and a similar app called Libby.
“Even if you don’t use the services yourself, there’s a lot of people in our community that really rely on them and need them,” Smith said.
Alivia Beckham, 18, has been going to Quisenberry Library in Clinton since she was in eighth grade. A student at Hinds Community College, she often uses the library to do schoolwork or meet with study groups. 
“I love the library. I come here a lot. It’s my favorite thing to do, is just sit down and read for hours,” Beckham said. She also uses the digital archives for schoolwork, one of the services Lena cited as being at risk if federal funding goes away.
Zarah Drake, 30, lives in Jackson. He used to frequent the Eudora Welty Library downtown. When it shut down, he tried one other branch before finding his favorite, Quisenberry.
He’s been going to libraries for years, though he doesn’t get to visit the library as often because of work. He said he likes to read books and use the WiFi on his laptop.
“I think that libraries, they give us access to a wealth, a treasure trove of knowledge and information that we can utilize and apply in our everyday lives,” Drake said.

Caitlin Sewell, 29, who works as a protective blast engineer,said she uses the online catalog to reserve books and pick them up.
“There’s just so many books that you have access to,” she said. “I mean, I don’t want to have to pay for a book every single time I want to read a book.”
According to Jeanne Williams, executive director of the Jackson/Hinds system, losing support services from the commission would be “the most critical loss.”
The Jackson/Hinds system is working on a five-year revitalization effort. Williams said that without the commission’s support, the system would potentially have to spend money that could’ve gone toward revitalization on replacing the technology support services and consultants. It also would lose access to free training and support for staff and would have to reduce its ebook catalog.
“If Mississippians care about literacy, workforce development, economic health, access to technology and the internet and safe spaces for learning and community connection, then they should care deeply about libraries,” Williams said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/08122954/Jennifer-Lena-Ms.-Library-Commission-1.jpg,,,2025-11-07 10:01:22.590231

SNAP was designed during the Great Depression and formalized in the 1960s as part of the War on Poverty, a bridge for families between hardship and self-sufficiency. Today, it reflects a system that has stopped solving problems and started managing them. The question is no longer how to help people through hard times; it is how to live with the permanence of those hard times.
This is the uncomfortable truth revealed by the budget impasse. Hunger is no longer a temporary emergency. It is a policy choice.
For decades, the number of Americans who depend on SNAP has quietly measured how many of our public systems have failed: unaffordable housing, stagnant wages, childcare, and health care that few can afford. We have programs layered on programs, each designed to fill the gaps left by another, until the very complexity of the system becomes its own form of poverty.
With SNAP benefits paused, Michigan recipients, advocates and lawmakers determine how to respond

When Congress fails to pass a budget, it is not just our government workforce who go unpaid. It reveals how far removed Congress is from the human cost of doing nothing. We do not need another round of partisan press conferences to fix that. We need a different conversation, one that starts not with blame but with proximity. The people closest to the problems should not be the furthest from the decisions that shape them. Yet that is exactly how we have built our systems: top down, fragmented, and resistant to collaboration.
While one party may benefit from the political stalemate for now, both would gain by addressing the problem’s root causes. The government would spend less, people would secure housing, transportation, and jobs, and we could move on to the next challenge in building a better system.
When I worked for the City of Detroit, following the resignation of Kwame Kilpatrick and before its bankruptcy, I saw how government, business, and philanthropy came together to support the city and ultimately save it through what became known as the Grand Bargain. That collaboration preserved pensions, protected city assets, and set a global example of how foundations can serve as conveners, aligning diverse partners across sectors to take concerted action and improve outcomes.
Detroit and Michigan: A Fragile Bargain

If we want fewer families depending on SNAP, we cannot start by cutting the program. We must cut the conditions that make it necessary. That means removing barriers to opportunity: wages that do not meet the cost of living, transportation systems that make jobs unreachable, and childcare that costs more than rent. It means aligning the work of government, philanthropy, and business around a shared purpose, because no single sector can solve a structural problem alone.
Philanthropy has an opportunity to lead where politics fails. Consider the staggering sums spent on recent election cycles, millions of dollars in Michigan alone, much of it poured into campaigns promising to fix what government itself keeps breaking. Imagine if even a fraction of that money were redirected to foundations and community organizations already doing the work: building local food systems, training workers, and connecting families to opportunity.
If facilitated effectively, foundations and business leaders can come together again to prevent future breakdowns in essential benefits by reducing dependence on them. It could be a win for everyone. Families move from survival to stability, the private sector gains a stronger workforce, Republicans reduce long-term spending and strengthen families and local control, while Democrats deliver on their promise to fight for working Americans and fortify the social safety net.
The challenge is that elected officials often thrive on political division and prefer to control the process internally. That is where the private and philanthropic sectors can step in, convening stakeholders, identifying barriers, and aligning resources to sustain progress without waiting for Congress or state legislatures. Foundations can link funding to measurable outcomes rather than short-term programs and coordinate on a larger scale across the communities they serve, guided by a shared strategy. With a collective voice, they can leverage their power to hold lawmakers accountable for removing the remaining legislative or regulatory barriers.
In Michigan, we have strong foundations and an influential private sector. Actual progress will require innovation to break down existing silos and share best practices. The status quo is no longer acceptable. Philanthropy can help depoliticize the work ahead by convening partners across sectors and aligning efforts toward measurable outcomes.

The media, too, has a role. It can illuminate the systems that produce hunger, not just the faces that endure it. It can tell the story of what happens when policy becomes theater, with lives at risk, and of the barriers families face in keeping their children fed.
It is time for the people we elect to lay down their swords and focus on collaborative problem-solving. Instead of arguing over positions, focus on shared outcomes. No one wants children to go hungry, and everyone wants people to succeed on their own terms. Starting from that common ground is the first step toward any durable solution. It is also the essence of democracy: staying in the conversation long enough to find a resolution.
The shutdown will end, eventually. Workers will get paid, and benefits will be restored. But unless we fix the larger failure, the one that leaves 42 million Americans reliant on SNAP every month, we will be back here again, mistaking a temporary budget for progress.
The private and philanthropic sectors must hold our elected leaders accountable and need to bring the stakeholders to the table to find common ground, remove barriers, align strategy, and transform the system of care so it serves people, not politics.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_7306-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-07 10:01:22.590231

(Photo: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)American inspections of foreign food facilities — which produce everything from crawfish to cookies for the U.S. market — have plummeted to historic lows this year, a ProPublica analysis of federal data shows, even as inspections reveal alarming conditions at some manufacturers.
About two dozen current and former Food and Drug Administration officials blame the pullback on deep staffing cuts under the Trump administration. The stark reduction marks a dramatic shift in oversight at a time when the United States has never been more dependent on foreign food, which accounts for the vast majority of the nation’s seafood and more than half its fresh fruit.
The stakes are high: Foreign products have been increasingly linked to outbreaks of foodborne illness. In recent years, FDA investigators have uncovered disturbing lapses in facilities producing food bound for American supermarkets. In Indonesia, cookie factory workers hauled dough in soiled buckets. In China, seafood processors slid crawfish along cracked, stained conveyor belts. Investigators have reported crawling insects, dripping pipes and fake testing data purporting to show food products were pathogen free.
In 2011, Congress — concerned about the different standards of overseas food operations — gave the FDA new authority to hold foreign food producers to the same safety standards as domestic ones. Although the agency’s small team remained unable to visit every overseas facility, inspections rose sharply after the mandate — sometimes doubling or tripling previous rates.
Now, the U.S. is on track to have the fewest inspections on record since 2011, except during the global pandemic.

Inspections began to decline early in the administration, after 65% of the staff in the FDA divisions responsible for coordinating travel and budgets left or were fired in the name of government efficiency.
Investigators suddenly had to book their own flights and hotels, obtain diplomatic passports and visas, and coordinate with foreign authorities, former and current FDA staffers told ProPublica. After workers tasked with processing expenses were laid off, investigators waited as a backlog of unfulfilled reimbursements climbed to more than $1 million, a former staffer said. (Investigators are responsible for paying off their own credit cards.) Senior investigators close to retirement also took the opportunity to get out.
Played out on a large scale, this combination of firings and voluntary departures has left the agency scrambling to make up for the loss of 1 out of every 5 of its workers responsible for ensuring the safety of America’s food and drugs.
Susan Mayne, the former director of the FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition and an adjunct professor at Yale School of Public Health, expressed alarm at the drop in foreign inspections.
“It’s very concerning that we are seeing these kinds of reductions,” said Mayne, who emphasized the administration’s cuts have hamstrung an agency that has long struggled to retain investigators who conduct both foreign and domestic inspections. In an attempt to maintain its numbers, the agency had been working on initiatives to elevate pay and adopt specialized training for investigators. “The plans that were in place to address staffing have now been undermined.”
The gutting of the workforce coincides with other actions the administration has taken that are poking holes in the nation’s food safety net. In March, the FDA announced it was delaying compliance with a rule to speed up the identification and removal of harmful products in the food system, to give more time for companies to follow the rules. The next month, it suspended a quality control program that ensured consistency and accuracy across its 170 pathogen and contaminant labs as a result of staffing cuts.
Then in July, the administration quietly scaled back the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network, also known as FoodNet, shrinking its surveillance to just two pathogens: salmonella and a common type of E. coli. The program — a partnership between the FDA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Agriculture and state health departments — was responsible for the critical monitoring of eight foodborne illnesses, including infections caused by the deadly bacteria listeria. In response to the change, a CDC spokesperson previously claimed that the program’s surveillance had been duplicative.
The administration did not respond to ProPublica’s questions about these actions.
“There are going to be things that fall through the cracks, and these things aren’t negligible,” said a current FDA investigations official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearing reprisal. The same was true of other current and former agency staffers; those who still had jobs risked losing them, while former employees worried about their chances of being rehired or the security of their severance or retirement packages.
The Department of Health and Human Services refused to respond to any of ProPublica’s questions about the decrease in foreign food inspections, citing the government shutdown. “Responding to ProPublica is not considered a mission-critical activity,” said Emily Hilliard, the department’s press secretary. The FDA and the White House also did not respond to requests for comment.
“Basic regulatory oversight functions have been decimated,” said Brian Ronholm, the director of food policy at Consumer Reports. “There’s an enhanced risk of more outbreaks.”

An agency already struggling
The FDA has long been one of the main protectors of the American food supply. The federal agency oversees about 80% of what people eat, including fruits, vegetables, processed goods, dairy products and infant formula and most seafood and eggs. It regulates more than 220,000 farms, food plants and distributors, inspecting facilities, testing for pathogens, tracing outbreaks and issuing recalls.
Only 40% of the facilities that the FDA regulates are within the nation’s borders. While the agency examines some products at ports of entry, those reviews are often cursory; workers cannot manually inspect every import or uncover whether a foreign plant properly cleans its equipment, conducts adequate salmonella testing or has a rat infestation. In-person facility inspections are necessary for that kind of insight.
For example, in 2023, an FDA investigator inspected a Chinese manufacturer of soy protein powder, a common additive in shakes and other beverages. While the company had previously imported its products into the United States without scrutiny, the investigator’s thorough visit found numerous violations, according to an agency report obtained through a federal records request.
Live insects crawled through the facility’s production workshop, while dead ones lay on the floor. Condensation from rust-covered pipes dripped into a water tank waiting to be mixed with raw ingredients. Just outside the plant, the investigator found processing waste and stagnant water coated with a green biofilm, attracting a swarm of bugs too numerous to count.
When the investigator reviewed the firm’s bacteria testing records, which purportedly verified the products were free of salmonella and E. coli, he discovered the company was providing fake data to “satisfy the customer specifications,” according to his inspection report.

Company officials also tried to obstruct his inspection, blocking him from entering a packaging room when he tried to photograph the pest infestation. After the three-day review, the federal agent censured the company, Pingdingshan Tianjing Plant Albumen Co. Ltd., which promised to take corrective actions. The company did not respond to ProPublica’s emailed questions.
If investigators find a foreign food facility is unable to comply with American safety requirements or refuses to permit the FDA to inspect its establishment, the agency can block its products from entering the country.
These crucial foreign inspections are neither easy nor cheap. They typically last longer than domestic ones and cost nearly $40,000 a visit, and they can require months of logistical planning, special visas and diplomatic approval from the host country.
In part because of these challenges, there was a time when the FDA conducted only a few hundred foreign inspections annually.
Then Congress passed the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011, which set firm targets for the agency: It needed to conduct more than 19,000 foreign food inspections annually by 2016 and increase the number of food field staff to no fewer than 5,000 workers.
The FDA has never fulfilled this congressional mandate. Even before the second Trump administration, the agency was inspecting less than 10% of its target each year.
Dr. Stephen Ostroff, a former acting commissioner of the FDA who also served as the deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine, said that the agency’s foreign food inspections have long been hindered by a lack of resources.
“It’s not because the agency isn’t interested in doing more overseas inspections — they are,” said Ostroff, who retired from the agency in 2019. “They simply don’t have the resources to be able to meaningfully do large numbers of overseas inspections.”
One major obstacle has been a lack of financial support. “Congressional appropriators have never provided the funding that FDA has determined it would need to do those foreign inspections,” said Mayne, who retired from the agency in 2023. Before the food safety act passed, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the agency would need about $1.4 billion over five years to comply with the new requirements, which included the expansion of field staff and foreign inspections. But lawmakers approved only a fraction of that amount.
As of last year, the agency had about 430 employees conducting both foreign and domestic food inspections, with only 20 investigators dedicated solely to international assignments.
With such limitations, the agency’s inspections have often been reactive instead of proactive. In 2023, for example, FDA investigators did not descend on a Mexican strawberry farm until about 20 people had been hospitalized with hepatitis A, a highly contagious infection that causes liver inflammation and, in some cases, liver failure and death.
Hepatitis A is spread through the consumption of small or even microscopic bits of feces. Farm workers can shed the virus when picking fruit, or it can be transmitted through contaminated water.
At the Mexican berry farm, federal investigators found significant safety violations, including sanitation facilities with hand-washing water that was dirty, gray and leaking throughout the growing area; one toilet offered no ability to wash one’s hands. The FDA censured the company, citing 11 violations of American food safety regulations. According to public data, the agency did not reinspect the farm to ensure it had made corrections even as its products kept entering the United States.
In January, less than two weeks before the second Trump administration came in, a report by the Government Accountability Office rebuked the FDA for consistently falling short of its foreign food inspection targets. The oversight office, recognizing the vital importance of the FDA’s food safety mission, urged Congress to direct the agency to assess how many foreign inspections are needed to keep the country’s food supply safe.
The FDA said in response that, in 2025, it would increase staffing levels and prioritize the training and development of investigators.

Reversing a decade of gains
During the first few weeks of the new Trump administration, foreign inspections carried on as usual. But the sudden hemorrhaging of FDA workers through firings, retirements and buyouts quickly foiled the agency’s plans to ramp up staff and inspections.
While the administration had vowed that food safety inspectors would be spared, it began to cut critical investigative support staff in March, a move that would eventually incapacitate foreign inspections, current and former FDA staffers told ProPublica.
As the agency lost support staff, their responsibilities shifted to investigators, who were quickly overwhelmed by the new burdens. Passports, visas and travel were all delayed.
“Support staff are not just there to bide time — they have a meaningful role,” said Sandra Eskin, who served as a top USDA food safety official in the Biden administration and is now the CEO of advocacy group Stop Foodborne Illness. “It’s like a game of Jenga: If you pull out one from the middle or the bottom, the whole tower collapses.”
In recent years, the agency has typically been able to conduct about 110 foreign food inspections each month, but in March, the number of inspections dropped almost in half compared with the monthly average in the previous two years.
As specialists who handled reimbursements were also fired, some investigators waited months for repayment, which made them reluctant to take on other foreign assignments, former and current staffers said.
The cuts and growing work burden quickly collapsed morale across the investigative division, leading many senior investigative officials with decades of experience to retire.
“We already had a significant percentage of our workforce that was eligible for retirement,” said a current FDA employee in the investigations division, “so reading the writing on the wall, they decided to exit.” These departures also interrupted the development of new investigators, as some of the senior staff members who left had been tasked with training new hires, a process that can take up to two years.
“There’s been such a brain drain,” said food safety expert Jennifer McEntire, founder of consulting firm Food Safety Strategy, “when inspectors do go out and are observing things, there’s no phone-a-friend.”
Instead of addressing the shortfall, in May, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary announced that the agency would expand the number of unannounced foreign inspections, in which investigators show up at facilities without alerting them first. Given the limited staff and resources, several current and former staffers told ProPublica that the prospect of conducting unannounced visits was impractical and even “comical.”
“A foreign unannounced trip is like an accelerated coordination process,” said a current FDA investigations official. “If you’re going to increase the number and not increase the staff, we don’t know how to make some of that stuff work.”
By the end of July, the number of foreign food inspections conducted by the agency was nearly 30% lower compared with similar periods in the previous two years. The administration refused to provide ProPublica with up-to-date inspection numbers, so we relied on data from the FDA’s public inspection dashboard to conduct this analysis.
Foreign inspections are not the only tool for overseeing food from abroad. The agency has developed partnerships with counterparts in other countries to ensure comparable oversight and required importers to verify that their foreign suppliers are following American standards. However, former and current agency staffers said that these initiatives also have been impacted by the administration’s cuts and recent departures.
While the administration’s cuts were ostensibly ordered to maximize efficiency and productivity, they have had an opposite effect, several former and current FDA employees said, reversing years of progress.
“The goal is to accomplish as much and more with less resources,” said a former high-level FDA investigations official. “Less inspections translate to less regulatory oversight, and that, from a public health perspective, never benefits the public.”
Scott Faber, senior vice president for government affairs at the nonprofit advocacy organization Environmental Working Group, said the fallout is simple:
“When you take a wrecking ball to the federal government, you are going to wind up undermining important government functions that keep all of us safe, especially our food,” he said. “It’s only a matter of time before people die.”


Let us know what you think...


 


How ProPublica calculated foreign food inspections
To understand how inspections of foreign food facilities have changed, we used a publicly available dashboard where the FDA publishes the results of those inspections. This database also includes inspections for manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, cosmetics, tobacco, biologics and veterinary products.
Beginning in May, we downloaded the entire database weekly and tracked the number of newly added foreign food facility inspections.
The dashboard is continually updated, with data added after inspections are finalized. That typically occurs 45 to 90 days after the close of an inspection, though some reports may not be posted until the agency takes a final enforcement action. Through an analysis, we determined that few reports are added more than 90 days after an inspection date.
Our story therefore only includes inspections through July. In an accompanying chart, we show the more provisional data through September. We asked HHS for recent figures, but the department refused to share them.
We considered the possibility that the downtrend in foreign food inspections was solely due to a lag in inspections being added to the dashboard. To check this, we performed the same analysis on domestic inspections.

The government approved Red Wolf DCD Properties' proposal to build a $12 billion data center there, but a lawsuit put the project on hold. (Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kansas)LAWRENCE — A protest petition and lawsuit have put the brakes on a proposed $12 billion data center after zoning was initially approved by the Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kansas, in May.
The developer of the hyperscale facility, Red Wolf DCD Properties, submitted plans for six buildings totaling 1.8 million square feet on the north and south sides of Parallel Parkway in western Wyandotte County. A “hyperscale” data center is 10,000 or more square feet and houses at least 5,000 computer servers. The project would be the largest development in Wyandotte County’s history.
Proponents of the plan say it will bring badly needed revenue to the county. However, residents and an environmental group have voiced concerns about government transparency, location and environmental costs associated with the facility, whose end user remains unknown.
“We’re trying to figure out, if we’re going to welcome data centers to Kansas, how we can make sure that we’re not doing any harm to the communities, to the ecosystems and the environment,” said Zack Pistora, director of the Kansas chapter of the Sierra Club.
Protest petitions were filed for each of the north and south developments, triggering the requirement of supermajority zoning approval from the 11-member planning and zoning commission. On July 31, a rezoning amendment for the north side application failed to meet that threshold after a 7-3 vote. The south side of the proposal did not require supermajority approval after eight signatories to the petition removed their signatures.
 
Petition signatures retracted
In documents filed in Wyandotte County District Court, the plaintiffs, Neal Palmer and Haskell Farms LLC, allege the Unified Government should not have approved rezoning from residential to commercial because of “numerous errors and insufficiencies” in the developer’s applications, which they say “failed to adhere to the Unified Government’s municipal code.” The lawsuit claims the commission rushed review processes “without sufficient study of short and long-term impacts.”
The lawsuit also alleges a commissioner was “unduly pressured” to recuse himself from planning commission hearings and that Red Wolf orchestrated an effort to have signatories withdraw from the south side petition.
On Oct. 29, a Wyandotte County district judge denied the Unified Government’s motion to dismiss the plaintiff’s case against the south tract. The court found the lawsuit against the north tract may proceed if commissioners make a “final decision” regarding the zoning application.
Palmer, the plaintiff, ran for election to the Wyandotte County Board of Public Utilities but lost his race on Tuesday.
Steve Sessions, a community organizer who operates the “We the People of Wyco” Facebook page and who is not involved in the lawsuit, said in an interview the developer needed eight fewer signatures on the petition in order to proceed without supermajority approval.
“Conveniently,” Sessions said, “eight people that signed the petition then retracted their petition via a letter that was written and notarized by Polsinelli Law Firm.”
Polsinelli Law Firm, which did not reply to inquiries for this story, is representing Red Wolf in its application process.
Sessions said elected officials have not been transparent with the community or articulated the benefits the project will bring.
“We send hundreds of emails asking for a response on the record,” Sessions said. “None of them are ever responded to.”

‘Flipper style’ development
As advances in artificial intelligence drive the proliferation of data centers around the country, developers and municipalities have been eager to cash in. The often-massive buildings house computer servers that handle everything people do online, from processing Amazon orders to answering Google queries. Often, data centers are built before corporate tenants commit to the location, drawing comparisons to real estate “flippers.”
“The risk to our health and the risk to our bills of just inviting this kind of real estate flipper style of data center from Red Wolf is great,” said Ty Gorman, senior campaign strategist for the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Coalition.
In many parts of the country, data centers are increasing energy costs for residents, although the Kansas Corporation Commission, which regulates public utilities, on Thursday approved a plan to allocate energy costs to try to ensure residents don’t foot the electric bill for data centers.
Gorman said hyperscale development should be focused on attracting end users like Google that have committed to green energy and will invest in infrastructure to help communities develop resilient, renewable energy sources.
“The prospect of being able to have the commission say this real estate flipper has to sell it to someone who’s willing to do that, like Google, is a big opportunity,” Gorman said.
Kasia Tarczynska, a senior research analyst at Good Jobs First who studies data center subsidies, said there has been a lot of buildup and “talk about a bubble.”
“Big tech companies are hiding behind developers. It’s a huge, huge problem,” she said, “because the public should have access to information. Do people want to have this company as a community member?”
She said speculative projects that don’t end up attracting a corporate tenant can leave communities stuck with massive, empty buildings.
Red Wolf is owned by Aaron Wolofsky of Brooklyn, New York. According to the Kansas City Business Journal, Red Wolf’s headquarters is listed as a residential address in New York, and it has proposed, but not yet built, two data centers in Georgia.
 
‘Shots in the arm’
Greg Kindle, president of the Wyandotte Economic Development Council, sees the data center project as a welcome and badly needed investment in the community.
“We need some pretty good shots in the arm,” he said.
Kindle emphasized the need to fund local schools, noting the project is sited within Piper School District, the second-fastest growing school district in the state. He said the project, when complete, would generate more than $2 million in property tax revenue annually for each of its six buildings. The data center will also pay local taxes on its power usage, he said.
“It runs 24/7 every day, and it’s the same consistent load,” he said. “Those are really consistent revenues.”
Kindle said the project will generate between 40 and 60 confirmed jobs, and possibly as many as 100. These are technical jobs, he said, that generate salaries around $100,000 a year.
He said that the Parallel Parkway location is ideal because it can support the power and water needs of the data center. He also said Red Wolf will be responsible for upgrading infrastructure like substations and transmission systems.
Some opponents say the project does not suit the location’s agricultural and residential character. Kindle said the project will generate substantial revenues on a relatively small footprint.
“General Motors pays about $3.5 million annually in property taxes on four million square feet,” he said. “We’re looking at one data center generating $2.4 million a year on 330,000 square feet.”
 
Environmental impact
Data centers have become notorious for their energy requirements and for the massive amount of water needed to cool their servers.
“AI likes to represent itself as a clean technology, but AI must be powered by the grid,” said Alex Boynton, a professor of environmental ethics at the University of Kansas. “There are significant parts of the U.S. grid that are still run by fossil fuel energy, which calls into question the validity of those claims.”
The water needs of the data center remain unclear. Kindle said water requirements will be determined by the tenant. Some newer technologies, such as closed-loop systems, reuse water but require more energy.
“These folks aren’t planning to use a significant amount of water,” Kindle said. “They’re going heavier on power and less on water.”
But Gorman, of the Sierra Club, said the proposed project would double the energy usage of the county.
As federal dollars for renewable energy disappear under the Trump Administration, the Southwest Power Pool, which manages the flow of electricity for Kansas and 13 other states, is working to transition away from a reliance on coal.
The Kansas City, Kansas, Board of Public Utilities still utilizes coal for 39% of its power generation.
 
‘A double-edged sword’
Boynton said “AI is coming, one way or another.”
With AI, data centers are inevitable, he said.
“I think everybody’s rushing in on the current gold mine,” Boynton said. “But it can be a double-edged sword. We need to take a long, hard look into the environmental consequences and a long, hard look into the benefits, and whether or not they’ll include everybody.”
Sessions, the community organizer, said he isn’t opposed to responsible development. He pointed to the recently approved data center in De Soto as an example.
“That project was handled very well,” he said, noting that De Soto did a good job of articulating community impacts and benefits. But the Red Wolf Project, he said, was approved by the zoning commission in just six weeks.
“I’m not anti-data center,” he said. “We obviously need these and they are revenue generators, but the way it’s presented is not truthful. It is not how we should be allowing businesses to do business in our community.”
The project leaves too many questions unanswered, he said.
“If it’s already irresponsible at the very beginning, what kind of disaster is going to happen later?” he said.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaska’s six-person judge-nominating board has picked a state prosecutor and a Fairbanks Superior Court judge for possible appointment to the Alaska Court of Appeals.
Following Wednesday’s vote by the Alaska Judicial Council, Gov. Mike Dunleavy will have 45 days to make the final choice between prosecutor RuthAnne Beach and Judge Patricia Haines.
The council’s members declined to nominate Juneau private-practice attorney Chris Peloso and assistant public defender Lacey Jane Brewster, who had also applied for an upcoming vacancy caused by the departure of Appeals Court Judge Bethany Harbison.
In a survey of practicing attorneys, Haines was rated as the most qualified candidate, having received a score of 4.6 out of a possible 5. Beach received a rating of 4.2, Brewster a rating of 2.9, and Peloso, a rating of 2.6.
Haines received the council’s unanimous support; Beach received the support of five members. Neither Brewster nor Peloso received any “yes” votes.
The council’s deliberations took place in closed session, and it interviewed all but Peloso in closed session as well. No members of the public testified for or against particular candidates during a Wednesday public comment period. 
The judicial council consists of three attorney members appointed by the Alaska Bar Association and three public members appointed by the governor. 
The chief justice of the Alaska Supreme Court chairs meetings and votes only to break a tie.
It’s unusual for members of the council to explain their decisions, but John Wood, a public member whose appointment by Dunleavy was challenged in court, offered explanations for his votes on each candidate and suggested that the council change its policy.
He suggested each candidate be ranked by each council member on a 1-5 scale, and that the council nominate anyone receiving an average of at least 3.5 points.
During his discussion, he said he rated Beach as a 4.25, Haines a 5, Brewster a 2.5 and Peloso a 1.
During Peloso’s public interview, attorney board member Savannah Fletcher asked him about written comments submitted to the board, suggesting that he has attempted to intimidate women in the past. “People have given examples of apparently intimidating behavior to have them not speak about you or about certain topics,” she said.
“Wow,” Peloso responded. “I honestly, absolutely — no idea where that would be coming from. … I don’t think I’ve ever threatened anybody with any kind of legal process in a professional capacity. I think that would not be professional to do that.” 
Board members also questioned Peloso about his decision to leave the Alaska Department of Law for private practice. Peloso said it was due to political differences and his personnel file said it was because of performance issues.
Responding to that claim, Peloso said he was punished for successfully fighting a fishing company that had ties to the governor, then talking to the press about the case.
“It turns out that the people running this fishing company that were now responsible for $18 million in taxes they didn’t want to pay, had connections with the governor, and I was called by the Attorney General himself, who said, ‘You weren’t supposed to be talking to the press, and you’re terminated immediately.’”
During the voting process, Wood said he found Peloso to be “very evasive” and that he was “a “strong no.” 
“I scored him a one only because I couldn’t go any lower,” Wood said.
One board member, Denny DeWitt, recused himself from voting on Peloso.
The other three candidates’ interviews were not accessible by the public; most candidates for judicial openings conduct their interviews behind closed doors.
When voting on Brewster, an assistant public defender, Wood said he had reservations about whether she could rule impartially as a judge after being an advocate. “I don’t know that she could leave that behind,” he said.
With Beach, he said, “She may not be the absolute top of the pinnacle, but she certainly showed enough talent and ambition and attitude and training to be more than an acceptable judge on the Court of Appeals.”
Discussing Haines, he noted that she applied for the appeals court in 2020 and was nominated by the council but not appointed. Since then, Wood said, she’s become an even stronger candidate because of her experience on the superior court, having been appointed by Dunleavy in 2021.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DSC01380-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-07 09:17:01.490952

The business, With the Wild Farm, is owned and operated by Innes and her husband, Guy Schlapper (Lily Mantel/Missouri News Network).A rainbow of crops fills farmer Abbey Innes’ table at the Columbia Farmers Market: tomatoes, squash, garlic, kale and flower bouquets — all from her and her husband’s 15-acre farm in Howard County.
But for a few markets last year, the table was a bit emptier.
“We planted hundreds of pounds of seed potatoes and got 10 inches of rain within 10 days,” she said. “And they drowned; they rotted.”
Farming is risky business, and crop insurance helps keep farmers paid when something goes wrong. A few years ago, Innes tried to see if she could get her farm insured. But the agent told her she didn’t have enough of any one particular crop to qualify for insurance.
That’s because she purposefully farms “with the land,” and to her that means farming a variety of crops. Research indicates diverse farms are better for the environment compared to single-crop farms. Diverse farms bolster soil health and require fewer chemical inputs.
For her efforts, she had to forgo insurance and eat the entire cost of those rotted potatoes.
“It is nerve-racking,” she said. “You just got to be ready to be flexible and have a backup plan for if something doesn’t go right.”
For some farmers, crop insurance is the backup plan. It’s subsidized by the federal government, and taxpayers foot most of the bill. Taxpayers will pay about $13 billion directly into the program each year over the next decade, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office.
But not all farms enjoy equal protection.
“Anywhere between 90 and 100% of corn, soybean and wheat acreage in the United States is covered under some form of crop insurance policy,” said Ben Brown, an University of Missouri Extension agricultural business and policy specialist.
“There is, I would say, larger barriers to entry for fruit and vegetable producers,” he added.
Garlic and other products sit on display on Saturday at the With the Wild Farm booth at the Columbia Farmers Market. Owner Abbey Innes grows and sells the crops with her husband, Gary Schlapper.

Most crop insurance policies protect against a drop in production or revenue by assessing a farm’s baseline of one or both of those metrics. For row crop commodities, such as corn and soybeans, it’s relatively straightforward since projected prices are standardized and many large farms only have one or a few crops to insure.


But it gets a lot more complicated to insure a diverse, 15-acre farm like the one Innes owns. Prices and yields are different for each crop and less standardized than for commodity crops.


“One of the challenges of developing crop insurance markets for fruit and vegetables is there’s a lot of different prices, and there’s a lot of things that drive those price markets,” Brown said.


The 2014 Farm Bill created Whole-Farm Revenue Protection insurance as an option for diversified farms. Instead of insuring the yield or revenue of particular crops, it insures the revenue of an entire farm.


But barriers to access and education have kept adoption low. Many farmers, including Innes, have never heard of the program. Even some insurance agents don’t know about it, and if they do, many don’t want to sell the product.


“One of the big challenges for this has been just the sheer amount of recordkeeping and paperwork that’s required, not only of the producer but also of the crop insurance agent selling the product,” Brown said.


Brown said agents are less incentivized to sell whole-farm insurance because of the extra workload.


Plus, the plans are often smaller in scale, meaning less commission for the insurance agent — and that can mean less incentive to sell, according to the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition.


“The system itself is set up where these private insurers and companies, and agents themselves, are incentivized, in a way, to sell certain policies and not sell others,” said Duncan Orlander, a policy specialist at the advocacy group.


In 2022, larger farms received 80% of payments from federal crop insurance, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture research. That same year, a majority of farms producing row crops purchased insurance, but fewer than 9% of farms growing specialty crops, such as fruits and vegetables, did the same.


The difficulty for diverse farms to get crop insurance is one of the reasons Orlander and the coalition believe the program needs to be tweaked to better promote conservation efforts.


“What we certainly don’t want to do is take that safety net away from farmers,” he said. “I think it’s about how do we structure these policies in a way that allow for farmers themselves to have more agency in their decision-making while maintaining that safety net to encourage conservation practices.”


For example, Orlander said insuring large-scale row crop farms based on their historical yield pushes farmers to produce more and more to keep that baseline high.


That could disincentivize them from using conservation practices that could be good for the farm and the planet in the long run, but have short-term drags on yield.


“It’s a perpetuating process here of farmers who don’t want to necessarily change because they don’t want to lose the security of crop insurance,” Orlander said. “Which is completely understandable, and I think it’s about making these products more flexible for conservation work.”


Economist Cory Walters is an associate professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and a farmer himself. He said overall, crop insurance is good for conservation.


“It gives you that (revenue) floor,” Walters said. “It gives you that certainty to then take that next step and invest in whatever that new technology is and give it a try.”


Walters did agree that crop insurance should be used to push conservation in a positive direction by offering incentives to farmers for implementing environmentally-friendly practices.


“If you could link your additional premium subsidy, or some incentive, to also do something else in the conservation world that that that seems like a great place to operate with trying to get farmers to to adopt different technologies,” he said


For example, Iowa gives farmers a discount on their premiums if they use cover crops, a conservation method that involves covering soil with crops that won’t be harvested.


“I think crop insurance and conservation can go together very well with the right mindset,” Walters said.


Innes currently uses cover crops on her family’s farm in Howard County. She said it’s helped make their soil more resilient. When she set up her table at the Columbia Farmers Market on Saturday, she had multiple varieties of potatoes to sell and many customers bought them throughout the morning.


But now she’s worried about another problem — deer. Apparently, they’re fans of potatoes too. And without crop insurance, she’d again bear the cost herself if the wildlife harvests the potatoes before she does.

Earlier this summer, California lawmakers including Gov. Gavin Newsom worked to close a multibillion-dollar deficit. But a closer look at “pork-barrel spending” raises questions about whether the state’s $325-billion spending plan is going to those who need it most, writes CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow.
To win the favor of their constituencies and tip the scales for reelection, lawmakers can allocate money to fund projects that benefit their districts. Known as pork-barrel spending, the practice isn’t unique to California lawmakers. But the state’s secretive budget negotiation process makes it difficult to identify what districts benefit from these special earmarks and the legislators behind them.
In one of the state’s 40 budget-related bills that passed this year, Ryan found nearly 100 earmarks that totaled $415 million for local projects. One of the biggest recipients of these earmarks appears to be Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire, whose district received more than two dozen earmarks totalling more than $100 million. In addition to funding for hospitals, schools, fire stations and other regional projects, the Santa Rosa Democrat’s district secured $250,000 for a private farm-animal rescue.
Lawmakers also allocated tens of millions of dollars from Proposition 4, a $10-billion climate bond voters approved last year. McGuire’s largest earmarks included $50 million from Prop. 4 for a 320-mile redwood trail that runs across his district. Other Prop. 4 earmarks from other districts include $20 million to help the public access a gated Santa Barbara County beach, and $15 million for “geologic heritage sites.”
With interest and other expenses, taxpayers could spend an estimated $16 billion over the next 40 years to fully repay the bond measure. 
Newsom and the 90 Democrats who control the Legislature approved the budget and its earmarks while keeping state worker positions vacant, suspending some health care benefits and foregoing raises for firefighters.
For Susan Shelley, the vice president of communications for the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, politicians like to say, “‘We need money for everything in California,’” she said.

Shelley: “And what are they spending the money on now? Basically gifts to the districts that make the elected representatives look good and that are not essential or not as essential.”

Confusion about CA’s sober housing policy

An apparent miscommunication between Newsom’s administration and a San Francisco lawmaker has led to renewed questions about California’s shift away from its nearly decadeslong “housing first” policy, reports CalMatters’ Marisa Kendall.
In October Newsom spiked a bill that would have allowed counties and cities to use a portion of their state funds to pay for homeless housing projects that require sobriety. Known as “recovery housing,” the measure would have veered away from California’s current housing framework, which requires housing providers to accept homeless people even if they use drugs or alcohol.
In his veto message, Newsom said that “recent guidance” already allows local governments to do this — much to the surprise of the bill’s author, Democratic Assemblymember Matt Haney. The guidance Newsom referred to was a document that was dated July 2025, but was posted online the day after the governor’s veto.
The document also underscores the challenges of requiring sobriety at the potential expense of long-term housing. For instance, the guidance says sober housing providers can’t evict someone for relapsing. But if providers can’t evict people for using drugs or alcohol, Haney argues, they can’t run sober housing effectively.

Haney: “There are some questions as to whether anyone is actually going to step up and do this under the guidelines as written.”

Could CA take the wheel on air quality?

Under President Donald Trump, the Environmental Protection Agency is rolling back federal climate rules. But as the administration weakens regulations for vehicle emissions — arguing that greenhouse gases do not endanger people’s health — some experts say California could use this as an opportunity to lead the way in climate policy.
As CalMatters’ Alejandro Lazo explains, California for decades has been both a laboratory and pioneer for reducing air pollution. The state has set its own vehicle pollution standards as long as it secured federal permission through waivers.
But now that the Trump administration is working to repeal the EPA’s legal authority under the Clean Air Act to set the country’s greenhouse gas rules for vehicles — known as the “endangerment finding” — California could argue it no longer needs federal approval to set its own rules.

Ann Carlson, a former federal official and current law professor at UCLA who first floated the idea: “If greenhouse gases aren’t covered by the Clean Air Act then California could presumably regulate them — and so could every other state.” 

Legal experts agree, however, that this would be a longshot in practice — in addition to opposition from the Trump administration, car and truck makers would likely sue the state to block its attempts to regulate greenhouse gases.

But since his ouster, and now under Prop. 50 maps, the GOP is increasingly isolated.","In summary
In recent years, California Republicans wielded far more influence in Congress than in the state Legislature, thanks to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. But since his ouster, and now under Prop. 50 maps, the GOP is increasingly isolated.


First, they lost their speaker. Then, they lost a key special election. 
Now, with the passage of Proposition 50, California Republicans are poised to lose five congressional seats in next year’s midterms — and with them, any remaining shred of national influence they once held.
The party was already floundering after the ouster and resignation of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a prolific fundraiser who could channel campaign resources to his fellow California Republicans and run interference with the Trump administration and other GOP leadership when they needed to take tough votes.
Absent McCarthy’s arm-twisting in D.C. and with a powerless superminority in both chambers of the state Legislature, California Republicans appear headed for an era of obsolescence, at least for the next five years.
Proposition 50’s landslide win owes its success in part to the abject failure of a disarrayed No on 50 campaign low on funds and unable to keep up with the Yes side’s deluge of savvy advertising. 
McCarthy reportedly told his former Republican congressional colleagues that he would help raise up to $100 million to defeat the measure. But that money never materialized. Instead, his No on 50: Stop the Sacramento Power Grab committee only pulled in $11.6 million, with $1 million of that from McCarthy’s defunct congressional campaign account. 
While the House Republicans’ super PAC pitched in $5 million to the Stop the Power Grab committee and $8 million to the state Republican Party, no financial help came from President Donald Trump or the White House donor circle, and the president only engaged at the last minute to call the election “rigged” and discourage Republicans from trusting mail-in voting.
Rob Stutzman, a California Republican political strategist, said he didn’t know what happened to the promised $100 million, but his best guess is the decision came from Trump and the White House to not open the fundraising floodgates. After all, a Republican from Texas, Missouri or North Carolina is just as valuable to building a House majority as a Republican from California — and far less expensive to elect. 
“Doug LaMalfa and Kevin Kiley and Ken Calvert go to bed at night knowing that Donald Trump just doesn’t care about them and is more than happy to trade them in for a Texan,” Stutzman said. “I don’t think that would’ve happened if McCarthy was still speaker.”
“I think Kevin would’ve fought for his members,” Stutzman added. “They were loyal to him, he was loyal to them, and there would’ve been a fully funded campaign out here.” 
A spokesperson for McCarthy declined to make him available for an interview in time for publication.
New leadership at the helm of California GOP
The disappointing Republican turnout against Prop. 50 and the opposition campaign’s meek closing performance only displayed publicly what party insiders and operatives have been grumbling about behind the scenes for months, ever since the party gained new leadership this spring. 
Corrin Rankin, a former Democrat who voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and “agonized” for weeks before admitting she was a Republican, ascended to chair of the California Republican Party in March after winning a tense election against former state Sen. Mike Morrell. She previously served as vice chair under the outgoing chair, Jessica Millan Patterson, who was widely respected as a McCarthy protegé and a prolific fundraiser and strategist. 
During a historic three-term stint as the party’s first Latina chair, Millan Patterson won praise after turning the party around from its last rock-bottom moment following the 2018 midterm elections. Under her tenure, the party also flipped three legislative seats in 2024 and increased Trump’s vote share in nearly every county. 
But as Rankin was taking over, she reportedly declined her predecessor’s offer to retain a transition team of advisers to help her new staff.
“It’s taken a step backward from Jessica’s leadership and how strong her leadership was because of McCarthy’s perch of power,” Stutzman said of the party.

Rankin and her spokesperson, Matt Shupe, declined multiple interview requests. 
In an emailed statement in response to CalMatters’ questions, Shupe wrote: “Change can be uncomfortable for some people, but we have been reimagining and rebuilding our organization to register new Republicans and win using the latest technology and tactics.”
“We have initiated an after-action review to measure what worked and what we will improve to ensure our highly adaptable, innovative organization, led by Chairwoman Rankin is ready to defeat Democrats in 2026 and beyond,” he wrote. 
In the months since her election, multiple public rifts appear to have shown the lack of faith in Rankin’s ability to successfully steer the party’s fundraising and messaging efforts. 
In July, the Legislature’s then-top Republicans, Assemblymember James Gallagher and Sen. Brian Jones, suddenly announced a change in the decades-old practice of splitting campaign donations between the party and legislative leadership’s re-election committees, known as the “one-ask” policy. That gave the party great legal leeway to distribute campaign donations where they were needed most.
“By and large, no one cares about political parties. They care about elected Republican leaders,” former Sen. Jim Brulte, a former party chair who oversaw the implementation of the one-ask policy in 2001. He said party leaders need to  foster close relationships with state and congressional lawmakers and major donors. Before he sought the chairmanship, he locked up that support, he said. 
“From everything I’ve read, those relationships have withered a little bit,” Brulte said. “They’re not raising as much money as they probably need to. They probably have to repair the relationships that have not been nurtured.” 
Some have privately suggested that the elimination of the arrangement amounted to a rebuke of Rankin’s leadership and a boiling over of legislators’ frustrations that the party was not funneling as much money back to statehouse races. 
Gallagher declined to comment through his spokesman. A spokesman for Jones said he was unavailable to answer questions in time for publication. 
“I think she’s gotten some really bad advice, and we’re seeing it play out in real time. And it’s not been fun,” Brulte said. “I’m disappointed to say that the party has done a good job of making itself irrelevant.”
A divided campaign against Prop. 50
A day after Gov. Gavin Newsom and Democrats in the Legislature engineered a statewide special election to vote on new gerrymandered congressional districts that favor Democrats, opposition mailers started hitting voters’ mailboxes. One was paid for by Republican billionaire and good governance champion Charles Munger Jr., who would go on to sink $33 million of his own money into the fight against Prop. 50.
The other pamphlet, which warned recipients to “stop the political power grab,” was paid for by “Right Path California,” a new group backed by McCarthy and headed by Millan Patterson, flanked by her former leadership team from her days as party chair. 
For the next 10 weeks, it was Millan Patterson and Right Path California, not Rankin and the California Republican Party, that spearheaded the Republican anti-Prop. 50 messaging as Munger and his team worked to energize independents and disaffected Democrats. The party was relegated to getting out the vote, a process that critics say that it botched by wasting money on mailers sent to voters who had already turned in their ballots weeks before. 
“I just don’t think there’s respect for the money donated to the party by the people that are spending the money,” said Cathy Abernathy, a Bakersfield-based Republican strategist. She said she was disappointed that opponents of Prop. 50 didn’t appeal directly to Republicans by putting Trump and other elected leaders’ faces on materials, so she worked with the Kern County party to send out her own. 
“The mail I designed was Shannon Grove, Congressman Vince Fong, Kevin McCarthy, and Donald Trump right on the cover,” she said. “Every piece of mail I got paid for by some statewide group with ties to the Republican Party, or the Republican Party, the smallest word on the mailer, the smallest word was ‘paid for the Republican Party.’ There was no word ‘Republican’ other than that.”
‘We left it all on the field.’California Republican Party chair Corrin Rankin on the party’s ‘No’ campaign against Proposition 50.
When asked at a press conference to respond to critics of her leadership, Rankin stood firm and said she was “very proud” of the party’s work opposing Prop. 50.
“We left it all on the field,” Rankin said. “Everyone worked incredibly hard. I’m proud of our staff. I’m proud of our central committees, and I think we did an incredible job. We worked as a team, and we are 100% united.”
As of Oct. 31, the party still had $2.85 million left in its state and federal accounts, according to an internal presentation given to the board of directors and obtained by CalMatters.
There’s no denying that the double-whammy of losing McCarthy and now several powerful incumbent GOP seats will diminish the party’s clout in Washington, putting even more pressure on the state party to fend for itself.
“Matt Gaetz destroyed the California Republican Party infrastructure that we had,” said Stutzman, the Republican adviser, using an expletive to describe the former Florida congressman who engineered McCarthy’s ouster. “McCarthy would’ve made sure there was a No campaign that resonated because it would’ve been funded.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/090625_CA-GOP-OC_JAH_CM_17.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-07 09:01:34.041882

California lawmakers faced a difficult budget year, but they still managed to put hundreds of millions of dollars in earmarks in the state budget to benefit their districts — and help them get re-elected.


Despite facing a $12 billion deficit this year, California’s Legislature still managed to spend at least $415 million for local projects to help lawmakers win their next elections. 
CalMatters found close to 100 earmarks inserted into just one of the state’s budget bills for local projects and programs that had little apparent benefit to anyone outside the lawmakers’ districts.
Some of the earmarks raise concerns about legislative priorities in a difficult budget year, such as lawmakers spending millions from the general fund on museums, trails, parks and other amenities in wealthy communities.The spending includes $5 million in general fund money for a LGBTQ+ venue in high-cost San Francisco, $2.5 million for a private day school in Southern California and $250,000 for a private farm-animal rescue on the North Coast.
Around $250 million of the local-project earmarks were funds taken from the $10 billion Proposition 4 climate bond California voters approved last year. 
Some of the Prop. 4 earmarks included: 

$26 million to programs paying farmers for private land conservation.


$20 million to help the public access a Southern California beach gated off by a wealthy community.


$15 million for “geologic heritage sites” including the La Brea Tar Pits — whose fossils have been used to study climate change in the last epoch.

The earmarks were approved at the same time Gov. Gavin Newsom and lawmakers left state worker positions unfilled, suspended some health care benefits, forewent raises for firefighters, filled budget holes with high-interest bond money and took billions of dollars from the state’s “rainy day” emergency fund.
Kristen Cox, executive director of the Long Beach Community Table foodbank, said the money lawmakers spent this year to enhance communities in their districts — often for projects that some would consider frills — isn’t going to the neediest Californians.
“It’s misprioritization,” she said. “My priorities are to help the people that need it the most. Their priorities seem to be ‘Let’s make this city look gentrified and pretty and beautiful.’” 
A secret process that benefits lawmakers
Many of the earmarks — one-time allotments of cash for a specific purpose or project — are fairly benign and went to local infrastructure needs such as fire stations, parks, public schools and environmental projects. 
They also represent just a small portion of the state’s $321 billion budget, which pays for programs and services that typically are intended to help all of California. 
But inside the notoriously secretive budget negotiation process, lawmakers also have the ability to set aside sizable chunks of money to benefit their districts through an even more opaque earmark system. 
It allows them to direct money to their pet projects without leaving a fingerprint — at least until they issue a press release touting a new community perk or show up for ribbon-cutting and check-passing ceremonies.
Such spending, disparagingly called “pork-barrel spending” or “pork” for short, is hardly new or unique to California, said Thad Kousser, a former legislative staffer and political science professor at UC San Diego. He has extensively studied equity in how politicians divide up budgets for local needs.

There’s a reason it’s pervasive: When politicians keep the cash flowing back home, it helps them get re-elected, he said.
“Politicians across generations — and in every country — try to use some portion of the budget on these clear signals that they’re directing the flow of government dollars to real people and real organizations right at home in their district,” he said. “Voters reward that.”
Eyeing higher office? Send pork home
The biggest recipient of the earmarks in Senate Bill 105 appears to be the North Coast Senate district of Democratic Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire. After losing his legislative leadership seat this year, he seems to be positioning himself for a congressional bid, according to The Santa Rosa Press Democrat. If he does run, he’ll be able to tout all the cash he brought to his Senate district this year. 
His district was the recipient of more than two dozen earmarks totalling more than $100 million, accounting for a quarter of the earmark funds CalMatters identified. They went to fund a regional hospital, harbors, habitat projects, schools and fire stations. His district also received $250,000 for the farm-animal rescue.

His largest earmarks included $50 million in Prop. 4 funds for a redwood trail that’s to run 320 miles across his district.
McGuire’s office didn’t make him available for an interview. McGuire instead sent an emailed statement defending the earmarks.
“Our state’s budget includes smart, one-time investments across California,” McGuire said. “Many in our state have been working on these projects for years to make California safer, stronger and more resilient.”
Sen. Scott Wiener, the powerful Senate Budget Committee chairperson from San Francisco, is definitely running for higher office. Wiener announced last month he’s running for Nancy Pelosi’s congressional seat.
The budget included at least $9 million in general fund earmarks benefiting the voters of San Francisco who will decide whether to send him to Washington, D.C. The money went for parks, restroom improvements and “to support the preservation and revitalization of a historic LGBTQ+ venue” in the city’s Castro neighborhood, according to the budget bill which doesn’t name the venue. 
San Francisco is also slated to receive $1 million for a new oncology clinic and chemotherapy center for Chinese Hospital and $250,000 for “accessibility improvements” to Wah Mei child development center.
Wiener’s office didn’t respond to interview requests.
Lawmakers complained of earmarks
None of the earmarks have a lawmaker’s name on them, making it extremely difficult for members of the public — or even other lawmakers — to decipher whose they are and which districts benefited. The governor’s administration is responsible for some.
Legislative staff told CalMatters while reporting this story that earmark requests sent to budget committees aren’t public records. 
CalMatters instead used the Digital Democracy database’s ‘Find your legislators’ tool to triangulate which pork projects are in which lawmakers’ districts from earmarks inserted into SB 105. That’s one of 40 budget-related bills Newsom signed this year.
There are almost certainly more earmarks buried in the other budget measures.
The secretive nature of earmarks — and the number and size of them this year — became a source of contention in September at the Senate Budget and Fiscal Review Committee. 
Some Democratic lawmakers complained that so many last-minute earmarks had popped up in the spending bills. They questioned whether the earmarks were being fairly distributed to communities with the most need.
“For the climate bond money, the general fund money, the Medi-Cal money, the Department of Education money, across the transit money, in almost every one, there is at least one — sometimes 40 — specific allocations,” Sacramento Sen. Christopher Cabaldon told the committee. 
“The broader concern about equity and balance in those earmarks is certainly a point really well taken,” said Sen. Ben Allen, a Democrat representing the El Segundo area.
Nonetheless, none of the 90 Democrats who control the Legislature voted against the budget this year, according to Digital Democracy.Newsom also signed it into law. His office didn’t respond to an interview request. 
Susan Shelley of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association blasted the pork-project spending as hypocritical, especially as some liberal groups and lawmakers support raising taxes or turning to voters to pass new bonds to prop up the state’s shaky finances.
Politicians, she said, like to say, “‘We need money for everything in California.’ And what are they spending the money on now? Basically gifts to the districts that make the elected representatives look good and that are not essential or not as essential.”
Pork in Prop. 4 
About $275 million in Prop. 4 funds also went to backfill the state’s general fund budget covering existing environmental, fire and energy programs and for expenses such as deferred maintenance at state parks. 
Using bond funds to pay for existing expenses in the general fund means there’s less bond money available to pay for the new expenditures voters thought they were supporting. The separate bond earmarks from lawmakers reflect their priorities and may not necessarily be what voters wanted either. Some of the lawmakers’ earmarks include: 

$40 million to secure public access to a beach blocked off by the wealthy gated Hollister Ranch community in Santa Barbara County and for a separate dam-removal project. Both projects are in the district of Sen. Monique Limón, who is replacing McGuire as the Senate Democratic leader next year. She shares a district with a handful of assemblymembers who may have sought the earmarks. 


Limón’s district also received $1 million for a museum in Santa Barbara “for an interactive water exhibit.” Limón replied to an interview request with an email from her spokesperson, Christina Montoya. “While the senator was not involved in Prop. 4 allocations,” Montoya said, “she is glad to see projects funded that advance the goals of the state.”

$1 million went to the UC Davis Integrative Center for Alternative Meat and Protein, primarily at the request of San Jose Assemblymember Ash Kalra. UC Davis isn’t in Kalra’s district, but he’s a vegan and the chair of the Assembly Select Committee On Alternative Protein Innovation.


The $15 million earmark “for geologic heritage sites” including the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles was from Democratic Assemblymember Isaac Bryan. His office didn’t make him available for an interview.

Taxpayers will pay at least $6 billion in interest and other expenses to finance Prop. 4 over the next four decades.
Using Prop. 4 to pay farmers 
An example of how earmarks lock up Prop. 4 funds can be found in this year’s budget for the Wildlife Conservation Board. The $10 billion bond is supposed to provide $1 billion for the board to give out as grants in the coming years. The board uses a competitive process that prioritizes habitat project proposals to provide the most ecological benefits for California.
This year, the Legislature gave the board $339 million in Prop. 4 money to spend. But about a quarter of it — $88 million — is going to projects the board must now fund because of  lawmakers’ earmarks. 
Gregg Hart, a Santa Barbara Democratic assemblymember, got one of the biggest earmarks from the board’s funds — $16 million for a conservation easement on Rancho San Julian, a 13,000-acre private ranch in his district. Conservation easements are legal agreements that ensure private lands don’t get sold and turned into environmentally unfriendly developments. 
In an interview, Hart said preserving the ranch’s habitat in perpetuity is in line with what voters intended when they voted for Prop. 4.

“In my district, this is a signature ranch that is an environmental gem,” Hart said. “And preserving that is a very high-value project.”
The conservation board also must allocate $10 million in Prop. 4 earmarks to programs that will pay farmers and private wetland landowners in the Central Valley to flood their fields to provide habitat for waterbirds. 
Central Valley farmers already have received hundreds of millions of dollars in federal crop subsidies over the decades.
The flooded-field earmarks came from Democratic Sen. Jerry McNerney, who represents the Stockton area, and Assemblymember Cecilia Aguiar-Curry representing the Davis area.
In an emailed statement, McNerney called the $10 million expenditure a “win-win for farmers and for wetlands … ensuring that migratory birds have places to rest and refuel on their long journey on the Pacific Flyway.”
The total number of earmarks relying on Prop. 4 funds has Senate Republican Leader Brian Jones of San Diego saying, “I told you so.” He urged voters to reject the bond last year. 
“It was going to be pork,” he said. “It was going to be earmarked projects that the legislators are going to be able to move …. into things that really didn’t have anything to do with the story that was being told to the voters when they voted.”
Jones’ district was the recipient of some pork, though he said he made no requests for Prop. 4 money. His earmarks were from the general fund. They include $1.4 million for San Diego County dam repairs and $615,000 to the San Diego Mountain Biking Association “for building and maintaining public trails for mountain biking.” 
‘What did we get?’ from the general fund
Other notable earmarks from general fund dollars, separate from the climate bond, include large one-time allocations for projects to benefit the state’s Jewish community. The Legislature has an  18-member Jewish Caucus.The funds include $15 million for the Museum of Tolerance and the Holocaust Memorial in Los Angeles as well as $5.4 million for the Jewish Community Center of the East Bay.

An earmark for $2.5 million also went “for security and other infrastructure” at Milken Community School East Campus, a private Los Angeles Jewish school with annual tuition of nearly $55,000.
The school is in Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel’s and Sen. Henry Stern’s districts. Stern’s office said the earmark for the private school wasn’t his. Gabriel co-chairs the Legislative Jewish Caucus with Wiener. Gabriel also oversees the Assembly Budget Committee. He didn’t return messages. Neither did the school.Gabriel this week attended a check-passing ceremony at the Discovery Cube in Los Angeles. He and two other local lawmakers touted getting the children’s museum a $5 million earmark from Prop. 4 funds.
Other earmarks using general fund money included at least $1.7 million for trail improvements and an urban garden in Democratic Sen. Catherine Blakespear’s wealthy coastal district, as well as $3.6 million for the Oceanside Museum of Art. 
Blakespear responded to an interview request with an emailed statement.
“I’m grateful that these impactful community projects were funded through the state’s general fund,” she said. “I know they will provide immense value to these communities and their residents and are deserving of funding.”
She announced this week she would be appearing at a check-passing ceremony for one of her earmarks: $1.2 million to the city of Mission Viejo for the Oso Creek Trail Improvement Project.
Former Stockton-area Democratic state Sen. Susan Talamantes Eggman said such earmarks are hardly surprising. She was proud to bring back to her district $10 million in her last term to reopen two dilapidated community swimming pools.  
“I mean, that is fantastic for my district,” she said. 
But she acknowledged it is a lot harder for lawmakers to justify those sorts of expenses when there are so many of them in a difficult budget year. 
“I think you either hope that (people) won’t find out, or they see what stuff they’re getting, and they’re like, ‘Oh, all right, well, as long as we got ours,’ right?” she said. “What people are more concerned about is equity. ‘What did we get?’”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091225_End-Of-Session_FG_CM_08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-07 09:01:34.041882

California is under pressure to embrace more temporary homeless shelters and programs that require sobriety, at the potential expense of long-term housing.


When Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill last month that would have supported sober homeless housing, his reason left many scratching their heads.
Newsom said Assembly Bill 255, which would have allowed cities to use up to 10% of their state funds to pay for “recovery housing,” was unnecessary. That’s because using state funds for sober housing is already allowed, the governor said. He said “recent guidance” makes that clear.
That was a big surprise to Assemblymember Matt Haney, who had spent the past two years working on the bill Newsom was now saying had been moot all along. Haney had been under the impression that California’s “housing first” rule — which dictates that homelessness programs offer housing to people regardless of their sobriety, mental health, employment, etc. — meant sober housing wasn’t eligible for state funds.
When CalMatters asked about the “recent guidance” that allows the state to fund sober housing, the governor’s office sent a link to a 20-page document. No one CalMatters spoke to had ever seen that document before. Neither had Haney, anyone in his office, or the other stakeholders involved in his bill, including the service providers trying to build more sober housing, he said. 
While the document was dated July, 2025, it wasn’t published online until Oct. 2 — the day after Newsom’s veto.
“I think it’s a terrible bureaucratic failure,” Haney said of the lack of communication. Having the state and the Legislature work together, rather than on separate parallel policies, would have saved everyone time and resources, he said. 
“Why didn’t anybody say anything over the course of two years,” Haney asked, “not just to me, but to the cities, counties and providers who desperately wanted to open these beds?”
The California Interagency Council on Homelessness, which has been working on the document since late 2024, put the blame on Haney’s office for not reaching out. A preliminary draft was publicly available earlier this year as part of a February council meeting, said Executive Officer Meghan Marshall.
The new sober housing guidelines come at a time when the state is facing political pressure from some facets to shift its approach to homeless housing – both to embrace drug-free housing and to turn at least some of its focus from permanent housing that accepts everyone to temporary shelter that may come with strings attached. 
A group of legislators, city housing staffers and nonprofits recently took a trip to San Antonio, Texas to tour a massive homeless shelter there, and returned with ideas on how to beef up California’s shelter capacity — which some on the trip say has been neglected as a casualty of California’s strict preference for long-term housing. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump’s administration has signalled that it will shift federal money away from permanent housing and into temporary shelter, while also imposing conditions such as sobriety. California might have to get on board with that agenda, or risk losing federal funds.
While few California Democrats are supportive of anything Trump does, the continued prevalence of encampments on the streets has convinced some that the state should change its tactics. 
“We need to break the logjam of the dogma that says that only permanent housing is acceptable,” said Sen. Catherine Blakespear, a Democrat from Encinitas. “Because what we’re de facto saying is that people are going to stay on the streets until we’ve built enough permanent housing or market-rate housing, and neither is on track to meet the need anywhere in the near term.”
But that push has some service providers worried that, in an environment where homelessness funding keeps getting cut, focusing on sober housing and temporary housing will mean less money for the permanent housing that ends people’s homelessness.
“The current trend shifts away from solving the actual lack of a home and focuses on some people’s associated issues,” said Jennifer Loving, CEO of Destination Home.
The debate over sober, temporary, or permanent housing doesn’t address the underlying income inequality that causes many Californians to lose housing in the first place and prevents their being able to afford housing afterward. 
The deal with sober housing
California has required state-funded homeless housing be “housing first” since 2016, meaning it gets people into a permanent home as quickly as possible without forcing them to jump through additional hoops. The idea is that once someone is safely housed, it becomes much easier for them to get sober, find a job or take care of other issues.
Haney argues the model prevented the state from funding sober housing, which he said could be lifesaving for people who are overcoming an addiction and don’t want to live next to neighbors using drugs.
The new state guidance says sober housing can be housing first, if it’s done right. It must be the client’s choice to get sober and live in recovery housing, and they must have other local options that don’t require sobriety. In addition, sober housing providers can’t evict someone for relapsing. If a client decides they no longer want to live in sober housing, the provider must connect them to another housing option. 
The guidance is more permissive than Haney’s bill. While the bill would have capped state funding on sober housing at 10%, the state guidance has no limit. But Haney worries it’s too strict in other ways. If housing providers can’t evict someone for using drugs or alcohol, they can’t run effective sober housing, Haney said.
“There are some questions as to whether anyone is actually going to step up and do this under the guidelines as written,” he said. 
The state guidelines come with no money to open new sober housing beds.
Without extra funding, as more money goes to sober housing, that means less money for low-barrier housing, said Loving, who worries that shift will move the state backward. Sober housing and drug testing were the norm in the 1980s and 1990s, but people still overdosed in those environments, she said.
“Drugs were always present, even in sober living environments,” Loving said. “And that did not increase our housing outcomes. What increased our housing outcomes was the availability of actual houses for people to transition into.”
Temporary or permanent housing?
Several dozen California legislators, city housing workers and nonprofit providers traveled to Texas last month to visit a massive homeless shelter in San Antonio. Haven for Hope fits about 1,500 people on one 22-acre campus — meaning that almost anyone in the city who wants to can sleep indoors. Most of those people are required to stay sober in order to keep their spot, and healthcare, counseling and other services are offered on site.
That program is a sharp contrast from the “discouraging results” of California’s homelessness strategy, said Sen. Dave Cortese, a Democrat from San Jose who went on the trip. He’s frustrated with what he sees as California’s neglect of temporary shelter. New programs such as Newsom’s Homekey only fund permanent housing. So did the Measure A affordable housing bond in Santa Clara County. 
Long-term housing is the only way to resolve someone’s homelessness, which is why it has been the gold standard in the state. But it can take years to build, and voters aren’t always patient.
“If you push all your chips to the middle of the table on permanent supportive housing, you start to lose your constituency because constituents are coming by in their cars every day and seeing more tents and more illegal encampments,” Cortese said. “And their thought process is, ‘I thought we just put a billion dollars into eradicating homelessness. What’s going on? Why is it getting worse?’”

Land is scarce and expensive in California, which would make it hard to replicate a shelter as large as Haven for Hope. But city staff in San Jose are looking into whether some version of it can be done there, said Housing Director Erik Soliván, who was on the Texas trip.
While it may seem unusual for the Golden State to look to Texas in search of advice on social services, Californians have been awed by Haven for Hope for years. CalMatters wrote about the phenomenon in 2023. 
The Texas shelter has made some changes since then. About 1,600 people slept in the shelter in 2023, and the facility served 85% of the city’s homeless population. 
But even that giant facility couldn’t hold everyone. The space was overcrowded, with hundreds of people sleeping on the floor on mats inches apart. Haven for Hope had to pause enrollments and put new rules in place to limit who can come in. In the last fiscal year, the population was down to an average of 1,453 people per night. About 60% of those are in a program that regularly conducts drug and breathalyzer tests.

The South Coast Air Quality Management District Board of Governors should vote against the so-called cooperative agreement to curb emissions in the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, because impacted community members were not meaningfully included, it weakens the district’s ability to reduce emissions and it creates a dangerous precedent.  
The toxic pollution experienced daily by nearby community members isn’t new. The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are the busiest in the country. We have known for decades that port emissions shorten life expectancy and quality of life in the South Coast Air Basin, which encompasses parts of Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties and all of Orange County.
These pollution-burdened areas are called “diesel death zones” due to the adverse health impacts. In places like West Long Beach, life expectancy is up to eight years shorter than the county average. Throughout the basin, there are an estimated 2,400 pollution related deaths a year.
Both ports have made air quality improvements, but the complex is still the single largest fixed source of emissions in southern California. 
And the toxins are only going to increase. Cargo activity at the ports is expected to rise 57% from 2021 to 2032. We can expect the human death toll to rise alongside it.
There is a process underway with the South Coast Air Quality Management District — the governing body charged with regulating port pollution — that has the potential to address these grave health outcomes.
Communities harmed by the pollution have consistently asked the district to incorporate their feedback when identifying solutions, but the district has not meaningfully engaged them. Instead, it has sided with industry time and again, allowing it to dictate the flow and outcomes of the process. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom recently declined to sign Senate Bill 34, citing concerns that it would limit the South Coast Air Quality Management District’s authority to regulate port emissions and would interfere with cooperative actions taking place with the ports.
We agree with Newsom’s assessment that regulatory authority and cooperation can avoid the worst health impacts — except the cooperation he refers to as “locally driven and collaborative” has been anything but.  
The cooperative agreement includes a five-year ban on rulemaking. That handcuffs South Coast Air Quality Management District, effectively blocking the agency’s authority to address port pollution when the South Coast Air Basin can least afford a delay.

This ban on rulemaking not only impacts the ports of LA and Long Beach but every port in the district. It also sets a dangerous precedent that could spur other air districts to eliminate public participation in rulemaking processes and prioritize industry priorities over public health. 
Instead of advancing the cooperative agreement, the South Coast Air Quality Management District’s board should provide more time to meaningfully and collaboratively engage local communities and consider public health implications.  
This doesn’t have to be a zero-sum game. We can chart a path that addresses port pollution, improves quality of life and recognizes the role ports play in our global supply chains. 
But that won’t happen without communities taking a meaningful place at the table.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/021225-Port-of-LA-JAJ-CM-24.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-07 09:01:34.041882

(Getty Images)A proclamation has yet to be issued announcing the date and agenda of a much rumored, unofficially announced special legislative session, which may happen as soon as next week. However, it is largely expected that the proposal to massively expand Nevada’s film tax credit program will be among the things up for consideration.
In preparation for the Summerlin Studio: The Squeakquel (apologies to Alvin and the Chipmunks), which was a spinoff of a “one bill, two studios” proposal from a prior session, here’s a recap of what the state’s film tax credit is, what the backers of the expansion want it to be, and how we got to this point.
What’s a film tax credit program?
Nevada’s film tax credit program was established in 2013 and pitched as a way to bring new jobs to the state and boost an economy still reeling from the Great Recession. Democrat Aaron Ford — then a state senator, now attorney general and gubernatorial candidate — spearheaded the effort.
Legislative failure aside, Nevada still has film tax credits, and MrBeast wants another $2.5m worth

The state’s program is is intended to lure productions to Nevada by offering a financial incentive — transferable tax credits, which we’ll explain in more depth shortly.
Nevada’s film tax credit program is currently capped at $10 million per year.
The last iteration of the film tax credit bill proposed raising the $10 million per year cap to $120 million per year, for 15 years, beginning in 2028. The majority of those transferable tax credits, $95 million per year, would be reserved for productions taking place at a proposed film studio in the Summerlin neighborhood in Las Vegas. The remaining $25 million per year would be for productions not attached to the studio.
Altogether, that’s equivalent to $1.8 billion in public subsidies for the television and film industry. It would be the largest public subsidy in Nevada’s history, eclipsing the two Tesla megadeals and the football stadium.
Fiscal staff for the state have described transferable tax credits as “negative revenue” because the state has to account for the tax credits when setting the state revenue forecast each biennium. They do impact the state budget.
Projects subsidized by transferable tax credits are supposed to grow the economy and raise revenue to offset themselves, but the actual return on investment is dubious, according to analyses from other states, from think tanks, and from the state’s own economic development agency.
Proponents of the film tax credit bill have argued incentive programs in other states are not comparable to what’s being proposed in Nevada because those do not involve the building of a massive 31-acre studio. The Lincy Institute, in a policy brief on the film tax credit proposal, concluded that the state would likely be better off supporting construction and building through its existing Nevada State Infrastructure Bank.
How transferable tax credits work
The state incentivizes film and television production companies to shoot in Nevada by offering them transferrable tax credits.
Production companies can get, as a transferable tax credit, 15% of qualified production costs and either 12% or 15% of wages and salaries. There are also some bonuses available for using majority Nevada residents as workers or shooting in rural areas.
But most production companies won’t owe in taxes more than the transferable tax credit they receive. So, they turn around and sell them to other companies with bigger tax burdens. Transferable tax credits sell for less than face value — a discount of about 10% isn’t unusual.
So, let’s say the state issues Sony $50 million of tax credits. MGM Resorts International could buy them from Sony for $45 million. Then, instead of paying the state $50 million in gaming taxes, MGM gives the state the tax credits it bought from Sony.
MGM would get a $5 million tax break. Sony gets $45 million. And the state, which otherwise would have received $50 million in tax revenue from MGM, gets nothing.
Details about who’s buying transferable tax credits, and for how much, are not public record. However, the Nevada Film Office does disclose through annual reports what the transferable tax credits were applied toward. In the most recent fiscal year, the credits were largely applied to the insurance premium tax, which is levied on insurance companies based on the premiums they collect from policies issued in the state. Some transferable tax credits also applied to the state’s gaming percentage fee and modified business tax.
Opponents of the film tax credit bill describe a “Hollywood handout” but Sony wouldn’t be the only deep-pocketed corporation to benefit from an expanded film tax credit program.
A recap of last season/session
State Sen. Roberta Lange, a Democrat from Las Vegas, during the 2023 Legislative session unveiled an eye-popping $4.9 billion proposal to massively expand the state’s existing transferable film tax credit program. The legislation would have set up not one but two film studios in Southern Nevada.
Lange has said she worked on the project for years with Birtcher Development and the University of Nevada Las Vegas when Howard Hughes Corporation and Sony Pictures Entertainment decided they wanted their own studio.
Lange’s 2023 proposal failed to make it to a floor vote. She vowed to continue working on the proposal and reintroduce the legislation during the 2025 Legislative Session.
Parallel film tax credit proposals should be single bill, says sponsor (of one of them)

But at some point during that interim period, Sony ditched Lange and teamed up with Democratic Assemblymembers Sandra Jauregui and Daniele Monreo-Moreno. Lange has said the company “went radio silent” on her.
So, during the 2025 Legislative Session, Lange introduced a bill to back just the Birtcher/UNLV project known as Nevada Film Studios. Jauregui and Monroe-Moreno introduced their competing bill known as the Summerlin Studios Project with Howard Hughes and Sony.
Lange’s bill was given a Senate committee hearing but advanced no further. She pushed for the bills to merge again.
Jauregui’s bill narrowly passed the Assembly. It was listed on the agenda for a full Senate vote in the last hour of the session but lawmakers hit the statutory deadline for ending the session before it could be voted on.
Where do lawmakers stand?
Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo in February, at the start of the legislative session, expressed skepticism about expanding the film tax credit program, saying it didn’t seem like good state policy. But the governor also said “the devil’s in the details” and that he would consider it. He never vowed to veto the bill, as he did with other high-profile proposals during the session.

Over the summer, Lombardo acknowledged the film tax credit expansion proposal was not dead and could potentially appear during a special session sometime this year. As governor, he issues the proclamation calling the Legislature into session, and he sets the agenda for the session.
Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro was largely quiet on the issue of film tax credits  when they were discussed in the 2023 and 2025 regular sessions, but last month she threw her support behind the project, appearing at a rally held by the labor union-backed political action committee pushing the proposal, according to The Nevada Independent.
Three other state senators representing parts of Southern Nevada — Republican John Steinbeck and Democrats Rochelle Nguyen and Marilyn Dondero Loop — also attended that rally, the Independent reported.
Senate Minority Leader Robin Titus (R-Wellington) has publicly come out in opposition of expanding the program, telling Newsmakers she’d done her due diligence by speaking to Georgia state lawmakers about their expansive film tax credit program. Titus said in a webinar earlier this week that members of her caucus have said they cannot give “an absolute” position until they’ve seen the language of the bill.
Support for the film tax credit proposal does not fall on clear partisan lines. That much is evident in the Assembly, which narrowly passed a version of the film tax credit bill in the waning days of this year’s regular legislative session. A tie vote would have meant the measure failed.
Among the 27 Democrats in the Assembly, 15 voted in support and 12 voted against. Among Republicans, seven supported and eight opposed. Here’s a reminder of who voted what on the film tax credit bill:
Since that vote, Republican Assemblymembers Toby Yurek and Ken Gray vacated their seats. The former supported the measure while the latter voted against it.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)A fight over which states along the Colorado River have to cut their water use may still be damming up negotiations like the towering concrete of Lake Powell. 
But time is running out. Utah and six other states are days away from their Nov. 11 deadline to reach a deal on how to manage the dwindling river and its reservoirs. If they don’t, the federal government has said it will decide for them. The existing agreement expires at the end of 2026. 
Here are five things to know as the due date approaches: 
Talks are tense
Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs gave a glimpse into negotiations when she called out the upstream states this week, saying they’re taking an “extreme negotiating position” and refusing to commit to water cuts.

See all of our stories about how Utahns are impacted by the Colorado River at greatsaltlakenews.org/coloradoriver


The Upper Basin states of Utah, Colorado, New Mexico and Wyoming have resisted mandatory cuts in dry years, saying they generally use less than they’re allocated. The Lower Basin states of Arizona, California and Nevada have said all seven should share water cuts during dry years.
Hobbs said a plan “where we shoulder the entirety of the water reductions while not one single acre-foot is put on the table by the Upper Basin states is an unacceptable outcome for Arizona families, farmers and businesses,” the Arizona Daily Star reported. 
“This is the extreme negotiating position we are confronted with as the Upper Basin states, led by Colorado, continue to run down the clock,” Hobbs said while speaking at a conference in Tucson Wednesday. A Democrat, she called on the Trump administration to step in and broker a deal.
Utah’s negotiator is still optimistic 
Gene Shawcroft, Utah’s Colorado River commissioner, seemed more positive. He said Thursday the states are “making steady progress,” but didn’t go into specifics.

“These are incredibly complex negotiations, and we’re continuing to work through some challenging issues,” Shawcroft said in a statement. He went on to say the states are “making steady progress on key issues the federal government has identified, aiming to reach broad alignment by November 11 — even if the finer details come later.”
He said he’s hopeful the states can agree on a framework before their next deadline to submit a proposal to the federal government in February. 
“Utah remains fully committed to defending every drop of Colorado River water to protect our communities and water users,” Shawcroft said. 
The debate ultimately could land in court if the deal results in mandatory cuts that Utah wants to fight with a lawsuit, or if the Lower Basin states make a case the Upper Basin isn’t delivering the water it’s obligated to.  
An already dwindling water supply could shrink more before a new plan’s in place
The Colorado River Basin has no more water today than in 2022, when reservoirs Lake Powell and Lake Mead made headlines for hitting historic lows, said Jack Schmidt, a professor emeritus in watershed sciences at Utah State University. 
“We’re sort of like the frog in the pot of water whose temperature keeps getting a little bit hotter,” Schmidt told Utah News Dispatch Thursday. “We’ve now gotten kind of used to it, but we have a serious problem right now.” 
Water managers are hoping for a bailout in the form of a big winter that will bring greater runoff and snowpack than normal. 
“That’s not a situation you ever want to be in, and that’s the position we’re in,” Schmidt said.

Farms use most of the water  
Agriculture uses roughly 80% of the river’s water, and a little more than half goes into growing livestock feed, including alfalfa and hay.
“From that perspective, we have a tremendous amount of flexibility in how we manage the system, and so from that perspective, we don’t have a crisis,” Schmidt said. “We simply have to change how we allocate water and use water.”
That’s already happening on some farms. Several Utah farmers are profiting from letting certain fields fallow, meaning they take a break from planting crops there. They lease the water they don’t use to the government. 
Paying farmers for the conserved water has proved cost-effective, according to a comprehensive study focused on Colorado River conservation and supply projects.
There’s a gap in permanent leadership at the federal agency managing water in the West 
There’s still no permanent boss at the federal agency working with states on the plan. President Donald Trump picked Arizona water expert Ted Cooke to head the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation in June, and Cooke was praised for his expertise at the time. 
But the Trump administration withdrew Cooke’s nomination in September. Cooke told the Associated Press that he’d “been sacrificed on the altar of political expediency.” A deputy chief of the agency has been serving as acting commissioner since January.

One reason to try is to protect the state’s clean-car economy.","In summary
Legal experts, including a former federal official and UCLA professor, say California could go it alone if the federal government stops regulating greenhouse gases. One reason to try is to protect the state’s clean-car economy.


California has long cast itself as the nation’s climate conscience — and its policy lab.
Now, as the Environmental Protection Agency moves to revoke the backbone of federal climate rules — the scientific finding that greenhouse gases threaten human health — one of the state’s top climate officials is weighing a provocative idea put forward by environmental law experts: If Washington retreats, California could lead on carbon-controlling regulation.  
Absent what’s known as the endangerment finding, the EPA may soon consider abandoning the legal authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gases from vehicles, power plants and other sources, furthering the Trump Administration’s stated aim to dismantle U.S. climate policy. 
While decrying the prospect of such a move, climate advocates say a repeal would yield a silver lining: California and other states could in theory set their own greenhouse gas rules for cars and trucks, regulations previously superseded by federal authority.
Cars and trucks represent more than a third of California’s greenhouse gas emissions. A long shot regulatory gambit could clean some of the nation’s dirtiest air – and keep the state’s clean-car transition alive.
“All options are currently on the table,” Lauren Sanchez, chair of the California Air Resources Board, told CalMatters in an interview.
Authority states have never had before
A former federal official and expert on the Clean Air Act – who is also a law professor at UCLA – first floated this idea. 
Ann Carlson wrote in the law journal Environmental Forum that an aggressive federal action against climate policy “could, ironically, provide states with authority they’ve never had before.”
The Trump administration now argues that greenhouse gases do not endanger health and that regulation is more harmful — a claim widely rejected by scientists, businesses and environmental groups, as well as states, including California.

“If greenhouse gases aren’t covered by the Clean Air Act,” Carlson told CalMatters, “then California could presumably regulate them — and so could every other state.”
Carlson, who ran the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration until last year and has written extensively about the landmark law, argues that the act only preempts state rules for pollutants it actually covers. States “have a pretty strong legal argument” to regulate greenhouse gases, she said.
The EPA, for its part, argues that states would still be barred from setting their own standards, arguing that its broad authority over air pollution covers even emissions the agency chooses not to regulate. That’s a view shared by the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade association and lobbying group, which supported overturning California’s phaseout of new, gas-powered cars, as well as the American Trucking Associations, which has opposed some of California’s rules on trucks.
Carlson said that argument doesn’t hold up. In her Environmental Forum article, she wrote: “If Congress didn’t intend the act to cover greenhouse gases, as the administration argues, then it’s hard to believe Congress intended to preempt states and localities from regulating them.”
In other words, she says, preemption has its limits. 
Other experts agreed the idea is worth considering. 
Ethan Elkind, who directs the climate program at UC Berkeley’s Center for Law, Energy and the Environment, said that states are free to “do whatever they want,” as long as the federal government hasn’t preempted them. 
Not a slam dunk for California to step in
For the better part of a century, California has worked to curb air pollution at the state and local level. The state’s vanguard status positions it well to test Trump’s move to curb federal climate regulation, say experts. 
“I personally would be advocating that they move ahead,” said Mary Nichols, a former air board chair. “And if I were there, I would be looking to gain support for doing it.”
California holds a unique status under federal law. It can set tougher tailpipe-emission standards than the rest of the country — a recognition of its early leadership in fighting smog. Since 1968, the state has obtained more than 100 federal waivers for its vehicle rules, and other states can adopt California’s standards under certain conditions.
UC Berkeley law professor Daniel Farber said the state could even take a dual-track approach. “We don’t really think we need a waiver,” he would argue after EPA abandons the field, “but just in case we do: yes, give us one.”
California’s latest clash with Washington stems from a decades-long dance over who sets the nation’s toughest clean-car rules.
The state’s strict vehicle rules have helped spur innovations from catalytic converters to cleaner fuel to electric cars. The regulatory push began in Los Angeles after skies grew so smog-choked they stung peoples’ eyes.
In 1966, California adopted the nation’s first tailpipe standards. When Congress passed the 1970 Clean Air Act, it gave the state rare authority to set tougher rules — making California both a laboratory and a trailblazer, so long as it secured a federal waiver.
In 2002, California passed the nation’s first law regulating greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. The Supreme Court’s 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA ruling confirmed those gases are pollutants under federal law, leading to the Obama administration’s 2009 “endangerment finding” that they harm public health.
Such a move would fit California’s pattern of pushing first and asking permission later. In 2005, the state adopted its greenhouse-gas standards for vehicles and sought a waiver before it was even clear whether carbon qualified as pollution under federal law. The EPA initially denied that request in 2008 but reversed course a year later, granting the waiver in 2009.
“So this wouldn’t necessarily be a slam dunk approach for the state to take, but I think the legal avenue is now there,” said Elkin, of UC Berkeley.
Targeting cars with new regulation
If California tried to regulate greenhouse gases on its own, it would have both experience and infrastructure to rely on. The process would look a lot like how the state has written past clean-car rules — except this time, the target would be carbon itself.
California’s clean-car rules have operated within the permission-seeking framework set up by the Clean Air Act — until this year, when Trump and Congress moved to block the state’s plans to phase out gas cars and tighten diesel-truck standards. Trump’s EPA then went further by proposing to repeal the 2009 endangerment finding, framing it as a win for “consumer choice.”
Most of the state’s climate programs already run under authority of California’s own groundbreaking state laws: clean-energy mandates for utilities, a carbon-trading program for businesses, even standards to cut the carbon in fuels.
Cars are different. They’re sold into a national market, and tailpipe emissions have long been federally preempted — one reason California has needed Washington’s permission to go its own way.
If the state decides to test those limits, regulators would need to draft new rules and open them to public review — a process that could take years.
California has already started down the path of new rules for clean cars and trucks. Last month, the Air Resources Board began the process of crafting clean car rules in response to the Trump administration’s rollback of the state’s new gas-car ban — a revocation the state is also fighting in court. In December, the board plans to begin the process of writing new emissions rules for trucks.
The automobile association declined to comment on the new rulemaking effort.  Patrick Kelly, vice president of energy and environmental affairs for American Trucking Associations, said the group would work with its state affiliate to “respond to specific proposals. “
“More broadly, (our group) supports achievable national standards and opposes a patchwork of state and local standards that Congress sought to avoid,” Kelly wrote in an email.

Asked by CalMatters whether the new rulemakings could become the vehicle for California to go its own way under Trump, Sanchez, the air board chair, said it’s an option staff is studying.
“It’s something that staff is looking into, and I look forward to digging into myself,” Sanchez said.
No downside to trying, and some upsides
Even if legal experts like the idea in theory, UC Berkeley’s Dan Farber says California going forward alone is a longshot in practice. 
“There’s a chance you would win,” Farber said, of the argument that the state could directly regulate greenhouse gas emissions from cars. “You’re buying a lawsuit, but other than litigation expenses, I don’t think there’s much downside in trying to do it.”
Farber and others point out that the Trump administration and car and truck manufacturers would almost certainly sue to block state-level efforts to regulate greenhouse gases. 
The Alliance for Automotive Innovation warned, in comments to the EPA, that if states were not preempted, any unregulated emission “would then become fair game,” creating conflicting standards across the country. Automakers have long argued that letting states write their own climate rules would create a costly patchwork of standards, raising prices for consumers and complicating production for a national market.
California is in somewhat of a legal quandary. The Clean Air Act requires California to meet national pollution standards, and the state still has some of the most air-polluted regions in the country.
The state’s solutions rely heavily on clean-car and truck rules to meet those requirements. If California falls short, it could lose federal highway funding, a situation that Sanchez called a “no-win, Catch 22.” 
After decades of regulation and incentives, California has built a reputation as a leader in electric cars, and experts said if the state pushes further on policy, that could help keep California’s clean-car transition alive and its electric-vehicle goals within reach. 
Nick Nigro, founder of Atlas Public Policy, said California could also risk getting ahead of consumers if it goes it alone. Electric cars proved less popular than policymakers expected when it originally passed its goal to do away with sales of new gas-powered cars. 
“What is clear is that the program was not overwhelmingly popular amongst the public, even in California, right?” Nigro said. “That’s usually a flag for policymakers.”
Craig Segall, an independent consultant and former state air board deputy, said there’s another factor to consider: by preserving demand and infrastructure for EVs, the state could maintain a beachhead for innovation that a future president might build on.
With no coherent federal policy to compete in the global EV market, California could again use its regulatory and investment muscle — just as it once did in helping spawn electric car maker Tesla — to push the market forward.
“What the feds are basically signaling here is that the field is open for anyone who’s serious about being a competitive car or truck company in five years,” Segall said. “One of those paths is: the world’s fourth largest economy figures out ways to take its manufacturing economic capacity and just plow ahead.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/030223_LOS-ALTOS-EV_SK_CM_16.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-07 08:16:32.121613

Butler introduced a similar bill in the 2025 legislative session that passed the House but did not come to a vote in the Senate.
HB 26 also allows the court or the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles to order an offender to receive mental health treatment, which could also include recurring polygraph examinations.
People who fail to report to treatment could be found guilty of a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $15,000 fine.
“It is just another level of accountability,” Butler said. “The polygraph people came to me with that. We are seeing other states putting that in because, apparently, people are lying to you.”
Experts and defense attorneys agreed with the treatment requirement but expressed doubts about other elements of the legislation.
Kerry McCarthy, clinical director at Wandering Pines Wellness, an organization based in Colorado that provides mental health counseling services, provided  therapy to people who had been convicted of sexual-based offenses for seven years. He took issue with restricting people’s access to communication devices.
“Those all sound like really good tools to limit access and availability to problematic content, but they are not research and evidenced based,” she said. “They also create hindrances for individuals to pay their bills. A lot of things are online. A lot of jobs require you to fill out an online application.”
Kyle Pierce, a criminal defense lawyer with Pierce and Pierce Attorneys, based in Gadsden and Birmingham, expressed concerns with the polygraph component.
“This requirement to go do this polygraph, pay for it twice a year, so it is adding a significant financial burden, a significant time burden, on people who are already having to regularly register, to pay every time that they register,” he said. “Polygraphs are bad science; polygraphs are not admissible in court. I can’t see the benefit of the required polygraph testing.”

,California,2025-11-07 13:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s pro-housing laws have failed to raise new home numbers,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/11/california-housing-data-tool/,"New housing starts were around 100,000 a year when Newsom took office in 2019;  they still hover around that number today.","California YIMBY, an organization founded eight years ago to promote housing construction in response to an ever-increasing gap between demand and supply, held a victory party in San Francisco recently.
“Welcome to the most victorious of California YIMBY’s victory parties,” Brian Hanlon, founder and CEO of the organization, told attendees.
Its acronym (Yes In My Backyard) symbolizes its years-long battle with NIMBYs (Not in My Backyard), people and groups who have long thwarted housing projects by pressuring local governments that control land use.
YIMBY’s party marked the passage of several pro-housing legislative measures this year, two of which have long been sought by housing advocates. Assembly Bill 130 exempts many urban housing projects from the California Environmental Quality Act, while Senate Bill 79 makes it easier to building high-density housing near transit stations in large cities.
“2025 was a year,” Hanlon gleefully declared.
The celebratory atmosphere was understandable because this year’s legislative actions capped a half-decade of ever-mounting state government activism on housing that followed Gov. Gavin Newsom’s 2017 campaign pledge to build 3.5 million new units of housing if elected.
That goal was wildly unrealistic, as Newsom should have known, but he did push hard for legislation to remove barriers to housing development. His housing agency also ramped up pressure on local governments to remove arbitrary hurdles that YIMBY-influenced officials had erected and to meet quotas for identifying land that could be used for housing.
However, the celebration omitted one salient factor: Pro-housing legislative and administrative actions have failed to markedly increase housing production.
New housing starts were around 100,000 a year when Newsom took office in 2019, and they are about that number today, with the net increase even lower.
As the Housing and Community Development Department admits in its statewide housing plan, “Not enough housing being built: During the last ten years, housing production averaged fewer than 80,000 new homes each year, and ongoing production continues to fall far below the projected need of 180,000 additional homes annually.”
The Census Bureau calculates that since Newsom took office, new housing permits in California ranged from a high of 120,780 units in 2022 to a low of 101,546 last year. Newsom’s own budget agrees with the Census Bureau’s data for the same period and projects future construction through 2028 at 100,000 to 104,000 units a year.
Those are the numbers.  But how data on housing is collected and collated has been a somewhat murky process, and opponents of housing projects often challenge how they comport with quotas the state imposes on local communities.
Fortunately, the Census Bureau has unveiled a new statistical tool that should go a long way toward having complete data that includes not only conventional single- and multi-family projects, but alternative forms of housing such as backyard granny flats, officially known as Accessory Dwelling Units; basements or garages that are transformed into apartments; single-family homes converted into duplexes or apartments; mobile homes or office buildings that become housing.
The tool uses several sources of data but is heavily reliant on the Postal Service, which maintains a constantly updated roster of addresses that includes all housing types.
More accurate data should make it easier to overcome conflicts and may even reveal that California’s pro-housing actions have had positive effects that current methodology misses.
“The housing crisis has persisted in part because we haven’t been able to measure our progress accurately,” an article about the new tool published by the Niskanen Center, a think tank, concludes. “With the Census Bureau’s Address Count Listing File data, that excuse is gone. Now the question is whether policymakers will use this powerful new tool to finally build the housing America needs.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/081724-Visalia-Heat-LV_10.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-07 08:16:32.121613

Mark Cusack, co-chair of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy, said he is pushing for his redraft of Gov. Maura Healey's energy affordability bill to receive a floor vote before lawmakers break for the year on November 19.","THE POINT PERSON on energy policy in the House is planning to use Gov. Maura Healey’s pending energy affordability legislation as a vehicle to pull back on the state’s ambitious climate goals.   
Rep. Mark Cusack, co-chair of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy, intends to take aim at the emissions reduction commitments the state is racing to meet by 2030, he told CommonWealth Beacon in an exclusive interview. Cusack said he is still weighing options as to exactly what shape such a move could take.  
“We’re looking at the real possibility here, in the objective analysis, that we are not going to make our greenhouse reduction mandates,” Cusack said, emphasizing his goal is not to undermine the state’s clean energy commitments but rather ensure they are realistic. “I have not found anyone who says that we are going to make our mandates.” 
In 2021, Massachusetts passed legislation laying out interim targets, including a 2030 goal to cut pollution by 50 percent compared with 1990 levels, on top of a larger effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 85 percent by 2050.  
Cusack’s effort threatens to divide the Democratic supermajority on Beacon Hill, enrage climate advocates, and shake up the dynamics around volatile energy politics right at the start of winter — and Healey’s reelection bid.  
It would also shift the debate in the middle of both deep rollbacks to clean energy funding and climate regulations from the Trump administration and a heightened political sensitivity in Massachusetts to the state’s high energy costs that contribute to soaring costs of living. 
Healey filed her energy affordability bill with the Legislature in May. It calls for reforms to gas and electric charges and boosts in energy supply in an effort to save ratepayers $10 billion over the next decade.   
Cusack, a moderate Democrat from Braintree, said he is pushing for his redraft of the bill to receive a floor vote before lawmakers break for the year on November 19. Cusack has the support of House Speaker Ron Mariano, he added.
Cusack also said he plans to propose reducing the budget for Mass Save, the state’s signature energy efficiency program, to $4 billion in what would amount to a $500 million cut. State regulators approved a $4.5 billion budget for Mass Save earlier this year, though in so doing rejected a larger proposed increase. 
Mass Save is a ratepayer-funded collaboration among the state’s major utility companies to offer discounted energy efficiency upgrades like heat pumps and weatherization, but has become somewhat of a political punching bag since the program’s costs appear as a line item on utility bills. Cusack said he doesn’t want to hamstring the program’s substantive work, but takes issue with its advertising and administrative budget. 
And he rejected Healey’s proposal to reform Mass Save by allowing the utilities to borrow money through bonds as a “gimmick.” 
Cusack said in the interview that he’s concerned about the potential for legal challenges should the state fail to meet its 2030 commitments. Massachusetts did meet its milder 2025 emissions reduction goals, and state statute allows for some flexibility in missing the interim targets, since officials must report to the Legislature what are the “remedial steps that might be taken to offset the excess emissions and ensure compliance with the next upcoming limit.”   
“It’s definitely on my mind,” Cusack said about potential future litigation. 
It isn’t yet clear how Cusack plans to shift the climate commitments, including whether the 2030 goal would be lowered, delayed, or both. And Cusack pledged not to touch the larger 2050 goal to ensure that “we aren’t taking our foot off the gas.” 
But if Cusack, in his first year as chair of the committee, moved forward with some version of such a plan, it would put him at odds with some of the state’s other key power players. 
Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Rebecca Tepper told CommonWealth Beacon in an interview last month that adjusting or pushing back the state’s climate goals is “not our focus right now.” 
“Clean energy is the way that we’re going to be powering the future,” she said.  
It isn’t likely that Cusack’s counterpart on the Senate side, Michael Barrett of Lexington, who co-chairs the energy committee, would go along with such changes, either, given his influential role in crafting the 2021 climate legislation that Cusack is targeting.  
Cusack seemed to recognize that he’s teeing up a fight. 
“There will always be differences between the branches,” Cusack said. “But I think from the outcry we’ve heard from our constituents last winter, and just the reality of the attacks from the federal government, that this is a very responsible and responsive piece of legislation.” 
Sen. Michael Barrett, co-chair of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy, has been influential in crafting Massachusetts climate policy. (Photo by State House News Service)

Cusack has previously said that “everything must remain on the table” as it relates to reassessing state climate targets.  
But his intention to use the energy affordability bill to specifically adjust the state’s 2030 commitments has not been previously reported and could test Beacon Hill’s resolve to defend the emission reduction goals enacted just four years ago that have formed the backbone of an economywide transition away from fossil fuels. 
Forcing lawmakers to go on the record with such a move would plunge the Legislature into an uncomfortable position. After President Trump won election a year ago, he moved swiftly to stop new offshore wind permits, yanked funding for clean energy technologies like electric vehicles, and ended tax credits for solar projects.  
That’s why, Cusack said, a move to ratchet back the state climate goals is a simple math question. To no fault of the state’s, the assault on clean energy from Washington likely means no new large-scale renewable generation will come on to the grid during Trump’s presidency, outside of the Vineyard Wind project that is already operating and a hydropower project slated to start delivering electricity soon from Quebec.  
That landscape, plus last winter’s outrage over high energy bills, is precisely what’s thrown the Healey administration into “all-of-the-above” energy mode, filing the energy affordability bill to attempt to remove ratepayer charges, speed up solar deployment, and even express openness to more natural gas.  
Still, an effort to touch 2030 commitments that are five years away is bound to galvanize environmental advocates who fought successfully for those goals under a Republican governor, Charlie Baker, and won in court to preserve them. In addition to the topline pollution reduction limits, there are targets for transportation, buildings, and other sectors. 
“They fought for them. I voted for them,” Cusack said. “I’m fully aware of the implications of doing anything with them, but we also need to live in reality.” 
When asked if the climate goals might be worth leaving in place for now to at least send the message that the state remains committed to a clean energy economy, Cusack responded that “the inverse of that is saying, ‘Don’t tell the truth.’ What’s the political benefit of that?”

The House redraft also aims to boost solar generation in Massachusetts by speeding up interconnections for new projects, instituting a “safe harbor” provision to make it easier for solar projects to be placed in construction to qualify for expiring federal tax credits, and allowing municipalities to deploy more net-metered solar. 
Cusack said he supports Healey’s proposal to reduce the solar net-metering compensation rates, which are among the highest in the country, in an effort to lower electric bills.  
“These are sobering times, and you have to have an adult conversation about where we are,” Cusack said. “This is not an ideological thing. This is not, ‘I don’t believe in clean energy.’ This is none of that. This is just a fact-based analysis of where we are and where we’re going to be by 2030. None of us want to be in this position. None of us want to be having this conversation. We’re just trying to be the adults in the room.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Cusack-Mark-and-Straus-William.jpg?fit=1024%2C665&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-07 07:56:21.123424

(Video forum screengrab)Nevada’s child care crisis should warrant a special session rather than efforts to give public subsidies to film studies, advocacy groups say. 
“We don’t think this is the time where we need to be giving tax incentives to billionaires,” said Denise Tanata with The Children’s Cabinet. Instead of “giving money away, we should be creating new revenue sources to fund things like child care, pre-K and a wide array of other programs.”
MomsRising, an advocacy group pushing for local and federal legislation expanding paid leave and affordable child care, hosted a virtual town hall Wednesday to discuss the state of those priorities, along with food insecurity pressing issues.
Democratic Assemblymembers Natha Anderson and Duy Nguyen, along with the Children’s Cabinet and the Children’s Advocacy Alliance, weighed in on the state of food insecurity intensified by the government shutdown, as well as child care affordability issues. 
The Trump administration announced last month it would refuse to pay SNAP benefits for the month of November. A federal ruling forced his hand to administer the funds and approximately $29 million in food assistance benefits was added to the EBT cards of over 196,000 Nevada households.
Nevada Senate Democrats plan to introduce legislation to establish an emergency cash assistance program to help the nearly 500,000 Nevadans whose food stamp benefits have lapsed. 
Last month, Gov. Joe Lombardo issued a statement saying there would be a special session, and that the ”goal will be to finish what the Legislature left unfinished — plain and simple.”
He was alluding to his proposed crime bill, which died in the final moments of the session after being rushed through, and a Democratic-led bill to give the largest public subsidy in state history to the film industry.  
Lawmakers are expected to reconsider failed legislation from the regular legislative session earlier this year that sought to allocate $1.4 billion in transferable tax credits over 15 years to support a film studio in Las Vegas.
“The Children’s Cabinet has signed onto a letter opposing the film tax credit bill,” Tanata said. 
Proponents of the legislation have argued the legislation could create thousands of jobs, a claim that has been met with skepticism from both sides of the aisle.   
And the proposals critics contend Nevada’s workforce would be better and more immediately served by the state addressing other priorities, such as a lack of accessible and affordable child care in Nevada that has long been cited as a barrier to people entering the workforce. 
“A lot of the programs and services we do have are not serving close to the number of families who need the services,” Tanata said. 
The Trump administration announced over the summer it would be withholding millions of dollars of federal funding streams for education programs, including after school programs. After ample bipartisan backlash, Trump released the funds. 
The last few months have underscored the state has a “very heavy reliance on federal funding,” Tanata said. It’s uncertain if that funding model will continue to be sustainable. 
“A big piece of what we’re looking at moving forward is identifying how our states can make investments in our own families and not just rely on federal funding,” she added.
There hasn’t been any mention from state officials about addressing the uncertainty of federal funding streams supporting child care and education programs during the special session. 
Child advocacy groups and allied lawmakers are instead looking toward the next time state legislators convene in a regular session, in 2027. 
As lawmakers attempt to attract industries to Nevada, there needs to be more effort to address the needs of children, said Carissa Pearce with the Children’s Advocacy Alliance.
“Our children can’t wait,” Pearce said. ”We certainly want to see child care be a priority.” 
Groups plan to revive legislation Lombardo killed – among the record breaking 87 bills vetoed this session – including a bill designed to make child care more accessible, and a measure to expand access to paid leave.
Also on the list is Assembly Bill 185, which sought to prevent most homeowners associations from prohibiting licensed home-based childcare operations within their communities. 
Anderson, who sponsored the bill, said the issue was “low hanging fruit” and an attempt to address the fact that across the state in “every single area, we are severely understaffed.” 
In his veto message he wrote the legislation “disrupts that balance by stripping HOAs of a key element of their regulatory authority.”
Lee on shutdown outlook
Democratic U.S. Rep. Susie Lee also spoke during the virtual town hall to answer questions about the federal shutdown, now the longest in history. 
A continuing resolution passed the Republican-controlled House in September has not been able to secure enough votes in the Republican-controlled Senate. 
Democrats have pushed that any resolution to fund the government to also reverse cuts to Medicaid and restore subsidies to the Affordable Care Act health insurance premiums — actions Republicans took while passing Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill Act.
Republicans have insisted they will negotiate with Democrats on health care subsidies after Democrats vote to reopen the government. But Democrats, skeptical that Trump can be trusted, are demanding that Trump negotiate the ACA issue with them first before they vote for a budget resolution.
Some Democrats are reportedly in talks about voting for the Republican budget resolution in exchange for getting a vote on extending ACA subsidies.
“Many in my caucus are saying do not give in until we get the result we want,” Lee said. 
Some “Democrats feel that if we vote to reopen the government and you take a vote on the ACA tax subsidies there will not be enough votes. Maybe there will be,” Lee said. 
Republicans in the House represent people who also rely on health care subsidies, Lee said.  
“These ACA tax subsidies are more important in many red states than states like ours that expanded Medicaid,” she said.
While she thinks there would be enough Republicans in the House who would support extending the ACA premium subsidies, she was less certain about the Senate. 
Since the vote that started the shutdown Oct. 1, Nevada Democratic U.S Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, along with Democratic U.S. Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with the Democrats, have all repeatedly voted for the Republican spending resolution.

Joe Lombardo poses for a picture with Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Jan. 24, 2023. (Photo: Governor's office)It wasn’t that long ago, in March, 2023, when the state of Nevada awarded Tesla $412 million in tax breaks for expanding its industrial footprint in Nevada, which Tesla was almost assuredly going to do anyway. That was on top of the $1.25 billion in cash and prizes the state granted Elon Musk’s company nearly a decade earlier. 
A lot has happened since then.

Musk went full-on MAGA. 
He plopped $250 million into a political action committee to help get Trump elected. 
A radicalized Trump supporter rented a Tesla Cybertruck and blew himself and the Cybertruck up in front of a Las Vegas hotel with Trump’s name on it. 
Musk created a quasi-federal agency he named after an internet meme coin (doge), because ooh ironic edgelord or whatever. 
Trump effectively made Musk co-president. 
Federal charges were filed against a man for allegedly setting Teslas on fire in a Las Vegas Tesla service center. 
Musk not only allowed but encouraged several puerile minions working in the quasi-federal agency named after a meme coin to hoover up personal and business data collected over the years by multiple government departments, slashing through regard for security, privacy, and the rule of law like a chainsaw through ketamine. 
As many as 300,000 federal employees were indiscriminately and recklessly dismissed by the Doge onslaught (even though the government has been finding it has to rehire some of them back). 
Musk and Trump broke up, at least publicly. 
Despite fawning political support and accompanying regulatory coddling, Musk’s preposterous vision of a worse than worthless network of underground private Tesla-only streets in Las Vegas remains more vision than network, and Musk is bringing the cars out of the tunnels in an effort to at least put the Las Vegas cab industry out of business. 

Those of course are only a few of the Muskesque developments, some national, some Nevada, some both, that have transpired since Nevada last gave Tesla tax cuts that Tesla has never needed. One could go on and on.
Thursday, in recognition of Musk’s … Muskness, Tesla’s shareholders overwhelmingly voted to make Musk the first human awarded a compensation package worth one trillion U.S. dollars.
Which raises several questions, among the more amusing ones being: Will Musk be demanding payment in meme coins? And if not, why not?
Nevadans might have slightly less amusing questions, such as, Why is the state of Nevada, a state notorious for both a low-wage economy and underfunded health, education, and public services and programs, giving tax breaks to a company that is bestowing its Dear Leader a pay package nearly four times the size of Nevada’s gross domestic product?
The simple answer is Nevada passed a law for that.
More fundamentally, that law, like economic policy in Nevada, is the product of an ideology broadly (if not always) shared among Nevada Republican and Democratic politicians alike.
It’s the same ideology that has dominated most of the globe but especially the U.S. for decades, in which it is simply taken for granted that the best way to help people is to help business.
It’s a convenient ideology to hold if you’re a politician, because business finances the U.S. political system.
But it would be wrong, or at least oversimplifying, to assume the only reason politicians dole out public subsidies to powerful interests is in exchange for campaign money — or in the hope of keeping  those interests from spending money to defeat them. 
Nevada elected officials of both parties also dole out subsidies to business for the same reason politicians of both parties nationwide do it: Decades of indoctrination has instilled a belief, a faith — and a rationalization and justification — that when they help business, prosperity will ripple out through the economy and be shared with everyone. It’s dogma, and most elected officials are soaking in it.
Few Nevada politicians would publicly assert the state government’s highest priority is to help business. But Joe Lombardo, Nevada’s Republican governor who was exhibiting public displays of affection for Musk while rubber-stamping Tesla’s 2023 subsidy package, came close not long ago.
“Government’s not necessarily in the jobs business,” Lombardo said in a television interview in August. “We’re in the environment business. We create environments, regulations, lack of regulation — everything else we can, for businesses to be successful.”
That interpretation of government’s role in the economy is ubiquitous throughout Nevada politics and policy. That’s why the state has spent more than a decade granting tax breaks to a corporation whose founder is poised to become the world’s first trillionaire, and why the governor and legislative leaders believe diverting tens of millions of dollars a year in Nevada tax revenue to film corporations is a reasonable idea. 
Nevada government’s putting-business-first mentality is also why — from child care to the cost of insurance, electricity and rent to an upside down tax system where the poorer you are, the higher percentage of your income you pay in taxes — Nevada politics and policy has failed to prioritize affordability.
Musk’s a freak show. There’s nothing Nevada can do to change that.
Nevada’s dysfunctional economic policy, by contrast, is the result of choices made in Nevada, by Nevadans.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/lombardo-and-musk-copy.jpg,,,2025-11-07 10:59:09.491231

This change impacts far more than convenience — it affects families’ peace of mind and the overall well-being of children and parents across Rutland County.  
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Corissa Burnell: Rutland needs pediatric care.","This commentary is by Corissa Burnell. She is co-executive director of the Rutland County Parent Child Center, where she has served for the past eight years, including two years in her current leadership role.


We at the Rutland County Parent Child Center were saddened and alarmed to hear the news that the Rutland Regional Medical Center is reducing its capacity for pediatric care.
This reduction in services will mean that if families with children need overnight care, they will need to travel an hour or more to another hospital. When a child is in the hospital, parents and caregivers want to be with them, and this increased distance could create a barrier that is too high for family members who can’t take off work and who have limited resources for extra gas.
Rutland County is already a pediatric care desert. Families struggle to find local pediatricians, specialists and therapy providers for their children already. Reducing services in this way creates even more stress for families who need care.

Transportation challenges compound the problem. Many families lack reliable transportation or funds for gas to travel long distances for care. Even those who own vehicles may have unregistered cars, unreliable transportation or no ability to afford upkeep.
These challenges lead to increased family stress and financial strain. If families do manage to be with their children who need inpatient care, they will incur travel costs, missed workdays and the emotional toll of managing care far from home. 
Finally, we are seeing worsening health inequities in Rutland County. Children from low-income, rural or single-parent households will bear the brunt of these decisions that are being made at institutions for financial reasons, without consideration for the low-income families who may need care.
This closure is part of a troubling trend. The removal of the child development dlinic a few years ago already forced families to travel long distances for evaluations — now, with the pediatric hospital closure, even more essential services are gone. 
I’ve heard from many families who are deeply concerned about the loss of pediatric inpatient care at Rutland Regional Medical Center. Parents have shared that when a child now needs to be admitted, families must travel long distances for care that was once available right here in our community.
This change impacts far more than convenience — it affects families’ peace of mind and the overall well-being of children and parents across Rutland County.

(Photo by Ryan Berry/Washington State Standard)The Trump administration has proposed significantly shifting management of the nation’s public lands toward producing more revenue. 
President Donald Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum have issued orders aimed at expediting energy production on federal lands. Burgum has repeatedly referred to federal lands as America’s “balance sheet,” pushing for increased oil and gas extraction, logging and mining. 
The administration also wants to roll back the Roadless Rule, which prohibits logging on millions of acres of national forests. Meanwhile, some congressional Republicans have pushed bills to sell off millions of federal acres.
Other administration proposals include transferring more federal responsibilities — such as disaster recovery — to the states, changing oversight of federal firefighters, and making significant cuts to federal lands agencies.
These proposals especially affect Western states, where 90% of federal lands are located. In Washington state, nearly 30% of land is owned by the federal government. 
Stateline reporter Alex Brown recently interviewed Dave Upthegrove, Washington’s public lands commissioner, to ask how these proposals and other federal changes are playing out on the ground. In addition to managing forests on state land, the Department of Natural Resources, which Upthegrove helms, is Washington’s lead wildfire-fighting agency.
Elected commissioner last year, the Democrat previously served as a state representative in the Washington House and on the King County Council. 
This interview has been condensed for length and edited for clarity.
Government shutdown
Stateline: We’re currently several weeks into a federal government shutdown that has furloughed thousands of workers at federal land management agencies. What effect is the shutdown having on national parks, forests and other lands?
Upthegrove: We’re still working through what those impacts are going to be. Obviously, it means that the people who care for those lands — rangers, foresters, biologists, more — are furloughed. So the longer the shutdown goes on, the longer people aren’t on the ground to manage the forest, the bigger the impact will be. 
We’re concerned about potential impacts to Good Neighbor Authority (a federal collaboration law) projects on federal lands, that we’re essentially losing time on forest health treatments, prescribed burns, at a time when we need to be doing that work to prepare for wildfire season. We’re going to keep working with the feds on those Good Neighbor agreements, but we’re worried those impacts can be widespread.
Trump’s firefighting plan
Q: President Trump has announced plans to create a unified U.S. Wildland Fire Service, combining the firefighting resources of the Forest Service, National Park Service and other land management agencies. You lead an agency that works closely with those agencies to fight wildfires. Do you support the idea of merging their fire crews into a single agency?
A: It’s how it’s done. The improvements and streamlining might be possible. A single federal entity that’s responsible for wildfires on federal jurisdiction, and that’s important — on federal jurisdiction — could be beneficial, but the federal government can’t override or supersede our state and local jurisdiction. So I think it’s really important for the administration to recognize that federal, state and local coordination already exists. 
This is a team effort, and what’s been going on at the federal level — the chaos, the lack of communication — is a serious problem. The last thing we want is partners that are disconnected from each other. So consolidation, done properly, maybe could be beneficial. But I really wonder, given the behavior we’ve seen for that administration, if they can implement this cleanly. We were engaging in that — our firefighting experts are offering comments and feedback — and we really value that federal partnership, but it’s really going to depend on what it looks like.
Selling public lands
Q: Leaders in Trump’s administration have talked about public lands as America’s balance sheet and called for some lands to be sold off to bring in revenue. Here in Washington state, you’re in the middle of similar debates about the role of public lands for revenue or conservation. At a time when budgets are tight and some are looking at public lands as assets that can be sold or managed to maximize their economic value, what is your view of the purpose of public lands, including potentially selling them for revenue?
A: Our state and federal lands belong to we, the people. They’re public lands, our lands, and they need to be managed in the public interest for all the people of the state or in the nation. And I think that’s the vision here in Washington.
The president’s plan to clear-cut national forests to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy is offensive and it sells out future generations. We’re seeing efforts to gut the public lands rule, which [would] put mining and drilling ahead of conservation and recreation, repealing the Roadless Rule [which would threaten] protected forests with industrial logging and development. And we need to manage these lands for the broader benefits.
Land revenue for schools
Q: Your agency oversees millions of acres of trust lands. In many Western states, these lands provide important revenue for schools and local governments and support economic sectors such as logging and mining. Your plans to conserve some older forests have drawn criticism from both timber companies and environmental groups who feel it either goes too far or not far enough. Do you see a way for Western states to manage that tension between the economic and environmental values of these trust lands? 
A: We need to always find the right balance, and we also need to acknowledge our world is changing. We’re seeing the impacts of climate change now. We’re seeing a rapid loss in biodiversity. The Washington State Department of Natural Resources has always led the way in sustainable management, and I want us to continue to lead the world and do more, and I believe we can innovate and diversify how we generate revenue from these lands.
What that means is we will continue to have a strong, robust, healthy wood products industry in Washington state for generations to come. … I think there is strong public support for the values those forests bring, in addition to wood products. So I think we are pursuing an approach that strikes the appropriate balance.
That tension will always be there for any trust manager. Any land manager in any Western state will always have those competing values. 
Q: How viable are carbon credits or ecosystem services as a revenue source compared to timber harvests?
A: Currently, carbon credits don’t generate the same amount of money that wood products do, so they would be just one part of a larger strategy. Other tools that could be employed as we innovate and diversify include more ecological forestry, such as thinning for forest health. 
An important part of my vision also is the acquisition of replacement timber lands. It is not unusual for this agency to acquire property with state legislative funds, and I would like to target opportunities to acquire private timber lands at risk of conversion. For example, we are currently in the middle of a transaction purchasing 6,000 acres on an area called Cle Elum Ridge. And were we not purchasing that, it likely would become what I call McMansions, housing for the wealthy out in a rural area. Instead, we’re going to keep it as a working forest.
I think a combination of ecological forestry, ecosystem services and replacement timber lands, all taken together, can help us meet those trust responsibilities.
Wildfire immigration raid
Q: Shifting gears a bit, there were national headlines this summer following the immigration raid at the Bear Gulch Fire here in Washington state. How surprised were you to see federal immigration officials targeting wildfire crews?
A: I was shocked. I was offended. Regardless of what someone thinks about immigration policy, enforcing visas at the site of an active, ongoing emergency is irresponsible.
I think it just plays into unnecessary fear that’s being generated intentionally by this administration. But even if there were people sympathetic to the president’s views on immigration, I think this really turned a lot of people off. You know, these were firefighters working hard to keep us safe, and active in the middle of an emergency.
And the more I learn about it, the more upset I am about it.
Q: Do you have concerns about the California-based incident management team that was overseeing the fire and their potential role in setting up that raid? Would you have qualms about that team returning to Washington or overseeing crews from your agency?
A: Yes. I don’t know enough to make decisions, final decisions, but I think concerns is a good word. I don’t want members of critical incident management teams calling in immigration officials during a fire. If they had concerns, they could have passed that along at the conclusion of the incident, and that could have been dealt with.
It wasn’t their job to go investigate people’s visas. I know that they have said this was a timesheet issue where they discovered this, but I’m concerned that that was a pretext for calling in immigration officials. Because I don’t know all of the details and not able to verify anything, we’ve not taken any steps, but I’m absolutely concerned about those individuals working on fires.
Q: Is there concern that this could create a culture of fear or even lead to reduced capacity if some crews are scared to deploy or fear they might be targeted?
A: Yes. I think overall, not just the targeting of firefighters, but the whole federal strategy appears to be a desire to create fear and chaos intentionally, and this is just that effort spilling into the wildfire space.
We expect people who work for us to be working legally. We believe in the rule of law at this agency, but how that is enforced is important. And when someone is out there on the fire working, that’s not the time and place to do that.
There’s no reason they couldn’t have contacted these individuals after the fire and questioned them about their visa status, if immigration officials had concerns. Quite frankly, for members of that critical incident management team, it’s none of their business.
Effects of funding cuts
Q: President Trump has made significant cuts at the U.S. Forest Service and other land management agencies, both to staffing as well as grant programs and other funding sources. Your agency obviously works extensively with the Forest Service on its forest health plan and other forestry issues. How significantly have these federal cuts affected your agency’s work and the forest health plan in Washington?
A: They create a lot of uncertainty. We had no communication from the federal government as to their plans. Many of our grants got suddenly turned off without notice, most of them turned back on again. It’s made it very difficult for us to plan our work. We don’t know whether we should keep spending money sometimes, because we don’t know if we’ll get reimbursed, even if we have a signed contract.
A lot of our grants are pass-through funds to other entities, like local governments, fire departments. They submit receipts to us. We pay them back. We submit them to the federal government. We get paid back. We’ve had to make decisions on a daily basis as to what to continue and when to tell people to stop working.
We also are beginning to see impacts from the mass firing of employees at some of these agencies. We had fewer critical incident management teams nationally this year in the fire services in large part due to the reduced staffing levels at these federal agencies. Fortunately, our fire season was able to accommodate that, but it presented risks. 
More logging
Q: Trump has also called for an increase in logging on federal lands. You said you’d be open to collaborating on more forest health and wildfire resilience-type work. What have you seen so far about how the feds’ plan to log more timber? And given the cuts we’ve seen, is that even possible with the reduced staffing that they have?
A: I don’t know. We’ve not seen any meaningful movement in that direction. I think they’re kidding themselves if they can lay off a whole bunch of foresters [and] at the same time increase their production. So I think it’s a lot of posturing and bluster on the part of the president.
There’s certainly room to better manage some of these national forests, and we want to be a part of that. We’ve partnered on over 25,000 acres in Washington state through the Good Neighbor agreement, doing forest restoration, forest health and other good work to help manage these forests, including generating wood products in the process.

(Photo courtesy of the Association of Indiana Counties)Tucked after Halloween trick-or-treating and before Thanksgiving turkey and cranberries is an often-overlooked holiday — Veterans Day, which is always on Nov. 11.
But it wasn’t always called that.
On Nov. 11, 1918, an armistice between the Allied countries and Germany was signed to end active fighting in World War I.
President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed Nov. 11, 1919 as the first commemoration of Armistice Day, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.
“To us in America, the reflections of Armistice Day will be filled with solemn pride in the heroism of those who died in the country’s service and with gratitude for the victory, both because of the thing from which it has freed us and because of the opportunity it has given America to show her sympathy with peace and justice in the councils of the nations,” the proclamation reads.
Congress, in a 1926 concurrent resolution, officially recognized the end of the war and declared that Nov. 11 should be a legal holiday.
The resolution says:
“Whereas the 11th of November 1918, marked the cessation of the most destructive, sanguinary, and far reaching war in human annals and the resumption by the people of the United States of peaceful relations with other nations, which we hope may never again be severed; and
“Whereas it is fitting that the recurring anniversary of this date should be commemorated with thanksgiving and prayer and exercises designed to perpetuate peace through good will and mutual understanding between nations; and
“Whereas the legislatures of twenty-seven of our States have already declared November 11 to be a legal holiday: Therefore be it Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), that the President of the United States is requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on November 11 and inviting the people of the United States to observe the day in schools and churches, or other suitable places, with appropriate ceremonies of friendly relations with all other peoples.”

From there, it became a legal holiday in 1938, and in 1954, was updated to honor American veterans of all wars.
Veterans Day is so much more important than food, and yet it gets short shrift in the holiday schedule.
Some of us are off work for the day, but not all. And even those who have the day off usually don’t recognize or do anything specific for veterans.
That’s why I’m excited about seeing displays for Operation Green Light for Veterans. Counties all around the state have drawn attention to veterans and their military service in recent years by lighting up their courthouses and other public spaces. And the program is growing every year.
The Association of Indiana Counties, in collaboration with the National Association of Counties, the National Association of County Veterans Service Officers, the Indiana Department of Veterans Affairs, Indiana War Memorials, Volunteers of America Ohio and Indiana and Amazon held a special event in downtown Indianapolis on Thursday night to honor veterans.
As part of the fifth annual Operation Green Light for Veterans, the event featured remarks from distinguished leaders and culminated in a ceremonial lighting of the War Memorials and Monument Circle in green.
“This symbolic gesture serves as a powerful tribute to veterans, letting them know they are seen, appreciated, and supported by their communities,” the news release said.
And if you want to participate on your own, grab a few green lightbulbs and light up your own porch for our veterans.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Hamilton-County.jpg,,,2025-11-07 07:17:16.293223

He was joined by Chad Wolf, executive director of the America First Policy Institute. (Screenshot from video)Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita on Thursday filed suit against Indianapolis Public Schools — with help from a conservative think tank — accusing the state’s largest public school district of “thwarting” federal immigration enforcement.
State law blocks local government entities, including school districts, from limiting cooperation or interfering with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other agencies.
“No public institution in Indiana has the right to pick and choose which laws to follow,” Rokita said in a news release. “When a school district refuses to cooperate with ICE, it doesn’t just break the law — it endangers students, protects criminal aliens, and sends a dangerous message to every government body in this state: that compliance is optional. Not on my watch.”
The lawsuit seeks an injunction preventing IPS from enforcing its policies.

In a Thursday evening statement, the IPS board of school commissioners affirmed the district’s commitment to “ensuring safe, supportive, and welcoming learning environments for all students.”
“As has always been the case, we will continue to uphold the law while keeping these commitments,” the board added, before knocking Rokita’s intentions.
“While IPS takes all legal obligations seriously, we respectfully hope that all concerned parties will recognize the heavy burden that silly litigation and political posturing places on students, families, and taxpayers,” the statement continued. “Every dollar spent on defensive legal posture is a dollar not spent on instructional support, teacher development, student services, or enrichment. In this case, Mr. Rokita prefers those dollars go to fight gratuitous political battles, as has too often been the case.”
Lawsuit’s claims
Rokita alleged IPS has “sanctuary” policies that bar employees from assisting immigration officers unless their cooperation is required by law and approved by the district’s superintendent.
IPS also prohibits employees from gathering, maintaining or sharing the immigration status of students, their families and district staff unless it’s legally required, Rokita asserted.
Finally, he accused the district of limiting ICE access to school facilities. Officers must have a warrant signed by a judge, or it must be an emergency, according to the lawsuit — and IPS legal counsel must authorize the access.
Rokita argued the district’ policies don’t let employees voluntarily comply — which he said violates state law — and that the limits are impermissibly stricter than federal law.

“Sanctuary policies are bad in any context, but they are especially troubling in our schools,” he said, in a news release. He claimed schools are “vulnerable to infiltration by criminal illegal aliens” and said that’s why “it’s essential that ICE be able to take action when that occurs to help keep our kids safe.”
The lawsuit described how IPS procedures tripped up one Honduran national’s planned self-deportation earlier this year. His son went to school on the day of the deportation flight.
“ICE faced significant obstacles — caused by IPS policies and actions on January 8 — in its efforts to reunite the father and the son,” the complaint reads.
The district asked ICE to produce a judicial order or demonstrate that it was an emergency, employees put the child in contact with an immigration attorney and legal counsel for both ICE and IPS went back and forth throughout the day.
The man missed his flight, and his voluntary deportation order expired later that day, according to the lawsuit. The child was released to the immigration attorney after the school day.

That prompted a February letter and civil investigative demand from Rokita’s office to IPS about its policies. The district replied in April and made some changes in response, but the edits “did next to nothing to ameliorate the policies’ legal infirmities,” the lawsuit reads.
Rokita’s office sent a second letter on Oct. 3 about the findings of its investigation into IPS policies. The complaint accuses the district of failing to give substantive responses by an Oct. 17 deadline, or by an Oct. 28 extension. “Accordingly,” Rokita determined there’s probable cause the district has violated Indiana Code.
In its statement, IPS confirmed the district has been “actively collaborating” with the Office of Attorney General to review its policies and procedures. School board members said they needed more time to respond.
“Unfortunately, despite taking six months to craft his opinion on IPS’ policies, Mr. Rokita permitted only five business days from the time IPS received his review to respond, and then refused IPS’ request for any additional time,” they said. “Yet, these important issues deserve thoughtful, deliberative weighing of important legal rights — not impulsive, superficial efforts for political gain.”
Board members also criticized Rokita’s use of the term “aliens” for noncitizen children and their families, saying that he’s “willfully dehumanizing” them and instead calling students “invaluable, unique, and bright human beings.”

“In Indianapolis Public Schools, the safety and security of our students is our top priority, and this commitment is non-negotiable,” the board concluded.
The America First Policy Institute joined the case as special counsel.
“Attorney General Rokita is showing exactly the kind of leadership America needs,” said Leigh Ann O’Neill, the conservative think tank’s chief legal affairs officer. “When state attorneys general act boldly to enforce cooperation with federal immigration law, they help protect families, uphold the rule of law, and stop the political gamesmanship that endangers our communities.”
She said the institute is “proud to support this work” and is ready to help other attorneys general “looking to follow Indiana’s lead.”
The national nonprofit worked alongside the Attorney General’s office in developing the legal strategy. The institute sees the Indiana case as a model for other state leaders to hold “rogue” state government agencies accountable and restore lawful cooperation between local institutions and federal agencies.
Meanwhile, the state’s largest professional educators organization proclaimed that it “stands with” IPS.
The Indiana State Teachers Association “believes every child in Indiana, regardless of background or immigration status, has the right to a safe and welcoming public school,” the group said. “Educators have both a professional and moral responsibility to protect the wellbeing of their students and ensure schools remain places of learning, trust and stability.”
“ISTA stands with Indianapolis Public Schools and its educators who are working every day to uphold these values,” it continued. “Turning schools into extensions of immigration enforcement threatens that trust and undermines the learning environment every student deserves. Our focus must remain on educating and protecting students, not politicizing their safety.”

In first year classes at eight […],"University of Minnesota students leave Pioneer Hall in November 2022. (Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer)Grade inflation has long been a problem in higher education. I taught my first college classes in 1981. It was a concern then and remained so throughout my career. A recent article in The Chronicle of Higher Education demonstrates that the problem persists and has worsened in recent years. In first year classes at eight representative universities, the average grade has moved to a B+. 
Minnesota, unsurprisingly, is not immune. Data from the University of Minnesota indicates that across all of its campuses and classes, grades are inflated. A summary of average grades in 100-level through 500-level classes in 2023-24 reveals the lowest average is a B and in many cases the average is a B+ or an A-. This pattern is no doubt true across the Minnesota State system too. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that, as the Chronicle demonstrates, high school students are less prepared for college than their predecessors — and they study less once they get there.
Numerous incentives exist to encourage high grades. 
Administrators want better graduation rates,  and higher grades ensure that students will move through their college careers more quickly and successfully. 
Academic departments want more students, especially when low enrollment numbers might portend their elimination. No one factor makes a department popular, but students learn from their peers about the difficulty of classes and the grades they receive, and that influences the majors they choose. 
Faculty want good evaluations and they know students who receive high grades are more likely to give them.
But perhaps the biggest incentive is that students want high grades because they see them as the ticket to lucrative employment. And since we have told them time and again that they are consumers in the education market, they do not hesitate to demand what they believe they have paid for. Their demands are often misguided, but just as often sincere. A student who had received a B on an assignment once visited my office and asked what she had done wrong. She assumed the default was an A and every gradation lower than that indicated a deficiency. My assumption, I told her, is that a C means you have met the basic requirements and anything higher indicates degrees of excellence beyond those requirements.
That conversation helped me realize that whether high grades constitute a problem depends on what they signify. 
One view — prevalent in our current age of assessment — is that grades measure whether students meet learning objectives. In this view all students might earn As. One might earn that grade on a first try at an assignment and another after three attempts. Inflated grades are not a problem because they indicate that more students met course objectives.
But the most common view is that grades compare students to one another. Faculty thus strive to disperse grades in a bell curve, so the majority get Cs, a few get As and Fs, and those interspersed between the average and the extremes get Bs and Ds. In this view inflated grades are a problem because they fail to distinguish between excellence, mediocrity and failure. If the average grade is an A-, what does a B mean?
When we look at transcripts or at GPAs, we can’t tell which view applies to which grades. But in either case, our responses to grade inflation depend on what we think grades mean. 
But there’s a way to create a shared conception of what grades mean that will incentivize all parties — even students — to seek to eliminate, or at least reduce, grade inflation. 
The solution is simple and expedient: Minnesota’s universities and colleges should mandate that transcripts report both the student’s grade and the average grade received in each class. This would make evident the degree to which faculty inflate grades. A bell curve is not necessary — a class in which a lot of students earn As is possible — but teachers should distinguish between those who do and do not meet requirements and between different degrees of excellence. 
It would also make evident the relationship between a student’s grade and the rest of the class. Students would then want the average grade to be a C, because anyone looking at a transcript could readily tell if a student’s A was actually the class average. When students themselves demand rigorous evaluation, inflated grades will be of little concern.
I loved my work with students. I hated assigning grades. But they are, for good or ill, baked into higher education.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)A slate of proposed regulations put forth by the Michigan Department of Transportation have activists and political advocacy groups up in arms, as the department mulls broad restrictions on political activity at its facilities, with criminal penalties for those who stray from the rules. 
Among the affected areas would be rest areas, as well as bridges and overpasses, spaces often used for petition activity and public protest.
Among the proposed rule changes is a prohibition on demonstrating, organizing, soliciting membership or distributing literature at an MDOT facility without official permission from the department. Those with permission are limited to entrances and exits and non-work areas, and cannot interfere with the operation and use of the facility or block people from entering or exiting.  
The proposed rules also block individuals from making sales or soliciting funds, with an exception for charities that receive permission from the department. 
The Department of Transportation manages 61 highway rest areas, 82 roadside parks, 267 carpool lots, 23 scenic turnouts and 14 welcome centers, though the rules also apply to the areas on, under or in bridges and culverts, and other bridges or culverts and other department right of ways. 
The rules would also bar individuals from bringing signs or placards into an MDOT facility, along with voice amplifying devices, like a megaphone. 
Under the proposed rules, official permission can either be granted by permit from the department, or a letter of authorization. Failing to abide by these restrictions, if implemented, would be considered a misdemeanor.

In an appearance on the department’s “Talking Michigan Transportation” podcast, Greg Losch, the head engineer for MDOT’s University Region, said the rules were drafted in response to complaints from the public regarding its public facilities, describing the rules as a starting point should the department need to ask for help from other state agencies. 
In regards to the restrictions on politicking at the department’s facilities, Losch said “our goal there is simply to say, ‘Hey, you know, we would like you to get official permission in most situations, because when the public protests or demonstrates in places where traffic could be in contact with pedestrians, we want to make sure some steps have been taken to plan for that, and that traffic control or law enforcement have been contacted.’”
Losch acknowledged the criticism that the rules would infringe upon freedom of speech, but said that was not the department’s goal. 
“The people that are worried about this know how to do those things correctly, but there are some bad actors out there that try to block entrance ways or intimidate people at our rest areas, and we want to make sure that we have an ability to ask for help to deal with that behavior,” Losch said.
However, Mariah Bryant, the program director for Voters Not Politicians, argued that the behavior of some bad actors was not grounds to restrict protected speech, warning this rule change would make it harder for petition circulators to gather signatures.
Voters Not Politicians, which successfully led the 2018 initiative to create the Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission and is currently supporting the Michigan Money Out of Politics campaign, trains its circulators on how to gather signatures on public property without interfering with others using the property, Bryant said. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Any circulators who aren’t capable of conducting themselves in a similar fashion should be dealt with on an individual basis,” Bryant said.
While the rules only partially prohibit political activities at MDOT facilities, Bryant emphasized that putting a barrier in place is still government overreach. 
“If you have to get a permit then it’s not free speech,” she said. 
Mark Brewer, an election lawyer for Goodman Acker and a former chair of the Michigan Democratic Party said the rules were “quite troubling” citing concerns with the broad definition of an MDOT facility. 
“A gated, closed area is obviously very different from the plaza in front of a rest stop or at the Michigan welcome centers, which are generally pretty big…you can’t lump them all together,” Brewer said, emphasizing that permits are not required for First Amendment activities in public areas, such as parks. 
Alongside granting Department of Transportation officials arbitrary discretion over who they confirm and deny permission, Brewer raised additional concerns with the penalty for violating the rules.
“A violation of these rules is at the very end, it’s a crime. It’s not something you get a ticket for or you get a warning,” Brewer said.

While there are legitimate restrictions against individuals blocking or impeding the movement of people or traffic in public areas, individuals collecting signatures at a table in a public plaza or in the grass of a roadside park aren’t creating any danger, Brewer said. 
“The courts have been very clear, starting with the U.S. Supreme Court, that collecting signatures on petitions – whether its candidates or ballot proposals – is constitutionally protected,” Brewer said. 
However, Jocelyn Garza, the department’s deputy director of public affairs, told the Advance in an email that the proposed administrative rules are in line with their existing policies and those of other state agencies. 
“The rules address issues that have occurred previously. It’s important to note, our intention is not to limit demonstrations from occurring at MDOT facilities or in MDOT right of way but rather ensure that the activity is not disruptive for other users (like blocking a road, sidewalk, entryway, etc.) and all participants remain safe,” Garza said.
Kyle Zawacki, the legislative director of the ACLU of Michigan, said the organization is still reviewing the rules in depth, but raised preliminary concerns around the First Amendment and the department’s requirement for prior approval. 
“In [the] current political climate that we find ourselves in, the concern of some of the provisions in these proposed rules being broadly applied to peaceful expressive activity with the potential to infringe on First Amendment rights or to discriminate is extremely concerning,” Zawacki said. 
While he does not believe that was the department’s intention, Zawacki said the downstream impact of these rules could impinge on those rights.
Looking at that permitting process, Zawacki said the ACLU of Michigan, at the very least, would suggest monitoring to see how those rulesJon King are enforced, to ensure they’re not applied disproportionately to certain individuals or at certain locations.
When asked about the impact these rules may have on protests held on highway overpasses, Zawacki said the organization is still investigating to ensure they have a full understanding of the situation. 
“But we do know that roadways, including sidewalks, have long been held in public trust for the free exercise of speech and assembly peacefully,” Zawacki said. “It is the core tenet of our ability to exercise our free speech, and we have major concerns with its restriction.”

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)The primaries for Wisconsin’s open gubernatorial election are about nine months away and the 2026 general election is still a year out, but Democratic and Republican candidates had their first opportunity to speak at a group forum Thursday. 
The forum, moderated by WISN-12 News Political Director Matt Smith, was hosted at the Wisconsin Technology Council’s annual symposium and focused mostly on the economy, especially the technology sector. 
Democratic candidates at the forum included Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, state Sen. Kelda Roys, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, state Rep. Francesca Hong and former Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) CEO Missy Hughes. 
Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann was the lone Republican candidate at the forum. U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, who is seen as the frontrunner on the GOP side, was not present.
All are competing to replace Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who won’t seek reelection, in the first open Wisconsin governor’s race in 15 years.
Threats to the economy
Smith asked the candidates what they see as the greatest threat to Wisconsin’s economy.  In her answer, Roys elicited the first — and biggest — round of applause from the audience.
“Wisconsin needs three key things that survive and thrive economically. We need higher wages for our workers — we lag behind our midwestern peers — we need lower costs on everything from housing to health care, and we need more freedom,” Roys said. “The biggest threat to all three of these things is the Trump regime.”
Roys said Trump’s tariffs are driving up prices for many products including appliances, building materials and groceries. She also said cuts to health care are going to have a disproportionate impact on rural parts of the state and that targeting immigrants is hurting the state’s agriculture industry. Entrepreneurship and capitalism, she added, also rely on the rule of law. 
“We need to have a free society that obeys democratic norms, and right now, Trump and his regime are our biggest threat,” Roys said. 
Hong said “authoritarianism” is the biggest threat to the economy, adding that disparities are growing in part because of actions being taken at the federal level, such as cutting food assistance. 
“When you have essentially a federal government that is taking away rights of states in our communities, that is going to threaten the economy,” Hong said. “It is workers that power the economy.”
Schoemann said “affordability” is the greatest threat and expressed concerns about young people and retirees leaving the state to live elsewhere. He said the state should work to deregulate industry and lower utility rates and cut taxes to address the threat.

“The average price of a home in Wisconsin right now is almost $350,000… A brand new teacher and a brand new cop who are married with a dual income can’t afford to qualify for the mortgage for that one. If they have a child, they’re trying to pay for child care, and they have utility bills that are going through the roof, and Verizon just had another increase in prices, and not to mention Netflix,” Schoemann said to some chuckles from the audience. “I know we laugh, but it’s a problem. It’s a massive problem.”
Rodriguez agreed that affordability is a big concern, saying that she wants her 19-year-old son to be able to build a life in Wisconsin but she is concerned that he won’t be able to afford to live here. 
“He’s not going to be able to do that if he can’t afford a home. He’s not going to be able to do that if, you know, he’s not going to be able to afford child care, so I think affordability is our biggest threat,” Rodriguez said. She added that the state needs to figure out how to ensure that its workforce can grow. 
Crowley said “complacency” is the biggest threat.
“We can’t continue to do the same work that we’ve been doing. We should no longer be defending the status quo because we have to figure out how do we build new institutions … ” Crowley said. “We see that public trust has been destroyed in government.”
Hughes said the state isn’t investing enough in K-12 and higher education. 
“When we start from a place of thinking, ‘No, we don’t want to take a risk. No, we don’t want to have investment in something,’ we end up just staying in the same place and often spiraling downward,” Hughes said. 
Working with the Trump administration
Democratic candidates were asked how they would work with the Trump administration, while Schoemann was asked whether there is anything he would push back on.
Rodriguez said that she would use the “bully pulpit” of the governor’s office to put pressure on the Trump administration to be more consistent. She noted her background as a health care executive, saying that being able to plan is essential. 
“You’re trying to figure out what you’re going to be doing in the next several years. Small businesses do the same thing. With this back and forth on tariffs… it is almost impossible to, so, that’s why it feels like we’re stuck,” Rodriguez said.
Roys called Trump a “bully and an authoritarian” and said Wisconsin needs a governor who will stand up to the administration. She noted governors in other states, including California Gov. Gavin Newsome, Maine Gov. Janet Mills and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, as examples of governors across the country who are pushing back.

Crowley said that he has worked with the federal government under Trump and President Joe Biden to secure grant funding for Milwaukee County. He also noted that he worked with Republicans at the state level to help pass legislation that overhauled local government funding in Wisconsin. 
“When we go into a restaurant, you’re not having a conversation with a waiter about their relationship with the cook. You want to make sure that your food is coming out hot and ready and delicious,” Crowley said. “We need our government to work the exact same way. Doesn’t matter if we agree on anything or not. We need to be delivering for the people that we represent every single day because it’s about moving our state forward.”
Hughes noted that Trump pushed for a plan operated by FoxConn during his first term, which had promised would create 13,000 jobs, and the state of Wisconsin invested $1.5 billion in infrastructure to make that happen. The original plan was mostly abandoned by the company.  
“I had to come in and clean up that mess,” Hughes said. She was involved in brokering a deal with Microsoft, which launched plans in 2024 for a $3.3 billion data center on the land that was once going to be the site of the FoxConn development. 
“You have to work at every level of the economy from a small business on Main Street all the way to our biggest businesses and supporting them and everywhere in between,” Hughes said. “Donald Trump thinks you can do these big things, and it’s all going to be better, and we’re all ending up paying the price for that.” Instead of taking Trump’s “silver bullet” approach, Hughes said, Wisconsin’s governor must understand the complexity of the state economy and ”keep working hard to create the quality of life that keeps people here here.”
Hong said it would be hard to work with the administration. She added that the lack of funding for SNAP is “disrupting an entire ecosystem,” and said public officials need to fight for the most vulnerable. 
“We have to make sure that people have food, and so, I think working with an administration that has no interest in your constituents is going to be incredibly difficult to be able to ensure that there is an economy that works for everyone,” Hong said. 
Schoemann didn’t say whether he would push back on anything the Trump administration is doing. He said tariffs have been difficult, but he also said the issues are global. 
“I hear from manufacturers and agriculture alike it’s the constant give and take, but let’s face it,… the changes that the world is going through right now — it’s a global thing,” he said. 
Data centers and artificial intelligence regulations
The growing presence of data centers in Wisconsin and the concerns they raise about increased electricity costs and water consumption, as well as the use of  artificial intelligence (AI), was a significant focus of the forum.
According to datacentermap.com, there are currently 47 data centers in Wisconsin. Proposals for more centers in the state are popping up as well, including one for a campus operated by OpenAI, Oracle and Vantage Data Centers in Port Washington. 
A recent Marquette Law School poll asked Wisconsinites about data centers and found that 55% say the costs of large data centers are greater than the benefits they provide, while 44% say the benefits outweigh the costs.
Schoemann, noting his close proximity to Port Washington, said that he thinks there is an “abundance of opportunity” created by data centers, but the state needs to be “very, very strategic and smart about where” data centers are placed. He said he also has concerns that there isn’t enough power in Wisconsin, and expressed hope that there will be a nuclear power “renaissance” in the state.
Crowley said he doesn’t think the government should be picking “winners and losers” when it comes to data centers, but instead should “make sure that this is fertile ground for entrepreneurs and businesses to either stay or move right here to the state of Wisconsin.”

“There’s an opportunity for us to really become AI and a data hub not only for the entire country, but for the entire globe and really sets us apart in making sure that we continue to invest in businesses and companies here,” Crowley said. 
Hughes said that Wisconsin has a diverse economy and that she doesn’t see the state  becoming a data center-based economy in the near future, but that data centers do offer an opportunity for communities.
“To have some of these data centers land here in Wisconsin, provide incredible property tax and revenue for the communities that are really determining how to pay their bills, how to build new schools, how to build new fire departments, it’s an opportunity for those communities to access some of that investment and to benefit from it,” she said. 
Hughes also said the state is already involved in conversations with companies seeking to build data centers in Wisconsin and that should continue. She said a project needs to be right for individual communities, noting the example of Microsoft scrapping its plans last month for a data center in Caledonia after major pushback from the local community. The company is now looking for an alternative site.
“We talked to them about their environmental needs, about where they’re building and how to make that happen in a way that has the least impact to the communities and the best benefit for Wisconsin,” Hughes said. “Working directly with the companies and getting to know those companies, acting with them as partners, is critically important for these to be good investments and ultimately beneficial for Wisconsin.”
Hong raised concerns about the environmental impact of data centers and the prospect that they could drive up utility bills. 
“One of the big considerations here is that for the workers and jobs that are created from these AI data centers, let’s make sure that the housing that’s being built, the workers are going to stay in Wisconsin, that we have to make sure that the companies are being held accountable,” Hong said. 
Roys said that “data centers are coming whether people like it or not” and the question for policymakers is whether they can implement “an approach that respects the values that I think all of us share — of democracy and shared decision making that’s transparent, that’s accountable, of fair play… and of protecting all of our resources.” She added that she has been concerned seeing “the biggest and wealthiest” companies seek to force their ways into communities. 
Asked about the role that the state should play in regulating artificial intelligence, most of the candidates appeared open to some regulation of AI but expressed concerns about stifling growth. 
Roys said she wants to see consumer protections and said she has authored legislation to crack down on crypto kiosk scams as well as to regulate on the use of AI to ensure landlords don’t use it to help hike rents.
Hughes compared AI to a hammer, saying it could be used to hurt someone or to build structures.
“Trying to regulate it at this moment could potentially hold back some of the benefits that we might see from it. I think that we need to continue to watch it,” Hughes said. “ … I want to make sure that we preserve the right to use that tool in a way that can really advance our society forward.”
Crowley said he thinks there should be laws in place, but there is no “one-size-fits-all solution for technology.”
“How do you make sure that those who are directly involved in this particular industry are at the table, making sure that there is some predictability when it comes down to starting your company and also making sure they can continue to grow?… But make sure that we’re also protecting our environment, protecting the consumer at the exact same time.” Crowley said. 
Schoemann, meanwhile, said he was concerned about how AI could be a threat to the state’s workforce. He noted that Washington County has studied the potential impacts of AI, finding that many jobs could be automated using AI in the next 15 years or so. 
He said he wanted to see more study of AI’s impact, to answer the question, “How do we prepare the workforce?”
Broadband and marijuana
A question about how to increase broadband access in Wisconsin led the an unexpected answer from Hong: “Legalize weed.”
Wisconsin is one of 11 states that hasn’t legalized recreational or medical marijuana. By some estimates the state is losing out on millions in tax revenue each year due to cannabis prohibition. 
“The revenue that comes in will be able to invest in fiber optic and high-speed internet in many different companies across the state,” Hong said.

The push to legalize marijuana for either recreational and medicinal purposes in Wisconsin has been a fruitless pursuit under split government. Republican lawmakers are working to advance a medical marijuana proposal in the Legislature right now, though it is unclear whether it can garner enough support to become law. 
Rodriguez said she didn’t disagree with Hong, noting that Wisconsin’s midwestern neighbors are able to bring in significant revenue by taxing marijuana.
“Gov. [J.B.] Pritzker thanks us all the time for the amount of tax Wisconsin [consumers pay],” Rodriguez said. 
Rodriguez also added that she wants to build off the Evers administration’s successes expanding broadband.
“It is a requirement for modern day working, for schools. We saw that during COVID,” Rodriguez said. “Making sure that we are able to get that type of connection to every part of Wisconsin is going to be important.” 
Hughes agreed both with marijuana legalization and with Rodriguez on broadband, saying there have been “incredible strides” in installing broadband in rural areas under the Evers administration. 
“I’m all for legalizing weed, and abortion for that matter,” Roys said. 
Roys noted that the state’s progressive tax structure has flattened over the last 16 years and that reversing that trend — taxing higher income residents — could help pay for investments in broadband.
Schoemann started his answer focused on broadband, rather than staking out his position on marijuana legalization, saying broadband it is a massive issue, especially in the Northwoods. He said Washington County was able to make progress using American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funding, though he didn’t necessarily support the funding. 
“I took [U.S] Rep. Glenn Grothman’s advice: ‘If they’re dumb enough to give you the money, you should be dumb enough to spend it,’” Schoemann said. “Some of that we did in broadband… I think we have to finish the job on broadband.”

(Photo by Jill Hummels/Kansas Reflector)More than 40% of Oklahoma’s energy generation comes from wind turbines and solar companies are showing increased interest in building projects in the state. Yet Oklahoma’s position as a top-tier renewable energy producer may fade following the passage of President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill.
Signed into law July 4, the megabill slashed tax incentives for wind and solar projects that were included in the Inflation Reduction Act, which were lauded as the U.S.’s first climate change mitigation law and passed during the Biden administration.
These cuts are expected to drive up electricity bills across the U.S., with some of the sharpest increases in Republican-led states, according to Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank.
Without tax credits the cost of wind and solar plants will go up. Companies will most likely respond by building fewer of these projects, and those facilities that do come on line will be much more costly.
When that occurs, it’s expected that the country will increase generation of electricity from natural gas plants which are often more expensive to run than wind and solar operations.
That shift will hit states hardest that do not diversify their energy resources and require that a specified percentage of the electricity utilities sell comes from renewable resources.
In Oklahoma, Energy Innovation predicts that electricity rates for residential, commercial and industrial consumers will grow between 60% and 350% over the next decade. That means $100 annual increases in household energy bills by 2030 and $540 by 2035. There is also a dire forecast for decreased economic activity. Their modeling suggests that Oklahoma will lose out on significant planned private investment and suffer job losses.
These cuts along with multiple laws passed by the 2025 Oklahoma Legislature that tightened regulations on wind and solar energy will at the very least slow down if not effectively stop the state’s renewable energy development.
The One Big Beautiful Bill was signed into law about two weeks after representatives from utilities and the Southwest Power Pool warned the Oklahoma Corporation Commission that the state would see a significant energy demand that is likely to outgrow its current supply.
Clearly, our electric utilities and regulators were caught off guard by the biggest jump in demand in a generation. One of the things they didn’t properly plan for is artificial intelligence, an immensely power-hungry technology, and the accompanying explosion in data centers.
One data center today consumes as much electricity as 100,000 households, but some of those currently under construction will require 20 times more.
As projections soar the question about the energy sources that will power the increased demand remain unanswered.
Natural gas in Oklahoma makes up about half of its generation. But it’s unclear if an adequate number of new plants will be built in time since gas-fired turbines, which are used in a majority of the country’s facilities, are backlogged for up to seven years.
Over-reliance on gas plants, coupled with mistaken assumptions about their reliability, is a significant grid vulnerability.
Gas plant operations are particularly susceptible to damage and disruptions during extreme weather events, which are becoming more frequent and severe as the climate changes. Remember in 2021 Winter Storm Uri hit the central United States and knocked nearly a quarter of the affected area’s power plant capacity offline. Gas plants accounted for most of the failed capacity.
Utilities can bolster grid reliability by utilizing clean energy solutions. Pursuing clean energy solutions instead of fossil fuels lessens not only global warming emissions but also toxic air pollutants that harm public health, particularly in communities of color where gas plants are disproportionately located. Further, these demand-side solutions can reduce the need for new infrastructure and decrease the land-use impacts that come with large-scale projects.
Ratepayers should not bear the burden of hosting dirty gas plants whose pollution puts their health at risk nor should they be responsible for the infrastructure and service costs associated with rapid load growth due to large users such as data
Our legislators, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission as well as utilities themselves should create unique electricity rate structures, or tariffs, for data centers. What this means is that data centers should be subject to rates, terms, and conditions that are more appropriate to how they use energy and their impact on the grid. Utility costs have long been assigned to the customers that cause those costs, at least in theory.
Meanwhile, utilities must prioritize the use of renewables, efficiency, energy storage, and other grid-supporting technologies to meet this demand.
Throwing new gas plants at the problem is an ineffectual attempt to keep up with energy demand predictions. We must recognize the paradigm shift that load growth from data centers represent and stop trying to solve new problems with old tools.

(Photo by Tom Davies/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Advocates for transgender Hoosiers are keeping up their fight against plans by the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles to stop allowing gender changes on driver’s licenses.
They oppose a BMV regulation revision first proposed in June to prohibit gender marker changes that have been allowed since 2009. The BMV’s proposal followed an executive order issued by Gov. Mike Braun in March prohibiting what he called “modern gender ideology” by state agencies.
Leaders of the advocacy organizations Indiana Youth Group and GenderNexus on Thursday criticized the BMV for reintroducing the rule change after dozens of people spoke against it during a July public hearing.
The BMV later withdrew that proposal but refiled an identical one on Oct. 15, setting up a new public comment period ahead of its possible adoption.

Also on Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a Trump administration policy to continue that requires passports list only an individual’s sex assigned at birth.

Opponents of the rule change plan on returning for a scheduled Nov. 14 public hearing at the Indiana Government Center in Indianapolis.
“People are going to take the time to show up again and have their voices heard and tell real-life stories of why this is harmful to not only the people who are denied the ID or driver’s license, but their families, their friends,” said Chris Paulsen, the Indiana Youth Group’s CEO.
The advocates argue that the BMV is manipulating the rulemaking process to produce an outcome meeting Braun’s wishes.
GenderNexus Executive Director Emma Vosicky questioned why the BMV was seeking to change a policy that had been in place for more than a decade.
“Why is it that the BMV wants to change that approach, which has not caused harm to people in this state, but has actually uplifted the lives of thousands of Hoosiers?” Vosicky said.
Changing previous policy
The proposed rule change would delete provisions allowing driver’s license gender changes for a person presenting a certified amended birth certificate or a physician’s statement that permanent gender change treatments had been completed.
The BMV asserts that the rule change is needed to comply with a 2024 state appeal court ruling that the agency didn’t have to allow a nonbinary — or “X” — option for driver’s licenses. That ruling determined that “gender” under the state’s motor vehicle code referred to a person’s male or female “sex.”
BMV spokesman Greg Dunn said Thursday that the agency refiled the rule proposal at the direction of the state attorney general’s office.
“The Attorney General’s office advised that a second public comment period and hearing should be held because so many substantive comments were submitted during the first public comment period,” Dunn said in an email statement. “Refiling the rule was only done for clerical purposes because it had already been submitted to the Attorney General’s office for approval.  The BMV wants to assure that anyone submitting a public comment on the matter that their voice will be heard and entered into the record.”
Braun’s office did not comment Thursday about criticism of the proposed rule change.
The governor’s March executive order directed state agencies to “respect and enforce the biological binary of man and woman as a fundamental and deeply rooted principle.”
Paulsen argued that the BMV change would prevent people from having identification “that reflects who they are.”
The advocates said such policies “nurture hostility” toward transgender people.
“The moment that you have a driver’s license that doesn’t match up with how you present, you have been outed, and you are now a target for violence,” Vosicky said. “We all know that outing results in violence.”

Lawmakers, water commissioners question ballooning costs for proposed West Fork, Alkali Creek reservoirs amid cuts to other state programs.
The post Dam estimate almost doubles to $150M as pols challenge runaway water projects appeared first on WyoFile .","State officials grilled Water Development Office Director Jason Mead this week over ballooning costs and uncertainties dogging three dam projects after he told them one project on the Colorado border would cost $150 million, nearly double the original estimate of $80 million.
Mead provided the new estimate for the proposed West Fork Dam above the Little Snake River Valley while seeking an additional $500,000 to study it. The controversial plan would swap state land for Forest Service property to enable construction of a 264 foot-high, 700-foot long concrete dam. Forty-four irrigators have expressed interest in purchasing water for supplemental irrigation, although prices have yet to be set.
Mead also will seek $1.5 million more to research easement problems dogging the proposed Alkali Dam above Hyattville, he told members of the Wyoming Legislature’s Select Water Committee on Tuesday. The Legislature has earmarked $59 million for that project. Officials in 2017 estimated it would cost $35 million, but it could be as expensive as $113 million.
Mead’s construction director also outlined a $315,000 need for safety monitoring and other work at the Middle Piney Reservoir, which was rebuilt atop a natural landslide that leaks. “We’re not sure whether it’s a concern or not, which is why we want it monitored,” Bill Brewer told the legislative panel that met with the Wyoming Water Development Commission.
“I gotta catch up, sometimes, to how fast and how easily and how effortlessly we allocate dollars — just boom!” Mike Gierau
Sen. Mike Gierau of Jackson, a Democrat, said water developers operate in a different world than the rest of Wyoming.
“I sit in a lot of meetings,” he said, “and everything I hear is ‘we don’t have any money. We’ve got to cut spending. We’ve got to end programs. We’ve got to cut across the board, 20, 30, 40%,’” he continued. “We’re like fighting in hedgerow country over 50 bucks.
“Then I come to select water,” Gierau said of the committee, “and I feel like I’m walking into a casino … an alternate reality. I gotta catch up, sometimes, to how fast and how easily and how effortlessly we allocate dollars — just boom!”
Not making sense
Sen. Ogden Driskill, a Republican from Devils Tower, said the proposed West Fork Dam, which would have 8,000 acre feet of active storage on the West Fork of Battle Creek, would be “the highest priced water project we’ve ever built on a per-acre-foot basis.” Further, the irrigation flows would be “supplemental” — for late-season watering — not “primary” flows used for conventional summer-long hay and forage production.
Even with the irrigation water he gets for free in his Campbell County ranching community, “it’s hard to make it work [financially],” Driskill said. He compared his irrigation supply to the West Fork plan asking: “Would it be logical to expect that this [West Fork water] is going to cost about 1,000 times as much per acre foot — delivered?”
Given the costs, Driskill said, irrigators are going to say “we can’t afford it,” while Wyoming and the federal government will have to pay “99.997%.” Considering there are other projects that could be built for $150 million, “is there any way that any part of this economically ever makes any sense?” he asked.
The Natural Resources Conservation Service is estimating a benefit-to-cost ratio of “a hair above 1.0,” which suggests a profitable project, Mead said. He agreed with Driskill.
“It’s heavily subsidized water,” Mead said.
It’s impossible now to decide whether the West Fork project is worthy, given uncertainties surrounding funding sources and irrigators’ ability, or inability, to pay the true cost of the water, Gierau said. Driskill agreed.
“I’m having a hard time getting the math pulled together from my end of it,” Driskill said. “At some point we’ve got to make a decision if we’re going to subsidize ag water to [such] an incredible degree.”
Mead said the price of water was “the price of what we all value in Wyoming — and that’s open spaces and agriculture,” plus wildlife and fisheries. With additional water storage, ranchers “won’t have to sell their properties, potentially, [to] out-of-staters that are going to have a little bit different management idea.
The proposed West Fork Dam would be built in and inundate part of this Battle Creek Canyon above the Little Snake River Valley in Carbon County. (Major King/WyoFile)
“Most of our small communities,” Mead said of Wyoming’s social tapestry, “are propped up from the surrounding agriculture.”
The proposed reservoir would release stored water into the Little Snake River, which flows back and forth across the Colorado border before leaving Wyoming for good, flowing into the Yampa, Green and Colorado rivers. The dam and reservoir would allow Wyoming to use more water from the Colorado River Basin, where states are at loggerheads over how to share oversubscribed flows.
Ultimately, the panel voted to extend an agreement to study the dam and to add $130,000 to a consultant’s contract to further investigate a wide array of issues, from the temperature of water released from the proposed dam to sediment buildup behind the structure and scouring of creek banks downstream.
Holdouts
At Hyattville and the site of the proposed Alkali Dam and reservoir, Mead said his office is trying to resolve conflicts over needed easements with neighboring landowners. Some are holding out because they would be impacted by the project but not necessarily benefit from it.
To entice them, his office may go beyond traditional water-storage amenities to, among other things, design center-pivot irrigation systems, an undertaking that would be an exception to the office’s rule for such projects. The Alkali project also could provide livestock watering on nearby public land and additional water diversion structures — add-ons that aren’t a core part of the proposed dam and reservoir.
“We’ve at least got verbal feedback that if all those things can happen, then they’re willing to sign option agreements when they’re put in front of them,” Mead said of the easement holdouts.
Water commission member Liisa Anselmi-Dalton said she would vote for extending a consultant’s contract — the Legislature will have to approve $1.5 million to fund the additional work — but will likely oppose “the next $1.5 million.”
“We’re being held captive [by] some people,” she said, referring to the neighbors, “some people putting things in and saying, ‘hey, you’re stuck here with us now.’”
Gierau agreed with Anselmi-Dalton. “I think we’re being held hostage,” he said.
Tim Gardiner, a neighbor to the planned dam, saw it differently. He’s worried about the dam, which is proposed right above his Twisted Tippet Ranch and assumed in planning documents to be a high-risk structure, he said in an interview. He wants proponents to provide him with flood insurance, among other things.
“They’re trying to bribe [holdouts] with taxpayer dollars,” Gardiner said.
Water commissioners agreed to extend a consultant’s contract for the Alkali Creek project.
The Legislature will have to provide the additional $1.5 million to fund further work on the changing proposal.
Seepage
For the Middle Piney Reservoir, the committee and commission agreed on another $315,000 to add remote control devices at the hard-to-reach dam site and install flow monitors to keep track of the leaking landslide that underlies the rebuilt dam. Completed in 2023, the reservoir hasn’t filled up in the last two summers.
The additional funding would extend a contractor’s responsibilities until the U.S. Forest Service, which owns the underlying property, signs off on the project’s completion.
A dam was built atop a landslide in the 1940s, water office construction director Brewer said. The Forest Service ordered the gates to be locked open 20 years ago. Because the reservoir, in the Colorado River Basin, holds valuable water rights, the Water Development Commission rebuilt parts of the structure atop the landslide.
“We do get some seepage through that natural landslide,” Brewer said. “Both us and the Forest Service [would] like to see a little more information on how much seepage we’re getting.
“It does not appear to be serious,” he said, “but it is something we want to look at, at least to make sure we’re not moving any material.”
The leak amounts to “a small spring trickling along one area,” he said.

(Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey Republicans reelected their Senate and Assembly leaders Thursday, two days after voters ousted several GOP Assembly members and left the party with its smallest caucus in decades.
The party retained Sen. Tony Bucco (R-Morris) and Assemblyman John DiMaio (R-Warren) for another term as minority leaders. DiMaio in a statement said the party will “will fight for the future of New Jersey.”
“Now more than ever, New Jersey families, seniors and businesses struggling under decades of Democrat control need us to be their voice in Trenton,” he said.
Election night was a drubbing for Republicans, who lost at least three seats in the Assembly, handing Democrats a two-thirds supermajority in the 80-seat body. Races in two other Republican districts are too close to call. GOP leaders expect five total losses.
Republicans credit the coattails of Gov.-elect Mikie Sherill (D), who won a decisive victory in Tuesday’s gubernatorial race against Republican Jack Ciattarelli, with the GOP’s dismal performance in Assembly races.
DiMaio’s reelection as minority leader spurred discontent with at least one member of his caucus. Assemblyman Jay Webber (R-Morris) said the chamber’s GOP leadership does not deserve another term after losses in two consecutive cycles.

Webber said he wanted there to be a discussion on Thursday before Republicans in the Assembly decided on leadership, but he was overruled.
“I am not pointing fingers at John. I’m not blaming him for the loss,” Webber told the New Jersey Monitor. “But when you’re the leader of a caucus, you’re the captain of the ship and it hits an iceberg, you can’t ask to steer the ship again. You should give someone else a chance.”
Republicans lost six Assembly seats in 2023, when Democrats flipped four seats across the 3rd and 11th legislative districts and claimed a single seat each in the 8th and 30th districts. Democrats flipped the other 8th District Assembly seat on Tuesday, among their other gains.
At best, Republicans will emerge from this year’s elections with 25 of the Assembly’s 80 seats. If Democrats claim seats in outstanding districts, Republicans could begin the new legislative session in January with even fewer.
Races in the 2nd and 25th Districts are too close to call and are unlikely to see a winner declared before provisional ballots are tallied Wednesday. Republicans went into Election Day controlling both Assembly seats in those districts.
“We haven’t been this low in membership since after Watergate,” Webber said.
Assemblyman Brian Bergen (R-Morris), who will remain the minority whip, defended DiMaio’s leadership.
“John DiMaio had nearly unanimous support in the room. The only dissent came from someone who wasn’t in the fight helping at all this election cycle. That says everything,” Bergen said.
All the leadership positions in the Senate, where members were not up for reelection this year, remain the same. In the lower chamber, Assemblyman Brian Rumpf (R-Ocean) will take Assemblywoman Nancy Munoz’s role as the chamber’s GOP budget officer, and Assemblywoman Vicky Flynn (R-Monmouth) will take Rumpf’s role as parliamentarian. Munoz (R-Union) was among the Republicans who lost their seats Tuesday.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Last week’s column noted the dismal approval ratings for Trump and even worse for Montana’s all-Republican Congressional delegation. Indeed, with one in three (or fewer) Montanans approving the delegation and the record low national approval of the president, it seemed like the propaganda about how great everything is was, well, running into the hard wall of reality.  
Then came Tuesday’s elections and the reality-TV president and his gobbling MAGA sycophants nationwide went down hard as the voters “just said no” to the anger, lies, and aggression spinning out of the White House.
Chief among Tuesday’s most decisive rejection of the president and his unending threats of retribution was the election of 34-year old Zohran Mamdani as New York City’s next mayor. He was vilified as a “lunatic Communist” by Trump, who threatened to cut off federal funding for the city if he was elected.  
Yet Mamdani cruised to victory — and he didn’t pull any punches in his victory speech, saying: “After all, the conventional wisdom would tell you that I am far from the perfect candidate. I am young, despite my best efforts to grow older. I am Muslim. I am a Democratic socialist. And most damning of all, I refuse to apologize for any of this.
“In this moment of political darkness, New York will be the light. New York will remain a city of immigrants — a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants, and as of tonight, led by an immigrant.  So hear me, President Trump, when I say this: To get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us.  
“Together, we will usher in a generation of change. And if we embrace this brave new course, rather than fleeing from it, we can respond to oligarchy and authoritarianism with the strength it fears, not the appeasement it craves.  After all, if anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him. In this moment of political darkness, New York will be the light.”
Nor was he alone in securing victory by speaking truth to power as MAGA candidates and issues fell by the wayside nationwide.  Far from being just a “blue state” rejection as claimed by the GOP, a sheriff who embraced ICE was defeated in Pennsylvania; progressives won all the open seats on Texas’ third largest school board; Georgia elected its first Democrats to the Public Service Commission since 2007; the Republican supermajority in Mississippi no longer exists for the first time since 2012; Colorado approved higher taxes on households with more than $300,000 income to fund free school lunches; and Maine voters rejected a MAGA initiative to make voting more difficult and did so by a whopping 60% 
Surely given their already terrible approval numbers, Montana’s GOP Congressional delegation — and governor — should be having second thoughts about their unquestioning support for everything that splurts from Trump’s mouth and his cadre of wealthy, racist and hard-hearted cronies.  
Denying Supplemental Nutrition (SNAP) funding for low-income families while blaming Democrats isn’t working since it’s the GOP that controls all three branches of government but can’t seem to govern. 
Then there’s the job cuts, which are up a whopping 175% since the same time last year with more than a million jobs lost since Trump took office. 
The takeaway?  It’s long past time for our governor and congressional delegation to get back to being “public servants” rather than MAGA puppets — or come next election, they’ll likely be joining their ousted fellow MAGAs on the loser’s bench.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/gavinnewsomnov52025-1024x698.jpg,,,2025-11-07 06:17:04.324185

(Courtesy of Minidoka Memorial Hospital)Idaho is asking the federal government for $100 million annually over five years to support rural health care through a grant created in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” 
Through the major federal tax and spending bill approved by Congress in July, states are entitled to a pool of $25 billion divided equally among each state, of which Idaho will receive $500 million over five years. 
All 50 states will vie for funds from $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program

Another $25 billion was set aside to be distributed as grants to states based on need. Idaho submitted its application Nov. 4 in hopes of receiving the additional $100 million in annual grant money, aiming to collect a total of $200 million annually between both distributions, or $1 billion over five years.
“Idaho is a mostly rural state, and we are grateful for the significant investments President (Donald) Trump and Congress have committed to improving healthcare access, quality, and outcomes in rural Idaho and across the country,” Idaho Gov. Brad Little said in an emailed statement. “We are proud of the effective, collaborative approach we utilized in preparing Idaho’s application for funding through this transformative new program.” 
Little created a task force through an October executive order to recommend priorities for the application. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare also solicited input from the public through a survey. 
Idaho’s application centered on five initiatives: 

“Initiative 1: Improving rural access to care through technology.
Initiative 2: Ensuring accessible, quality care through innovative models.
Initiative 3: Sustaining rural workforce with training, recruitment, and retention.
Initiative 4: Implementing population-specific, evidence-based projects to make rural America healthy again.
Initiative 5: Investing in rural health infrastructure and partnerships.” 

 What is Idaho trying to do with the funds? 

The state’s application focused on a population of 655,070 Idahoans who live in rural census tracts, all rural health care centers, hospitals and facilities, and the five federally recognized Native American nations in the state. 
Idaho officials plan to set aside 3.5% of total funds awarded for the state’s tribal nations, the report said, based on the percentage of the state’s Native population over the state’s total rural population. 
The state hopes to enhance telehealth as well as mobile and community-based services, upgrade electronic health records, develop a shared technology infrastructure, utilize artificial intelligence, and pair “technology with provider training.” 
There are also proposed investments in Emergency Medical Services, software upgrades at rural health centers, installation of “telehealth pods” and “diagnostic kiosks,” recruitment and retention incentives at the undergraduate and graduate level for training physicians as well as retention bonuses and sign-on incentives for practicing doctors, and increased utilization of non-physicians health care professionals such as nurse practitioners, medical assistants, and pharmacists. 
The application also lays out plans to deploy technology, such as phone apps, to monitor and educate about chronic health conditions. 
The goals laid out in the application include reducing emergency department visits for chronic conditions by 20%, and increasing the ratio of physicians per 100,000 population from 193 in 2023 to at least 195 by 2030.

 What are the health care challenges in rural Idaho? 

The state’s application outlines several of the challenges faced by rural residents, including higher rates of preventable illness and premature deaths than the national average. Idaho’s rural residents with chronic conditions have higher death rates than those living in urban areas, according to the application. 
Nearly 60% of residents are affected by primary health care professional shortages, and nearly 66% of residents are in what’s called a dental health care professional shortage area. The entirety of the state’s landmass and population fall in what’s considered a mental health professional shortage area, the application said. 
Most rural residents have no or limited access to public transportation and must drive significant distances to reach care, which can cause people to postpone preventative care, the application said. 
The state’s rural hospitals and clinics face significant financial pressures. A 2024 assessment found that 46% of Idaho’s Critical Access Hospitals maintain fewer than 100 days cash on hand, the application said.  
[subhed]Rural Idaho hospitals bracing for reductions in Medicaid payments [/subhed]
Many rural hospitals in Idaho are struggling financially because of low patient volumes and a reliance on reimbursements from Medicaid, which are often less than what it costs to provide the care. 
This summer, Idaho said it would cut Medicaid reimbursement rates for health care providers by 4%, the Sun reported. 
The state budget is facing a projected budget shortfall of more than $49.3 million by the end of the fiscal year, which prompted Little to direct agencies to cut their budgets by 3% ongoing. 
The federal “Big Beautiful Bill” is expected to reduce Medicaid spending in rural areas by $137 billion nationwide over 10 years, according to an analysis by the health policy organization KFF. It’s estimated Idaho’s Medicaid funds will be cut by up to $4.3 billion over the decade. 
U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, previously told the Sun that the reductions are meant to protect Medicaid for those it was intended for, and most people who are disabled, children, or able-bodied and complying with new work requirements will maintain their coverage. 
“The only way to prove this is to wait and see what actually happens,” Crapo said.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)Tennessee’s one-of-a-kind TennCare Medicaid waiver program crossed over $1 billion in savings, TennCare Director Stephen Smith told state officials during the agency’s budget hearing Thursday.
The program, referred to as “shared-savings,” is a Medicaid waiver that allows the state to access about half of the money it saves from its federal allocation to pay for insurance coverage for the state’s poorest residents.
Tennessee is the only state to receive such a waiver. The state applied for the program in 2021, despite concerns that the only way to save money was to remove people from TennCare or reduce services.
About 1.4 million Tennesseans, or 20%, are enrolled in TennCare, of which over 800,000 are children. As recently as 2023, over 1.7 million were enrolled in TennCare, but the agency purged about 300,000 after the expiration of the rules that had prevented it from doing so during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Tennessee is still one of the handful of states that haven’t expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, which could have helped hundreds of thousands of Tennesseans access more affordable insurance. 
This year, TennCare can tap about $345 million in “shared savings,” which it plans to spend. In the past, the “shared savings” cash has been used to invest in rural healthcare programs, pregnant women and children and to provide $100 million in disaster loans after Hurricane Helene.
The state is using $5 million from the fund to support food banks, after President Donald Trump’s administration refused to fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in November during the federal government shutdown. 
Overall, TennCare requested a $750 million budget increase, mostly from federal funds, in line with its requests over the past few years, attributed to annual increases in medical costs.

(Photo courtesy of Shepherd University) A new program at Shepherd University aims to help beginning farmers in West Virginia’s Eastern Panhandle. The school’s Agricultural Small Business Incubator program is now accepting applicants for the 2026 growing season. 
The program will offer farming mentorship and up to a quarter acre of land to grow on, plus access to cold storage, greenhouse space, a tractor and other specialty equipment the farmers may be interested in trying out, said Molly Sutter, program coordinator. The program will also help farmers with business and marketing, infrastructure and irrigation. 
“We’re just trying to help out farmers,” Sutter said. “Everywhere, but especially in Jefferson County, there’s so much farmland that’s being developed mostly for housing and also planned data centers. We really want to support small farmers who want to farm.”
Program leaders say the ideal candidates are those with some experience farming and a business idea who don’t have land to grow on. 
“The idea is that they would maybe spend some time in this space, leasing land at a really inexpensive rate from us until they have their footing, and then they might want to go and get land of their own once they’re established and have some funds,” Sutter said. “Because the upfront cost of farming can be a lot with equipment and everything.”
According to the state Department of Agriculture, West Virginia has nearly 23,000 farms that cover 3.5 million acres. More than 90% of the state’s farms are family-owned and operated.
Brooke Comer, an assistant professor of environmental science and the program lead for the incubator, said there’s room for farm expansion in the state’s Eastern Panhandle, but there are barriers to getting started.
“The people that are interested in farming and kind of filling some of the void where there is additional need, oftentimes, if you’re not coming in as a generational farm and inheriting land, that is a major barrier to entry,” she said. “So the point of an incubator farm, more than anything, is to reduce those barriers to entry into farming.”
Beth Southern, a spokeswoman for the West Virginia Department of Agriculture, said the agency is not aware of other farm incubators operating in the state, though there are other programs that support beginning farmers. 
“Programs like the farm incubator at Shepherd are exactly what we need to help grow the next generation of farmers in West Virginia,” state Agriculture Commissioner Kent Leonhardt said through an email from Southern. “Getting hands-on experience and guidance early on makes a big difference. It gives new producers the confidence and know-how to build successful operations. Agriculture is changing, and programs like this help young people bring new ideas to the table while keeping our farming traditions alive.”
Comer said the program doesn’t have a specific time limit in mind for how long farmers can work with the incubator, but it’s typically up to five years. 
“At that point you’ve grown your business to such a degree that you have your clientele base, you know that business plan and all the finances and could essentially graduate off the farm and either purchase or rent your own land that’s going to support that farm business,” Comer said. “That’s going to be easier to do now that you have all of that experience and that base of your marketing.”
The farm incubator takes up about 10 fenced acres of Shepherd’s Tabler Farm, which is about 160 acres. They’re also putting in an additional 40 acres for the possibility of rotating grazing animals, Comer said. 
The program is funded with a grant from the federal Small Business Administration. 
Comer said there will be educational opportunities at the farm, and farmers can also learn from each other.
“There’s so much benefit, I think, to growing side by side with other farmers that maybe are growing different things, so they have different techniques,” Comer said. “That way you’re expanding your knowledge and this grassroots kind of way.”
The farm incubator has enough space for 18 participants. Four people have applied for the program for next year so far. 
The application for the farm incubator program can be found at the school’s website. For more information, email Comer at bcomer@shepherd.edu or Sutter at msutter@shepherd.edu.

(Getty Images)Open enrollment to sign up for health coverage on Idaho’s state health insurance exchange (Your Health Idaho) is underway in Idaho, running from Oct. 15 through Dec. 15, and this year comes with new challenges for thousands of Idahoans. Unless Congress acts, the enhanced premium tax credits (ePTCs) that have made health insurance more affordable will expire on Dec. 31, forcing families and small business owners to face dramatic increases in their monthly payments.
The federal government shut down after a health care clash. In Idaho, the stakes are high.

Tax credits to help families afford their health insurance have been around for over 10 years. A few years ago, Congress enhanced them because families needed extra support to maintain their coverage. These ePTCs reduced what people pay each month for their health insurance and expanded eligibility so that no household would spend more than 8.5% of income on monthly payments. The “tax credit cliff” was also removed which left middle-income families paying disproportionately high premiums simply because they earned slightly above the cutoff.
The results were immediate and meaningful. Idaho families saved an average of $700 a year, and more than 86% of Idahoans enrolled used these tax credits. Subsequently we saw more people enroll, which creates stability and keeps costs lower for everyone.
That progress is at risk. With the expiration of the ePTCs, health insurance payments are rising again. For many Idaho families and small business owners, those higher monthly payments add up to thousands of dollars more a year. For others, especially those who are self-employed or running small businesses, the increase could make coverage completely out of reach.
According to recent estimates, 25,000 Idahoans are expected to drop their insurance if the ePTCs aren’t made permanent. For a family of four in Idaho, annual costs could increase by more than $6,000, forcing many to choose between keeping their health insurance and paying for other essentials like rent, childcare, or transportation. For some families, costs will triple because the “tax credit cliff” will be reinstated. 
Those statistics represent real people and real sacrifices. In every part of Idaho, families are trying to make hard choices about how to balance their budgets while protecting their health. A rancher in eastern Idaho, a child care provider in Twin Falls, or a young family in Lewiston could each be one unexpected bill away from losing the security that health insurance provides.
When people can’t afford their monthly payments, they often put off preventive care, skip prescriptions, or wait until they’re seriously ill before seeking help. That leads to higher costs and worse health outcomes, not only for those families, but for the entire health system. Hospitals, health care providers, and rural clinics all feel the strain when more people go uninsured.
The ePTCs were a proven solution. They lowered costs and expanded coverage. Letting them expire undermines that progress and risks reversing the historic coverage gains we’ve seen over the past few years.
Congress has an opportunity to fix this. Lawmakers should act quickly to permanently extend the ePTCs, ensuring families, small business owners, and self-employed workers can continue to afford health insurance. This is not a partisan issue. It’s about protecting the health and economic stability of Idaho families and communities.
Health insurance is not a luxury. It’s a foundation that allows families to stay healthy and productive. Idaho families deserve the peace of mind that comes from knowing they can see a doctor when they need to without wondering how they’ll pay for it. Congress should act now to make the enhanced premium tax credits permanent and keep healthcare within reach for every Idahoan.

In a scene familiar to Wisconsinites, Pennsylvania voters beat back an effort by a MAGA billionaire to buy their state supreme court. “People don’t want corporate control of the courts,” Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chair Eugene DePasquale said of the millions wasted on that race by TikTok billionaire Jeff Yass — a repeat of Elon Musk’s failed bid to buy a friendly majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. 
The results are a concrete sign that there is a political price associated with the chaos Trump and his GOP enablers have unleashed, sending federal agents to terrorize American cities, driving up health care costs and inflicting unnecessary suffering and hunger on Americans during the longest government shutdown in history.
Young men, Black and Latino voters, working-class people — all the demographic groups that abandoned Democrats in 2024 returned in droves on Tuesday. As the Democrats celebrated their wins, they also seemed to concede that they were benefitting from the mess Republicans have made of governing. People are hurting, their outlook is grim, and they are in the mood to throw out the party in power after just six months.
Democrats need to form an aggressive, unified opposition to champion the will of those voters and not just take their support for granted. And Republicans had better re-examine their unwavering loyalty to Trump.
So far, in Wisconsin, Republican members of Congress have not signaled that they care about the catastrophic effects of Trump’s policies on their constituents.
In an interview with “UpFront” on WISN 12 News on Sunday, Republican U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden wouldn’t say if he supports extending Affordable Care Act subsidies, even as Wisconsinites are receiving the news that without the subsidies their premiums are set to skyrocket by 45% to 800% depending on where in the state they live.
Van Orden, who supports a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act, repeatedly declared on “UpFront” that he “won’t be held hostage” by Democrats who have made preventing a huge spike in health care costs for people who buy insurance on the ACA marketplace — more than 310,000 of them in Wisconsin — a condition of their votes to reopen the government. Nor has he been willing to say whether he supports or opposes the Trump administration’s decision to withhold food assistance from 700,000 Wisconsinites during the shutdown.
U.S. Rep Tom Tiffany, who is running for governor, also supports repealing the Affordable Care Act and this month called on Republicans to “hold firm” against extending ACA tax credits, repeating the lie that Democrats are shutting down the government because they want to give health care to “illegal aliens.”
U.S. Rep Bryan Steil told “UpFront” that the Trump administration is in “a very difficult position” as it makes the decision to fire thousands of federal workers during the shutdown. He also claimed he might support extending ACA subsidies, but only after the shutdown ends, and if there are “significant changes to that program to root out waste, fraud and abuse.” 
Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, took the opportunity, as health care subsidies lapse and insurance premiums spike, to hold a hearing Thursday on the “harms” caused by extending health care coverage to millions of Americans through the Affordable Care Act.
Is it any wonder that voters are not thrilled with how the party that holds complete control in Washington is governing?
What’s significant about Tuesday’s election is that it puts everyone on notice that voters will push back.
Over and over, during the Democrats’ Wednesday press conference, various national leaders eagerly declared that theirs is the party of “affordability.” But Martin acknowledged that his party had lost touch with working class voters worried about making ends meet. He said Democrats “didn’t focus on that anxiety enough over the years.” and that they have to “give working class people the sense that we’re fighting for them.”
It doesn’t take a political genius to see the vulnerability in the wretched excesses of the Trump administration, which is forcing children to go hungry while throwing a lavish “Great Gatsby” party at Mar-a-Lago and building a massive, gilded ballroom at the White House.
If nothing else, Democrats are the populist alternative by default. But there also seems to be a sincere effort underway to build a democratic resistance that will fight for most Americans against the MAGA oligarchs who are liquidating civil society and sucking up the common wealth of the nation to enrich themselves.
Martin and the other Dems on the Wednesday call trumpeted the importance of state-level politics. “The path back to building Democratic power runs through state legislatures,” declared Heather Williams, president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, adding, “the center of gravity has moved to the states.” 
Martin agreed. “I believe this party has ignored building power at the state level for too long,” he said. “We cannot just build federal power.” 
The stars of this new strategy are Democratic governors — the most popular Democratic politicians in America, according to the panel, which made a passing mention of the importance of the 2026 Wisconsin governor’s race. Certainly Virginia Democrats, who won back both the state legislature and the governor’s mansion, gave hope to Wisconsin Dems who are hoping to do the same.
But how much the national party will engage in Wisconsin and who will emerge from a crowded field of Democratic hopefuls in the first open election for governor here in 15 years is very much up in the air. 
On Thursday, at a gubernatorial candidate forum covered by Baylor Spears, candidates were asked to name the greatest threat to Wisconsin’s economy. Few had a simple, appealing answer that connected to most voters’ most immediate concerns — skyrocketing prices, a shredding safety net and the disappearing prospect of shared prosperity. 
Tuesday’s elections showed that we still have a democracy, that voters have a say in how the government is run, and that they won’t put up with an endless cycle of abuse.
That should embolden everyone who is shocked and appalled by what is happening to our country — including those Wisconsin Republicans who have so far been afraid to criticize Trump, as well as the Democrats who need to point the way to a better future.

(Getty Images)Three elected judges in Louisiana are leveraging a new privacy law to remove their home addresses and spouse’s work addresses from the state’s public campaign finance database that tracks political donations and spending. 
The Louisiana Board of Ethics wants to know the extent to which it has to comply with these requests. It asked Attorney General Liz Murrill in June for a legal opinion clarifying the requirements it must meet, but Murrill’s office hasn’t issued its response yet. 
Judges can demand a large swath of personal information be taken down from government and privately-operated websites under a law that went into effect in February. The statute conflicts with longstanding laws meant to ensure government and election transparency that the ethics board traditionally follows. 
The ethics board is likely to have far more than three requests for redactions in 2026. Starting in February, hundreds of additional elected officials will also be eligible to ask for their personal information, as well as their family members’ information, to be removed from campaign finance and personal disclosure databases.

Louisiana lawmakers voted earlier this year to expand the list of people entitled to keep their personal information private to include state lawmakers, statewide elected officials, public service commissioners, district attorneys, assistant district attorneys and district attorney investigators. 

The privilege will also be extended to the people who live with them, such as spouses, children and other dependents. 

The privacy law was intended to protect public officials and their families from harassment and violence. But government transparency advocates warned it will make it easier for public servants to hide conflicts of interest.
“[The law] is well-intentioned but really problematic,” said David Cuillier, director of The Freedom of Information Project at the University of Florida. “All it is going to do is end up having corrupt politicians hide from the public.” 
 Three judges, 66 reports

All active and retired judges — those at the city, state and federal levels — have the option of asking the ethics board to remove their personal information from its website and campaign finance database. But so far, only three have done so, according to documents received through a public records request. 
All three judges preside over the Jefferson Parish Juvenile Court — Barron Burmaster, Amanda Calogero and Jennifer Womble. They sent letters in May asking to have their home addresses and spouse’s business addresses taken off the ethics board’s website. 
“This law was proposed because there has been a national increase in violence towards members of the judiciary and was enacted to help protect the members of the Louisiana judiciary and their family members,” said Dawn Palermo, judicial administrator of the Jefferson Parish Juvenile Court, who spoke on behalf of the judges. 

In total, the three judges’ requests would require the ethics board to alter 66 separate reports and the campaign finance database housed on its website. These included redactions to forms the judges submitted years ago before they were on the bench. 
Burmaster asked for his home address and his wife’s business address to be removed from personal financial disclosure records he filed as a member of the Lafitte Area Independent Levee District from 2008-13, before he became a judge. 
Calogero asked for her address to be taken off of old travel disclosure forms for out-of-state conferences she attended while working as a Jefferson Parish prosecutor from 2012-18. 

All three judges have asked for addresses to be removed from the section of campaign finance documents that details personal loans their campaigns received. 
Burmaster requested that the business address of Barataria Dental, which made a $5,000 loan to his 2013 campaign, be removed because it is his wife’s dental practice. 
Calogero asked that her campaign committee chairman’s work address be taken off several campaign finance reports because he is also her husband.

In response to the requests, the ethics board has removed the home addresses and spouse’s work addresses off of the judges’ personal disclosure forms and campaign organizational paperwork that appears on its website. 

But the board is holding off on altering any of the campaign finance reports that provide details about donors and loans until Murrill provides more clarification, Ethics Administrator David Bordelon said. 
 When enough is enough

Among the questions the ethics board has for Murrill is whether the new law requires it to remove a home or work address entirely or whether the board can keep the city and state listing available. 

Addresses are often used to verify the identity of a contributor or a vendor to a campaign. 

For example, an address listing for a campaign contributor named Mike Johnson would help determine whether a campaign donation is coming from the U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson of Benton, Louisiana House Speaker Pro Tempore Mike Johnson of Pineville or a private citizen with the same name. 
This is likely to become a much more pressing matter for the ethics board next year. Active judges are prohibited from making political campaign contributions. It is less likely their addresses need to be removed from campaign finance reports other than their own. 

But the elected officials who will be entitled to have their personal information redacted in 2026 are among the state’s most prolific political donors. Statewide officials, legislators and their families regularly make contributions to each other. 
If even a fraction of them asked for their addresses to be removed from all reports, the number of documents that would have to be altered could easily climb into the thousands. 
 Internet vs. IRL

The ethics board has also asked the attorney general to clarify whether redaction requests only apply to documents shared on the internet. It’s unclear whether a person could make a public records request for a form that has been redacted online and receive an unredacted hardcopy of the same document. 
The new privacy law allows public servants to block the publishing of their personal information but also defines “publish” narrowly as “to publicly post or publicly display on the internet.”

“You can still go to those entities and get those pieces of paper. … You are not specifically prohibiting someone from getting the information,” Judge Tiffany Chase, with the Louisiana Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal, told lawmakers while advocating for the bill in 2024. 

“It’s just that it cannot be on the internet,” she said.  

The purpose of the law was not to hide information from the public, according to Chase. It was to provide a “cooling off” period for a person who might be angry at a judge or elected official to calm down before they get access to the public servant’s home address, she said. 
Still, the law has already been used at least once to block access to a judge’s records both online and in person. Louisiana Supreme Court Justice Will Crain used the statute to justify sealing his divorce filings for 11 months. The public wasn’t able to access them electronically or as paper copies at that time.

While the ethics board primarily deals with home and work addresses, the new law allows judges — and soon many more elected officials — to demand the removal of a far larger swath of information from social media and websites.  

Under the law, public servants can also ask for the removal of their license plate numbers, vehicle identification numbers, marital records, birth dates, a child’s school or daycare, and places of worship, among other items, on the internet. 

These demands for redactions can be made to governments, businesses and private individuals, including those who share a social media post or who use that information in a news story. 

The penalties for not complying are severe. The law allows judges — and soon hundreds of other elected officials — to sue public bodies and individuals for damages for refusing to remove their protected information.

A violation of the law could also result in criminal misdemeanor charges that carry a sentence of up to 90 days in prison or a $1,000 fine.
This could be part of the reason why the ethics board might ask state lawmakers for an exemption to the law, Bordelon said. If granted, it wouldn’t have to remove the public information from its website. 
Legislators have already carved out one such exception for the Secretary of State’s office. That agency oversees candidate qualification forms, voter registration information and business ownership paperwork. 
Secretary of State Nancy Landry, R-Lafayette, said her agency wouldn’t have enough manpower to meet the redaction requests it could receive. She argued for the agency to be exempt from the requirement.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Gavel-GettyImages-876701606-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-11-07 06:17:04.324185

Shelby County Sheriff’s officers will start enforcing immigration law in Memphis as part of a deal reached with Tennessee and federal officials, a move critics say will increase fear in the Hispanic community.
Deputies will serve as warrant officers on immigration cases under the agreement, documents show, potentially increasing their role in the Memphis Safe Task Force and the Trump administration’s national immigrant sweep.
Tennessee Safety and Homeland Security Commissioner Jeff Long told the Lookout on Tuesday that Shelby County was preparing to sign the paperwork, but he didn’t know if it had been completed.
“I think they’re negotiating some issues on jail space,” Long said.
By Wednesday, it was signed.
Shelby County’s entrance into the 287(g) program made it the 28th Tennessee county to reach an agreement with the feds for local law enforcement officers to enforce immigration law. Six more requests by sheriff’s offices and police in Tennessee are pending.

Long said the state’s new immigration bureau isn’t dealing with individual task force cases but is coordinating with local agencies that want to enforce immigration laws. The bureau also is making grants to local agencies, but it was unclear how many of those have been made.
Immigration enforcement was once a federal matter. The 287(g) partnerships between the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and state and local authorities delegate immigration enforcement powers to local agencies, enabling them to identify and remove immigrants who don’t have permanent legal documentation.
Tennessee lawmakers created the Immigration Enforcement Bureau this year at the request of Gov. Bill Lee and made it exempt from the state’s Public Records Act.
Republican lawmakers largely hail the Shelby County task force formed by Trump and Lee to cut into crime, despite stories of wrongful detainment and thousands of tickets for minor violations such as a driving with a loose bumper. 
State Rep. Kevin Vaughan, a Collierville Republican, told the Lookout that if the agreement “streamlines” the ability to remove criminals from the streets, whether they’re here legally or illegally, he favors it.
“Folks that are law-abiding folks shouldn’t have any concerns. I’m not sure why this waiver’s being requested,” he said. “If it is to deal with criminal activities within the area, then I’m fully supportive of it.”
Most Democrats and advocacy groups aren’t quite as enthused.
Memphis City Council member JB Smiley was surprised that Sheriff Floyd Bonner requested the agreement. Smiley and Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris are plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the state to stop it from deploying Tennessee National Guard troops to Memphis. A Davidson County chancellor is considering a temporary injunction to remove the troops while determining whether the governor violated state law and the Constitution by sending soldiers to Memphis without a local request or approval by the legislature at a time when no rebellion or invasion is taking place.
Smiley told the Lookout that Shelby County residents aren’t upset about agencies such as the U.S. Marshals Service, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Drug Enforcement Agency stepping up enforcement.
“But almost everyone’s going to be concerned with what ICE is doing in our communities,” Smiley said. “It’s making it problematic for people who are brown to go anywhere.”
Smiley told of an American-born man who was more than an hour late to work because ICE stopped his car, questioned him, took his license and “roughed him up a little bit.”
“The majority of people don’t want ICE here,” Smiley said.
Sentiment is similar for the National Guard, he added.
Likewise, Lisa Sherman Luna, executive director of the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition, said ICE agents are “terrorizing” Memphis residents, tearing apart families who have lived there for decades by harassing, detaining and deporting them. 
Parents are afraid to send children to school, and crime victims are remaining silent because they’re scared of running into ICE agents at the police department, according to Luna.
Shelby’s sheriff could be making the move just to get grant money.
But deputizing sheriff’s officers as immigration agents will make the “crisis” even worse, she said.
“In a time where elected leaders across the country are standing up for their communities against these invasions by the Trump administration, Sheriff Bonner instead has turned his back on Shelby County residents,” Luna said.
Bonner’s office did not respond to questions, and Harris could not be reached for comment.
Hallway arguments
Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti and plaintiffs in a lawsuit to remove National Guard troops from Memphis took their arguments outside the courtroom this week.
After an injunction hearing before Chancellor Patricia Moskal, Skrmetti spoke to reporters, continuing to claim that the governor has authority to deploy the Guard without oversight by the courts. Moskal didn’t make an immediate ruling.
“The argument is not that there’s no room for oversight. It’s that the determination of when the Guard should be brought out is statutorily left to the governor’s discretion,” Skrmetti said.
He called it a “separation of powers issue,” one that, otherwise, could keep the governor from fulfilling the role the Constitution “clearly confers him without significant court oversight.”
Shelby County Mayor, elected officials sue Gov. Bill Lee over National Guard deployment

Skrmetti contends the government needs to be in position to respond to emergencies. Yet Lee never declared an emergency, nor has anyone been able to turn up an order to deploy the Guard, only a press release after he received word from President Trump.
The attorney general also cast doubt on claims by Mayor Lee Harris that the mobilization is hurting Shelby County by overcrowding the county jail. In five weeks, the task force has arrested nearly 2,100 people, including 138 gang members, and seized 366 firearms, according to a WREG report. It’s also written up thousands of motor vehicle violations.
“The harm of arresting criminals seems like a pretty flimsy harm to base a significant lawsuit on. It seems like a pretty bad reason to upset an important constitutional balance of power,” Skrmetti said.
Yet Sheriff Bonner is moving hundreds of inmates out of the jail to facilities across the state, according to WREG.
The Constitution was rewritten in 1870, in part to stop Gov. William Brownlow from sending troops to ward off the Ku Klux Klan. 
Skrmetti said he was “shocked” to hear plaintiffs argue that Brownlow was an example of what the governor “should not do.”
“For 150 years, Gov. Brownlow has been maligned for abuses of authority. What’s important to realize is he was fighting the Ku Klux Klan. He had used the state Guard because there was a very organized, very militarized effort to disenfranchise Black voters after the Civil War,” the attorney general said.
It should be noted that Brownlow, a violently pious Methodist minister and former newspaper editor, was pro-Union yet favored slavery pre-Civil War, even arguing that it had biblical backing. He shifted views later.
Gov. Bill Lee “glossed over” the Tennessee Constitution in deploying National Guard troops to Memphis, says Memphis Councilmember JB Smiley. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
Smiley, who attended the hearing, spoke along with other plaintiffs, Memphis Reps. Gabby Salinas and G.A. Hardaway, calling Skrmetti’s remarks “intellectually dishonest and flawed logic,” especially in regard to locking up more criminals.
“What he attempted to gloss over was the fact that the Constitution was violated. The governor cannot do this without the General Assembly consenting,” Smiley said.
Neither the Memphis City Council nor Shelby County Commission were given the opportunity to vote on Guard deployment.
Hardaway said he was disappointed to hear such arguments from the state attorney general and was “particularly ticked” when he heard an insinuation that Shelby County lawmakers are not concerned about crime and that the lawsuit was a “political effort.”
“If they had fulfilled their constitutional obligations … to have us, the General Assembly, debate the issues, we wouldn’t be here,” Hardaway said.
Even so, with a Republican supermajority in control, tanks would likely be rolling into Memphis.
Who said that?
Gov. Lee’s top finance administrator urged departments to cut their budgets by 1% next fiscal year. And Senate finance chairman Bo Watson supported the move, the Tennessee Journal reported.
But Lee seemed caught off guard this week when asked about the looming reduction.
“I’m sorry, I don’t know what you’re referring to,” Lee said when a Tennessee Journal reporter asked him why department heads weren’t offering budget cuts during hearings this week.
Pressed on the matter, Lee said, “One percent budget cuts in? I’m sorry, I don’t know what you’re referring to.”
It would have been a great opportunity for Lee to say something in the vein of, “Yes, we’re always looking for ways to save money.” Instead, he played it dumb.
More dumbing it down?
House Speaker Cameron Sexton reportedly floated the idea to allow Tennesseans to start teaching after earning nothing but an associate’s degree in an effort to fill classroom vacancies. They could follow up with a bachelor’s degree and then earn a master’s to take on an administrative job. 
Governor refuses to disavow Hillsdale president’s anti-teacher remarks

Considering Gov. Lee was skewered a few years back for taking cues from Hillsdale College President Larry Arnn, who was recorded as saying teachers come from the “dumbest colleges” in the country, could this further dumb down the profession, at least in the eyes of those who hold no respect for teachers?
Some students might be prepared to teach after earning a two-year degree, but it probably won’t improve the teaching corps overall.
So, how do we solve this teacher shortage?
The answer: Pass a law keeping the legislature from trying to control education. The more they tinker with it the worse things get.

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)West Virginia is standing in the eye of a perfect storm.
Our foster care system is already breaking under caseworker shortages, heavy caseloads, and recent budget cuts. More than 6,000 children remain in state custody — a figure that would overwhelm even a healthy system.
Now, amid that fragility, the federal government shutdown has triggered delays and partial funding of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, placing food benefits for roughly 275,000 West Virginians — including an estimated 86,000 children — at risk.
SNAP pays out about $45–$47 million a month in West Virginia; if disruptions persist through January, more than $135 million in food purchasing power could vanish from our grocery aisles, small town economies, and dinner tables. Food banks simply cannot replace support at that scale.
The consequences won’t stop at hunger. Research in JAMA Network Open links stronger SNAP access to lower Child Protective Services investigations and foster care entries. If benefits remain disrupted, West Virginia could plausibly see hundreds of additional neglect investigations and dozens of new foster placements by February — not abstractions, but children’s lives disrupted and trauma compounded.
And the ripple effects will be felt everywhere. Less grocery spending depresses local revenues and can trigger layoffs. Food insecurity raises stress-related risks — from theft for basic needs to relapse and family conflict — piling onto systems already at their breaking point. This is how temporary budget decisions become permanent scars on a generation.
We are watching a human catastrophe unfold in slow motion. Each month this shutdown continues, West Virginia’s most vulnerable families are pushed closer to the edge. The state should move urgently to support food banks and seek every lawful avenue to bridge gaps, while restoring foster care funding and shoring up frontline workers. Otherwise, when the history of this crisis is written, we’ll have to admit the truth: it wasn’t a storm we couldn’t weather — it was one we refused to prepare for.

Centra Southside Community Hospital plans to discontinue its labor and delivery services mid-December as part of a consolidation of women’s health care with Centra’s Lynchburg locations. 
As numerous obstetrics or OB-GYN services closed at multiple hospitals across South Side and Southwest Virginia in recent years, hospital officials have cited low birth rates in rural areas and challenges in attracting or retaining specialists in gynecological and maternal health care. 
Those strains were listed among Centra’s reasons for the downsizing in a press release along with federal funding changes that include the reconciliation bill Congress passed this summer — a law that entails changes to Medicaid insurance and hospital funding mechanisms. 
Starting on Dec. 19, Farmville-area expectant parents will need to travel to Centra Virginia Baptist Hospital in Lynchburg — a roughly hour-long drive west. 
Longwood University professor Leah Shilling-Stouffer had already made that journey in 2019 when facing a complicated delivery of her daughter. The trek, however, was part of her birthing plan with her local doctors in Farmville as she’d had a pregnancy with higher-risks. 
“I was so prepared and planning to make the drive and able to, but babies don’t always work on anyone’s schedule,” she said. 
When she went into premature labor, she said she was fortunate her husband was able to drive her to Lynchburg and she “shutters” to think about how differently things could have gone. 
By the time they arrived, her daughter was breech — meaning she was in the wrong position to be born naturally — and had to be delivered by emergency cesarean section. The baby also spent time in the facility’s Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. 
Shilling-Stouffer said she worries about other parents who might experience sudden labor or for whom the travel is a burden on time or finances. She noted her own pregnancy required frequent visits to her specialist. She said not all of her neighbors have the time or money or reliable transportation to make the trip. 
“It feels so wrong, like we are just leaving people in the dust,” she said. 
Katie Page, a certified nurse-midwife who works with Centra, said maternal health challenges are ones “that we know won’t go away” as more and more patients find themselves 30 minutes to an hour or more from the nearest hospitals or birthing centers. 
Centra’s Farmville obstetrics unit has long filled a critical gap in the South Side for reproductive health care. Page laments how the community will now find itself in a “growing desert.”
Still, she points to a sweeping package of bills dubbed the “Virginia Momnibus” that lawmakers passed this year. The laws support maternal health care workers through provisions like allowing midwives to be on 24/7 on-call duty rosters or special Medicaid enrollment periods for pregnant people to ensure they are covered earlier in their pregnancies. 
It will take state lawmakers’ efforts again to address how less federal funding will continue to affect access to reproductive health care before, during and after pregnancy, she said. 
In the meantime, Centra has softened the blow by continuing its partnership with Central Virginia Health Services, a federally-qualified health center (FQHC) in Farmville, though with thousands of Virginians standing to potentially lose Medicaid coverage, it remains to be seen the full scope of impact that could have on FQHCs. 
And Centra stated in its press release that there are protocols in place to transfer patients in labor that might need more specialized care. 
In addition, hospital emergency rooms are typically prepared to handle births. For instance the ER staff at Southwest Virginia’s Lee County Community Hospital receive training for just such situations, its administrator told The Mercury earlier this summer. 
Shilling-Stouffer is thinking ahead about what the changes might mean for her local community. A longtime professor at Longwood, one of the town’s main employers, she serves on a committee that works to recruit instructors. 
“We want to have people that don’t just come here for a year or two, but people that really want to plant their roots and start families,” she said. “We sell Longwood as a family-centric university for staff, but it might be a hard conversation with candidates if they have concerns or questions about hospitals.”
Shilling-Stouffer believes Centra administration’s assertion that ending obstetrics was a “difficult decision,” but said she hopes that advocacy from health care professionals and families statewide will encourage lawmakers to address ways to prevent more hospitals from making such calls. 
As governor-elect, Abigail Spanberger met with Gov. Glenn Youngkin this week to discuss the transitions of their administrations, she reiterated her intention to address health care issues at the state level where possible. 
“We owe it (to patients) to fight back against this and to see if there’s anything that can be done,” Shilling-Stouffer said.

Not this year.
“In the past we’ve been saying, ‘Health care is more affordable than ever before, so take a look and check it out,” Lindsay Lang, HealthSource RI’s director, said in an interview Thursday. “Now we’re really sticking to a message of, ‘We want to make sure you have coverage.’” 


Where to learn more
Open enrollment continues through Jan. 31. More information, including plan comparisons and sign-ups, is available at healthsourceri.com


That’s because the low or no-cost premiums available to many of the 48,000 people covered through the state insurance marketplace are set to expire at the end of the year, barring action by Congress. Without the pandemic-era federal tax credits, HealthSource RI participants are expected to see their monthly premiums double, on average, from $109 to $220 a month, according to an Oct. 30 analysis by the Rhode Island Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS). 
Democratic officials frame the looming premium spikes in dire terms, warning of the tough choices that low and middle-income families will face. Lang acknowledges the challenge, too. But, unlike political leaders, Lang needs to make sure marketplace enrollees know what’s coming, and why maintaining health insurance still matters. 
“There’s a fair amount of this we cannot control,” Lang said. “What we can do is show up and be available and provide good reliable information to support as clear decision making as can be done in this environment.”
Showing up
Lang and other state health care administrators have spent months preparing. They changed the ad campaigns blanketing airwaves, billboards and screens, staffed up the East Providence call center with extra workers, and held virtual and community events.
Six days in, calls are “a tick higher,” than in previous years. But it’s too early to put much stock in initial call volumes, Lang said.
Enrollment numbers don’t provide much insight yet either: All existing enrollees were already automatically renewed for their same plan next year unless they already signaled they wanted to make a change. The real marker will come Dec. 23, when the 44,000 auto-renewed participants have to make their first payment to stay on marketplace insurance next year.










In the past we’ve been saying, ‘Health care is more affordable than ever before, so take a look and check it out. Now we’re really sticking to a message of, ‘We want to make sure you have coverage.’


– Lindsay Lang, HealthSource RI’s director


HealthSource RI estimates 13,000 current enrollees will drop coverage when federal tax credits expire at the end of the year. It’s a fate Lang and her team are trying their best to minimize by focusing on the more limited federal tax credits that will still be available even after the year ends. 
A 40-year-old Rhode Island adult who earns $30,000 per year, for example, can still get $351 in monthly tax credits, reducing their annual premium for a “silver” — or second-tier  — insurance plan to $158 per month, according to HealthSource RI.
Younger and middle-income enrollees will see the highest monthly premium increases, up to $333 more on average for an adult who earns more than $62,600, based on 2025 federal poverty guidelines. 
Rather than opting to forgo insurance entirely, Lang hoped to convince people to keep a less expensive, and less expansive, marketplace plan.
“We’re still offering a high-quality product,” Lang said. “We understand how stressful this is, but we’re resolved to be here no matter what.”
As of October 2024, Rhode Island boasted the sixth-highest insured rate of any state in the country, with nearly 98% of residents covered. Returning to pre-Affordable Care Act days, when more than 11% of the state population lacked any form of health insurance, could have dire consequences well beyond state bragging rights.
“You can’t have a healthy thriving economy at the state level without a steady and reliable health care system, and our health care system is already under enormous pressure,” Lang said. 
More uninsured people will drive up demand for costly emergency room services and simultaneously reduce federal funding to the tune of $70 million a year — dollars ordinarily funneled back to health care providers and hospitals, according to EOHHS’ report.
Younger and healthier people are most likely to drop coverage, leaving a pool of older, sicker and more medically expensive enrollees for commercial health insurers to cover. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island and Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island, the two insurers that cover marketplace enrollees, sought record high premium increases partly because of the costs associated with covering a riskier pool of plan participants. 
Rhode Island Health Insurance Commissioner Cory King, whose office is charged with reviewing and approving annual commercial insurance rates, shaved $59 million off what insurers wanted. But the approved 2026 premiums for marketplace enrollees are still 20-22% higher than 2025 — even before waning federal subsidies. 
While public sentiment may be less sympathetic toward health insurers, company  financials impact what they can pay health care providers. Rhode Island’s lower reimbursement rates compared with neighboring states are widely blamed for the shortage of primary care providers, along with other medical specialties.

Can Congress step in?
Democratic state and federal elected officials continue to apply pressure in D.C. in the hopes of convincing the Republican-led Congress to extend the federal discounts for marketplace insurance.
Gov. Dan McKee called on President Donald Trump to “get his party to the table” in a statement Monday, while U.S. Sen. Jack Reed called the president’s health care policy “a cruel joke” in a separate statement the same day.
“As open enrollment begins, many Rhode Islanders are being forced to make impossible choices: between affording health care next year and necessities like food and housing,” U.S. Rep. Gabe Amo said in an Oct. 31 statement. “It’s time for Trump and Republicans to demonstrate they care by moving quickly to negotiate with Democrats to reopen the government and lower health care costs.”
If Congress extends the federal tax credits, it will cause short-term administrative burdens for Lang’s 16-person team to recalculate monthly premium costs and let people know about the discounted rates. 
But, “it would be a great problem to have,” Lang said.
She continued, “This is a challenging year in that we feel the pain on behalf of our customers in a really visceral way.”

Jared Polis speaks to education officials from across Colorado during a roundtable at West High School in Denver in July. (Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)As a child, I have memories of driving down Milwaukee’s streets in my mom’s white Dodge Shadow and listening to the best 90s music on our way to school. Every few years, the route would change along with my school, teachers and friends, because my mother was determined to find the perfect school for her only daughter.
For her, perfection meant a place that challenged me academically, where teachers saw me as more than just a test score. She wanted a school that would put me on the path to college while letting me explore my changing dreams for the future. Some of my schools had a few of the qualities she was looking for, but no one school quite measured up.
Those years in Milwaukee taught me what it feels like to chase quality education within a system that never quite delivers on its promise. My mother’s determination planted in me a lifelong belief that every child deserves access to an excellent education without their parents having to soul search whether the school they found is worth the long commute, complex enrollment processes, and competition with other families.

As the executive director of Teach Plus Colorado, I’m lucky to work with outstanding educators to ensure every child has access to high-quality schools, no matter where they live. Our teachers have advocated for policies that expand these opportunities for students, including a new school finance formula, universal preschool, and robust postsecondary workforce readiness programs. Beyond legislation, they serve on state committees, present at conferences, and publish research that informs policy — all to expand their students’ opportunities.
But even the best ideas can wither and die for lack of funding.
Now, as Gov. Jared Polis unveils his next state budget, his commitment to fully fund education, including kindergarten, carries real weight. After years of hard work to eliminate the budget stabilization factor and to create a new school finance formula, Colorado’s students finally have a chance to experience an education system with consistent investment. We can’t afford to turn back.
Yes, the state faces tough choices in the months ahead. With economic uncertainty at the state and federal levels, every dollar in the budget will be scrutinized. But the measure of leadership isn’t just how we manage in times of plenty; it’s how we protect our values when resources are scarce. Education is one of those values.
That’s why Colorado must invest in policies that expand access to opportunity for students and support the educators who make learning possible. This means ensuring that every student can participate in college and career pathways, such as in-demand industry credentials, college credit, and work-based learning, so they graduate with real options for the future. It means closing foundational literacy and math gaps with the interventions, supports and innovations students need to succeed. And it means building and sustaining a high-quality educator workforce by investing in preparation, professional growth, and the working conditions that allow excellent teachers to thrive and stay in the classroom.
When I think about what’s possible for Colorado’s kids, I picture my mom behind the wheel of that Dodge Shadow, doing everything she could to find the right school for me. Thirty years later, families shouldn’t have to work that hard — especially after all the progress we’ve made.
Colorado’s children need classrooms with teachers who stay, programs that support their growth, and schools that reflect the promise of opportunity this state was built on. Polis and the state Legislature have shown that they believe in that promise. Now is the time to prove it again by standing firm, not wavering, on the commitment to education funding, even in uncertain times.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Fresh off a decisive election night, Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger is promising a sharp turn in Virginia’s energy policy, vowing to boost in-state power generation, lower costs, and force data centers to “pay their fair share.”
“We’re going to produce more energy and we’re going to lower energy costs. We are going to produce more energy here in Virginia and make sure that data centers pay their fair share,” Spanberger told a cheering crowd during her victory speech.
With Democrats securing a government trifecta — and picking up 13 seats in the House of Delegates to solidify their majority — energy policy is expected to shift away from the approach taken under Gov. Glenn Youngkin. 
The Republican governor was a frequent critic of the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) and vetoed multiple bills meant to expand renewable energy development. The political changeover also signals the possibility of tighter oversight of data center permitting and energy demand, an issue that has risen alongside soaring utility bills. 
“We’ve made some minimal progress over the course of the last four years. But with the change of administration, yes, I am hoping that we make more progress and faster progress,” Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, said.
The state’s major utilities, Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power Company, are currently bound by VCEA requirements to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. During the 2025 regular legislative session, Youngkin vetoed legislation that would have increased requirements for  utility investment in solar- powered battery storage — technology that allows excess solar energy to be stored and deployed later. It is a developing technology that is slowly becoming more available. In his veto message, Youngkin argued that the bill would be too costly for ratepayers.
Utility-scale solar projects continue to run into resistance at the local level, particularly in rural areas where opponents cite land use and siting concerns. While solar is viewed as the fastest-to-deploy renewable energy source, many conservatives and utility officials argue that solar and wind cannot meet statewide demand on their own — and warn large solar farms could consume valuable agricultural land.
“The movement for utility-scale solar is all coming from our urban and suburban areas, and the burden is being imposed on our rural areas,” said Sen. Mark Obenshain, R-Harrisonburg. “Last year a fairly prescriptive bill was on its way out of the commission that would have removed a lot of power from local governments, (but) the Speaker spoke up and said, ‘Not on my watch.’ I hope that commitment continues.”
Spanberger has pledged to rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), the multi-state carbon credit program Youngkin withdrew from, calling it an unnecessary tax. Before the withdrawal, Dominion customers paid a little over $2 per bill for RGGI costs — money that flowed back to the state for energy efficiency programs and flood resiliency projects.
“I think the governor has to lead these conversations and bring resiliency efforts into everything that the state might prioritize. Road investments, bridge investments, new structures coming to Virginia, businesses that we are attracting, agriculture space efforts to make sure that we’re doing everything possible,” Spanberger said in an August interview with The Mercury.
Clean Virginia, a nonprofit and political action committee focused on utility regulation, noted that 57 members of the House of Delegates refused campaign contributions from the state’s largest utilities this election cycle. Executive Director Brennan Gilmore said the shift will play a major factor in future regulation.
“We have got to remove that block from the utilities and start harnessing every type of energy, clean energy technology that’s out there, and that includes strengthening our energy efficiency outlay as well,” Gilmore said.
Spanberger’s call for data centers to “pay their fair share” remains light of specifics, but Dominion’s pending rate case would create a separate class for data centers and other highload users. 
Under the proposal, those companies would be locked into 14-year contracts and face demand charges of 85% for transmission, 85% for distribution, and 60% for generation. The State Corporation Commission has not yet ruled.
“Data centers are an important part of Virginia and its future moving forward, but at the same time we need to be smart about growth,” said Nate Benforado, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center. “We need to make sure communities are on board and that we can power this industry in a way that’s good for Virginians.”
Some lawmakers and advocacy groups want data center companies — not ratepayers — to shoulder more of the cost of the new transmission lines and power infrastructure needed to run them. 
During last month’s gubernatorial debate, Spanberger echoed Youngkin’s “all of the above” energy messaging, highlighting nuclear power as a long-term option. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are touted by some as a carbon-free, more reliable alternative to solar and wind, but none are currently operating in the U.S.
“The problem with nuclear power is that even Dominion … have pushed a timeline back for that and the timeline has been pushed back repeatedly in the past decade. They’re now looking at 2035 before even a model SMR could be put on the grid,” Gilmore said.
Utilities maintain that without nuclear or continued fossil fuel use, a reliable grid isn’t possible under current technology. 
Previous legislation to create a state review board to help localities evaluate energy project proposals failed to pass, though supporters expect a revised version to return.
Across party lines legislators agree the state must confront rising energy demand and growing utility costs — and that voters made affordability impossible to ignore.
“If there is anything the election told us, affordability is front and center,” Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, said during a recent Commission on Electric Utility Regulation meeting.

(Photo by Larry Levine/WMATA)As inflation drives up the cost of running buses and trains, a panel of Virginia lawmakers has finalized a list of recommendations to help shore up public transit in fast-growing jurisdictions north of Richmond. The move is part of a broader push to address mounting funding pressures on Metro, Virginia Railway Express (VRE) and bus agencies serving Northern Virginia and the Fredericksburg areas. 
One key recommendation — reforming Virginia’s legislated 3% operating assistance growth cap, which limits how much the state can pay Metro — comes with caveats tied to potential tax increases that could affect overall transit funding.
The committee’s action comes as Virginia faces uncertainty in covering rising transportation costs, driven by inflation, as well as other expenses related to healthcare, early childhood care and food assistance programs due to changes made by President Donald Trump’s administration.
Meeting Wednesday in Arlington, lawmakers on the Northern Virginia Growing Needs of Public Transit Joint Subcommittee endorsed a resolution urging the General Assembly to consider “net new” revenue sources, avoid reductions to current transportation funding to or use of existing transportation funding, and minimize impacts on low-income Virginians. 
Ideas on the table include a retail delivery fee, a sales tax on transportation network companies and an expanded sales and use tax that would exempt food and personal hygiene products.
“It’s hard to predict exactly how the General Assembly session will go, but we have a lot to work with, and I think we’ve established a good set of principles and needs,” said Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, who chairs the subcommittee.

The General Assembly created the panel last year to study long-term funding solutions for public transit agencies including Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), or Metro, and VRE, which serve most Northern Virginia jurisdictions as well as the Potomac and Rappahannock region — Prince William, Spotsylvania, Stafford, Fredericksburg, Manassas and Manassas Park.
Among the recommendations is a plan to cover a projected $400 million annual need beginning in fiscal year 2028 for WMATA, VRE and the bus systems within the Northern Virginia Transportation Commission (NVTC) and Potomac and Rappahannock Transportation Commission (PRTC) transportation districts. 
WMATA’s share includes $153 million in operating costs and $136-$150 million in capital funding, while VRE and NVTC bus systems require $35 million each, and OmniRide needs roughly $22 million.
The list also calls for regional surcharges on the highway use fee and mileage-based user fee, and for the creation of new regional transit funds at both NVTC and PRTC using new or additional revenue streams. Another provision directs the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation (DRPT) to report all revenues and interest earned in the WMATA Capital Fund.
Lawmakers also recommend further study of cost efficiency of bus and rail systems, including Metrobus versus local bus operations, accountability metrics for VRE, expansion of Interstate 66 Inside the Beltway tolling and the feasibility of bidirectional commuter rail between Northern Virginia and Maryland.
The resolution notes the subcommittee’s support for WMATA accountability and transparency measures adopted by the DMVMoves task force.
On Oct. 29, that task force approved a separate package including $460 million in new capital funding for Metro starting in fiscal 2028, to be shared by Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Virginia. The money is intended to stabilize service, support long-term investments and give all three jurisdictions greater budget certainty.
Leaders from the Washington Metropolitan Council of Governments and WMATA Board of Directors will meet Nov. 17 to review the proposal before pursuing enabling legislation in all three legislatures.
DMVMoves Task Force Co-Chair and Metro Board Vice Chair Paul Smedberg, who represents Virginia on the board, said in a statement last week that “reaching consensus on a unified transit vision is a major achievement for our region and reflects the countless hours of discussion and deliberation by area leaders.” 
“Now the more challenging work begins as we build momentum to turn these recommendations into action and deliver the seamless, integrated, world-class transit experience our region needs and deserves,” Smedberg added.
Tiffany Robinson, VRPT director, acknowledged that Metro is an “important asset” but opposed a tax increase of $300 million annually. She voted against the committee’s resolution in the absence of Transportation Secretary Shep Miller and said that she is concerned about whether Maryland and D.C. can fund their shares despite their commitments. 
“We all acknowledge that WMATA is a very important asset for the commonwealth, and I appreciate the work of the committee,” Robinson said. “What we don’t agree on is increasing taxes — up to $300 million annually from hardworking Virginia taxpayers.”

Robinson also noted that the resolution includes an additional $100 million a year for other Northern Virginia transit needs, bringing the total increase to roughly $400 million annually.
“In fiscal year 2026 alone, Virginia taxpayers will send nearly $800 million to WMATA — and this resolution proposes adding hundreds of millions of dollars to that amount,” she said. “A more practical approach is to focus first on additional savings by looking at items like service levels, overhead, and fares. Over the last five years, the WMATA budget has grown much faster than the incomes of the Virginia taxpayers who fund it — 67% faster — which is unsustainable.”

However, in response, Ebbin emphasized that WMATA has identified over $532 million in cost savings and balanced service levels effectively to support growing rider demand, now passing 54 months of the year over the year growth. He also said after a fare increase of 12.5% last year, the transit agency anticipates another rise in fiscal year 2028 in line with inflation, while revenues were $75 million higher than expected due to strong ridership.
Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, asked whether the recommendations could be phased in, given the state’s fiscal constraints. Andrew D’huyvetter, NVTC’s director of programs and policy, said lawmakers now have a framework, but implementation is up to the General Assembly. 
If lawmakers decline to act, local jurisdictions could face a “difficult set of choices” to meet their $153 million WMATA obligation, and regional transit agencies would also confront major shortfalls.
“I think there certainly could be opportunities to find other ways to meet that need with general fund support,” D’huyvetter said. “But again, we just want to put together this package to recognize what a … longer term solution could look like, and how we build that ramp to get there, recognizing that immediate operating need in fiscal (year) 2027.”
Virginia lawmakers return to Richmond on Jan. 14 for the start of the General Assembly.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Lance Watson, senior pastor of a large Baptist congregation in Richmond, must have spoken for hundreds of thousands of Virginians Sunday when he mentioned the prospects of Jay Jones, then the Democratic attorney general candidate, in this week’s election.
Jones, a former Virginia delegate, faced an October surprise when violent texts he wrote in 2022 surfaced. Those texts were aimed at the then-Republican state speaker of the House of Delegates and his children.
(Full disclosure: I’ve known Jay Jones since he was a pre-teen, because our families attend the same church in Norfolk.)
“What’s good for the goose is good for the gander,” Watson said, two days before Jones easily defeated Jason Miyares, the Republican incumbent attorney general, in a race that had tightened because of the scandal. “Anytime I have to live with a president who has 32 felony convictions, I can forgive somebody who made a mistake on his text messages.”
Watson, of course, was referring to President Donald Trump, who actually was convicted of 34 felony counts of falsified business records in New York last year. Trump also fomented the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol after his 2020 electoral defeat – which should have disqualified him from ever holding elective office again.
That’s the backdrop voters in Virginia weighed when they cast ballots this year:
Should we reject someone who fantasized violence, even though his policies might be preferable over his opponent’s? Does character matter more than the good that Jones could do in office, especially as a check on a president who scoffs at the law and whose economic policies are wreaking havoc on families?
And if the highest office in the land is held by someone who incited a riot on Jan. 6, 2021, where several people died and others were injured, haven’t the standards for electability changed?
Voters calculated those factors when putting Jones over the top Tuesday, 52.73% to 46.87%, longtime Virginia political analyst Bob Holsworth told me.
“There was a sense among a lot of Democrats, given what Trump has done and said, that this is no big deal,” said Holsworth, a managing partner at a public policy research firm and a former dean at Virginia Commonwealth University. Jones sent the texts privately to Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield, who lost her re-election bid this week.
“It’s nothing like what the president does and says every day and puts into action,” Holsworth added.
There were other factors that helped Jones and Democrats around Virginia:
Gubernatorial winner Abigail Spanberger trounced her Republican opponent, Winsome Earle-Sears, by more than 14 points. She had long coattails for the Democratic ticket, Holsworth noted, which also saw Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, win the lieutenant governor’s race.
Abortion rights and kitchen-table economics spurred Democrats to surge to at least 64 seats in the House of Delegates, up from 51 of the 100 seats right now. Turnout was up sharply in several suburban swing areas.
Republican demonization of transgender students and athletes, especially by Earle-Sears, held little sway with voters. Good. She had no business targeting a small segment of the population for her political gain.
Miyares didn’t always join other state’s attorneys general to oppose the Trump administration, even when Virginians were in the crosshairs. Examples included when more than two dozen states sued over the administration’s refusal to fund food stamps during the ongoing government shutdown. The states said the impending cuts were unnecessary and illegal.
More than 866,000 Virginians received food stamps earlier this year. Two federal judges recently ruled the administration had to keep the food program running.
Those were some of the reasons people like Latangie Clay, 51, voted for Jones on Tuesday.
“Sometimes people do make bad decisions,” she told me outside her polling place in Chesapeake. But Clay, who usually supports Democrats, said she researched Jones and his platform and decided he was the better choice.
Besides, I’m sure many Virginians feel Democrats are held to higher standards of conduct while Republicans like Trump can do or say anything they want, without penalty. (See: Misogynistic Access Hollywood comments that were released before the 2016 election.)
I’m also thinking of the calls in 2019 for then-Gov. Ralph Northam to resign for a blackface photo in his 1984 medical school yearbook. As I wrote previously: Why was resignation proportionate to his reputed offense?
“Had Northam done nothing showing his commitment to blacks and the disadvantaged in the years since he entered elective office?” I said.
Holsworth told me it’s clear what’s acceptable in politics today has shifted a long way over the past few decades. He mentioned the 1985 “scandal” that harmed Republican Buster O’Brien in his longshot bid to become attorney general.
His campaign suggested O’Brien, a quarterback, played for the Washington Redskins, when in fact he practiced with the team only a few weeks. Oh, the horror!
This bit of resume boosting didn’t help O’Brien in his battle against eventual winner Mary Sue Terry, a Democrat. Nowadays, that 40-year-old episode seems … quaint.
The bottom line is this: The age of Trump has lowered the standards for would-be officeholders. Voters will choose their interests, even when a candidate has flaws.
And some flaws are worse than others.

(Matthew Hatcher/Getty Images)Ohio Senators voted Wednesday to require absentee ballots arrive at county election boards by Election Day to be counted. The change represents yet another shortening of the return timeline with each successive federal election.
In 2024, ballots postmarked the day before the election had four days to show up. In 2022, properly postmarked ballots had 10 days to arrive.
Thirty four other states require voters to return absentee ballots by Election Day, but the push to pass Ohio Senate Bill 293 comes thanks, in part, to threats from the Trump administration.
In a March executive order, the president reinterpreted federal statutes setting the date of elections to declare any ballots received after Election Day are invalid.
Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose told state senators the U.S. Department of Justice had already warned his office about a potential lawsuit.
Notably, a federal judge rejected a related assertion of federal authority over elections just last week.
Ruling on the same executive order, U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly determined the Trump administration doesn’t have the authority to require voters show proof of citizenship.
Looking back to the framers, she wrote, “The states have initial authority to regulate elections. Congress has supervisory authority over those regulations. The president does not feature at all.”

Speaking after the committee hearing, state Sen. Kristina Roegner, R-Hudson, acknowledged federal pressure was a factor, but insisted lawmakers advanced the bill because “it’s the right thing to do.”
She also brushed off complaints about shifting timelines.
“Voters are smart, and they catch on to those changes,” she said.
“They’ll find their new polling locations as those change, and as the dates change, they’ll adapt as well.”
Committee pushback
League of Women Voters of Ohio Executive Director Jen Miller said reducing the timeline for returning ballots won’t improve election security.
“It simply erects more barriers to voting and punishes hard working Ohio tax paying citizens for something out of control, the speed of the mail service.”
Absentee ballots are often the most accessible choice for voters with disabilities, seniors, and active-duty military, Miller said. They also offer flexibility for Ohioans who work during regular business hours, she added.
But federal cost-cutting has slowed postal delivery.
In several parts of Ohio, Miller said, mail leaves the state for processing before getting delivered.
“We have, over and over again every election, ballots that were sometimes put in the mail two or three weeks before Election Day that just didn’t get there until the day after,” she said. “Those should count.”
And nothing is lost, she said, by allowing time for ballots to arrive; county boards process provisional ballots for four days following the election.
Collin Marozzi from the ACLU of Ohio criticized lawmakers for acquiescing to the Trump administration’s threats.
“It cannot be overstated how inappropriate it is for a federal officeholder with no constitutional authority to regulate elections, to threaten states with the Department of Justice,” Marozzi said.
“At best,” he added, “it’s an insult to federalism, and political coercion at worst.”

Senate floor debate
One of the bill’s sponsors, state Sen. Theresa Gavarone, R-Bowling Green, offered a different explanation.
Last year, she said, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit sided with Republicans challenging a Mississippi law that allowed ballots to be returned up to five days after Election Day.
The judges determined federal statute sets the day “by which ballots must be both cast by voters and received by state officials.”
Gavarone stressed voters still have a month of early voting in person or through the mail.
“This bill does not change early voting,” she said. “Ohioans have the right to vote. We want all valid votes to count, and the process needs to be done on Election Day.”
Her co-sponsor, state Sen. Andrew Brenner, R-Delaware, recited all 34 states that require absentee ballots arrive by Election Day.
“So, before we hear that this is, again, taking away rights of people — it isn’t,” Brenner insisted.
State Sen. Bill DeMora debating on the Ohio Senate floor. (Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)
State Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, said relying on an increasingly unreliable postal system is unfair to voters.
He described how one of his staffers requested an absentee ballot more than two weeks ago for Tuesday’s election.
It still hasn’t shown up, and she wound up unable to vote.
In the most recent election, he added, almost 10,000 ballots showed up in the four days following Election Day.
“Ten thousand eligible voters who followed every rule, who cast their ballots on time, who did everything the law asked of them, would have had their voices stolen because, the post office,” DeMora said.
He also rejected Republicans’ reliance on the Fifth Circuit — “the most whackadoodle circuit on the federal bench” — to justify the change.
“The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has no jurisdiction over the state of Ohio,” DeMora said. “None whatsoever.”
The measure passed, with all but one Republican voting in favor of the change.
Speaking after the vote Senate President Rob McColley downplayed the potential for voter confusion as the deadline for returning ballots changes again.
“I think most voters, if you ask them right now, and we had 100 people in here and said, raise your hand if you think your ballot needs to be in by Election Day, I would imagine the vast majority of them would raise their hands,” he said.
Minority Leader Nickie Antonio actually agreed with his assessment, but added, “The thing is, we’re having to trust the U.S. Post Office, which has been attacked in terms of a lack of funding, a lack of personnel, complicating how they do business.”

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)Earlier this year, New Hampshire lawmakers installed a new process to oversee struggling charter schools. The law, House Bill 752, allows the State Board of Education to put a charter school facing major problems on probation, and allows the board to revoke the school’s charter if those problems are not subsequently fixed. 
Today, as the Claremont School District continues to face a deep-set budget crisis caused by a $5 million fiscal hole, some Republicans are proposing to extend those powers to public schools.
Rep. Glenn Cordell, a Tuftonboro Republican, has introduced a last-minute amendment to an existing bill that would increase the state’s oversight of public schools facing a financial crisis — and allow for top-down control of individual districts by state-appointed administrators.
On Wednesday, the House Education Policy and Administration Committee endorsed the bill, 10-7, with all Democrats opposed.
The legislation would create a model similar to receivership. Under the bill, if the State Board of Education determined the school district met one of seven criteria, it could put the district into a probationary period of up to six months. 
Among the possible triggers are if the school fails “generally accepted standards” for fiscal management; if it violates state or federal law; if the school materially violates a state administrative rule or standard; if the school does not file an annual report of its finances; if the school does not follow other state or federal reporting requirements; and if the school “fails to remedy” the causes of its probation.
After being placed on probation, the district’s school board would be required to devise a plan with the state board for addressing the problem, the bill states. If that plan is unsuccessful after the probationary period, the Department of Education and State Board of Education must hire an administrator to run the district for up to one year.
That administrator is empowered to override any school board decisions; fire the superintendent and business manager; cancel and negotiate contracts; appoint people to carry out superintendent and business management duties; direct audits; authorize the transfer of students out of the district; and reorganize the district’s finances. 
The bill also includes tighter requirements for audits. Currently, the Department of Revenue Administration requires districts to initiate audits within 12 months of the end of each state fiscal year in June. 
Cordelli’s bill would reduce that initiation deadline to four months after the end of the fiscal year. It would give the DRA the power to compel additional school district audits “whenever conditions appear to warrant” it, rather than the current limit of once every two years. And it would allow the department to levy a fine of up to $500 a day on an uncooperative school district, up from the current allowed $250 limit.
Pressure to audit
To Cordelli, the financial crisis facing Claremont warrants much stricter state oversight of schools across the state. 
That crisis kicked off in August, when an audit delivered to the school board revealed that district officials had failed to secure federal grant reimbursements — costing the district millions of dollars of expected revenue — and had overreported the amount in its surpluses. That latter error caused the DRA, which uses a district’s surplus to adjust the local education property tax rate, to set taxes that were too low, exacerbating the shortfall. 
The shortfall nearly prevented the school district from opening this school year, but a loan from Claremont Savings Bank will keep the school running through April. Lawyers for the school are pressing lawmakers to create a revolving loan fund to give upfront funding to the district that it would pay back with interest, but movement on the proposal is not expected until January. 
“Claremont was, or is, a case study of failure,” Cordelli said, introducing his bill. “It’s a failure of auditing, a failure of communication, a failure of accountability, and a failure of transparency.”
Democrats have been wary of the proposed law, arguing it gives the state too much power over school districts and that it could be abused. 
“We think audits are important and they need to happen, but we don’t think that this bill is the one that would do it,” said Rep. Patricia Cornell, a Manchester Democrat.
But the idea is popular among conservatives, who have pointed to Claremont as evidence of the need for accountability for public school administrators. Republicans in the Senate, including Manchester Sen. Victoria Sullivan, have proposed school district receivership bills of their own for the 2026 session, citing the Claremont decision. 
Cordelli’s amendment has the potential to move quickly. It was tacked onto House Bill 121, an unrelated bill setting up local school district parent advisory councils for special education services. Because the House Education Policy and Administration Committee retained HB 121 over the summer, it will return to the House floor on Jan. 8 and could pass the Senate weeks later.
The bill comes as more school districts have been falling behind in their auditing in recent years, according to the Department of Revenue Administration.
In state fiscal year 2022, which covers the 2021-2022 school year, 5% of school districts were non-compliant with their auditing, according to Jennifer Ramsey, the tax policy counsel at the New Hampshire Department of Revenue Administration. 
That portion jumped to 35% in fiscal year 2024, Ramsey said. But she said she expects the noncompliance to drop this year “in light of the sunshine that has been spread on this issue.” The DRA has never fined a district for noncompliance, despite having the power to do so since 2022, she said.
Although they are sent to the DRA, the school district audits do not affect the local tax rate set by the department for each district. 
That’s because the tax rate is determined by the department in late fall of each year — ahead of districts’ budget process over the winter — but the audits are not due to the DRA for a year. The data within the audits are thus out of date for the purpose of tax setting. 
Another case of local control
Cordelli’s bill has ignited a familiar, and growing, partisan debate over school district autonomy and local control. Public school advocates have called the bill an overcorrection. 
The New Hampshire School Boards Association said that it welcomes transparent audits. But Executive Director Barrett Christina said he’s concerned about the accelerated timeline given the scarcity of auditing firms available in the state.
Christina also said the probationary approach used in the charter school bill should not be applied to public school districts. Charter schools are authorized by the State Board of Education and fall under closer scrutiny, so a probationary period makes more sense for them, he said.  
“We’re not comparing the same thing,” Christina said, addressing the committee. 
Christina said the bill should include greater minimum qualifications for the state-appointed administrator, like a “certified superintendent.”
And he argued the triggering language to set off the district probationary period is overly broad — and could be read to apply to situations that have nothing to do with finances. Under the bill, that determination could be made by the State Board of Education “on a whim,” he said. 
“Failure by a principal to routinely, properly investigate bullying in a school district could lead to some sort of receivership,” he said. 
The National Education Association of New Hampshire — the state’s largest teachers union — is also opposed to the current bill. 
The NEA does not oppose strengthening audit requirements, said Brian Hawkins, the NEA-NH director of government relations. But the auditing and probation process set out in the amendment is complex, and should be given a full legislative process, he argued.
Hawkins said the current bill is “too broad,” particularly when it comes to the management powers given to the administrator. Those powers extend beyond the administrator’s ability to correct a school district’s finances, he said. 
The concern, Hawkins said, is that the state board-appointed administrator could gain more powers over the school district than a locally approved superintendent might have wielded. 
“If the goal is around correcting fiscal issues, we should make it narrow to the extent necessary to correct those deficiencies,” he said. “And that really ought to be the role that the state plays in assuming this kind of proposed authority.”
And Hawkins added that if an administrator canceled staff contracts, it would be “reasonably likely” that terminated employees could file lawsuits.
But Republicans said the additional oversight was necessary in extreme cases, and noted that the proposed bill would give school districts and school boards plenty of time to address their fiscal problems on their own. 
“I think that Claremont has taught us that maybe it should not just be charter schools that can be placed on probation, but traditional public schools as well,” Cordelli said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/PB054936-Damon-Cordelli-1024x709.jpg,,,2025-11-07 05:17:45.887389

Photo by Arden BarnesA number of advocacy groups are urging Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear to halt utility disconnections in the state during the federal government shutdown. 
Kentuckians for Energy Democracy is organizing the call to action and lists more than 40 organizations as supporting a utility disconnection moratorium including the ACLU of Kentucky, Kentucky Voices for Health, the Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center, the Kentucky Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics and other local and statewide organizations. 
Cara Cooper, the coordinator for Kentuckians for Energy Democracy, told the Lantern that Beshear could issue an executive order similar to one he issued during the beginning months of the COVID-19 pandemic that prevented utilities from disconnecting service for nonpayment. 
Cooper said low-income Kentuckians could especially be squeezed by having only partial federal food assistance this month through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. 
She said the groups are asking that any utility disconnection moratorium be extended through the end of the shutdown and until Kentuckians have access to more federal funds to help with energy costs and utility bills through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program or LIHEAP. 
“We’re worried that there’s going to be even greater need this year, and there’s never enough LIHEAP money to go around,” Cooper said. “We want to help to protect Kentuckians and make sure that nobody’s having to choose between groceries, medicine or paying their utility bill this winter.” 
Energy assistance funding in flux
About six million people across the country use LIHEAP funding to help pay heating or cooling bills, buy heating fuel, prevent emergency situations such as utility disconnections and help weatherize homes to be more energy efficient. In Kentucky, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services receives LIHEAP funding, and community action agencies throughout the state distribute it.
The government shutdown has prevented the annual allocation of federal funding to states, causing some state governments to delay distributing LIHEAP funds. But that hasn’t been the case yet in Kentucky.
“Kentucky’s LIHEAP operates from the previous year’s federal allocation and has not been affected thus far by the federal government shutdown,” said Kendra Steele, a spokesperson for the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services. 
Rick Baker, the executive director of the nonprofit Community Action Kentucky, told state lawmakers in July that LIHEAP funds can sometimes run out but that money from previous federal laws, such as the CARES Act, has kept funding sufficient. 
Baker told lawmakers more than $43 million in LIHEAP funding had been distributed through the current fiscal year. About $24 million of that went to 68,059 households in Kentucky for “crisis benefits” to prevent utility disconnections, with recipients receiving an average of $345.07 each. Community action agencies are accepting applications through December for a one-time, non-emergency LIHEAP payment to go toward heating costs on a first-come, first serve basis.  
The National Energy Assistance Directors Association, representing directors of state LIHEAP programs, called on utilities last month to suspend utility nonpayment disconnections during the government shutdown, especially as the need for LIHEAP and electricity costs rise. 
When asked about the possibility of a utility disconnection moratorium during a Wednesday press conference,  Beshear said he was “always willing to consider things that could help the people of Kentucky” particularly federal workers going without a paycheck. 
Liz Pratt, a spokesperson for Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities, the state’s largest utility in terms of electricity customers served, was asked in an email whether the utility supports a disconnection moratorium during the government shutdown. She did not directly answer the question, but said in a statement that the utility has been working to support organizations leading “critical food relief efforts” in Louisville, Lexington and Paducah during the government shutdown. 
“We understand how, at any time throughout the year and particularly now during the shutdown, a customer may face an unexpected situation, and we encourage our customers to contact us right away if they’re facing a situation and think they may have difficulty paying their bill,” Pratt said in her statement. 
Pratt said the utility can arrange for payment plans and connect people with local agencies that can offer assistance, including working with federal employees. 
Stalled legislative efforts
One of the nonprofit leaders supporting Kentuckians for Energy Democracy said the request for a utility disconnection moratorium is also connected to efforts by the group to support state legislation that would prevent disconnections during extreme weather. 
Lane Boldman, executive director of the environmental advocacy group Kentucky Conservation Committee, said such legislation could prevent dangerous situations during the upcoming winter. 
“People are forced to use unconventional ways to heat their house or run appliances in ways that are less safe,” when a utility turns off a home’s heat, Boldman said.
Democratic-sponsored legislation this year to limit when utilities could disconnect a customer, including depending on what the temperature is outside, did not advance in the GOP-controlled legislature. 
Boldman said such legislation would be a longer-term protection for low-income Kentuckians, while a utility disconnection moratorium would serve as a stopgap measure. The financial strain from the government shutdown on federal food assistance only exacerbates the situation. 
“If we had a severe weather incident in the next week or two, people could be in serious risk,” Boldman said.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/240227Lantern059-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-07 05:17:45.887389

(Photo courtesy of Lutheran Services Carolinas)COLUMBIA — When President Donald Trump won a second term, Saleh Alkhalifa knew his older brother had until January of this year to get from Lebanon to the United States or remain trapped in a country at war.
Alkhalifa’s brother arrived in December 2024, a month before Trump, following promises made on the campaign trail, suspended most refugee admissions in an executive order. Since then, the Trump administration has slashed funding to refugee resettlement groups and paused or eliminated programs meant to help people flee war and persecution to come to the United States.
On Thursday, the administration said it would limit the number of refugees allowed in the country during the coming year at 7,500, a record low.
For nonprofits helping refugees get to South Carolina and settle in once they’re there, those changes mean significant reductions to their budgets and services. Meanwhile, refugees are facing uncertainty about how long they will legally be able to remain in the country and cuts to the benefits that once helped keep them afloat while looking for a job.
Alkhalifa’s family fled to Lebanon from their home country of Syria in 2014. Ten years later, Alkhalifa, his six siblings and his parents settled in Columbia.
The pressure of getting his older brother — the last immediate family member overseas — from Lebanon to South Carolina took a toll on the family. But 21-year-old Alkhalifa recognizes how lucky he is to have everyone together and safe.
“That’s something really special,” he said. “We have to remember that it’s something that doesn’t happen twice.”
Pause in resettlement
Many did not have the same luck as Alkhalifa.
Since the beginning of this year, Lutheran Services Carolinas has resettled six people into the country — four from Afghanistan and two from South Africa, said Seth Hershberger, who runs the state’s New Americans Program.
That’s a far cry from the more than 1,300 the nonprofit resettled by this time last year. Lutheran Services expected a new Trump administration to make cuts. Before Trump took office, the nonprofit expected to welcome 500 people into South Carolina in 2025. But that came to a grinding halt in January, Hershberger said.
How a nonprofit helps refugees make SC their home

People the nonprofit worked with “had sold all their belongings, if they had any belongings, and had prepared to move to the U.S., and then all of a sudden were told, ‘No, you can’t come to the U.S.,’” Hershberger said.
The cities and small towns taking in refugees couldn’t handle the number of people moving there from abroad, the Trump administration said in its January executive order pausing refugee resettlement programs.
“The United States lacks the ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans, that protects their safety and security, and that ensures the appropriate assimilation of refugees,” the order read.
That’s supposed to be the job of organizations like Lutheran Services Carolinas, which works with Global Refuge, one of 10 agencies nationwide approved to identify, screen, process and move refugees from countries where they face persecution into the United States.
Every person the nonprofit works with is coming to the country legally. Many, like the Alkhalifa family, go through years of processing and screening before they can enter the U.S.
Lutheran Services is operating with half the staff and a quarter of the budget it had last year, Hershberger said.

Last year, the nonprofit received about $16 million in federal grants to fund its offices in Greenville, Myrtle Beach and Columbia. This year, it’s getting $4 million to help refugees pay their bills or fund support services for them, Hershberger said.
Reductions in other services
Stopping refugees from coming into the country doesn’t stop the nonprofit’s work, Hershberger said.
For the first few months after a refugee arrives in the country, Lutheran Services Carolina covers their expenses, including rent, utilities, groceries and other necessities. The nonprofit offers cultural orientation and English classes, as well as help finding jobs.
In the past, the nonprofit helped people sign up for public assistance programs, including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly called food stamps. However, that changed with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed into law July 4, which immediately made refugees ineligible for either program.
Refugees still get help paying for health care during their first four months in the U.S.
After that, they need to either get insurance through a job, pay for it themselves — which is almost impossible — or just go without.
But finding a job that quickly is unrealistic, Hershberger said.
“When you have to focus on just getting a job so fast, it also makes it so that you don’t have as much time for cultural orientation,” he said. “You don’t have as much time for English classes. There’s more pressure on the family in general to all be working and making that a top priority over some of these other things that are necessary for integration in the long term.”
Alkhalifa’s family lost their SNAP benefits, which they used to pay for groceries, under the change in federal law. The family has been getting by, but paying for food and other costs makes saving up for other expenses difficult, Alkhalifa said. Not all of his family speaks fluent English, so not all of them can easily find a job, he added.
Alkhalifa plans to attend Midlands Technical College for two years before transferring to the University of South Carolina to pursue a degree in cybersecurity, he said. First, though, he needs to save at least $4,000 per semester for tuition. He’ll need more if he doesn’t get the aid he applied for, he said.
“It’s kind of a lot of money to pay while having a big family to spend money on,” he said.
Some people who received help from Lutheran Services Carolinas stopped getting assistance at all. In June, the Trump administration received permission from the U.S. Supreme Court to end a humanitarian parole program for people who came to the country from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The nonprofit can’t help refugees from those countries who may have stayed anyway, since it can offer aid only to people in the country with a legal permit, Hershberger said.
Uniting for Ukraine
Also in question is a program offering Ukrainians humanitarian protection amid the country’s ongoing war with Russia. Under the Uniting for Ukraine initiative, U.S. residents could apply to sponsor Ukrainian families into the country and help them get settled.
When reviews for new applications stopped in January, so did the process for Ukrainians who came to the U.S. two years ago and needed to reapply to stay, said Curtis Lee, who founded Carolinas for Ukraine, a nonprofit that has helped resettle 30 Ukrainian refugees in Hartsville. Since then, approvals nationwide have been sporadic, and families with expired or nearly expired parole forms have no clue whether they will be able to stay in the country legally, Lee said.
Without legal residence, the Ukrainians who settled in Hartsville and other parts of the country could lose their jobs or face deportation. But their only other option, in many cases, is to return to a country still at war, Lee said.
“They’re really kind of caught in limbo,” Lee said. “You’re sitting there not knowing if you should be planning on staying or if you should be planning on having to leave, and then you don’t know when you would need to leave.”
“It’s very stressful,” he added.
As of Thursday, just one of those 30 families in Hartsville had received reapproval, Lee said. For the rest of the community, a path forward remained unclear. Without official word as to whether the program is still running, families don’t know if their applications are under consideration or not, he said.
“I think that’s what’s really kind of worn them down, is just not knowing,” Lee said. “They’ve been waiting for months and months and months.”
Looking ahead
Lutheran Services regularly gets calls from clients who are afraid that police might stop and detain them, even though they have legal permission to be in the country, he said. They’re fearful if they see a police car in their neighborhood on a random patrol. Hershberger said he’s getting more calls from people wondering if they should go to work.
Clients learn their legal rights during cultural orientation, but people are still afraid, he said.
“We used to be like, ‘Yes, you should go to work, nothing will happen,’” Hershberger said. “Now we’ve changed our verbiage to more of, ‘Nothing should happen, but we can’t guarantee it, because there’s just a lot of unprecedented things happening, unfortunately.’”
Lutheran Services Carolinas is working to help its clients become self-sufficient so they won’t rely on the nonprofit’s resources. Independence is always the goal, but it became even more important with the uncertainty over the future of resettlement agencies, Hershberger said.
“I think that’s the biggest thing, is we want them to be prepared,” Hershberger said. “If we’re not there to help them, we want them to still be able to live and thrive in the U.S.”
Alkhalifa’s own migration to the U.S. hit one road bump after Trump’s first election in 2016. His parents started the process of coming into the country two years prior, but their application went on pause until Biden took office in 2023, he said.
Since moving to Columbia in February 2024, Alkhalifa has made friends and figured out how to navigate an unfamiliar place. Most important, though, is knowing that he and his family are safe, he said.
“It’s really amazing, having the security, like you belong to somewhere,” he said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG9195887186102240568-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-07 05:17:45.887389

(Photo by Ryan Berry/Washington State Standard)The Trump administration has proposed significantly shifting management of the nation’s public lands toward producing more revenue. President Donald Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum have issued orders aimed at expediting energy production on federal lands. Burgum has repeatedly referred to federal lands as America’s “balance sheet,” pushing for increased oil and gas extraction, logging and mining. The administration also wants to roll back the Roadless Rule, which prohibits logging on millions of acres of national forests. Meanwhile, some congressional Republicans have pushed bills to sell off millions of federal acres.
Other administration proposals include shifting more federal responsibilities — such as disaster recovery — to the states, changing oversight of federal firefighters, and making significant cuts to federal lands agencies.
These proposals especially affect Western states, where 90% of federal lands are located.
In Washington state, nearly 30% of land is owned by the federal government. Stateline reporter Alex Brown recently interviewed Dave Upthegrove, public lands commissioner of Washington state, to ask how these proposals and other federal changes are playing out on the ground in his state. Elected commissioner last year, the Democrat previously served as a state representative in the Washington House and on the King County Council.
This interview has been condensed for length and edited for clarity.
Stateline: We’re currently several weeks into a federal government shutdown that has furloughed thousands of workers at federal land management agencies. What effect is the shutdown having on national parks, forests and other lands?
Upthegrove: We’re still working through what those impacts are going to be. Obviously, it means that the people who care for those lands — rangers, foresters, biologists, more — are furloughed. So the longer the shutdown goes on, the longer people aren’t on the ground to manage the forest, the bigger the impact will be.
Trump denies disaster aid, tells states to do more

We’re concerned about potential impacts to Good Neighbor Authority [a federal collaboration law] projects on federal lands, that we’re essentially losing time on forest health treatments, prescribed burns, at a time when we need to be doing that work to prepare for wildfire season. We’re going to keep working with the feds on those Good Neighbor agreements, but we’re worried those impacts can be widespread.
Trump’s firefighting plan
Q: President Trump has announced plans to create a unified U.S. Wildland Fire Service, combining the firefighting resources of the Forest Service, National Park Service and other land management agencies. You lead an agency that works closely with those agencies to fight wildfires. Do you support the idea of merging their fire crews into a single agency?
A: It’s how it’s done. The improvements and streamlining might be possible. A single federal entity that’s responsible for wildfires on federal jurisdiction, and that’s important — on federal jurisdiction — could be beneficial, but the federal government can’t override or supersede our state and local jurisdiction. So I think it’s really important for the administration to recognize that federal, state and local coordination already exists.
This is a team effort, and what’s been going on at the federal level — the chaos, the lack of communication — is a serious problem. The last thing we want is partners that are disconnected from each other. So consolidation, done properly, maybe could be beneficial. But I really wonder, given the behavior we’ve seen for that administration, if they can implement this cleanly. We were engaging in that — our firefighting experts are offering comments and feedback — and we really value that federal partnership, but it’s really going to depend on what it looks like.
Disaster recovery
Q: Under Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied some requests for disaster relief, including here in Washington. He has called on states to play a larger role in disaster recovery and rely less on federal support. Have you gotten any indications that FEMA’s support for wildfire recovery could be diminished, and is the state equipped to handle a bigger role?
A: No, state and local governments are not able to replace the kind of resources the federal government has. That’s why this has always been a federal responsibility, because of the scale and scope of these disasters. So no, we aren’t able to replace it.
We have to be able to trust that they will be there to support everyone in this country when there’s a disaster, regardless of political party or political leanings of a state. And I really worry about that, because the notion that state and local governments can pick up the tab for these huge disasters is laughable.
Selling public lands
Q: Leaders in Trump’s administration have talked about public lands as America’s balance sheet and called for some lands to be sold off to bring in revenue. Here in Washington state, you’re in the middle of similar debates about the role of public lands for revenue or conservation. At a time when budgets are tight and some are looking at public lands as assets that can be sold or managed to maximize their economic value, what is your view of the purpose of public lands, including potentially selling them for revenue?
A: Our state and federal lands belong to we, the people. They’re public lands, our lands, and they need to be managed in the public interest for all the people of the state or in the nation. And I think that’s the vision here in Washington.
Trump wants to log more trees. He’ll need states’ help.

The president’s plan to clear-cut national forests to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy is offensive and it sells out future generations. We’re seeing efforts to gut the public lands rule, which [would] put mining and drilling ahead of conservation and recreation, repealing the Roadless Rule [which would threaten] protected forests with industrial logging and development. And we need to manage these lands for the broader benefits.
Land revenue for schools
Q: Your agency oversees millions of acres of trust lands. In many Western states, these lands provide important revenue for schools and local governments and support economic sectors such as logging and mining. Your plans to conserve some older forests have drawn criticism from both timber companies and environmental groups who feel it either goes too far or not far enough. Do you see a way for Western states to manage that tension between the economic and environmental values of these trust lands?
A: We need to always find the right balance, and we also need to acknowledge our world is changing. We’re seeing the impacts of climate change now. We’re seeing a rapid loss in biodiversity. The Washington State Department of Natural Resources has always led the way in sustainable management, and I want us to continue to lead the world and do more, and I believe we can innovate and diversify how we generate revenue from these lands.
What that means is we will continue to have a strong, robust, healthy wood products industry in Washington state for generations to come. … I think there is strong public support for the values those forests bring, in addition to wood products. So I think we are pursuing an approach that strikes the appropriate balance.
That tension will always be there for any trust manager. Any land manager in any Western state will always have those competing values.
Wildfire immigration raid
Q: Shifting gears a little bit, there were national headlines this summer following the immigration raid at the Bear Gulch Fire here in Washington state. How surprised were you to see federal immigration officials targeting wildfire crews?
A: I was shocked. I was offended. Regardless of what someone thinks about immigration policy, enforcing visas at the site of an active, ongoing emergency is irresponsible.
I think it just plays into unnecessary fear that’s being generated intentionally by this administration. But even if there were people sympathetic to the president’s views on immigration, I think this really turned a lot of people off. You know, these were firefighters working hard to keep us safe, and active in the middle of an emergency.
Firefighters question leaders’ role in Washington immigration raid

And the more I learn about it, the more upset I am about it, and my hope is that it doesn’t happen again.
Effects of funding cuts
Q: President Trump has made significant cuts at the U.S. Forest Service and other land management agencies, both to staffing as well as grant programs and other funding sources. Your agency obviously works extensively with the Forest Service on its forest health plan and other forestry issues. How significantly have these federal cuts affected your agency’s work and the forest health plan in Washington?
A: They create a lot of uncertainty. We had no communication from the federal government as to their plans. Many of our grants got suddenly turned off without notice, most of them turned back on again. It’s made it very difficult for us to plan our work. We don’t know whether we should keep spending money sometimes, because we don’t know if we’ll get reimbursed, even if we have a signed contract.
A lot of our grants are pass-through funds to other entities, like local governments, fire departments. They submit receipts to us. We pay them back. We submit them to the federal government. We get paid back. We’ve had to make decisions on a daily basis as to what to continue and when to tell people to stop working.
We also are beginning to see impacts from the mass firing of employees at some of these agencies. We had fewer critical incident management teams nationally this year in the fire services in large part due to the reduced staffing levels at these federal agencies. Fortunately, our fire season was able to accommodate that, but it presented risks.
More logging
Q: Trump has also called for an increase in logging on federal lands. You said you’d be open to collaborating on more forest health and wildfire resilience-type work. What have you seen so far about how the feds’ plan to log more timber? And given the cuts we’ve seen, is that even possible with the reduced staffing that they have?
A: I don’t know. We’ve not seen any meaningful movement in that direction. I think they’re kidding themselves if they can lay off a whole bunch of foresters [and] at the same time increase their production. So I think it’s a lot of posturing and bluster on the part of the president.
There’s certainly room to better manage some of these national forests, and we want to be a part of that. We’ve partnered on over 25,000 acres in Washington state through the Good Neighbor agreement, doing forest restoration, forest health and other good work to help manage these forests, including generating wood products in the process.

He’d navigated these frontlines for two years, since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but that night his vehicle rolled over an anti-tank mine. The explosion ripped the tank to pieces but somehow spared Gromadskyi’s life.
His injuries — to the spine, abdominal wall, arm and several other areas — were extensive, and Gromadskyi was passed from one hospital to another as the complexity of his case proved beyond the capacity of multiple medical teams.

Ultimately, he landed at the Vinnytsia National Medical University Hospital, roughly 500 miles from where his tank exploded, in the care of Dr. Roman Chornopyshchuk.
“It was too hard for regional hospitals to provide care for such a difficult patient,” Chornopyshchuk said. “That’s why we decided to move this patient back here.”
Chornopyshchuk is uniquely qualified to handle complex cases like Gromadskyi’s, in part because he participated in a program — based at Yale University’s School of Medicine — called Doctors United for Ukraine, or DU4U.

Established in 2022 by a group of Yale-based doctors and researchers, the organization provides medical support and education for Ukrainian medical professionals via equipment donations, lectures and in-person training.
Gromadskyi, who now relies on a wheelchair to get around, experienced necrosis and received skin grafts — several of which his body initially rejected. He lost both his legs and needs to be fitted for prosthetics. During his treatment and recovery, he said he found strength in visits from fellow soldiers, friends and family.
Speaking softly, a gentle look in his deep brown eyes, Gromadskyi said he wants to return to the frontlines. “The boys are waiting there for me,” he said.

Treating trauma
As the war in Ukraine escalates — in both intensity and magnitude — doctors like Chornopyshchuk are waging their own battle to keep up.
“Day by day, month by month, the number of patients is only increasing,” Chornopyshchuk said. “The severity has also increased a lot.”
On a cloudy day in the early summer, Chornopyshchuk moved quickly through the Vinnytsia hospital’s labyrinthine corridors, which are adorned with art from rehabilitated soldiers and their families. Checking on one wounded patient after another, the doctor’s cheerful disposition and boundless energy were like sunshine beaming down the sterile halls.
The burn unit where he works has a staff of about 70, including 10 surgeons, and it’s equipped to handle complex cases. More than half the patients they treat suffer from combat injuries that include burns, Chornopyshchuk explained.

“They are usually combined with other types of trauma,” he said. “Usually it’s eyes, ears, different brain injuries and so on. The priority is burn injuries that are usually more than 30% of the total body surface area.”
An injury that extensive is no longer uncommon. The severity of injuries has been rising alongside the war’s growing intensity.
In Kyiv, about four hours northeast of Vinnytsia, Dr. Olena Kvasha practices otolaryngology — ear, nose and throat medicine — at the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine. While her hospital is non-military,  she estimates that 90% of her patients are now military patients. Many suffer from blast-induced eardrum injuries.

Kvasha’s patient, 49-year-old Yuriy Petrovskyi, had been in the Ukrainian army for just over a year and a half when Russian forces dropped a grenade into his dugout in early June. Aside from his eardrum injury, Petrovskyi also has bits of shrapnel lodged in his eyes and other parts of his body.
Even during treatment at the hospital, the war remains ever-present. Russia has ramped up its drone and missile attacks, and air raid sirens regularly wail across the city of Kyiv and around the academy campus — as they did on a cloudy Tuesday morning in June as Petrovskyi visited Kvasha for a checkup.
The academy campus has three bomb shelters equipped with bean bag chairs, beds, seating and a makeshift operating room. But they’re rarely used, even when the sirens signal an attack.
“We don’t go down (into the shelter),” Kvasha said with a sheepish grin before hurrying away to continue her rounds.

Connecticut connection
Drs. Kvasha and Chornopyshchuk met last year in Connecticut, where they participated in the Yale DU4U program. 
The idea for the program started to take shape in the early days following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 
Dr. Alla Vash-Margita, a gynecologist at Yale who immigrated to the U.S. from Ukraine, had been attending meetings organized by Ukrainian undergraduate students, where she and DU4U’s other founding members first made connections with students, faculty and researchers who were concerned about the war. 
“Instead of crying — which I did a lot those days — and watching the news and being sad and angry, we said, ‘Okay, we’re going to put our minds and time to the cause.’”
That cause, they decided, would be to help support the doctors and nurses treating the rising number of combat-related injuries in Ukraine. Like the Ukrainian coat of arms — a trident — the effort would be three-pronged, incorporating intensive care, the health of women and children and mental health.

At first, DU4U focused on raising money and sending medical equipment that Yale practitioners were no longer using. But as the war progressed, Vash-Margita said, “we kind of started realizing that no matter how much money we have, we’re not going to be able to provide medical equipment for the entire Ukraine.”
She and other doctors began to shift their focus to medical education.
“There’s a severe shortage of doctors and even more so nurses,” Vash-Margita said. “So the situation has been precarious, and it’s not much better today, if not worse.”
To date, DU4U has hosted three cohorts of medical professionals from Ukraine to train for a month with local doctors in the types of specialized care that are critical in the war zone. Vash-Margita said the program is limited only by which facilities can host visiting doctors for the 4-week period they’re in the U.S.
Kvasha and Chornopyshchuk joined five other doctors in New Haven late last summer.
“It was a great period of professional life,” said Chornopyshchuk, who spent some of his time in Connecticut observing doctors in Bridgeport Hospital’s burn center. “It was rather intensive, rather interesting and rather fruitful,” he said.
The most recent cohort of Ukrainian medical professionals — the program’s third — arrived in New Haven in early October.

‘People joined us’
Gromadskyi, the Ukrainian soldier, was the first patient to benefit from some of the training Chornopyshchuk received at Yale. When Gromadskyi arrived in Vinnytsia, he was suffering from deep necrosis on his bones, his spine, his arms and his abdominal wall.
While in Connecticut, Chornopyshchuk had learned some specialized techniques for treating complications of burn injuries and skin grafting. “It was interesting to see, to analyze and to study any new methods of prevention, scar formation, and surgical and non-surgical methods of corrections,” he said.
Using new methods for removing necrotic areas and closing up wounds, Chornopyshchuk said his team was able to heal the wound in a shorter timeframe.
Chornopyshchuk and his fellow doctors in the program are still in contact with the physicians they trained with in Connecticut.
Across the country from Donetsk, in Lviv, Dr. Volodymyr Vovk has been deploying a surgical skin grafting technique he learned from Yale faculty called “free flap.” The technique is often used in complex operations like trauma reconstruction. 
“This knowledge that we took from this hospital and university, we implement in Ukraine, and not only in practical cases, but also in educational and scientific work,” Vovk, a craniomaxillofacial surgeon and professor, said.
During his time in Connecticut, Vovk studied at Yale New Haven Hospital with Dr. Suresh Mohan. A plastic surgeon focusing on the face, head and neck, Mohan has been practicing at Yale New Haven Hospital for three years.

Mohan said having the eyes of so many visiting physicians on him during complex surgeries was tense at times. During one procedure, he was searching for a nerve in the patient’s face that, once transferred, would allow the patient to regain the ability to smile.
“I was dissecting, dissecting and finally I dissected one place and stimulated, the whole face moved,” Mohan said. “You felt this huge sigh of relief in the whole room… They were watching, and they were right there with you. It wasn’t just this disconnected presence,” he recalled.
A few months after that surgery, Mohan reunited with Vovk in Ukraine where he performed nearly 15 operations on blast injury patients at Superhumans Center, a surgical facility in Lviv’s outskirts. Mohan traveled with two other American doctors, as part of DU4U.
Mohan, who has performed surgeries in places like Haiti and India, said Ukraine was unique. “I think the urgency and intensity with which the circumstance has presented itself was very, very different. It’s different when your safety feels threatened. I think when that is the underlying current, it really shapes everything else that you’re doing.”
Mohan said his experience with gunshot wounds gave him a baseline of experience. “In New Haven, we have our share of gun violence, but this is trauma at a whole other level,” he said. “We don’t see that level of ballistic trauma here.”

In the years since DU4U launched, the organization has expanded its work on the ground in Ukraine. The first year, the program sent intensive care providers. The second year, reconstructive surgeons traveled to the war zone. The latest group comprises two psychiatrists, four anesthesiologists focused on pain management and two OB/GYN doctors.
“Nobody left, and people joined us,” Vash-Margita said. “What is inspiring is that it’s not even people who are Ukrainians, or have Ukrainian heritage. It’s Americans. It’s people who have no ties to Ukraine, but they feel that this is the right cause, and they join and they do work.”

(Getty Images.)Electricity prices are rising in Ohio with increasing demand from data centers powering artificial intelligence. Adding power from nuclear plants would lower prices, a panel of economists said, but some also had doubts.
Gov. Mike DeWine and JobsOhio have been pushing tax incentives  for data centers even though they create relatively few jobs. By one estimate, taxpayers are foregoing at least $1 million in revenue for each job created.
The centers have, however, dramatically increased energy demand in a state whose leaders have shown an inclination to gut efficiency programs. The state’s Republican leadership also has demonstrated a hostility to most renewable sources of energy. 
They were not, however, hostile to nuclear energy in 2019, when some took $61 million in bribes from Akron-based FirstEnergy and passed a $1.3 billion bailout. The lion’s share of the money was meant to prop up two money-losing reactors in northern Ohio. Then-House Speaker Larry Householder, R-Glenford, is serving a 20-year federal prison sentence in connection with the scandal.
But with smaller, hopefully less-dangerous reactors under development, does it make sense to build some in Ohio? 
As part of a regular survey by Scioto Analysis, a panel of 18 economists was asked whether it agreed that “Encouraging development of new nuclear power generation facilities will lead to lower energy prices in Ohio.” Thirteen said they did and five were uncertain.

Among those who agreed, the law of supply and demand applied — put more power on the grid and it becomes cheaper.
“Perhaps not immediately, but over the long run increased supply should put downward pressure on prices,” Will Georgic of Ohio Wesleyan University said in the comments section of the survey.
But Faria Huq of Lake Erie College said there are many uncertainties.
“Basic laws of demand and supply would suggest that in the face of increasing demand, supply needs to be increased in order to keep prices low,” she wrote. “However, given the very large fixed costs associated with developing nuclear power generation facilities, there would need to be reliable projections of the specific energy needs of the data centers prior to investing in them. There should also be some form of commitment by the data centers to use the additional energy produced.”
Given that nuclear generation by definition involves radioactivity, there can also be a question of possible health hazards. However, some of the economists said, those have to be weighed against those associated with burning fossil fuels. 
For example, Ohio is home to the Gavin coal plant, whose smokestacks pump out a toxic plume that a Sierra Club analysis estimated kills 244 Americans a year. Even old-school nuclear plants in the Western world are far safer, said Jonathan Andreas of Bluffton University.
“Nuclear power has a long track record and Western plant designs have produced much, much lower rates of health problems for area residents than coal-fired plants, which have killed hundreds of thousands of Americans due to pollution,” he wrote. “Even the worst nuclear disasters in the West, Three-Mile Island and Fukushima, killed very few people directly although there were many indirect deaths caused by the evacuations. Those are the worst disasters in the entire global history of capitalist nuclear reactors, and the technology has been improving.”
When asked whether the economic benefits of adding nuclear generation in Ohio would outweigh the costs, the economists were split more closely. Eleven said they would, while seven were uncertain.
“The demand for electricity is projected to increase substantially year after year,” wrote Iryna Topolyan of the University of Cincinnati. “It is imperative to find ways to increase supply with low climate impact. Nuclear energy looks like a good candidate. My reservation is that, within the long time frame it takes to build and bring online a new nuclear plant, (far safer nuclear) fusion may become a viable and much more attractive option.”

(New Hampshire Bulletin file photo)New Hampshire is paying Concord-based Riverbend Mental Health Center $60,000 over two years for electroconvulsive shock therapy for approximately 25 patients at the state-run New Hampshire Hospital.
The procedures will be performed at Concord Hospital to treat conditions such as severe depression, psychosis, and mania.
The Executive Council unanimously approved the contract during its meeting last week.
“We see ECT as one of several therapeutic tools available to restore health and reduce suffering for those with severe depression, psychosis, mania, or catatonia — conditions that, without effective treatment, can lead to prolonged hospitalization, disability, or even loss of life,” Dr. Paul Brown, chief medical officer for Riverbend Community Mental Health, said in an email to the Bulletin. “For some patients, ECT truly can be life-saving.”
A strong stigma surrounds electroconvulsive therapy due to a history of doctors administering excessive levels of electric shock and a lack of anesthesia. However, the treatment is much safer and more effective today, according to the Mayo Clinic, because doctors now employ it in a more controlled environment with better safety measures. Electroconvulsive therapy involves sending a small electric current into a patient’s brain to intentionally cause a brief seizure. This, doctors say, alters brain chemistry and can quickly alleviate the symptoms of some mental health disorders.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for the Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original story.)Coming off the heels of winning local races, the Ohio Democratic Party is feeling optimistic about the 2026 election. 
Democratic mayors in Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Toledo all won reelection on Nov. 4. 
“Our mayors are a model of what Democratic leadership can look like and represent the future of our party,” Ohio Democratic Party Chair Kathleen Clyde said during a virtual press call Wednesday. 
Ohio voters will cast their ballot for a new governor in 2026, along with all of Ohio’s other statewide executive offices, as all current officeholders are term-limited. That includes Ohio secretary of state, attorney general, auditor, and treasurer. 
“This cycle brings us the most opportunities for Ohio Democrats in 20 years, and we’re feeling confident that we will win these elections and take our state back,” Clyde said. 
“Republicans in Columbus have raised costs on Ohioans and made life unaffordable for families across the state, while only serving billionaires and special interests. This election, voters will be ready for a change, while Republicans offer more of the same.”
The last time a Democratic candidate won any of Ohio statewide executive offices was back in 2006 when Ted Strickland was elected governor, Marc Dann was elected attorney general, Richard Cordray was elected treasurer, and Jennifer Bruner was elected secretary of state. 
“Republicans have controlled state government for nearly two decades, and all we have to show for it is rising costs and falling quality of life,” Clyde said. 
Former Director of the Ohio Department of Health Dr. Amy Acton is running as a Democratic candidate for governor against Republican candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. 
The Ohio Republican Party officially endorsed Ramaswamy in May. 
Political newcomer Heather Hill is also running for governor as an independent after leaving the Republican party. 
Former Democratic Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan has hinted at running for governor in 2026, but has yet to make a decision. 
Former Democratic state Rep. Elliot Forhan and John Kulewicz, a retired attorney and Upper Arlington City Council member, are running in the Democratic primary for Ohio attorney general. Current Republican Ohio Auditor Keith Faber is also running for attorney general. 
Democratic Ohio House state Rep. Allison Russo and Bryan Hambley, a cancer doctor with University of Cincinnati Health, are running in the Democratic primary for secretary of state.
Current Republican Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague and retired Air Force intel officer Marcell Strbich are running in the Republican primary for secretary of state.
Current Republican Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose is running for auditor in 2026. 
A Republican primary for the nomination for Ohio treasurer includes former state Sen. Niraj Antani, current state Sen. Kristina Roegner, former state Rep. Jay Edwards, and Lake County Treasurer Michael Zuren.
No Democrats have yet announced their candidacy in 2026 for Ohio auditor or treasurer, but Clyde said she expects to hear announcements about those races soon. 
Ohio Supreme Court races will be on the 2026 ballot. 
Democratic Ohio Supreme Court Justice Jennifer Brunner is being challenged by five Republicans competing in a primary — Rocky River Municipal Judge Joseph Burke, former Franklin County Common Pleas Judge Colleen O’Donnell, Fifth District Court of Appeals Judge Andrew King, Second District Court of Appeals Judge Ron Lewis, and State Appellate Judge Jill Flagg Lanzinger. 
Brunner is the only Democratic judge on the 6-1 Ohio Supreme Court. 
Republican Ohio Supreme Court Justice Dan Hawkins is up for reelection next year, but no candidates have announced they are running for his seat. 
The filing deadline to run for office is Feb. 4, 2026, and Ohio’s primary election is May 5, 2026. 
Also in 2026, former Ohio Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown will challenge appointed Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Jon Husted, who replaced JD Vance in the chamber. Husted is seeking his first election to the position.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Outside a southern Maine polling place on election night, Kristen and her son Ezra were stopped by a man collecting signatures for a petition campaign to “protect girls’ sports.” The petitioner asked them to sign a proposed ballot referendum that would bar transgender girls from participating on girls’ sports teams and from using girls’ bathrooms and locker rooms. 
“I know you’re making money doing this, but think about the cost — the impact to these kids,” Kristen, who asked to use only their first names to protect their privacy, told the petitioner.
“I’d do it for free,” replied the man, who refused to identify himself.
“I’m trans myself and I play sports, so this affects me directly,” Ezra added.
Later, Kristen explained why she stopped to talk to the petitioner. 
“I just wanted to bring attention that what he’s doing is hurting trans youth, is medically incorrect and that he doesn’t have correct data,” she said. “It’s not inconsequential to the lives of parents and kids.”
Campaign to restrict trans students’ rights collecting signatures at polling places Tuesday

According to campaign organizers, more than 53,000 Mainers have signed the petition since it launched on Tuesday. It’s the latest effort by a conservative group to roll back Maine’s inclusive policies, which for two decades have guaranteed transgender students the right to participate on teams and use facilities aligned with their gender identity under the Maine Human Rights Act.
The petition will need about 68,000 signatures by early February to make it onto the 2026 ballot. The number of signatures required represents 10% of the total votes cast in the last gubernatorial election in 2022. 
If it passes, the proposal would require schools to separate athletic teams, locker rooms, and bathrooms strictly by “biological sex,” forcing trans students to use facilities corresponding to their sex assigned at birth. It would also mandate the establishment of coed teams. 
The proposal resembles recent rules adopted by more than half a dozen local school boards that defy state anti-discrimination laws. 
A coalition of LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations have denounced the effort, raising alarm about the influence of polarizing national politics that have put trans students in the crosshairs.
“We have a wide network of organizations and individuals in Maine who understand that this is just a national agenda,” said Destie Hohman Sprague, executive director of the Maine Women’s Lobby. “Those organizations are currently working together to build and implement a plan to make sure that our communities really understand the threat that this initiative poses.”
Their efforts will focus on combating the misinformation they expect to be spread by the petition effort, Hohman Sprague and Equality Maine Executive Director Gia Drew told Maine Morning Star.
Maine gained national attention this spring after Gov. Janet Mills defended the state’s inclusive policies in a tense exchange with President Donald Trump. The Maine Department of Education and Greely High School in Cumberland faced several federal investigations, accusing the state of violating anti-discrimination law for allowing trans girls to play on girls teams. A lawsuit for alleged violations of Title IX is ongoing in federal court.  
Supporters of similar measures that failed in the Maine Legislature this year argued that the proposals were about fairness in girls’ sports and safety in bathrooms, although no data has shown that cisgender girls are at greater risk in bathrooms shared with trans girls.
Trans athletes — who make up a tiny fraction of the overall high school athletes nationwide — have been the target of scrutiny over the past few years as the politicization of trans identities ramped up. Since 2020, thousands of anti-LGBTQ+ state laws have been introduced across the country, with a majority of states imposing some kind of restriction on trans and nonbinary students. Some of those laws ban books about trans people; others restrict students and teachers from using affirming pronouns; and dozens include bans on trans athletes.
Reviews of these laws show that bans on athletic participation in particular almost always spill over into prohibiting other kinds of access for trans students, which has severe consequences on their mental health and has shown to be linked to higher rates of suicide, depression and anxiety, according to longstanding research.

Allen Cornwall, another petitioner who collected signatures for the campaign in Scarborough, said as a pole vaulting official, his concern about fairness got him interested in the issue.
“The whole thing really started because I dealt with a bunch of girls who were negatively impacted” by competing against a trans athlete, he said. The town of Cumberland drew national attention earlier this year after state Rep. Laurel Libby (R-Auburn) posted on her legislative Facebook page photos and personal details of a local transgender student athlete after they won a pole vaulting event. 
“The girls were literally in tears at every meet. They were defeated before they started. And I thought, ‘What do I do?’” Cornwall said.
Cornwall talked to voters as they left Scarborough on Tuesday evening, asking if they were interested in signing petitions that “would protect girls’ sports.” Some voters stopped to sign, saying they agreed that it was a question of fairness or safety. 
“This is just about fairness and equality,” he said. “You can be whoever you want to be.”
But to the Maine Women’s Lobby and other members of the coalition, the movement to exclude trans girls from sports and school facilities will mean increased scrutiny on all girls, Hohman Sprague said.
“They may have gotten a lot of signatures, but I think over time people will come to understand that this is not about fairness,” she said. “It’s about invading people’s privacy, and not just people, but children.”
Regardless of whether the initiative gets on the ballot, having the petition circulated for the next few months will be harmful for some students and their families, Hohman Sprague said. The coalition will also be providing support and reassurance to impacted families that Mainers largely want to protect all students’ rights.
“I’m just really concerned for anyone who is now going to have to spend the next several months listening to a dissection of who gets to count. What we have to look, or feel, or act like. Whether or not we have the right genitalia — and let’s remember we are talking about children,” Hohman Sprague said.
“I do not think it has ever served marginalized minorities to have the majority debate their right to exist,” she added.
Ezra and his mom said they are worried about the petition gaining traction, as well. 
“Seeing someone who doesn’t know really anything about the trans community, just seeing them talk about it that way … is just inaccurate,” Ezra said. “But being strong as a community will help us persevere during these times.”

Jeff Colyer speaks to an audience at Fort Hays State University on Sept. 30. He's running in the Republican primary for governor. (Photo by Sam Foglesong for Kansas Reflector)Jeff Colyer stopped by Fort Hays State University to speak to students and community members about his campaign for governor on Sept. 30.
In a 30-minute address, Colyer touched on classic stump speech themes: recounting his public service and leadership experience, declaring Hays one of the most special places in the world and sprinkling in humor by adding, “Don’t tell the people in Johnson County!” He also followed what has become standard practice for lower-level GOP candidates by stressing his allegiance and closeness to President Donald Trump.
Beyond the clichés, however, Colyer offered little in the way of substantive policy solutions to Kansas problems, notably education.
The former governor lamented education standards in Kansas, claiming that only one in three third graders could read at a third-grade level. What’s to blame? According to Colyer it’s “Wokeism” and diversity, equity and inclusion. Both, he told an audience member, need to be taken out, “root and branch,” from our education system.
I pressed Colyer on the issue, asking him which specific policies he planned to remove and how they were directly contributing to falling education standards in the state.
His response was scattered.
He argued for reexamining the K–12 curriculum and asking “where it’s leading us.” He said that local school boards should be given tools so “their only option is not just a woke option.” He never explained what that “woke option” entailed or how it had become the only one available. Instead, he pointed to an apparently much-needed alternative based on “modern educational science,” along with “phonics and some basic educational parameters.”
Colyer’s remarks imply that Kansas classrooms don’t include “modern educational science” or “basic educational parameters.” He has said elsewhere that Kansas schools need education not indoctrination, a slogan that portrays Kansas schools as dystopian propaganda mills.
In the comments under one of Colyer’s recent Facebook posts, Kansas teachers took issue with his framing of Kansas education as indoctrination:

“Believing teachers are ‘indoctrinating’ children to do anything but write their names on their assignments? Hard pass.”
“When was the last time you were actually in a classroom? You have no clue what goes on in our classrooms. How about supporting teachers instead of falsely accusing them of ‘indoctrination’?”
“I would invite you to visit classrooms with me in the Wichita Public Schools. I think the experience would change your mind.”

After his initial answer to my question, I told Colyer that he still hadn’t explained what “Wokeism” was or how it was responsible for Kansas education standards.
The candidate then defined “Wokeism” as “something that gets rid of any sort of merit, that it is a politically inspired outcome. That’s what you’re looking for, that’s what you’re grading people on.” He did not expand upon what this politically inspired outcome might be or where or who it was coming from.
Colyer wants voters to believe that DEI and “Wokeism” are so damaging and so ingrained in our school system that they need to be torn out “root and branch,” but he couldn’t identify either the roots or the branches.
It was a shocking lack of clarity from someone seeking the state’s highest office. Colyer earned a graduate degree from Cambridge and has a wealth of international and domestic leadership experience. He knows that social challenges like education are complex and seldom influenced by a single factor.
Consider that Kansas has the second-highest rate of teachers leaving the profession in the country. Many of them complain that they are overworked and underpaid. Or consider the well-documented harms of social media on K-12 students, including shortened attention spans, lower academic motivation and a host of other mental health issues. These are just some of the factors that might contribute to falling education standards in Kansas. None was mentioned by Colyer.
This is the problem in an era of culture-war politics and a Trump-led GOP: Candidates like Colyer no longer need to worry about crafting policy solutions to complex problems. Regurgitating culture-war rhetoric and clinging to the president is enough to secure political success.
In nature, we’d call this mutualism, a symbiotic relationship that benefits both species.
Think of the oxpecker bird perched on a rhino’s back, plucking off ticks in exchange for a safe perch and a free ride. For GOP politicians, it’s much the same. Hug the president close, polish his reputation and echo his talking points. In return, political survival is virtually guaranteed without having to do any pesky problem solving.
Oxpeckers can live on a diet of sour ticks, unaware of the indignity of their position, which involves existing in a near-permanent cloud of farts emanating from one of the gassiest animals on the savannah.
Through their sycophancy to the president, GOP politicians like Colyer have created a flatulent environment of their own where they subsist on the sour tics of Trump’s culture war politics. But unlike the oxpecker, human beings are not immune to extended exposure in such an undignified environment. Prolonged sycophancy takes a toll on the human soul.
I hope that GOP politicians come to their senses and extricate themselves from their obsequious position. I wish it for their own sake but also for that of Kansas teachers, students and parents who stand to lose the most from the reductive politics and atrophied problem solving that now define so much of the GOP.

The views expressed here are those of the author.
In an era of school choice, districts across the country are facing declining enrollment, funding challenges and increased competition.
Here in Ohio, the state Department of Education just received $105 million in federal funding to expand charter schools, while the state continues to offer one of the largest private school voucher programs in the U.S.
Public school districts have two options.
They can sit back and hope the pendulum of support swings back to public education, or they can use increased competition as a driving force for innovation to best serve their students’ specific needs.
In Worthington, Ohio, where I became school superintendent 11 years ago, the district has embraced school choice as an opportunity.
Serving students in a diverse, inner suburb of Columbus, Worthington Schools hit its highest enrollment in history in 2025, without boundary or population shifts.
Families are choosing neighborhood public schools despite an abundance of alternatives, and the community continues to invest in modernizing district facilities.
The lessons learned demonstrate that public schools not only continue to matter to families, but they can set benchmarks for excellence in today’s competitive education landscape.
One of the top reasons parents lean toward school choice is that they are searching for more rigorous and challenging learning experiences for their children.
To remain competitive, districts need to think beyond the traditional classroom and create academic and extracurricular opportunities that fit students’ learning styles, interests and goals.
For instance, the Linworth Experiential Program allows Worthington’s second-semester high school seniors to complete their education in real-world settings, from working alongside business leaders to backpacking across Europe.
Phoenix Middle School offers a mastery-based learning environment that emphasizes taking intellectual risks and reframing mistakes as learning opportunities.
A key component of the program is Phoenix’s Connections class, a writing course that deepens students’ critical thinking skills across all core subjects.
Teachers encourage inquiry by asking open-ended questions and posing thought experiments, helping students develop basic techniques of analysis, organize arguments and evaluate evidence, and learn how to engage one another respectfully in sustained discussions of current ethical and social issues.
Expanding extracurriculars to appeal to every student’s interests is a tall order on a small budget.
However, keeping kids busy with positive learning experiences and connected to school and friends prevents them from filling their time with less favorable activities.
Through a combination of community funding and participation fees, Worthington has expanded its extracurriculars offerings to include 33 varsity sports, a variety of music programs and 70 clubs.
Because real learning happens through relationships, the district has also focused on ensuring that all students know they have an identified, trusted adult within the school system who cares for and believes in them.
This one-on-one connection is a clear expectation for every member of the school community, whether they are a teacher, coach, nurse, custodian or other staff member.
This individualized attention and support shifts the narrative that public schools can’t provide the personalized experience parents want for their children.
As centerpieces of their neighborhoods, Worthington schools host a variety of community activities, including art shows, Fourth of July fireworks displays and civic events, while sports stadiums and running tracks are open for use by the public.
By building these connections, Worthington has in turn fostered essential public-private partnerships.
Some of the area’s largest employers, including Worthington Industries, Honda of America, Abbott Laboratories and Columbus State Community College, work with the district to provide on-site job training.
Students gain critical career skills, while businesses develop a strong workforce built on local talent, ensuring the region remains an economic powerhouse.
Because Worthington’s relationships with local residents don’t end when their children graduate, there is greater community support for essential capital projects.
Over the past few years, Worthington has passed multiple levies and launched a three-phase, 15-year master facilities plan to renovate decades-old buildings into modern learning environments that align with diverse student needs.
To secure buy-in from the community, the district has maintained complete transparency and engaged families throughout the planning process.
Between 2017 and 2021, Worthington redesigned four middle schools, and in 2022, voters passed a bond issue to rebuild a 1950s-era high school.
Through the support of the community, today’s students enjoy bigger and better classrooms, children with special needs or English learners have access to more flexible learning spaces, and the community itself has new multipurpose rooms for public gatherings and events.
In today’s competitive education market, when families see firsthand how deeply a community cares about the long-term success of a school district and the funds it is willing to invest in their children’s education, they are more likely to make public school not just their first choice, but their only choice.
The national debate around struggling student enrollment assumes public schools are in decline.
Worthington’s experience shows there is another path.
Public schools can grow, adapt and remain central to the community when they stay rooted in values, relationships and responsiveness.
It’s up to forward-focused school and community leaders to rethink K-12 education and help public schools reclaim their status as the best option for families.

Gov. Wes Moore listens. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The state of Maryland and Prince George’s County sued the Trump administration Thursday over its plans to keep the FBI headquarters in downtown Washington, D.C., a move that they said would “unlawfully sabotage a multiyear collaborative effort” to relocate the facility to Greenbelt.
The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for Maryland, also claims that the administration plan would “unlawfully divert funding that Congress designated” for the Greenbelt project and put it toward renovation of the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington for the FBI.
Thursday’s announcement was just the latest battle in the fight by state and county officials to bring the FBI to Greenbelt, a proposal they say was developed over more than a decade of careful study and debate — only to be reversed in a matter of weeks on an apparent whim by the president.
“We are asking the court to stop the unlawful selection of the Reagan Building, prevent the diversion of congressionally appropriated funds and ensure the federal government, the Trump administration, follows the law,” Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown said Thursday.
Brown said the reversal of the decision to locate the FBI at Greenbelt is “illegal” because Congress allocated more than $1 billion for Greenbelt, not the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center in Washington. It was not on any potential list of sites until July 1, when it was announced as the new home of the FBI.
U.S. Senate Committee advances plan to keep FBI headquarters in Washington

The lawsuit also says that state and county officials made “extensive preparations” for the Greenbelt site after it was chosen in September 2023 by the General Services Administration. But the GSA and FBI announced that they were “casting all that aside and were embarking on a new plan” without consulting congressional, state or local officials on the move, the lawsuit said.
“[In] Maryland, we played by the rules. We won the project fairly and we will not let this administration steal jobs and opportunities from Prince George’s County and Maryland,” Brown said.
Brown made the announcement at a news conference at the Wayne K. Curry Administration Building in Prince George’s County, surrounded by some of Maryland’s top Democratic officials – Gov. Wes Moore, Reps. Glenn Ivey (D-4th) and Steny Hoyer (D-5th), Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) and Prince George’s County Executive Aisha Braveboy.
“Maryland is going to fight this thing with everything that we have because in Maryland, we do not bend the knee,” Moore said. “So, if Donald Trump thinks that we are going to roll over when he tries to make life worse for our law enforcement, he better think twice, and we’ll see him in court.”
The lawsuit comes a week after a Republican majority on the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee voted 10-9, along party lines, for a resolution that brings the GSA one step closer to making the Reagan Building the new home for about 6,000 FBI employees.
The vote reverses the agency’s decision in 2023, during the Biden administration, to choose Greenbelt over other potential sites in Landover and Springfield, Virginia, to replace the aging FBI headquarters in the J. Edgar Hoover Building. That decision followed more than a decade of studies and competition between Maryland and Virginia over which state would land the project.
A GSA prospectus approved by the Senate committee last week, estimated that the cost for design, construction, management and inspection at the Reagan Building would be nearly $843.7 million. With an additional $555 million from the FBI that would include preconstruction and “fit-out requirements,” it would raise the amount to nearly $1.4 billion.
The federal agency states in the prospectus that a “30-year, present value cost analysis” of the total for refurbishing the Reagan Building would be $1.6 billion; construction for a new headquarters would cost $2.4 billion.
Ivey said the administration may want to save money “on some things,” but he also noted the estimated $300 million price tag to construct a White House ballroom and a proposal to give $40 billion in aid to Argentina.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“They spend it when they want to spend it, but apparently those are higher priorities then having our FBI agents and law enforcement personnel safe,” Ivey said during a brief interview after the news conference.
A GSA spokesperson said in an email Thursday the agency “does not comment on ongoing litigation.”
The lawsuit names the GSA, the FBI and the Justice Department as defendants, along with FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi.
Maryland officials at Thursday’s event pointed out that Trump announced his intent to block the Greenbelt site earlier this year, when he said in a Justice Department speech that he didn’t want to relocate the FBI to Maryland “three hours away” from the current site on Pennsylvania Avenue in downtown D.C. The Hoover Building is actually about 16 miles from the Greenbelt site, which is just outside the Capital Beltway.
Hoyer, who was credited with getting the FBI project to Prince George’s, said the Trump administration’s decision to keep the headquarters in D.C. is “related more to his political bias.”
“He’s decided to move it to a building totally unsuited, unplanned for, undesigned for the purposes of a major law enforcement agency,” Hoyer said. “We’re going to win this suit.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Anthony-Brown-and-Wes-Moore-11-6-2025-1024x763.jpg,,,2025-11-07 04:56:11.278042

(Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Redrawing Maryland’s congressional districts mid-decade could imperil, rather than aid, Democrats’ chances of retaking the U.S. House next year, Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) warned this week.
In addition, he cautioned, the mechanics of the state’s elections calendar leave no time for such a move.
Ferguson’s comments, made during an interview with Maryland Matters, come as Democratic states are under growing pressure to redraw their congressional maps in response to similar moves this year by Republican states, years ahead of when states normally redistrict. Both sides are looking to gain a partisan advantage ahead of the 2026 congressional elections.
The fight began when Texas, at the urging of President Donald Trump (R), redrew its congressional maps in such a way that Republicans could pick up as many as five House seats in 2026. Some other Republican states have since followed suit.
Pressure on Maryland intensified this week when California voters approved a redistricting referendum intended to add Democrats to that state’s congressional delegation, countering the GOP gains in Texas.
Some Maryland Democrats have been talking about redistricting since this summer, but Gov. Wes Moore (D) made it official this week when he announced the creation of a commission to study redistricting seven years ahead of when the process would traditionally take place.
A rising star in the Democratic Party, Moore’s move comes as party activists pressure their leaders to fight the aggressive Republican posture head-on. Protesters rallied outside the State House on Thursday, demanding that the state redraw its eight House districts — seven of which are currently held by Democrats — to give them a shot at capturing all eight seats.
Moore defends redistricting as effort to ensure fairness; Republicans prepare to go to court

The group Indivisible Maryland is planning to protest outside Ferguson’s office on Friday. Activists are eager to see Maryland ditch its current map in favor of one in which Democrats run the table.
While he acknowledged that an 8-0 map is theoretically possible, Ferguson told Maryland Matters that “you have to determine whether or not that map can also withstand the legal and constitutional challenges that are inevitable in any map. That is where the responsible analysis has to land, around what do we think the final outcome would be.”
Ferguson pointed to a 2022 ruling by Senior Judge Lynn Battaglia, who struck down a map drawn by General Assembly Democrats on grounds that it constituted a partisan gerrymander. That ruling, while not precedent-setting, nonetheless represents the most recent judicial opinion on congressional line-drawing. Lawmakers hastily approved a new map in the wake of Battaglia’s decision that led to the current 7-1 split in favor of Democrats.
“Almost every legal mind that I have spoken to through this [process], given the legal context, almost none of them believe that there is a map that could withstand legal challenge, that wouldn’t jeopardize our current map.” Ferguson added.
Rather than holding nearly all of the state’s U.S. House seats, Democrats could see their margin shrink to 6-2 or 5-3, he cautioned.
“If the [state] Supreme Court did adopt [Battaglia’s] ‘extreme partisan gerrymandering’ standard as a violation of the Declaration of Rights, the only way around that is to increase the representation on a partisan standard, and you would end up with one or two additional Republican seats,” Ferguson said.
The Senate leader laid out a second objection to mid-decade redistricting — the ripple effect it would have on primaries next year.
“At this point we’re already too late,” he said. “There is no way that the primary election schedule could maintain if [a new map] were to move forward.”
Ferguson said the state’s chief elections administrator “has expressed extreme concern about what happens with any timeline shift. Local jurisdictions have already finalized their maps for the election, so you would have to restart an entire process.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Lastly, Ferguson noted that unlike the resolution needed to redraw state legislative districts, congressional redistricting in Maryland is done by law, and laws can be petitioned to the ballot. A successful petition effort would delay implementation of the new map until after the general election.
“In a moment where we are all saying that every seat matters, we have a certainty around 7-1,” he said. “That certainty goes immediately out the window…. It subjects us to an enormous legal risk at a time when we can’t afford that.”
Ferguson acknowledged the grassroots energy behind the push to redistict, but — noting that each state has its own constitutional framework — he said “it feels like a trap to move forward in this in Maryland.”
Ferguson said he thinks that when residents learn that passage of a new map could backfire on Democrats, “almost every time … the reaction that I get is, ‘Wow,  I didn’t know that.'”
The five-member redistricting commission created by Moore will be chaired by Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), a Moore ally, and will include two other members appointed by the governor — former Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh and Cumberland Mayor Ray Morriss — as well as one member each for the Senate and the House.
House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) this week named Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles) as the House’s representative. Ferguson said that, at this point, he is likely to serve as the Senate’s representative, but that he wanted to check first with members of the Senate’s Democratic caucus before making that final.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)The deaths of six immigrants who were working on the Francis Scott Key Bridge when it collapsed. The Trump administration’s “erroneous” deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Increased enforcement by federal immigration agents looking to boost deportation numbers.
Those are just a handful of challenges and turmoil that Maryland’s immigrant communities have faced over the last two years.
But at the 40th anniversary celebration Thursday for the immigrant-advocacy group CASA, outgoing Executive Director Gustavo Torres said that immigrants have overcome pain before and they will overcome current and future challenges – even if he is no longer at the helm.
“We didn’t start here. We didn’t start as a national powerhouse,” Torres, who could not attend the event in person, said over a livestream. “We didn’t start with policy wins or national campaigns. We started with pain; we started with injustice. We started with a handful of people who said ‘enough.’”

The 40th anniversary celebration was held at CASA’s Baltimore Welcome Center, which was filled with well over 100 advocates and lawmakers.
The celebration was also largely centered around Torres’ 34 years of work with the immigration advocacy group, helping both lawfully present and undocumented immigrants get connected to resources, while pushing for better conditions in the community.
Torres started working with the organization with three people in a church basement in Montgomery County in 1991, sixyears after its founding.
Today, he said CASA has 250 staff members, with its headquarters in Prince George’s County’s Langley Park neighborhood, home to one of the D.C. area’s highest concentrations of Latinos. More than three decades after he started, Torres will be passing the torch and retiring this month.
He said he has faith that members of the immigrant community will support each other on the road ahead.
“None of this happened by accident. It happened because we organized. It happened because we refused to give up. It happened because we believe in each other,” Torres said.
“Some years pass in the blink of an eye. One day, you are holding a baby at a rally. The next day, that baby is leading the rally,” he said. “I have learned from the elders who came before me, and now I look around and realize I am one of them.
“I see the next generation, and know we are in such good hands. We have won so much, but we have also hurt. We have been scared. We have been doubted and that’s OK,” Torres said. “Because fear is not new. Pain is not new. But neither is our power. The answer to fear is strength.”
During the celebration, Gov. Wes Moore (D) praised Torres for his time with CASA.

“Gustavo is someone with a loving heart, but a fighting spirit,” Moore said at the event. “Gustavo is someone who saw potential of a small team running out of a basement in Takoma Park Presbyterian Church … Those issues from 40 years ago, they haven’t gone away.”
Later, Del. Deni Taveras (D-Prince George’s) presented Torres with a citation from Moore, who left the event early. The citation was presented for Torres’ “demonstration of high integrity and ability, meriting our great trust and respect.”
“You’ve always been able to move the needle forward, and for that I thank you,” Taveras said during a toast for Torres.
When Torres came on-screen to deliver his remarks, he reminded the crowd that “it has never been about me, it has always been about you” and issued his own toast.
“To us,” he said. “Forty years of struggle, hope and solidarity. To the friends we have lost and the ones we have yet to meet. To the young who will carry this fight when we are tired. CASA has always belonged to the people.”
He then led the crowd in a chant of “Si, se puede,” a common rallying cry in immigrant settings that translates to, “Yes, you can.”

(Photo by Natalie Behring/Getty Images)Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier filed a $354 million lawsuit Thursday against Planned Parenthood, accusing the reproductive organization of driving profits by “misleading” women into believing abortion drugs are safer than Tylenol.
Uthmeier is asking a circuit judge in Santa Rosa County to force Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest reproductive health services clinic, to pay $350 million for violating the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act and an additional $4 million for breaking Florida’s racketeering statute, he claimed in the 37-page suit.
Uthmeier even suggested that the court — if it finds it “necessary” — shut down all Planned Parenthood operations in Florida.
“Planned Parenthood and its Florida operations mislead women about the critical and undeniable risks of a chemical abortion by deceptively claiming these powerful drugs are less risky than everyday pain medication,” Uthmeier wrote. “This is no accident. Planned Parenthood profits from this deception.”

He referred to medical abortions, which involves ingesting two pills approved by the CDC through 10 weeks of pregnancy instead of undergoing an aspiration abortion. Medical abortions have accounted for roughly 68% of abortions in Florida so far this year, according to data provided by the Agency for Health Care Administration.
The Thursday lawsuit is the latest chapter in Florida’s agenda to severely restrict access to abortion. The GOP-dominated Legislature, with approval from Gov. Ron DeSantis, passed a 15-week abortion ban in 2022 that was further hamstringed by a 2023 six-week ban. That law was a top priority for the governor, who was attempting to set himself apart from Donald Trump — who’s been reticent on abortion — as he geared up for what would be a heated GOP presidential primary.
Uthmeier, who served as DeSantis’ chief of staff, also supported the administration as multiple state agencies leading up to the 2024 election urged Floridians to vote against a measure that would have enshrined abortion access in the state constitution.
Planned Parenthood didn’t immediately return a request for comment.

The lawsuit names four Planned Parenthood affiliates and claims their business is “booming,” accusing the industry of switching from mostly aspiration abortions to more medical ones because they’re “more profitable.”
Uthmeier’s case centers on Planned Parenthood’s popular line claiming that the abortion drugs are “Safer than Tylenol.” He calls this a “lie,” pointing out that there are no direct studies specifically comparing the safety of mifepristone and acetaminophen, the primary ingredient in Tylenol.
This is disputed by some medical groups like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, who joined a 2023 lawsuit arguing that the abortion pill’s safety profile is “on par” with pain killers like acetaminophen.
More than that, Uthmeier also claims that Planned Parenthood’s statement doesn’t take into account that more people use Tylenol, and that acetaminophen hospitalizations arise mostly from overdoses or misuse, he claims. He charges that Planned Parenthood’s has conspired to mislead women, violating both the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act and the Florida RICO Act.
By estimating that Planned Parenthood is responsible for roughly 35,000 medical abortions in the past two years, he asks the circuit court to impose a $10,000 fine under FDUTPA per abortion and to charge each Planned Parenthood affiliate with a $1 million civil penalty under the RICO Act.
This isn’t Tylenol’s first foray into pregnancy-related debates. In September, Health and Human Services Director Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., warned that Tylenol use during pregnancy is linked to autism. And although President Trump amplified these claims, urging pregnant women to “tough it out,” Tylenol representatives and scientists have rejected these claims.
“[Planned Parenthood] acted as an ongoing organization, formal or informal, with a common purpose of selling abortion to Florida women,” Uthmeier wrote.

A few states and cities have elections, among them Virginia, New Jersey and New York City. Here, in my home state of Connecticut, some towns have municipal elections.
Nonetheless, the tea leaves can be interpreted. 

Joseph Bentivegna MD
The main results were that New Jersey and Virginia elected Democratic governors, New York City elected a self-described socialist, a California referendum championed by Gov. Gavin Newsom allowed further gerrymandering, and Pennsylvania retained three Democratic justices for their Supreme Court.
Republican spinmeisters are writing off these results as they occurred in Democratic states. But what these spinmeisters are failing to recognize is that none of these elections were even close. Both Democratic gubernatorial candidates won by comfortable double-digit margins. 
The new socialist mayor of New York City eclipsed 50% in a three-way race after the highest turn out in decades. California approved gerrymandering by a huge 63%. Pennsylvania retained Democratic judges by over 60%. In Connecticut, Republicans got slaughtered in a massacre that would embarrass Attila the Hun.
What does this mean? Here goes:
President Donald Trump is not popular. While his presidency has accomplished a great deal – closing our borders, neutering Iran, lowering gas prices, making progress in the Mid East, bringing industry and investment to the United States etc. – he has not conquered the Big Enchilada: inflation. Housing prices and rents are out of control. The premiums for health insurance, car insurance and homeowner’s insurance continue to skyrocket.
This is the main reason for Zohran Mamdani’s mayoral victory in New York City. Young people who have never experienced the disaster of socialism are outraged because they are paying $5,000 a month to live in an ant colony while few make wages high enough to meet other daily escalating expenses comfortably.
And this is a national trend. As one young man stated in his viral video (and I paraphrase): “My grandfather and grandmother bought a house when they were my age and started having kids. I can’t even afford an apartment let alone a girlfriend.”
The Democrats are going to have a huge fight between moderates and liberals. In 2016 and 2020, moderate Democrats shafted self-proclaimed socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders by rigging the delegate rules to deny him the nomination. The result: Hillary Clinton lost in 2016, and the ineffective President Joe Biden poisoned the well enough to allow a Trump victory in 2024.
Liberal Democrats are furious and are now screaming, “It’s our turn.” And they have a point. It was liberal Democrats who organized and marched in the No Kings protest. It was liberal Democrats who had gave moderate Democrats the spine to stand up to President Trump and shut down the government. And the result? Liberal Democrats showed up in droves to create the huge Democratic victories that just occurred. 
But moderate Democrats still believe a liberal presidential nominee in 2028 is unelectable. Furthermore, most billionaires are Democrats, not Republicans, and dislike liberal socialist schemes.
California Governor Newsom is on the rise. Democrats hope to overcome the slim Republican majority and retake the House in 2026. The problem is that Democrats have gerrymandered almost all the Blue States so that they cannot steal any more seats. For example, in Deep Blue New England, President Trump won 40% of the vote but there is not a single Republican Congressman. Similar situations exist in New York, Maryland and Illinois. Presently, California is well-gerrymandered with 43 Democratic and only nine Republican seats. But with creative software, Republicans could lose four or five more seats. And Governor Newsom is successfully choreographing this.
President Obama is not going away. Most former presidents keep a low profile. Carter, Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Clinton, George W. Bush and even Joe Biden rarely make political statements. Not President Obama, mainly because his legacy can be described in two words: Donald Trump. Obama is determined to destroy President Trump’s base, and he worked like a dog to help Kamala Harris and the Democratic candidates this cycle. He will do the same in 2026 and if he doesn’t like any of the Presidential candidates in 2028, he may entice his wife Michelle to run.
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court will allow the liberal interpretation of ballot harvesting rules. Philadelphia Democrats harvest ballots with such efficacy that even a Bridgeport alderman would blush. But it was not enough to stop the Trump tsunami in 2024. But with some more creative voting rules, this crucial swing state could go Democratic in 2028 if the Pennsylvania Supreme Court allows it.
The problem with this analysis is that it merely points out that the Democratic states are becoming more Democratic. The same phenomenon is happening in Republican states, but this election cycle did not generate enough meaningful data in this area. But the 2026 election will do so. Stay tuned.

Ned Lamont has floated a plan to use state pension assets to purchase a stake in the WNBA’s Connecticut Sun and keep it from moving to Boston. Saving a local team may be good politics, but it is bad finance that puts taxpayers at risk. 
Connecticut’s $60 billion Retirement Plans and Trust Funds exist to fund the retirement benefits promised to public workers, not to serve as a bailout vehicle for a professional sports franchise or to promote Connecticut’s economic development.
Lamont’s efforts to keep the Connecticut Sun in the state come as a Boston-based private equity group led by Celtics minority owner Steve Pagliuca reached a $325 million deal to buy the team and relocate it to Boston in 2027, pending league approval.
Connecticut’s state and local governments have recently made an impressive fiscal recovery after decades of budget neglect. The adoption of spending guardrails and mechanisms that enabled surplus pension contributions has stabilized finances, reduced bonded debt, improved pension funding, and led to credit rating upgrades. But recent fiscal improvements are no excuse for pursuing pension investments for political symbolism rather than financial merit.
The job is unfinished: Connecticut still ranks second in the nation in terms of per-capita public employee debt (which includes unfunded pension and retiree healthcare liabilities). Furthermore, the state’s pension trust—which calculates contributions presuming a 7% annual return—has earned an average return of just 5.7% over the past 24 years (2001-2024), while the S&P 500 returned 10.6% over the same period, according to the Reason Foundation’s 2025 annual pension solvency and performance report.
If the goal of this investment in the Connecticut Sun were to maximize returns, it wouldn’t have been paraded in such a manner. A financially motivated investment is one where Connecticut’s pension funds would be comfortable selling at any time deemed advantageous; it is one where the state feels comfortable advocating for management decisions that benefit the team the most—which could very well mean moving out of Connecticut.
In fact, politically motivated investment harms not only the state’s pension plans, but also the Connecticut Sun itself. The team would be better off with investors who are genuinely interested in its success, rather than ones whose primary goal is merely to retain the team in a particular geographical location, even if that is not conducive to the team’s ability to compete and win.
Sports teams can be great investments if managed correctly, but the upside comes with a delicate bundle of risks. Professional sports franchises are relatively illiquid, with valuations that fluctuate depending on revenue trends, media rights, and local market conditions. Future exit prospects are also limited, because—unlike an investment in a publicly traded company—only so many people/institutions are willing and able to buy a sports team.
If the Connecticut Sun turns out to be a bad investment for the state’s pension plan, public employees in the plan will likely not bear the harm: they are still guaranteed their benefits regardless of investment outcomes or cost increases. The risk instead falls on taxpayers, who must cover any funding gap in the pension fund through higher property, income, and sales taxes.
Connecticut’s pension funds are fiduciary funds established to fund retirement obligations while avoiding unnecessary risk—not a piggy bank for pet projects. Any sports investments, like all other pension fund investments, must be evaluated on a single criterion: maximizing risk-adjusted returns for beneficiaries and taxpayers.

Photo by Bryan P. Sears.A former Maryland Department of Health police captain has pleaded guilty to two counts of misconduct in office, after prosecutors said she attended university classes during her shifts.
Capt. Astarte Hunt, who started at the police department in 2016 and mainly worked at the Spring Grove Hospital in Catonsville, admitted in a guilty plea Wednesday that she repeatedly attended courses at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County during her shifts this spring, without approval from a supervisor.
Hunt also admitted in her plea that she used a state-issued vehicle to travel to her classes, and for other personal reasons, though she was prohibited from doing so.
“Law enforcement officers are entrusted with upholding the law and maintaining public confidence and trust,” read a statement from Maryland State Prosecutor Charlton T. Howard III. “When that trust is violated through misconduct or misuse of public resources, it undermines the integrity of the entire system. Our office will continue our efforts to hold all public officials who abuse their authority accountable for their actions.”
Baltimore County Circuit Judge Garret P. Glennon Jr. accepted the guilty plea Wednesday. A sentencing hearing for Hunt has been scheduled for Dec. 18.
In the guilty plea, Hunt acknowledged that she signed up for two classes at UMBC on Tuesdays and Thursdays during the spring 2025 semester that conflicted with her scheduled work shift. She attended the courses throughout the semester, but submitted timesheets reflecting that she was working at the hospital.
Hunt enrolled at the university in 2019 and graduated in May, according to the court document.
In addition to the false timesheets, Hunt also submitted false mileage logs for her state vehicle, according to the guilty plea.
Besides using the state-owned vehicle to commute to and from classes during her shifts, Hunt also used the vehicle after work hours and on weekends throughout April 2025 and most of May, and drove the vehicle home after every shift.
In March 2023, officials reprimanded Hunt after she was involved in a car crash in her state vehicle while off-duty. Hunt was “reminded that she could not use a State-owned vehicle for personal reasons, including taking the vehicle to [her] residence,” according to the guilty plea.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0391-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-07 01:56:57.574515

The leaders of two of the unions, the Laborers and Operating Engineers, confirmed the decision to disaffiliate with the AFL-CIO but declined comment on what led to the challenge and the split. The leader of the third, Pipefitters Local 777, could not be reached. 
Keith R. Brothers, the leader of the Connecticut Laborers District Council, said his union formally disaffiliated on Oct. 1, a month after a slate opposing Hawthorne and other top leaders dropped their challenge. The slate was led by Joelyn Leon, who was the AFL-CIO’s political director until recently, and included Brothers.
Brothers also is the president of the State Buildings Trade Council and was general vice president of the AFL-CIO. The Building Trades Council will remain affiliated with the AFL-CIO, but Brothers and an Operating Engineers official, Tiana Ocasio, will be replaced Friday as AFL-CIO officers.
What the changes mean for the labor movement and how it was playing at a two-day AFL-CIO convention was unclear. Hawthorne declined an interview request, and the convention, where he is expected to be reelected before adjournment Friday, was closed to the press. 
But he suggested in an emailed statement that differences were inevitable within such a large, diverse federation.
“The Connecticut labor movement has a vast and diverse membership — from nurses and teachers to bus drivers and machinists to fire fighters and construction workers,” Hawthorne said. “While we may not always agree on every issue, every union in our state remains committed to fighting for workers’ rights and advancing policies that improve the lives of working people. And we understand that every union must also make the choices they feel are best for their members.”
Tensions within the AFL-CIO are not new. The building trades nearly bolted four years ago, complaining that the federation dominated by public-sector unions was not always supportive of its issues. 
One of the issues then was a belief they were not adequately supported as they lobbied for Gov. Ned Lamont’s unsuccessful effort to return tolls to pay for infrastructure projects that produce construction jobs. The industry and the trade unions spent $1.5 million lobbying for the tolls.

The building trades have maintained cordial relations with Lamont, whose administration has agreed to project-labor agreements on major projects and backed the expansion of the State Pier in New London, which has been important to off-shore wind projects and their union jobs.
Hawthorne’s relationship with the Democratic governor, who is about to launch a campaign for a third term, has been fraught at times. He blistered Lamont after the governor vetoed an AFL-CIO priority: a bill that would have provided jobless benefits to strikers.
“Gov. Lamont has failed to hear the voices of thousands of working people who urged him to stand with striking workers,” Hawthorne said then. “The governor had a choice — stand with corporate CEOs or stand with working people. Unfortunately, he chose corporate CEOs.”
One of the unions that backed Hawthorne against the challenge slate was SEIU 1199, whose president, Rob Baril, also has been among the more aggressive union critics of Lamont over his opposition to a more progressive tax code and greater state spending.
Baril confirmed he backed Hawthorne but downplayed its significance in ending the challenge. “I think reports of my importance in Ed’s retaining leadership are greatly exaggerated,” he said.
Baril is a member of the Connecticut AFL-CIO executive board, but he was on union business out of state and not attending the AFL-CIO convention. He said he had no insights on what was driving the departures. 
“I haven’t been following closely who’s left and who hasn’t, and I don’t really have a strong opinion on it,” he said.
Baril’s parent union, the Service Employees International, has its own rocky history with the national AFL-CIO. It left the federation in 2005 and became part of a short-lived Change to Win coalition that promised to be more aggressive than the AFL-CIO in organizing new members. SEIU later returned to the fold.
Hawthorne comes from the public sector: He was an AFSCME official and lawyer at the state Department of Labor when he won his first term, running on a slate with Shellye Davis, an AFT official who represented paraprofessionals in the Hartford schools.
Sen. Julie Kushner, D-Danbury, a retired UAW executive who is co-chair of the legislature’ Labor and Public Employees Committee, predicted that the building trades will remain an important voice on labor issues, even if they are outside the AFL-CIO.
Daniel McInerney, the president of the Fairfield County Building Trades, was expected to take Brothers’ seat in the AFL-CIO leadership, leaving the trades with a voice inside the federation.
In his statement, Hawthorne expressed optimism that the unions still will work for common goals.
“We all understand the moment we’re in and the enormous challenges we all face,” Hawthorne said. “To build a strong labor movement to meet this moment means we have to find a way to work together. I’m hopeful we will be able to do that.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_8489.jpg,,,2025-11-06 23:16:41.524509

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)U.S. Senate candidate Nathan Sage said Thursday that after holding town halls in all of Iowa’s 99 counties, his biggest takeaway was that Iowans are looking for a “fighter” and a “listener” to represent them in Congress.
The Indianola Democrat said his party’s victories across the country in this week’s elections show his campaign is in a strong position.
Sage finished his “99 Counties In 99 Days For The 99%” tour with an event at the Wesley on Grand senior living community in Des Moines. It’s an accomplishment many candidates running for U.S. Senate and statewide offices in Iowa work toward each year as a tradition started by longtime Republican U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley.
The Senate race looks different from when Sage, a military veteran and former Knoxville chamber of commerce executive director, announced his candidacy in May. When he launched his campaign, U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst was expected to become the Republican nominee for the seat as an incumbent. Ernst has since said she will not run for reelection, and U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson quickly became the GOP frontrunner in the race.
There are two other Democratic candidates running for the Senate seat, state Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville and Rep. Josh Turek, D-Council Bluffs. Des Moines School Board chair Jackie Norris and state Rep. J.D. Scholten, D-Sioux City, were also running for the Democratic nomination, but have ended their campaigns.
Speaking with reporters, Sage asked, “How many people thought that I’d still be here?” as he completed the 99-county tour. He said the amount of support his campaign has received in recent months shows the popularity of his campaign’s message on issues like raising the minimum wage, making health care more affordable and supporting programs to help people in need like Medicaid and SNAP.
“Obviously we’re connecting with people,” Sage said. “Obviously, what we’re seeing with the most recent elections, across the board, is people care about affordability. People want someone to listen to them. That’s my forte. That’s what I’m trying to do. So I think for me, I’m going to keep controlling what I can control, fighting the way that I know how to fight. And then we’ll see what happens in June, and then we’ll see what happens in November.”
Sage said he wanted to bring working class people “back to the Democratic Party.” He pointed to Democrat Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York City mayoral race as a sign that voters want politicians who will “shut up and listen,” and interact with voters to learn more about what their top issues are.
“So many people feel like they haven’t been listened to,” Sage said. “So many people feel like there’s somebody that’s just going to talk down to them or say, ‘This is what you need in your life.’ Well, who better (to) know what we need in our life, than the people that are going through the struggle? And so I think the thing I took away from that is, Mamdani … listened to people. That’s what we need, is people to listen to us.”
At the event, Sage’s campaign collected food donations for the Food Bank of Iowa in Des Moines to help support people who have had Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits cut short during the federal government shutdown. While the federal government has moved to partially fund SNAP during the shutdown, the timeline for when partial payments will be distributed is still not clear. A court order to fully fund SNAP payments for November was immediately appealed on Thursday.
Sage said he was “angry” about SNAP benefits being used as a political tool by Republicans and the Trump administration during the shutdown when it means many Americans going without food. But he said as a person who grew up in a family using food stamps, he believed larger changes — like an increase to the federal minimum wage — are needed to help address food insecurity.
He also said he supports Senate Democrats in the shutdown negotiations, saying he was glad Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer “finally showed a spine, decided to stand up and fight for something” in their effort to extend Affordable Care Act enhanced tax credits.
“If he’s not willing to fight, we wouldn’t be able to extend the ACA tax credits,” Sage said. “And that’s what we need more than anything, because everybody’s health care premium here will double if that doesn’t happen.”
Sage’s opponents, Wahls and Turek, outraised the candidate in the most recent Federal Election Committee reporting period. Sage ended the period from July 1 through Sept. 30 having raised $410,501, with an election cycle total of $1.12 million. Sage said coming into the race as an outsider, he was happy with the fundraising pace his campaign has maintained.
“I’m a no-name politician who’s never done this before — the fact that I’ve raised $1.1 million — the fact that we have 26,000 unique contributions is amazing to me. You have told me that a year ago, I laughed in your face. … We’re going to keep we’re grinding away. We’re going to do what working class people do, and we’re going to outwork and out-hustle everybody.”

Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan (Alaska Beacon file photos)Alaska’s two U.S. senators split on a vote that would have allowed the U.S. Senate to take up a resolution that sought to prevent President Donald Trump from unilaterally ordering the bombing of Venezuela. 
Fifty votes were needed in the Senate to take up the resolution, but only 49 senators — all the Senate’s Democrats, plus Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rand Paul of Kentucky — voted in favor of the procedural action needed to force a vote.
Sen. Dan Sullivan joined a majority of Senate Republicans and voted against taking up the resolution, which was sponsored by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia.
Thursday’s vote, and the split decision by Alaska’s senators, was similar to a vote that took place last month, when the Senate declined to consider a resolution intended to curtail America’s killing of suspected drug dealers without trial.
Since September, the United States has killed 67 people aboard boats in both the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, according to tallies kept by the New York Times and CNN. There have been 16 known military strikes since Sept. 2, each targeting a boat that the U.S. government claims was carrying drugs. 
It is illegal for the U.S. military to intentionally kill civilians who are not actively taking part in hostilities against the United States.
In October, Murkowski joined Paul and all but one of the Senate’s Democrats in voting to take up a resolution intended to curtail the strikes. Sullivan joined the rest of the Senate’s Republicans, and Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pennsylvania, in voting to support the strikes.
Since that vote, Trump has said that he has authorized covert CIA operations in Venezuela and is considering military strikes against the country, which is governed by dictator Nicolás Maduro. 
The U.S. military has positioned large numbers of soldiers and aircraft near Venezuela’s coastline, possibly in preparation for attack.
In a statement after Thursday’s vote, Murkowski said she has “been briefed multiple times and reviewed classified documents that provide insight into the administration’s factual justification” for attacking Venezuela.
“Even with this additional context, I do not believe their case has met the standard of clarity and rigor that Congress needs to fully evaluate the legality and scope of these operations,” she said.
Devyn Shea, a spokesperson for Dan Sullivan, said by email after the vote, “In both Democrat and Republican administrations, Senator Sullivan has consistently voted against limiting the authority of the President as Commander-in-Chief to protect the national security interests of the country.”
Sullivan “believes that under Article II of the Constitution, President Trump as Commander-in-Chief has the authority to defend our homeland from Venezuelan narcoterrorists, just as President George H.W. Bush did when he ordered the full military invasion of Panama in 1989 to remove the drug-trafficking dictator Manuel Noriega,” Shea said.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Copy-of-Candidate-Side-by-Side-2-4-1024x576.png,,,2025-11-06 21:56:12.039883
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-07 02:15:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Federal judge orders Trump administration to fully fund SNAP in November,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/06/judge-orders-snap-payments-trump/,The ruling by U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell Jr. gave President Donald Trump's administration until Friday to make SNAP payments.,"A federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the Trump administration Thursday to find the money to fully fund SNAP benefits for November, a decision that the administration promptly appealed.
The ruling by U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell Jr. gave President Donald Trump’s administration until Friday to make the payments through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, though it’s unlikely the 42 million Americans — about 1 in 8, most of them in poverty — will see the money on the debit cards they use for groceries nearly that quickly.
The order was in response to a challenge from cities and nonprofits complaining that the administration was only offering to cover 65% of the maximum benefit, a decision that would have left some recipients getting nothing for this month.
“The defendants failed to consider the practical consequences associated with this decision to only partially fund SNAP,” McConnell said in a ruling from the bench after a brief hearing. “They knew that there would be a long delay in paying partial SNAP payments and failed to consider the harms individuals who rely on those benefits would suffer.”
McConnell was one of two judges who ruled last week that the administration could not skip November’s benefits entirely because of the federal shutdown.
Shortly after the judges’ rulings, lawyers for the Trump administration filed a motion to appeal, contesting both Thursday’s decision and the earlier one last Saturday that ordered the federal government to use emergency reserves to fund the food program throughout November.
Vice President JD Vance told reporters the ruling was “absurd.”
“What we’d like to do is for the Democrats to open up the government of course, then we can fund SNAP,” Vance said at an unrelated White House event. “But in the midst of a shutdown, we can’t have a federal court telling the president how he has to triage the situation.”
The Trump administration chose partial payments this week
Last month, the administration said that it would halt SNAP payments for November if the government shutdown wasn’t resolved.
A coalition of cities and nonprofits sued in federal court in Rhode Island, and Democratic state officials from across the country did so in Massachusetts.
The judges in both cases ordered the government to use one emergency reserve fund containing more than $4.6 billion to pay for SNAP for November but gave it leeway to tap other money to make the full payments, which cost between $8.5 billion and $9 billion each month.
On Monday, the administration said it would not use additional money, saying it was up to Congress to appropriate the funds for the program and that the other money was needed to shore up other child hunger programs.
The partial funding brought on complications
McConnell harshly criticized the Trump administration for making that choice.
“Without SNAP funding for the month of November, 16 million children are immediately at risk of going hungry,” he said. “This should never happen in America. In fact, it’s likely that SNAP recipients are hungry as we sit here.”
Tyler Becker, the attorney for the government, unsuccessfully argued that the Trump administration had followed the court’s order in issuing the partial payments. “This all comes down to Congress not having appropriated funds because of the government shutdown,” he said.
Kristin Bateman, a lawyer for the coalition of cities and nonprofit organizations, told the judge the administration had other reasons for not fully funding the benefits.
“What defendants are really trying to do is to leverage people’s hunger to gain partisan political advantage in the shutdown fight,” Bateman told the court.
McConnell said last week’s order required that those payments be made “expeditiously” and “efficiently” — and by Wednesday — or a full payment would be required. “Nothing was done consistent with the court’s order to clear the way to expeditiously resolve it,” McConnell said.
There were other twists and turns this week
The administration said in a court filing on Monday that it could take weeks or even months for some states to make calculations and system changes to load the debit cards used in the SNAP program. At the time, it said it would fund 50% of the maximum benefits.
The next day, Trump appeared to threaten not to pay the benefits at all unless Democrats in Congress agreed to reopen the government. His press secretary later said that the partial benefits were being paid for November — and that it is future payments that are at risk if the shutdown continues.
And Wednesday night, it recalculated, telling states that there was enough money to pay for 65% of the maximum benefits.
Under a decades-old formula in federal regulations, everyone who received less than the maximum benefit would get a larger percentage reduction. Some families would have received nothing and some single people and two-person households could have gotten as little as $16.
Carmel Scaife, a former day care owner in Milwaukee who hasn’t been able to work since receiving multiple severe injuries in a car accident seven years ago, said she normally receives $130 a month from SNAP. She said that despite bargain hunting, that is not nearly enough for a month’s worth of groceries.
Scaife, 56, said that any cuts to her benefit will mean she will need to further tap her Social Security income for groceries. “That’ll take away from the bills that I pay,” she said. “But that’s the only way I can survive.”
The next legal step is unclear
This type of order is usually not subject to an appeal, but the Trump administration has challenged other rulings like it before.
An organization whose lawyers filed the challenge signaled it would continue the battle if needed.
“We shouldn’t have to force the President to care for his citizens,” Democracy Forward President and CEO Skye Perryman said in a statement, “but we will do whatever is necessary to protect people and communities.”
It often takes SNAP benefits a week or more to be loaded onto debit cards once states initiate the process.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1105_SR_SNAPFoodPantries_070-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-06 21:56:12.039883

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)AMES — Iowa State University presidential hopeful David Cook said Thursday that when he arrived on campus the previous day, he was “feeling awesome about Iowa State.” Less than 24 hours later, during his presentation to ISU students, faculty, staff, alumni and community members, Cook said he had learned many new things and felt even better.
Cook, president of North Dakota State University and an Iowa State University alum, came back to Ames for interviews and a public forum as he vies for the university presidency. He was the second candidate this week to present his case to the ISU community, with Cornell University agriculture college dean Benjamin Houlton having participated in his own forum Wednesday.
Two other finalists dropped out before the campus visits were scheduled and their names were not disclosed.
As an Ames native and ISU graduate, Cook said it’s been wonderful to be back. Like Houlton, Cook said ISU is doing amazing things in its capacity as a land-grant institution and as a driver of education, research and outreach. When looking at ISU graduation rates and growing enrollment, Cook said “there’s a lot of good there.”

“My plan isn’t to come in here and reinvent the wheel, it’s to come in here and build on President (Wendy) Wintersteen’s incredible legacy and foundation to make anything I can do maybe a little bit better,” Cook said.
Wintersteen will retire from ISU in January after making the announcement earlier this year.
Building strong relationships, both within and outside of the institution, is “critical” to ensuring ISU thrives, Cook said. Also essential is expanding work into sectors like artificial intelligence and rural health care, he said, with the foundations the university has already built through its existing AI programs and humanities and the ISU extension and outreach service.
Cook said connecting with people and forming partnerships — from his own executive team and the leadership, faculty, staff and students at ISU to business owners, industry leaders and lawmakers at the state and federal level, as well as other universities — will help the university break into new areas of research and education, generate interest and elevate ISU’s work.
At North Dakota State, Cook said, he interacts with students often through events and just being there to welcome them onto campus. He also travels around the state during field days to connect with communities directly, from farmers to business owners to local politicians. If he hadn’t had this forum, Cook added he would have been in Washington, D.C., this whole week to speak with his delegation about the issues his college is facing and what could be done on a national level to help them.
“We’re going to do more together, and we’re going to be better together,” Cook said. “I believe that with all of my heart.”
Students lead questions of Cook’s career
Students dominated the Q&A portion of the forum, asking Cook about his prior experiences making decisions and responding to issues that affect students.
Multiple questions focused on past decisions made by Cook while starting at North Dakota State, namely cutting 80 positions and eliminating or merging nearly 30 academic programs, which his curriculum vitae stated brought down operating expenses by $24 million.
Cook assured the audience that there are stark differences between North Dakota State’s situation when he first became president and ISU’s situation now — Cook’s current university had been on a decade-long enrollment decline when he got the job, he said, and had reached a budget deficit of more than $7 million.
“I got to tell you, we’re really starting to turn the ship around because we did some tough things there,” Cook said. “But I just want to emphasize again, that is absolutely not at all what I see happening here.”
When cutting programs, Cook said the university worked with an outside firm to get data on which degrees were “high-cost, low-enrollment programs,” but it was still a tough situation where he had to move faster than he would have preferred. Part of the job is continuously scrutinizing programs and looking for what opportunities may be out there, he said.
Cook had similar responses to questions from students about how he would connect with and support different student groups, from international students to those involved in Greek life. He said he would seek to listen to them and best understand the issues they’re dealing with.
When discussing topics like mental health and food insecurity during the Q&A, Cook said finding funding to support programs that students want and need would be a priority, whether that’s through making mental health a legislative priority like he did at North Dakota State or speaking with alumni about food insecurity among students and fundraising from there.
Other questions focused on faculty, namely their academic and individual freedoms. Weston Abney, ISU record analyst and president of the union representing university clerical workers, repeated his question about terminated ISU employee Caitlyn Spencer from the previous forum. ISU presidential search committee co-chair and Faculty Senate President Meghan Gillette again reworded the question to ask about Cook’s relationship with his board of regents.
Cook said he has references from members of state higher education governing bodies he’s worked with in the past, and while he said he didn’t know the details of the case Abney referenced, every situation is different and making tough decisions is part of the job.
“My boss would be, you know, the board of regents, so I’m going to work with them closely on tackling and managing difficult conversations,” Cook said.
Ginny Otto, an undergraduate student studying materials engineering at ISU, told Cook during the forum she and her peers have felt that instructors are afraid to discuss certain topics as a result of administrative decisions and policies at the state and federal level. Her question to Cook was about how he would try to alleviate these concerns, and Gillette added a query into his thoughts on academic freedom.
Cook said he supports faculty’s role in the classroom and understands “it’s their job to teach topics that are germane and relevant to the subject matter at hand,” which he said he supports. He also supports academic freedom and believes that faculty should have the right to research what they want “that’s relevant.”
“I know that this is a big topic that’s challenging right now, but it’s something I believe in wholeheartedly,” Cook said. “But again, some of these things really depend on the specific situation.”
With both finalists having completed their on-campus interviews and forums, the Iowa Board of Regents will interview them and get feedback from members of the presidential search committee, Nov. 11. An announcement of ISU’s new president is expected to come the same day.

Governor Mike Dunleavy and others have proposed that we should welcome new industries that seek to capture and store carbon away from the atmosphere, including marine carbon dioxide removal, to boost our economy and reduce the impacts of climate change. This sounds like a win-win for Alaska, but there are many complexities and most Alaskans have never even heard about this issue.
The idea behind marine carbon dioxide removal, also known as mCDR, is to increase the ability of the ocean to take up carbon dioxide. The ocean already absorbs carbon dioxide whenever the concentration is higher in the atmosphere than the water. Various mCDR proposals include adding minerals to the ocean to shift its chemistry so that more carbon dioxide can dissolve into seawater, adding nutrients such as iron to promote carbon uptake by algae or growing kelp and then sinking it into the deep sea. These proposals seek to test whether it’s feasible to build a new trillion-dollar global industry to sell carbon credits to governments or companies based on sequestering carbon in the ocean.
Alaska’s unique oceanography and geography provide an ideal location for many types of mCDR  strategies. On the other hand, our marine ecosystems provide the basis of a multi-billion dollar fishing industry and are priceless in terms of supporting Alaskan ways of life. Any industry that could have a substantial impact on ocean ecosystems should be examined carefully.
The time is running short for communities to learn about mCDR and be adequately consulted before these technologies are implemented in Alaskan waters.  The federal government is currently investing millions of dollars in mCDR research and congress is considering new legislation to support further research. Simultaneously, some privately-funded groups, such as Exploring Ocean Iron Solutions, are exploring plans to test the mCDR strategy of adding iron to stimulate carbon uptake in the Northeast Pacific in the next few years.
We invite our fellow Alaskans to join us for community conversations to learn more about the various strategies for mCDR and to provide perspectives on this new proposed industry in our waters. Through the Community Leaders and mCDR project, known as the CLaM project, we plan to hold round-table events in Cordova and Kodiak this December, as well as a discussion at the Alaska Forum on the Environment in Anchorage in February. We hope that these conversations will give coastal communities, whose lives and livelihoods are dependent on marine ecosystems, a greater voice in shaping the trajectory of mCDR research and industry development in our state.
We owe it to present and future generations of Alaskans to carefully consider what path to take on mCDR, understanding that whatever path we choose is likely to have a big impact on our economy and ecosystems.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DSC09645-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-06 20:57:31.981555

(Photo courtesy of Louisiana Sea Grant)The Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Commission has taken early steps to adjust a buffer zone that would allow commercial menhaden fishing closer to the state’s coastline, reigniting the industry’s fight with sports fishermen and charter boat captains.  
The policy, which still has months to go in the approval process, would shrink a half-mile zone, inside which menhaden cannot be harvested, down to a quarter-mile along much of Louisiana’s coast. The buffer would be expanded in certain select areas, but the large portions moved closer to shore would appease menhaden industry members who have complained their catch has been hurt since the buffer was put in place a year ago.
Menhaden, also known as pogies, are a small, bony fish used in pet foods, fish oil supplements and fertilizers. The Gulf of Mexico’s waters off Louisiana’s coasts are prime commercial harvesting grounds for menhaden, which are a primary food source for popular gamefish such as redfish and speckled trout. 
Other states along the Gulf Coast, where beaches draw more tourists, have far larger buffer zones for menhaden fishing. That, along with more plentiful stock off the Louisiana coast, has led to the increased tensions here.

Recreational anglers, who are largely interested in larger gamefish that feed on the smaller menhaden, say the pogy boats’ wide nets and vacuum devices ensnare reds and specks, and that their excluder devices fatally injure fish that manage to escape. Commercial harvesters say the sport fishers remove far more gamefish from the Gulf than they do. Hundreds showed for a standing room-only commission meeting Thursday when commissioners heard three hours of public testimony for and against the buffer zone change. 
The commission’s 4-3 vote, with chairman Kevin Sagrera breaking the tie, comes about a year after both sides reached a compromise to establish the half-mile buffer zone. 
The commission put that policy in place after two mass menhaden kills left tons of dead fish on Louisiana shores.
The Wildlife and Fisheries Commission was moving toward a 1-mile buffer zone until Gov. Jeff Landry interceded and led both sides to a half-mile compromise.  
There was standing room-only at a Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Commission meeting Thursday, Nov. 6, 2025, when a proposal to shrink the buffer zone for commercial menhaden fishing was debated. (Photo by Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)
Charlie Caplinger, CEO of the Coastal Conservation Association of Louisiana, opposes the buffer zone adjustment. He told the commission the change scraps the compromise from a year ago in favor of restrictions that favor commercial menhaden harvesters.  
“You are giving this industry a billion fish a year, and the message here today is: ‘That’s not enough,’” Caplinger said. 
Travis Harvey of Port Sulphur said he represented fishermen and other members of the lower Plaquemines Parish community who depend on menhaden harvesting and processing for their livelihoods. He likened the situation to the demise of the steel and coal industries in other parts of the country. 
“You all are trying to close our mill, our mine,” Harvey said to recreational fishing advocates. “We’re not asking for extra. We’re just asking what we’ve had for 75 years.”

Both sides had their own takes on the findings of a recent bycatch study that examined what pogy boats bring up from Gulf waters. Bycatch is a term for fish caught up in nets that are not part of the intended harvest of a commercial fishing boat.
One of the study’s authors, Scott Raborn with the environmental research firm LGL, said he did not believe there would be a dramatic increase in redfish bycatch if the buffer zone is reduced to a half-mile. He said his research determined water depth, and not distance from the shore, was the bigger factor in increased bycatch.      
“The predators are going to go where the prey are. Wherever the menhaden go, that’s where the redfish will be,” Raborn said.
Sport fishermen said pogy boats working closer to the shore would invariably catch more gamefish, with some suggesting the industry adapt and fish at greater depths.  
State Rep. Joe Orgeron, R-Cut Off, testified against the buffer zone change. He told commissioners that Menhaden are pelagic fish. 
“Do you know what ‘pelagic’ means? Deep water,” he said. “The industry needs to adjust its equipment to find menhaden in deeper water.”
Francois Kuttel owns and leads Westbank Fishing, one of the main menhaden fleets working off the Louisiana coast. He said it’s wrong to assume his vessels can simply move further offshore to make up for the catch it loses to the buffer zone.  
The next step for the proposed changes is a 35-day public comment period once the state provides public notice. That period will span from Dec. 19 to Jan. 23. The Wildlife and Fisheries Commission will then consider the feedback and decide whether it wants to adjust, scrap or forward its proposal.
After that, the Natural Resources committees of the Louisiana Legislature could decide to review the proposal and either halt or advance it. Without any action from lawmakers, the new buffer zones could go into effect as soon as March 20.
Proposed buffer zone changes

From 1/2 mile to 1/4 mile from the Cameron Jetties to Rutherford Beach; Mermentau River to Rollover; Point Au Fer to Bayou Grand Caillou; and Bay Long to Southwest Pass.

(Peter Hall/Capital-Star)A compromise that sacrifices Pennsylvania’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) to end the commonwealth’s four-month budget stalemate would be shortsighted and harmful, environmental and clean energy advocates say.
Gov. Josh Shapiro and lawmakers negotiating a spending plan are tight-lipped about what is and isn’t on the table. But Republicans, who control the state Senate and have rejected Democratic budget proposals, have staunchly opposed the carbon reduction program.
Now, environmentalists claim, Senate Republicans are refusing to act on a budget as schools and social programs desperately wait for state funding until Shapiro and Democratic lawmakers agree to repeal the regulations entering Pennsylvania into RGGI.
“As the governor himself has often said, this is a false choice between a healthy environment and our economy, and now our environmental champions in Harrisburg, many of whom are standing behind me today, must resist,” Molly Parzens, executive director of Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, said at a news conference Thursday.

A spokesperson for Shapiro said Thursday his office would not comment on budget negotiations. Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman’s (R-Indiana) office did not respond to a request for comment.
RGGI aims to reduce climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by requiring the companies that own them to invest in clean energy projects. The multi-state program has been in place in about a dozen mid-Atlantic and northeastern states for more than a decade. 
It has cut carbon emissions from power plants in half by placing an enforceable declining cap on the amount of climate pollution that fossil fuel power plants are allowed to emit. Participating states have seen more than $9 billion in investments and it’s projected that consumers will save $20 billion in energy costs as a result. 
 Former Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf entered Pennsylvania into the program in 2019 by executive order. Republicans, who controlled both chambers of the General Assembly at the time, argued it infringed on their legislative authority and argued it amounts to an illegal tax on energy. 
The state Supreme Court heard arguments last May from the Shapiro administration that controlling carbon emissions is within the state Department of Environmental Protection’s broad authority to control air pollution. Lawyers for Senate Republicans said the regulations encroach into policy decisions about the state’s energy economy that are the domain of lawmakers, not the executive branch.
A decision in the case could come at any time.

Robert Routh, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said at the news conference in Philadelphia that withdrawing from RGGI before the court’s decision would be shortsighted, as the decision will not abrogate the administration’s ability to regulate emissions.
“Regardless of how the court rules, the Supreme Court decision will affect how Pennsylvania can design rules to control climate pollution under the Air Pollution Control Act, not whether the state can do so,” Routh said. 
“And there is, of course, the possibility that the court finds in favor of RGGI, upholds the constitutionality of the rule as currently designed, and delivers a massive victory for Pennsylvanians that will lower costs, cut pollution and create jobs,” Routh said. “I urge people to recognize that giving away this possibility at the goal line would be a costly mistake.”
On the 100th day of the impasse last month, House Minority Leader Jesse Topper (R-Bedford) told reporters that budget discussions were outside the realm of economic reality in Pennsylvania. GOP lawmakers have objected to Shapiro’s proposal to spend down the state’s budget surplus and dip into its $7 billion rainy day fund, arguing that doing so ignores a structural deficit.
To avoid that, the state needs sustained economic growth, and Topper argued the way to achieve that is by unleashing Pennsylvania’s fossil fuel resources. 
“What we have underneath our feet in terms of natural resources would make any state in the union green with envy, and yet we continue to miss our opportunities,” Topper said, arguing that RGGI is the cause of instability in the state’s energy markets. 
“We have to get out of RGGI once and for all,” he said, noting House Republicans planned to file a discharge motion to force a floor vote on the Senate’s bill to repeal RGGI regulations.
The same day, House Democrats ratched up pressure on Senate GOP leaders before passing a $50.6 billion spending plan, in a response to the Senate’s flat funding proposal in July. Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D-Montgomery) told reporters that Democrats were willing to compromise on “every single issue.”
“There are 102 Democrats that would be heartbroken by almost every one of those compromises, but we will do them because government must be open and it must work,” Bradford said.
Asked whether the openness to compromise extended to the Senate RGGI bill, Bradford acknowledged two areas where his caucus would not budget. One, he said, was taxpayer funded private school tuition vouchers. 
The other: “No, we’re not getting out of RGGI without taking care of our environment, period full stop.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSC_9445-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-06 20:01:13.090657

(Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Department of Human Services delayed its plan to furlough hundreds of employees and temporarily close offices next week if the federal government shutdown does not end before then, the agency announced Thursday.
In the meantime, DHS has not yet issued federal nutrition assistance for November, the agency’s press release states. DHS staff began working on calculating recipients’ Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits under a new set of federal guidelines issued Thursday morning before a federal court order required benefits to be issued in full.
SNAP funding was expected to cease Nov. 1 before two federal court orders created leeway for the program to continue while the government shutdown continues. On Saturday, U.S. District Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. of Rhode Island ordered the U.S. Department of Agriculture to pay at least a portion of SNAP benefits to the program’s 42 million recipients nationwide.
On Thursday, McConnell ordered USDA to issue the entirety of November’s $9 billion in SNAP benefits. The ruling came after Arkansas Human Services officials took questions from lawmakers about DHS’s ability to administer SNAP.
Trump administration ordered to pay full $9B in November SNAP benefits amid shutdown

Arkansas usually receives roughly $41 million in SNAP funds per month, Secretary Janet Mann said at Thursday’s Joint Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee meeting. More than 222,000 Arkansas individuals and over 118,000 households received SNAP benefits as of Sept. 1, according to DHS.
“We are hoping for benefits to go out the door next week, but that is a day-by-day thing considering [USDA] made a change on us this morning,” Mann said.
The formula USDA initially sent to states Tuesday in response to McConnell’s Saturday order would have resulted in about a 50% cut to the maximum monthly benefits and left some households without benefits.
A Wednesday filing in McConnell’s court revealed that USDA miscalculated its adjustments to SNAP benefit payments. The agency’s new formula released Thursday reduced the cut to 35%, meaning SNAP households were expected to receive nearly two-thirds of what they typically would. Under this formula, USDA would have complied with McConnell’s order to spend the entirety of a $4.65 billion SNAP contingency fund.
A coalition of cities and nonprofit organizations sued to force the federal government to pay SNAP benefits this month. The subsequent court rulings do not apply past Nov. 30, and USDA has issued no guidance to states regarding whether or how to issue SNAP benefits in December if the government remains shut down then, Mann said. At 37 days, the shutdown is the longest in American history.
Before last week’s court orders, DHS had planned to temporarily close its offices in all 75 Arkansas counties and furlough 1,500 Division of County Operations employees starting Nov. 10. Thursday’s news release said the plan had been delayed to Nov. 22 unless the government reopens.
When asked if Thursday’s order to issue full SNAP benefits averts the planned furloughs or changes DHS’ goal of releasing benefits next week, spokesperson Gavin Lesnick said DHS needs guidance from USDA “before we determine next steps or any potential changes.”
The agency went ahead Friday with its plan to furlough 34 federally-funded employees in the Office of Payment Integrity; Division of Aging, Adult, and Behavioral Health Services; and Division of County Operations, according to Thursday’s news release.
DHS furloughed 37 employees in the Division of Provider Services and Quality Assurance on Oct. 1, and they remain furloughed as of Thursday.
The agency suspended Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Social Services Block Grant (SSBG), and Community Service Block Grant (CSBG) initiatives due to a lack of federal funding.

The Idaho DOGE Task Force – named for the federal Department of Government Efficiency that was helmed at one point by billionaire Elon Musk – briefed members of the Idaho Legislature’s powerful Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC, Thursday.
Rep. Jeff Ehlers, R-Meridian, and Sen. Todd Lakey, R-Nampa, said that the list of agencies, departments and commissions to consider combining, consolidating or eliminating was preliminary at this point. 
Ehlers said the process will likely take years, and some of the government programs on his list may never end up being cut or eliminated. In some cases, Ehlers said the only action taken may end up being ensuring that programs and personnel are adhering to their original missions set forth in Idaho law or administrative rules.

Ehlers and Lakey presented three tiered lists to JFAC members, which were labeled “low-hanging fruit,” “Legislature ideas” and “further review.” 
Under “Legislature ideas,” the list included:

Eliminating the Idaho Board of Tax Appeals.
Merging or eliminating the Idaho Commission on Libraries.
Merging or eliminating the Idaho Commission on Hispanic Affairs.
Merging or eliminating the Idaho Commission on the Arts.
Merging the Idaho Department of Finance and into the Idaho Department of Insurance.
Resizing the Idaho Department of Commerce and moving to an Idaho emphasis.
Moving wildfire responsibilities away from the Idaho Department of Lands and giving them to the Idaho Office of Emergency Management. 

Programs, commissions and departments listed on the “further review” list include:

The Idaho School for the Deaf and Blind.
Idaho Public Television. 
Serve Idaho: the Governor’s Commission on Service and Volunteerism.
Lake Pend Oreille Basin Commission.
The Idaho Women’s Commission.
The Idaho Division of Veterans Services.
The Idaho Veterans Affairs Commission.
The Idaho Medal of Honor Commission.
The Office of Species Conservation.
The Idaho Criminal Justice Commission.
The Wolf Depredation Control Board.
The Division of Career-Technical Education. 
The Idaho Professional Standards Commission, which investigates whether teachers have violated Idaho law.

Ehlers and Lakey did not discuss specifics of what or how they would cut the programs listed. 
 Potential cuts, consolidations among Idaho agencies met with some pushback by members of legislative budgeting committee

Upon reviewing the lists, Sen. Jim Woodward, R-Sagle, said, “This looks to me more like a list of what exists, versus something we have potentially identified problems with.”
Several members of JFAC thanked Ehlers and Lakey for their presentation and their effort to seek out government efficiencies and identify waste.

But the lists of agencies and programs for potential cuts was met with some skepticism and even pushback from some members of both political parties. 
“Wow! I’m pretty flabbergasted here,” Sen. Janie Ward-Engelking, D-Boise, told Ehlers and Lakey.
Rep. James Petzke, R-Meridian, said some of the commissions on the lists don’t even spend taxpayer dollars and instead rely on dedicated funding sources like fees or dues. For that reason, eliminating some of them wouldn’t help the state reduce the amount of taxpayer dollars spent, Petzke said. 
Woodward urged the Idaho DOGE Task Force to conduct more research into the programs listed for potential cuts, saying each was created for a reason. Woodward expressed concern with how broad the lists were, and encouraged Ehlers and Lakey to research why the programs were created, reach out to the directors of the programs and allow members of the public who are served by the agencies or programs to comment.

Lakey told Woodard that many of the programs are “further down the line” and the task force had not gotten into detail on all of them yet or even notified all of the directors. 
Lakey said the task force will look into the programs’ history and invite key stakeholders to talk to the task force about the programs’ needs, mission and effectiveness.
 GOP legislators proposing changes say they are concerned about state government’s growth

Ehlers, who was first elected to the Idaho Legislature in 2022, said he is concerned by the growth of many government programs.

“I liken it to a tree where if you don’t trim it, it just keeps growing and growing and growing, and that’s the point that we are at right now.”
Ehlers also stressed that no decisions have been made and cuts would have to be approved by the Idaho Legislature as a whole.
“I’ll just remind all of us whatever comes forward from the DOGE Task Force will have to go through the legislative process,” Ehlers said. “So we will all get a chance to debate this … so I think whatever comes forward will have to have majority support.”

Ehlers and Lakey brought the list of potential cuts to JFAC because JFAC is a powerful committee responsible for setting all of the budgets for every state agency and department.
Ehlers and Lakey presented the list of potential cuts two days after JFAC co-Chair Wendy Horman, R-Idaho Falls, said JFAC is about to enter a new era of budget setting where JFAC will focus less on adding to budgets and focus more on trimming budgets, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
Thursday marked the final day of three days worth of meetings JFAC conducted in Boise this week in preparation for the upcoming 2026 legislative session. 
During its three days of meetings, JFAC:

Received a state general fund budget briefing and vowed to cut spending to avoid an unconstitutional budget deficit as state revenues continue to lag behind projections. 
Heard about delays and errors in annual reports and audits that were caused by the Luma, the state’s controversial, massive business and account management system. 

Although the Idaho Legislature is not in session, JFAC conducted the budget meetings and workshops to prepare for the upcoming legislative session, which begins Jan. 12 at the state Capitol. 
The first day of the session will be highlighted by Gov. Brad Little delivering the annual State of the State address.

 Election 2025
Coloradans voted on two statewide ballot measures and a variety of local issues in the off-year election. Click here for more of Newsline’s coverage.

As of 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday, elections officials had counted a statewide total of 1,729,345 ballots, according to data released by the Colorado secretary of state’s office. That’s a slightly higher raw ballot total than had been counted at the same point in 2023 — but it represents 41.8% of the state’s 4.1 million active registered voters, a slight dip from the 43.5% turnout recorded two years ago.
Turnout will likely rise slightly in the coming days as ballots from military and overseas voters are added to the total, and as ballots are “cured” after being rejected because of signature discrepancies or other issues.
The 2025 election was the sixth off-year election held using the Colorado’s universal mail ballot system, which it adopted in 2014. As usual, the overwhelming majority of Colorado voters have opted to return their ballots through the mail or a drop box, with just over 30,000 voters — 1.7% of the total — casting a ballot in-person.

Colorado holds coordinated elections in odd-numbered years to elect candidates for certain school boards, municipal offices and other local races, often alongside one or more statewide ballot issues. They are consistently the state’s lowest-turnout elections, averaging just over 41% of active voters during the last decade, roughly half of the average turnout in midterms and presidential election years.
Older Colorado voters made up the majority of the electorate in 2025, with voters aged 55 and over accounting for over 54% of all ballot returns, compared to 15% from voters aged 18 to 34. Women were significantly more likely to vote this year, returning 910,498 ballots as compared the 809,846 returned by men.
Registered Democrats returned more ballots (521,362) than registered Republicans (443,942), but both trail behind the 741,816 ballots returned by unaffiliated voters, who make up half of all registered voters in the state.
‘Curing’ ballots
On average, about 1% to 2% of mail ballots in each election in Colorado are rejected because of a verification issue. Voters whose ballots are rejected should receive a notification from the state’s BallotTrax system or a letter from their county elections office, which will include the steps they need to take to “cure” the problem and ensure their ballot is counted.
Nov. 12 is the deadline for curing a ballot. Voters can also use the state’s Colorado BallotCure system, previously known as TXT2Cure, by visiting GoVoteColorado.gov.
“Every voter who casts a ballot can ensure it is counted, even if it was first held for an ID or signature issue,” Secretary of State Jena Griswold said in a statement. “Colorado BallotCure gives Coloradans an additional tool to fix their ballot using a computer or smartphone.”

Mohammed Rashid, who received asylum nearly a year ago, could soon be free as a judge granted him a $20,000 bond on Thursday.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Judge grants bond to Palestinian man after 15 months in detention.","After more than 15 months in detention, Mohammed Rashid, a 29-year-old Palestinian man, could soon walk free in the United States for the first time.
Rashid fled Gaza in 2019 to escape from Hamas, according to his attorneys. Later, he boarded a ship as a stowaway and arrived in Rhode Island in July 2024, where U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement took him into custody. When immigration officers interviewed Rashid, they confirmed he had a credible fear of persecution. 
Just a few months later, a judge granted him asylum status. But ICE appealed the judge’s decision, and Rashid remained detained. He was held in three different facilities across New England before being transferred to Vermont’s Northwest State Correctional Facility in Saint Albans at the end of August, where he still is.

But Judge Natalie Smith in Chelmsford Immigration Court, in Massachusetts, decided on Thursday to grant Rashid a release on bond, setting the amount at $20,000.
In a previous bond hearing at the end of September, Smith had denied bond, saying she didn’t have jurisdiction to hear the case. But recently, at the U.S. District Court in Vermont, Judge Geoffrey W. Crawford determined Rashid should be granted a second bond hearing in which the immigration judge considers only danger to the community and flight risk when deciding whether to grant Rashid bond.
On Thursday, Rashid joined the hearing virtually. His lawyers, Andy Pelcher and Emma Matters-Wood with the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project, were on the call, as well as Rashid’s uncle and Erica McMahon, an attorney with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
The government argued against Rashid’s bond request by attempting to prove that Rashid is a danger to the community and a flight risk.

McMahon said Rashid had several disciplinary reports, including for contraband and for attacking another detainee, which she argued showed he’s a danger to the community. According to McMahon, the fact that Rashid entered the U.S. as a stowaway, hiding in the trunk of a car that boarded a ship, shows that he’s a flight risk and would not comply with the orders of the court if released.
Pelcher, one of Rashid’s attorneys, said Rashid has no criminal record and the disciplinary report on contraband referred to toilet paper, while the other report related to an incident where a detainee punched Rashid and, when he was about to hit Rashid again, Rashid tried to stop him. Pelcher argued this demonstrates that Rashid is not a danger to the community, but rather, that he tries to de-escalate violent situations.
Pelcher also said that coming as a stowaway doesn’t show that Rashid is a flight risk and that he has every reason to stay in the country and defend the asylum status he obtained. Rashid also has family ties in the U.S., including an uncle who is a U.S. citizen and agreed to be his sponsor and give him employment and any necessary monetary support, Pelcher added.
Rashid, dressed in a green uniform, listened carefully as the judge talked through the arguments made by both sides before presenting her decision.
Smith agreed with Rashid’s attorneys that he doesn’t have any criminal history and the incidents that happened in detention don’t show that Rashid is dangerous, so she rejected the government’s argument that Rashid poses a danger to the community.
However, Smith acknowledged that Rashid could be a flight risk. Yet, she considered that Rashid has family ties in the U.S. and a reliable sponsor and decided to set the $20,000 bond to ameliorate the flight risk.
Hearing her words, Rashid leaned over, touching his forehead with his hand, and breathed a sigh of relief, holding back tears. He then turned to someone next to him asking if the judge said the bond was $20,000.
The hearing concluded with the government reserving the right to appeal the decision, and the judge saying the government has 30 days to do so.
DHS didn’t answer VTDigger’s questions about whether the department is planning to appeal the decision.
Pelcher said Rashid’s family plans to pay bond, and he’s expecting Rashid to be released on Friday.
“We thought that our position going in was very strong, but immigration law is really uncertain, so we were certainly nervous,” Matters-Wood said. “We are very happy. It’s been a long and emotional case.”

Notably, the Trump administration is relocating the country’s most advanced aircraft carrier from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean, joining other Navy resources currently amassed there. On Oct. 16, Trump publicly confirmed a New York Times report that he had authorized covert CIA operations in Venezuela and told reporters he was “looking at land” for possible further strikes.  Kaine, Schiff push for war powers vote“All of this together with the increased pace of strikes in the Caribbean and the Pacific suggest that we are on the verge of something that should not happen without a debate and vote in Congress before the American people,” Kaine said on the floor before the vote. Kaine and Schiff told reporters Thursday they viewed the White House Office of Legal Counsel opinion authorizing the fatal strike in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean near Venezuela. The document, which senators are allowed to read in a classified setting, “makes no effort to claim that there's a legal rationale for invading a sovereign nation, no effort to claim that it's about Venezuela, or could be used with respect to Venezuela or any country,” Kaine said.Schiff characterized the opinion as “broad enough to authorize just about anything.”Kaine urged Senate Republicans, who received a brief and review of the document earlier this week, to introduce and debate legislation authorizing the administration to continue its military force in the region.“Anybody in Congress who thinks we ought to be bombing ships in the Caribbean and Pacific, introduce an AUMF (Authorization for Use of Military Force) and have a debate and vote on it,” Kaine said, adding “but don't just abdicate this power.” Hegseth posts videoSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth posted a grainy video online Tuesday of a vessel in flames after a strike, and said the United States targeted the boat in the Eastern Pacific that had been operated by “a Designated Terrorist Organization.” “Intelligence confirmed that the vessel was involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics. The strike was conducted in international waters in the Eastern Pacific.”“No U.S. forces were harmed in the strike, and two male narco-terrorists — who were aboard the vessel — were killed,” Hegseth wrote on social media.It’s unlawful for the U.S. military to intentionally kill civilians who are not actively taking part in hostilities against the U.S. Ahead of Thursday’s vote, Sen. James Risch, R-Idaho, defended the administration’s “decisive actions to protect thousands of Americans from lethal narcotics.” “Some Democrat members and members of the media claim that President Trump does not have authority to conduct these strikes. I’ll tell you right now, that is plain wrong,” said Risch, chair of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.Risch said he and fellow Senate Republicans have sat through “hours of briefings and analysis by government legal departments and attorneys” regarding the strikes.Schiff and Kaine told reporters their access to information and briefings has been more limited.Paul criticizes Trump movesOn the Senate floor ahead of the vote, Paul compared the strikes and buildup in the Caribbean to the U.S. military’s ""misguided"" intervention in the Middle East.“We owe it to our service members to only send them into harm's way when vital American interests are at stake. Who is in charge of Venezuela does not constitute such an interest,” Paul said, alleging the strikes are about regime change in the South American nation ruled by dictator Nicolás Maduro.  “We overthrew Sadam Hussein thinking Iraq would be transformed into this great Jeffersonian democracy. Instead what occurred was an insurgency that led to some of the most brutal sectarian violence in living memory,” Paul said.Congress passed the War Powers Resolution in 1973 after the Nixon administration secretly bombed Vietnam and Cambodia, killing hundreds of thousands of people.",,,,2025-11-06 19:17:15.012510

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The Providence City Council on Thursday gave its final OK to tighten rules in order to deter local police from interacting with federal immigration officers, sending the measure to Mayor Brett Smiley, who has pledged to sign it.
Councilors unanimously gave its second approval to amend the city’s Community-Police Relations Act to clarify prohibited conduct following questions over police compliance after officers were seen at the scene of an U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) during the summer.
“At the end of day, this is building trust and more accountability as public servants,” Council Miguel Sanchez said. “We all have seen and continue to see, unfortunately, horrific actions by our federal administration when it comes to immigration enforcement.”
Providence officials want to further prohibit police cooperation with ICE

The council gave its first approval to amend the ordinance on Oct. 16 after updating a new provision that allows community organizations to challenge potential violations in court. Smiley had previously expressed the initial language could open the city up to “frivolous lawsuits.”
Councilors changed the wording to clarify that organizations may only sue the city as a whole and only for a court to uphold one’s civil rights, not for monetary damages.
The ordinance now heads to Smiley’s office, where the mayor has 10 days to sign, veto it or allow its enactment without his transmittal.
“After collaborating with Council to update their proposed amendments, Mayor Smiley will sign the Community Police Relations Act,” Anthony Vega, a spokesperson for the mayor’s office said in an email to Rhode Island Current.
Amendments to the existing policy come after a civilian oversight board found Providence police officers violated the ordinance during an ICE arrest on Alverson Avenue in July.
The new language in the ordinance would bar Providence police from complying with any federal agency’s request for assistance — such as sharing information or controlling traffic — unless they provide a criminal warrant signed by a judge.
Providence’s public schools and the municipal court are also barred from granting access to their premises “for any federal immigration authority to investigate, detain, apprehend, or arrest any individuals for potential violations of federal immigration laws,” unless there is a judicial warrant.
That provision acts somewhat of a prelude to the next action councilors like Sanchez want to take: Urging Rhode Island’s Judiciary to provide virtual court hearings amid ICE officer sightings and arrests outside the state’s courthouses.
The council on Oct. 16 passed a resolution asking the city’s Municipal Court and Probate Court begin to offer accommodations for remote hearings if requested, when possible, beginning Nov. 1.
The council’s resolution emphasized the Rhode Island Supreme Court’s 2021 order permitting courts to conduct hearings remotely at the discretion of the court or upon a party’s request during the pandemic — which certain judges still do to this day, said judiciary spokesperson Jonathan Bissonnette.
“Currently, some court calendars are held in a virtual format; for example, the Family Court’s child support calendars are held primarily virtually,” he said in an email to Rhode Island Current Thursday. “Most other matters which implicate constitutional and due process concerns are held in person.”
A decision to grant a request for a virtual hearing is within the discretion of the presiding judicial officer, Bissonnette added.

Former Tennessee House Speaker Glen Casada and his ex-chief of staff reportedly received presidential pardons Thursday, just weeks after being sentenced to prison for government corruption convictions, according to news reports.
Casada’s attorney, Jonathan Farmer of Nashville, could not confirm the pardon Thursday evening.
But Casada told Channel 4 News via text message and the Tennessee Journal that President Donald Trump called him Thursday and granted him a full pardon.
Casada and his former chief of staff, Cade Cothren, did not respond to text messages or calls Thursday night to confirm the pardons.
In late September, Casada was sentenced to 36 months in prison for his role in a kickback scheme after a jury convicted him on multiple counts of fraud, bribery, theft, conspiracy and money laundering in connection with a shell company called Phoenix Solutions run by Cothren, who was sentenced to 30 months the previous week.
Defense attorneys were appealing the case to a higher court.
Attorneys for Casada and Cothren requested a mistrial after prosecutors inadvertently played an unredacted recording of an FBI interview with Casada that incriminated Cothren during their four-week trial that stretched from mid-April into May. They also sought a new trial just before sentencing, but U.S. District Court Judge Eli Richardson denied the request.
Casada and Cothren were convicted of setting up the secret company that tapped into the state’s postage and printing program that provides House members $3,000 a year for constituent mailers. Casada and former Rep. Robin Smith, who pleaded guilty and testified against the pair, steered lawmakers’ business to Phoenix Solutions, which was secretly run by Cothren with the front name of “Matthew Phoenix.”
Smith was recently sentenced to eight months for her role in the scheme. She is seeking a presidential pardon according to the Chattanooga Times Free Press.

With state-funded benefits set to arrive on Friday, nearly a week has elapsed since the pause in federal nutrition assistance. Local providers have been scrambling to try to meet the need.

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.
Campbell MacArthur, 53, had never been to a food pantry before this week, but Thursday afternoon found him eating lunch in the busy lower level of Enough Ministries, a Barre church that operates a food shelf and meal service. 
MacArthur moved to Vermont in June after losing everything in a North Carolina fire, and had always been able to get by with help from federal food benefits, called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, run by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. He said he was grateful the state is doing “the right thing” by sending state-funded food assistance out on Friday.
“If it wasn’t for being in Vermont, I’d be shit outta luck — pardon my language,” MacArthur said.
MacArthur was one of many newcomers at food pantries across the state this week amid the pause in federal food aid, according to the local providers that have been scrambling to try to meet the need. State-funded benefits covering half the month are set to become available on Friday, nearly a week after Nov. 1 payments were missed due to the ongoing federal government shutdown. 
First-timers joined regular visitors like Helen Zamojski, a Bristol resident who comes to Helping Overcome Poverty’s Effects, or HOPE, in Middlebury for food each week. 
Zamojski said some SNAP recipients had expressed confusion about how the state-funded benefits would be administered this week. State officials have told VTDigger those benefits will arrive on Electronic Benefit Transfer cards Friday in the same manner as traditional assistance.
Zamojski said she was 70, and didn’t have a family, so had been able to plan ahead for food this week.

“I can’t imagine what it’s like if you have, like, kids,” she said.
‘A roller coaster’
Anna McMahon, the associate director at Feeding Champlain Valley, under the Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity, said Thursday that each of the organization’s three food shelves had seen sharp increases in need this week, with an unusually high rate of new clients.
November’s first three days saw visits to the Addison Food Hub in Middlebury almost double compared with the same period last month, while traffic at NorthWest Family Foods in St. Albans and the Burlington Food Shelf increased by 61% and 31% respectively.
Food pantries would normally expect to see some increase in need over the late fall and winter as utility bills rise, McMahon noted, but the combination of factors this year has resulted in a much earlier spike than normal.

“We’re talking to people who are saying they’re watering down their meals or skipping them altogether,” McMahon said.
Jennie Sperry, the community care coordinator at Enough Ministries, said her food programs had seen an increase in traffic this week, and over 200 people had taken $25 food vouchers available to Barre City residents during this trying time.
Charles Clark, a pastor at the Barre organization, was unsure of the increase, and said there was no imminent danger of the pantry running out of food, pointing to a number of full produce bins stacked around the room.
Feeding Champlain Valley has been able to order more food than usual to offset the rise in demand, McMahon said, thanks partially to increased support from the community and a grant from the Vermont Food Bank.
Carrie Stahler, the Vermont Food Bank’s government and public affairs officer, said that the state’s $250,000 emergency allocation to her organization had gone “a long way.” But ultimately, she said, a lapse in federal funding of this scale isn’t a problem the grant was able to completely solve. In fact, the assistance network — including the food bank and its partners — has long been stretched past the capacity it was designed to hold each year, she said. 
3SquaresVT, Vermont’s name for its SNAP program, costs about $3 million per week. For the Food Bank’s partners, many of which are small-scale and serve rural communities, the week has been a challenge, she said.
“I think if you asked any of our partners across the state, the way they would describe it is as a roller coaster,” Stahler said.
‘We were prepared’

Jeanne Montross, executive director at HOPE in Middlebury, said the stream of 80 people her team helped Tuesday was several times larger than a busy day under normal circumstances. On Wednesday morning before opening time, nearly every chair in the pantry’s waiting room was occupied.
The people Montross serves weren’t panicking this week, she added, but have often been worried, frustrated, or confused.
Montross paused in her explanation to remind staff that many recipients on the organization’s nine delivery routes would need extra food this week. Many, Montross said, are elderly people who began receiving the deliveries during the pandemic.
As the largest food assistance provider in Addison County, HOPE received nearly $8,000 from the Food Bank’s emergency funds. Staff had also ordered extra food in anticipation of rising need this week, and the organization isn’t in immediate danger of running out of stock.
“We were prepared,” Montross said.
On the whole, the network has shown real resilience this week, Vermont Food Bank’s Stahler reflected.
“We have so many incredible people who are willing to step up and help in an urgent moment of need like this,” she said.
Still, Stahler said she is concerned about the long-term effects of this pause in benefits.
“November is already intense,” she said. “What we have done now is exhaust everyone at the beginning of the month and hope they’re all going to make it to the end.”
The status of a federally funded SNAP benefit for November became more unclear Thursday after a federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the Trump administration to fully fund the program by Friday. District Court Judge John McConnell gave an oral order that rejected the current USDA plan to partially fund SNAP this month.
The USDA filed statements in two separate federal cases Monday — including the multistate lawsuit joined by Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark last week — that it would use contingency funding to cover half of the normal November SNAP payments.
Zamojski and MacArthur both expressed frustration with the lack of decisive political action to remedy the crisis. MacArthur called Washington, D.C., a “dog and pony show.”
“They just held a Great Gatsby party,” he said, referring to a gala thrown by President Donald Trump as food benefits ended for Americans. “That’s the American tragedy, if you’ve ever read that novel.”

Officials with New Mexico’s state emergency management agency said Thursday that the Federal Emergency Management Agency opted to withhold disaster prevention funding following deadly flooding in the Ruidoso area, a decision they are appealing. 
FEMA’s decision not to award funding from its Hazard Mitigation Grants Program “puts lives and property at risk unnecessarily during new or cascading life-threatening flooding events,” said Ali Rye, deputy secretary of the state Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, in an appeal letter Oct. 24. The appeal also calls the funding “indispensable.”
The mitigation program enables the state to prepare for future disasters and prevent so-called “cascading events” from causing repeated damage or undoing progress in disaster areas, according to Rye’s letter. 
Earlier this summer, flooding devastated the Ruidoso area, causing widespread damage to homes and business and prompting numerous swiftwater rescues. Also, three people, a father and his two kids, died after floods swept them out of their home.
‘We’re just here to pick up the pieces’: Ruidoso digs out in the aftermath of flooding

Flooding and debris flows have continued to threaten the area since the Salt Fork and Salt Fire last summer. Rain that falls on burn-scarred mountainsides often becomes powerful floods, and the state and other agencies have been working since last summer to harden the area against future flooding.
President Donald Trump on July 22 declared a presidential disaster in Lincoln County, a couple of weeks after storms, floods and landslides devastated the area in and around Ruidoso. Then FEMA in mid-August announced that Doña Ana County residents could also qualify for aid after separate flooding. Local governments and other public entities in Otero County can receive some funding to recover from floods under the same disaster declaration as well. 
The letter did not specify how much funding FEMA is withholding.DHSEM spokesperson Danielle Silva told Source New Mexico that there is no “set number” on how much the grant is worth, but that it can be as much as 7% of the total cost of the disaster. She did not immediately respond to how much the disaster cost, but some estimates put it at at least $10 million. 
Rye’s letter says FEMA denied the funding without adequate reason and that agency officials lack the discretion to do so under the law. She also said that FEMA officials “articulated verbally” to the state that they withheld the grant funding because the state hasn’t fully spent the money it’s received in previous disasters.
But Rye’s letter disputes that premise. Instead, she writes, FEMA has provided the state with only about $20 million of about $120 million it’s promised for mitigation grants for multiple recent disasters. 
FEMA officials did not respond to Source New Mexico’s request for comment Thursday. 
Despite withholding the mitigation grant funding, FEMA has provided about $11 million in response to the disasters in Southern New Mexico, according to the latest figures. That includes a little more than $8 million to about 600 households affected in the disaster.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ZAM0794-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-11-06 19:01:25.531775

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas Democrats asked a Pulaski County circuit judge Thursday to hold the governor and secretary of state in contempt for failing to comply with a court order to set a special election in House District 70 for March 3.
On Oct. 31, Judge Shawn Johnson issued a writ of mandamus ordering Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders to move the general election for the House seat from June 9, the date Sanders had set, to March 3. A writ of mandamus is a court order compelling a government official to perform a duty they are already legally required to do.
The Democratic Party of Arkansas and four District 70 voters had sued to have the election held on the earlier date, arguing that the June date deprived district residents of representation in the upcoming legislative fiscal session. The financial session starts in April.
“Respondents have not complied with the Writ,” the plaintiffs said in their motion to show cause why the defendants should not be held in contempt.
The motion notes that the state filed notice of appeal but has not requested a delay in enforcing the writ nor filed a record of the proceedings with the state Supreme Court.
“The Supreme Court has no jurisdiction in this case,” the motion states. “Respondents have stated publicly that they will seek to avoid complying” with the writ of mandamus.
Meanwhile, Attorney General Tim Griffin’s office filed an emergency motion with the Supreme Court on Wednesday asking for a stay pending appeal in the similar Senate District 26 special election. In that case, Pulaski Circuit Judge Patricia James ruled in favor of a Franklin County resident who sued to have the June 9 election date declared unconstitutional because it deprived residents in that district of representation. 
James’ ruling said the governor should set a new election date “as soon as practicable,” but didn’t specify a date. After Johnson’s ruling in the District 70 case, plaintiff Colt Shelby’s attorney filed a motion asking James to amend her writ to have the Senate District 26 election set for Feb. 8 or March 3 as the soonest practicable election date.
Special elections in the Senate and House districts became necessary after the death of state Sen. Gary Stubblefield on Sept. 2 and the resignation of Rep. Carlton Branch on Sept. 30 to become executive director and CEO of Arkansas PBS.
 State’s request for a stay

The court order in the Senate special election case would have the governor “violate state law within 132 days” of the court’s ruling, even though state law “requires at least 192 days from the state of candidate filings,” Deputy Solicitor General Noah Watson wrote in the emergency motion for a stay. Candidate filings began Monday and continue through Nov. 12. 
The state’s motion goes on to cite other statutory requirements for election officials and absentee ballots that would make an election date earlier than June impractical.
All of the legal wrangling over the special election dates stems from the legal requirement that the governor call special elections for legislative seats within 150 days of a vacancy. The law gives the governor the discretion to set a special election after that deadline “as soon as practicable” if an earlier date would be impractical or unduly burdensome.
Plaintiffs in both of the lawsuits presented evidence that persuaded the judges that holding primaries and a special election earlier than June was doable and not burdensome.

(Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)Researchers for Colorado’s racial equity study said they plan to have a draft of the full historical report by next November that details inequalities caused by systemic racism in the state.
“That will allow us to spend the remaining months of the study both revising the report and pulling together a variety of supplementary materials, such as data tables, maps, images, primary sources and so on,” researcher Scott Spillman told members of the Black Coloradan Racial Equity Study Commission on Wednesday.
The study is mandated by a 2024 state law and is meant to determine the historical and ongoing effects of racism against Black Coloradans. The commission, which is chaired by Colorado Senate President James Coleman, a Denver Democrat, will use the historical research and economic analysis to make legislative recommendations.
So far, researchers say they have completed six investigations on certain topics — such as criminal justice in the 20th century and banking in the New Deal era — and should have eight more finished by the end of this year and around a dozen others completed by next fall. They want to complete about 100 new oral histories for the study and digitize dozens of existing ones. They have completed community listening sessions in Denver and Pueblo and have scheduled sessions in Boulder, Durango and Colorado Springs.

Researchers are under budget and ahead of schedule to deliver the historical study, according to Chloé Duplessis, History Colorado program manager, but there is a $550,000 funding gap for the economic analysis phase of the project.
Colorado racial equity study uncovers history on early lawmakers, runs ahead of schedule

Duplessis, Spillman and other members of the team shared some research updates to the commission during their quarterly meeting Wednesday. That includes the conclusion that the percentage of botched executions for Black Coloradans was “much higher” than for other demographics, according to researcher Melissa Jones.
“The ways in which those executions were carried out, or the manner by which they met their deaths, was much longer and over a prolonged period of time,” Jones said.
Additionally, Jones said the percentage of incarcerated people who were Black between the 1870s and 1940s was about five to 10 times that of the Black population in the state. She also noted the “reductive language” used in arrest records and newspapers, such as a woman in 1906 described as “enraged” and of a “perverted nature” with “kinky” hair and a “dark brown” complexion.
“But there’s an incredible, rich story there that we can bring back to life, and show some of the harms that were done to her in reducing her to just a few descriptions and a few lines on an arrest record,” Jones said.
Researcher John Valdez shared information about a Denver “gentleman’s agreement” between banks and realtors to not let Black Coloradans buy houses in certain areas until the 1970s.
“One of the major quotes that I thought was important to bring up was from a realtor out at Denver National Bank, and he said in one of our reports that there is an ‘unwritten law amongst real estate agents that Negroes cannot buy houses outside of their area no matter what the individual financial standing might be,’” Valdez said.
Various human relations reports, he said, showed that bankers and realtors were not afraid to blatantly discriminate.

The California Supreme Court upheld a law protecting the rights of LGBT people in nursing homes, including by forbidding employees from misgendering those patients.


The California Supreme Court rejected a First Amendment challenge to a state law that protects the rights of gay and transgender people in nursing homes and forbids employees of those sites from using the wrong pronouns to address a resident or coworker.
The ruling, handed down today, held that violations of the LGBT Long-Term Care Residents’ Bill of Rights are not protected by the First Amendment because they relate to codes of conduct in what is effectively both a workplace and people’s homes. 
“The pronouns provision constitutes a regulation of discriminatory conduct that incidentally affects speech,” the court ruled. 
The opinion reversed an appeals court ruling that held provisions in the law relating to patient pronouns and names could impede on an employee’s freedom of speech. Five justices signed onto the main opinion; two signed onto a concurrence. There were no dissents.
The group challenging the 2017 law, Taking Offense, asserted in its lawsuit that the law mandating that long-term care facilities use people’s chosen pronouns amounts to “criminalizing and compelling speech content.”
Taking Offense described itself in court documents as a group opposing efforts “to coerce society to accept transgender fiction that a person can be whatever sex/gender s/he thinks s/he is, or chooses to be.”
The court ruled that the LGBT Long-Term Care Residents’ Bill of Rights “will be violated when willful and repeated misgendering has occurred in the presence of a resident, the resident hears or sees the misgendering, and the resident is harmed because the resident perceives that conduct to be abusive.”
The LGBT Long-Term Care Residents’ Bill of Rights is enforced by a section of California’s Health and Safety Code. Penalties can range from civil fines to criminal misdemeanor prosecutions — the potential for criminal penalties was a major element of Taking Offense’s argument. The court’s decision noted that other protections for long-term care facility residents have long carried both civil and criminal penalties. 
“It seems apparent that the Legislature does not intend for such criminal penalties to be imposed except as a last resort, in the most egregious circumstances,” wrote the decision’s author, California Supreme Court Chief Justice Patricia Guerrero. 
The opinion made comparisons to other free speech decisions with similar elements, such as the 1995 U.S. Supreme Court decision holding that the the Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston could not force St. Patrick’s Day parade organizers to include them. 
“By contrast, the present case does not involve any analogous creative product or expressive association,” Guerrero wrote, concluding that the California law is instead regulating people’s conduct.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/040324-CA-Supreme-Court-CASC-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-06 19:01:25.531775

The Natrona County District Attorney’s Office brought the misdemeanor charge following Becky Hadlock’s no-show at a legislative hearing. 
The post Weston County clerk faces criminal charges for defying subpoena appeared first on WyoFile .","The Natrona County District Attorney’s Office has charged Weston County Clerk Becky Hadlock for failing to appear at a legislative committee meeting in Casper after she was subpoenaed by state lawmakers, court filings show. 
The subpoena, issued by Rep. Chris Knapp, R-Gillette, in his capacity as co-chair of the Joint Management Audit Committee, required Hadlock to appear at a September hearing, where lawmakers were expected to question her about her office’s actions in the November 2024 election. 
Hadlock, however, did not attend the meeting, prompting lawmakers to pursue criminal charges. The violation is a misdemeanor, according to state law. If convicted, Hadlock could face up to six months in jail and a $100 fine. 
The subpoena stemmed from Hadlock’s role in an initial ballot miscount and subsequent false post-election audit in Weston County’s 2024 general election. In July, lawmakers formed the Weston County Clerk Subcommittee to investigate what occurred and to compel testimony. 
“This is a big violation,” Sen. Dan Laursen, R-Powell, said at the September meeting when Hadlock failed to appear. 
It was initially unclear to lawmakers and staff attorneys whether charges should be pursued in Casper, where the meeting was held, or elsewhere. However, the Natrona County Sheriff’s Office began an investigation in late September, according to an affidavit signed by Sgt. Ken Jividen. 
The investigation involved interviews with multiple lawmakers including Reps. Knapp and Rachel Roriguez-Williams, R-Cody, and Sen. Laursen. 
Knapp told Jividen that Hadlock had indicated ahead of the meeting that she would not be present, according to the affidavit.
“Although she provided documentation to the committee indicating she would not be present, she did not provide any specific details as to why she would not be available to attend,” the affidavit states. 
In her own interview with Sgt. Jividen, Hadlock said she had a doctor’s appointment in Newcastle on Sept. 29, the day of the meeting. Hadlock also said she had to drive her mother to Gillette for a doctor’s appointment that same day. 
“Ultimately, Hadlock again said she did receive a subpoena, she knew she was commanded to appear, and that she was not excused from the subpoena,” the affidavit states. 
Hadlock also provided documentation following the interview that indicated the Sept. 29 medical appointments in Newcastle and Gillette. 
Ryan Semerad, Hadlock’s attorney, declined to comment for this story. 
A hearing in the case is set for Nov. 14 in Natrona County Circuit Court in Casper, according to a criminal summons. 
Background
For the November 2024 election, Hadlock printed three versions of the ballot due to errors on the first two. It’s not unusual for clerks to reprint ballots to correct misprintings and other errors ahead of an election, but problems arose when some voters were given the erroneous first and second versions. 
As a result, tabulators miscounted votes in a county commission race and the contest for House District 1, where House Speaker Rep. Chip Neiman (R-Hulett) was running unopposed.

The initial results for Weston County showed Neiman received 166 votes while 1,289 voters left that part of the ballot blank, also known as an undervote. 
That count caught Secretary of State Chuck Gray’s attention on election night, he told the state canvassing board last year. When Hadlock didn’t answer his calls, he sent the sheriff’s office to her home. 
Hadlock initially denied there was an issue, but ultimately agreed to Gray’s request that her office complete a hand tabulation of the ballots, which confirmed her mistake. The recount showed that Neiman received 1,269 votes, and the results were certified by the county canvassing board.
Gray recommended that Hadlock be removed from office, but Gov. Mark Gordon came to a different conclusion, saying her mistakes did not rise to the level of malfeasance. Gordon is now weighing new complaints against Hadlock, including for her failure to comply with the subpoena.

Migrant Justice was notified of the raid and is helping families of those who were detained, according to Will Lambek, spokesperson for the nonprofit advocacy group.

File photo by Eric Gay/AP
Border patrol officials detained several people at a gas station in Jeffersonville on Wednesday morning, according to immigration advocates.
While some residents reported immigration authorities arresting 10 to 15 people, advocates have confirmed at least five local residents are currently being held in detention. 
An employee at the Maplefields convenience store at the Mobil gas station on VT-15 said the incident occurred around 5:30 a.m. on Wednesday with “people running around and yelling” as “immigration police” rounded up more than 10 people. 
Customs and Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Migrant Justice was notified of the raid via its emergency response line and is helping families of those who were detained, according to Will Lambek, spokesperson for the nonprofit advocacy group.
“We can confirm that this was a CBP action and that the people were subsequently transferred to ICE custody,” he said.
The total number of people detained in Jeffersonville is likely under 18, he estimated, although information is still coming in.
“We are in touch with family members of the detained. At this time, they are not looking to speak to the press or to provide information about those in detention,” he said.
Vermont State Police, which serves the small Lamoille County village, said it does not have information about the incident.
“Federal authorities have not been in the habit of notifying state law enforcement agencies in advance of their planned operations,” state police spokesperson Adam Silverman said.
The Jeffersonville raid comes on the heels of other operations in Vermont this week that have resulted in the detainment of 17 others at the Northwest Correctional Facility in St. Albans, NBC5 News reported. 
They are “a mix of people detained by ICE/CBP in Vermont and those transferred from out of state,” Lambek said Thursday.
Advocates from the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project, which offers legal services to detainees, visited the facility Wednesday to meet with them but did not find the people taken from Jeffersonville there, according to Executive Director Jill Martin Diaz. That suggests the detainees were likely held temporarily to be transferred out of state, they said.
The project’s legal tracker has confirmed five individuals detained and held in Vermont this week, three of whom are recorded as being Hispanic or Latino.
These latest roundups are examples of the Trump administration’s accelerated immigration enforcement in Vermont this year.
“They are linked, of course, as part of a larger trend of escalating attacks against immigrant communities, both in Vermont and around the country,” Lambek said. 
Since the start of the second Trump presidency, Migrant Justice has documented more than three dozen ICE and border patrol actions in the state that have resulted in the detainment of  more than 100 immigrants in Vermont. Vermont prisons are also struggling with the increased immigration enforcement.
ICE’s plan to build out its surveillance capabilities in Williston has been met with public opposition, and Vermont signed a new agreement with U.S. immigration authorities, allowing them to continue using the state’s prisons for federal detentions.
The government should be supporting working people, not targeting them and undermining their rights, said James Duff Lyall, executive director of the ACLU of Vermont, in an emailed statement.
“Our hearts go out to everyone impacted by this latest attack on our community,” he said.
“ICE and Border Patrol have long operated with a shocking lack of transparency and accountability and routinely engage in racial profiling and constitutional rights violations. Vermonters reject these actions and we will continue to show up for one another in this nation of immigrants,” he said.
Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., is aware of and monitoring the situation, according to spokesperson Elisabeth St. Onge . 
His office “will continue to work closely with Vermont’s network of advocates, interpreters and lawyers who work with asylum seekers and those detained,” St. Onge said. “Everyone deserves due process.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Federal officials on Thursday announced the formation of a Nashville-based Homeland Security Task Force to combat gangs, drug trafficking and transnational crime across Middle Tennessee.
Dozens of federal law enforcement agents from the Department of Homeland Security, the IRS, U.S. Marshals Service, the U.S. Army Criminal Investigative Division and state and local agencies will be deployed across central Tennessee as part of the expanded “whole government” approach to law enforcement, said Rob McGuire, acting U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee.
The task force was convened at the direction of the FBI and Department of Homeland Security and represents one of the first of what is expected to be an expanded federal presence in communities nationwide, said Jeff Pfeiffer, assistant special agent in charge of the FBI Nashville field office. 
Similar task forces were announced this week in Indianapolis, Dallas and Little Rock.
“To effectively dismantle these transnational criminal organizations the FBI and our partners at HSI (Homeland Security Investigations) spearheaded the creation and implementation of a nationwide homeland security task force network,” Pfeiffer said. “This allows us to extend our reach, share intelligence in real time and target these threats at every level.”
Judge mulls arguments over deploying Tennessee National Guard to Memphis

The task force announcement in Nashville follows the Trump administration’s highly visible and controversial deployment of federal law enforcement officers and National Guard members to  Washington, DC, Memphis, Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland to enforce immigration laws and patrol community streets.  
Those efforts were launched by executive orders and memoranda issued by President Donald Trump. Trump has thus far not issued any formal written directive establishing the task force in Nashville. 
Asked whether he viewed the work of the Nashville task force as distinct from the activities in those cities, McGuire did not provide a direct answer.
“I think what we’re trying to do is combat gang violence, drug trafficking and transnational criminal organizations. That’s where I’m going to leave that,” McGuire said in an interview with the Lookout after the press conference. 
And in response to a question about whether Middle Tennessee residents would soon see a more visible federal law enforcement presence in their communities, McGuire said he did not know.
Metro Nashville Police Chief John Drake says his department will be focusing on crime only and not immigration enforcement. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
“I think right now we’re focusing on drug trafficking and gang violence,” he said. “There are going to be more detectives trying to launch our investigations about violence and drug trafficking. I don’t know the answer to that.”
The effort will also involve local police departments and county sheriffs, including the Metro Nashville Police Department. The collaboration does not thus far include the Tennessee National Guard, whose presence in Memphis is currently being challenged in court. 
Gov. Bill Lee, who authorized the Guard’s deployment in Memphis, declined to respond to a reporter Thursday when asked if he would be mobilizing the Guard as part of the task force’s efforts in Nashville.
Metro Nashville Police Chief John Drake, among more than two dozen law enforcement officials present at Thursday’s press conference, said Nashville has thus far had a “great partnership with federal law enforcement” but drew a distinction between his department’s involvement in the task force and the work of federal partners.
“I don’t feel safe”: Black Memphis residents report harassment by Trump’s police task force

“Our task force is focused on drugs, gangs and illegal activity,” Drake said. “That’s it. We’re not focusing on immigration or on a person’s status, whether they are documented or undocumented.”
“As far as the other branches of the federal government, I’m not sure what they’ll do. But I can tell you our focus is criminal activity and that’s different from west of here,” he said in a reference to federal task force activity in Memphis.
Thursday’s press conference marked the first official day of the task force, but McGuire noted that federal and local law enforcement have for months been cooperating to combat crimes involving cartels, drug traffickers and transnational criminal operations. 
Against a backdrop of large poster boards displaying mug shots, McGuire described the indictment of 38 individuals in recent months for offenses that include involvement in fentanyl and methamphetamine distribution pipelines, gun offenses and gang violence, including the arrests of 20 “midlevel dealers” in Cumberland County. 
Tennessee, feds provide few details on cost, arrests three weeks into Memphis task force

“This is something you’re probably going to see more of in this district and other places,” McGuire said. 
The Homeland Security Task Force in Nashville is similar to federal law enforcement forces created earlier this week in Dallas, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Little Rock, Arkansas. The Nashville task force will be led by the U.S. Department of Justice in Nashville and made up of personnel from U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Alcohol, Fire and Tobacco (ATF), the FBI, the Army Criminal Investigative Division, the Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office, Metro Nashville Police and other local agencies. 
This is not the first federal task force to be created in Tennessee under Trump. In September, Trump and Lee created a law enforcement force to “end street and violent crime in Memphis to the greatest possible extent.” The Memphis task force has announced over 1,000 arrests, but released scant information about the names or charges of those taken into custody. 
At the same time, the Memphis task force’s focus is on making a high volume of traffic stops. The Lookout previously reported on a man who was held by Memphis Task Force officers for 45 minutes over a loose car bumper. MLK50: Justice Through Journalism and ProPublica reported that many of Memphis’s Black residents are getting caught in the “indiscriminate and intimidating police encounters.”

Credit: Related DigitalMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel on Thursday filed a notice with state energy regulators intervening in DTE Energy’s request to approve two contracts allowing them to supply power to a data center under development in Saline Township. 
Last week, DTE filed an ex-parte request with the Michigan Public Service Commission, which provides oversight to the state’s energy utilities, seeking approval to provide 1.4 gigawatts of power to the OpenAI facility. Nessel’s office noted that this type of request does not carry public hearing requirements, and no party is allowed to conduct discovery and file testimony for the commission to review before making its decision on the contracts. 
While the energy company assured that the new data center would absorb all new costs associated with supplying power to the facility, painting the project as a benefit for customer affordability, Nessel has asked the commission to treat the matter as a contested case, citing a lack of clarity in the company’s plan to protect ratepayers from facing additional costs. 
“Reducing electric bills and making energy affordable is essential,” Nessel said in a statement. “That’s why I’m asking the Commission to hold a public hearing on this case – to make sure DTE customers are not stuck footing the bill for a data center that never comes to fruition or uses far less electricity than projected. In either scenario, the massive costs of building the data center won’t just disappear. The costs would be passed on to ratepayers, driving up bills for families.”
Nessel said a public hearing was the only way to ensure transparency in the process as well as confirm the details of DTE’s proposal before approval is granted.

krisanapong detraphiphat/Getty Images)A former top administrator for Johnson County is suing three county board members, alleging they defamed him and fired him due to his political support of another board member.
Guillermo Morales, who worked as the executive director for the Johnson County Board of Supervisors from March 2023 until his firing in September 2024, is suing Johnson County and supervisors Rod Sullivan, Lisa Green-Douglass and Royceann Porter in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
As the board’s executive director, Morales was responsible for providing administrative guidance to the board and overseeing the board’s office, which involved supervising 13 full-time employees.
The lawsuits claims the board completed a written evaluation of Morales’ work performance in September 2023, finding he exceeded expectations and was qualified for the highest possible merit-based salary increase.

A few weeks later, in October 2023, about 150 University of Iowa students protested a speech given by Chloe Cole, a conservative activist and self-identified “de-transitioner.” After the speech, protesters blocked traffic on two Iowa City streets for roughly 20 minutes.
Johnson County Attorney Rachel Zimmerman charged seven of the protesters with engaging in disorderly conduct and interfering with official acts. The seven protesters who were charged all identified as transgender or as nonbinary, the lawsuit alleges.
In early 2024, the board’s vice chair, Jon Green, drafted a resolution requesting the Johnson County Democratic Party’s Central Committee denounce or censure Zimmerman for refusing to dismiss the criminal charges filed against the protesters. The committee later met and rejected Green’s resolution by a vote of 34-13.
Morales, who attended the committee meeting, voted in favor of the resolution, the lawsuit claims, and Mandi Remmington, a candidate in the upcoming Democratic primary for a seat on the board, spoke in favor of it.
The lawsuit claims that in March 2024, before the board met with Morales to discuss his one-year performance evaluation, Porter inquired as to whether the board could discipline Morales for his support of Remmington’s candidacy and for his support of the Zimmerman censure vote.
As part of the board’s evaluation of Morales, Porter gave Morales a significantly lower score than he had six months earlier, the lawsuit claims, and Green-Douglass expressed concern with his support of the Zimmerman censure resolution. The lawsuit claims that during the evaluation, Morales repeatedly asked Porter what he could do better to improve her assessment of his performance and Porter refused to respond.
In June 2024, the defendants in the lawsuit — Sullivan, Green-Douglass and Porter — ran in the Democratic primary for three of the board’s five “at large” seats, competing with Remmington.
According to the lawsuit, Morales donated money to Remmington’s campaign, displayed a Remmington sign in his yard, and publicly backed Remmington throughout her campaign. Remmington finished third among the five candidates in the primary, potentially unseating Porter, who finished fourth in the primary.
In August 2024, Sullivan allegedly set up a special board meeting to discuss Morales’ work, which was held on Sept. 4, 2024. At that meeting, Sullivan read a two-page statement that the lawsuit contends included false and unsubstantiated allegations against Morales, accusing him of being “insubordinate, argumentative and disrespectful” to supervisors and rude to the county staff.
Green-Douglass then made a motion to fire Morales, seconded by Porter. The motion was approved on a 3-2 vote, with Sullivan, Douglass-Green and Porter voting in favor of the termination.
The lawsuit claims Sullivan subsequently published a blog entry under the heading, “Working for Johnson County,” stating there were three basic requirements for employment: “(1) Don’t be an a–hole, (2) treat people with respect, and (3) recognize we succeed or fail as a team.”
According to the lawsuit, the blog post included “thinly veiled references,” suggesting that “if over 80% of your peers think you are an ass, you are going to need to find a different place to work.”
As part of his lawsuit, Morales, who is Latino and of Mexican origin, alleges discrimination by the county and argues that his “race, skin color, or national origin played a part” in the board’s decision to fire him.
Morales also claims that after he exercised his First Amendment rights by opposing discrimination against other protected classes the county retaliated against him by firing him. The lawsuit also accuses the county of defamation, citing false statements that injured Morales’ reputation.
The county has yet to file a response to the lawsuit.

(Screenshot by South Dakota Searchlight)Three South Dakota counties have some of the highest percentages of federal food assistance participation in the country, based on a report from the Center for American Progress.
The report highlights retailers and areas most at risk of being harmed by changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
Amid the federal government shutdown, President Donald Trump’s administration has said it will eventually run out of money to fund SNAP benefits or will have to reduce benefits for the program, which provides 42 million low-income Americans — including 75,000 South Dakotans — with payment cards they can use to buy food. A federal judge on Thursday ordered the Trump administration to pay full November SNAP benefits by Friday. 
USDA revises SNAP benefit amounts during shutdown after admitting miscalculation

South Dakota has counties with the nation’s third-, sixth- and eighth-highest percentages of residents utilizing SNAP, according to the Center for American Progress report. Those are Todd County, where 49.3% of residents use SNAP, Ziebach County (43.5%) and Oglala Lakota County (43%).
The counties include tribal lands of the Rosebud, Cheyenne River and Oglala Sioux tribes, respectively.
Rosebud Sioux Tribe President Kathleen Wooden Knife wrote a letter to South Dakota’s congressional delegates in October, urging them to reopen the government. Wooden Knife wrote that 60% to 70% of Rosebud tribal members, some of whom live off tribal land, rely on SNAP.
Sicangu Co., an economic development organization based on Rosebud land, plans to harvest and process five bison to distribute to SNAP recipients across the Rosebud Reservation. The estimated cost for the effort is about $10,000.
RF Buche, with GF Buche Foods, said the grocery and convenience store chain will offer $100 worth of groceries to each SNAP household if funds aren’t processed by Nov. 10 (SNAP benefits in South Dakota are loaded onto payment cards on the 10th of every month). GF Buche stores are largely on or near tribal land.
Republican South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden told South Dakota Searchlight earlier this week he would not support using any state funds to supplement SNAP payments during the shutdown.

Free.,Supreme Court OKs for now Trump passport policy that targets trans people,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/supreme-court-oks-now-trump-passport-policy-targets-trans-people,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday allowed President Donald Trump’s administration to continue carrying out, for now, its policy requiring that passports only list a person’s sex assigned at birth.The nation’s highest court paused a lower court order that temporarily barred the administration from enforcing the policy, codified in an executive order Trump signed in January. The executive order made it the “policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female” and called on the State Department to “implement changes to require that government-issued identification documents, including passports, visas, and Global Entry cards, accurately reflect the holder’s sex.” Under then-President Joe Biden, the State Department allowed people to “select an ‘X’ as their gender marker on their U.S. passport application.”In the unsigned court order, the majority noted that “displaying passport holders’ sex at birth no more offends equal protection principles than displaying their country of birth — in both cases, the Government is merely attesting to a historical fact without subjecting anyone to differential treatment.”  Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, indicating a 6-3 decision.Jackson, who authored the dissent, wrote that the court “fails to spill any ink considering the plaintiffs, opting instead to intervene in the Government’s favor without equitable justification, and in a manner that permits harm to be inflicted on the most vulnerable party.” “This Court has once again paved the way for the immediate infliction of injury without adequate (or, really, any) justification,” she wrote. “Because I cannot acquiesce to this pointless but painful perversion of our equitable discretion, I respectfully dissent.” In February, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against the administration on behalf of seven transgender and nonbinary people over the suspension of the Biden-era policy.A federal judge in Massachusetts in June temporarily blocked the administration from enforcing the policy. The judge had issued an earlier preliminary injunction in April that applied to six of the case’s plaintiffs. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit kept in place the district court’s order in September, prompting the administration to ask the Supreme Court to intervene.",,,,2025-11-06 18:16:52.140410

Doctors in Mississippi are encouraged by how this program has boosted the quality of life for young patients and caregivers.,"What would happen if every mother in Mississippi – or in Mississippi’s neediest counties – received no-questions-asked cash assistance during pregnancy and months after a baby is born? Lawmakers pondered these questions at the state Capitol Thursday. 
The conversation focused on a program called Rx Kids, that started in Flint, Michigan, and is branded as a “prescription to poverty.” Dr. Mona Hanna, the program’s founder, presented her initiative to Mississippi lawmakers in House and Senate Public Health committees as a way to combat infant mortality. Nationwide, infants die at a higher rate in Mississippi than any other state. 
Mississippi doctors offered context during the hearing on rising infant deaths. In August, the state health department declared a public health emergency, and this week, doctors urged lawmakers to think creatively in how they choose to address the crisis. 
“Every hour that goes by, every day that goes by when a baby is born without the resources they need is a failure on all of us – we can do better,” Hanna said. “We don’t have to be OK with babies dying because of deprivation. This is not a genius idea, it’s not a new idea, it’s not a radical idea – this is just common sense.”
Rx Kids gives $1,500 to moms during pregnancy and $500 a month for six to 12 months after birth. This program only applies to mothers in the perinatal window in select communities, unlike a universal basic income, which would be available to everyone in theory. However, it is similarly unconditional – requiring no proof of income or employment and making no stipulations about how the money is spent. In Michigan, the program has given over $17 million to nearly 4,000 families in 11 communities to date – and the preliminary data bodes well.
Rx Kids is administered by GiveDirectly, a global cash assistance program funded by a number of private foundations and government institutions. At one point, this list included the U.S. Agency for International Development. 
Senate Public Health Committee Chairman Hob Bryan, a Democrat from Amory, said the program showed “great promise,” and House Public Health Committee Chairman Sam Creekmore, a Republican from New Albany, said he intends to “float the idea out to the Legislature.”
“My initial thoughts are that it’s great,” Creekmore said. “It comes down to can we afford it, or can we not afford it – but we can’t ignore it. It’s proven, successful and something I wanted to bring to the table today.”
Cash assistance programs similar to what Hanna described have demonstrated usefulness and public appeal. During the pandemic, the nation briefly had a cash assistance program for parents through the expanded child tax credit. The program helped reduce childhood poverty to a record low of 5%. After members of Congress failed to extend the program, childhood poverty has surged to a new high of 12%. Had Congress voted to continue the program in 2022, an analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found 3 million children could have been kept from poverty.
The U.S. is exceptional among wealthy nations for its high rate of childhood poverty. Evidence shows that when children endure poverty, they also are at greater risk of experiencing emotional dysregulation, obesity and malnutrition. These conditions are significant contributing factors to developing chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer. In Mississippi, one of the poorest states in the nation, nearly 1 in 4 children live in poverty. 
Around childbirth, expenses increase while income decreases for parents, making it a uniquely difficult time. The United States offers no national paid parental leave policies but produces the highest costs in child care globally, according to the World Economic Forum. 
The program Rx Kids has helped alleviate some of those crushing costs for young families in Michigan. The number of infants staying in the neonatal intensive care unit, as well as those born underweight, dropped by more than a quarter, while preterm birth dropped by 18%, according to a study conducted on the program in Flint. In addition, evictions fell by 91%, and postpartum depression and nutritional access improved by 14%. 
Mississippi doctors are encouraged by these data and how a program like what Hanna has launched could boost quality of life for young patients and caregivers. Dr. Patricia Tibbs, a Laurel pediatrician and president of the Mississippi Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said she is sold on the program, calling the premise and the results so far “amazing.” 
“It seems like it shouldn’t work, but it works,” Tibbs told Mississippi Today. “There’s something that happens when a child is not born into absolute poverty, when that first year or two years of that child’s life is stress-free. It makes a huge difference in this child’s trajectory in the future.”
Given her understanding of child development and psychology, Tibbs believes even a temporary alleviation of poverty is worth it, because of the dramatic long-term effects that it can have on health and wellbeing. 
“The security of a check for a few months is enough to make you realize the possibilities,” Tibbs said.
Dr. Anita Henderson, a pediatrician in Hattiesburg and former president of the Mississippi Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said this program would help many of the patients she sees. 
“Transportation is an issue, child care is an issue, missing half a day at work is financially not feasible for many of my families,” Henderson said. 
During the hearing, Rep. Dan Eubanks, a Republican from Walls, raised concerns about the “lack of accountability” in the program. 
“If we’re trying to incentivize better behaviors, but we’re just giving them money, how does that incentivize them to correct some of the underlying causes of infant mortality?” Eubanks asked. 
Hanna said research shows the program led to an 11% decrease in smoking in the third trimester – something she attributes in part to a reduction in stress. 
“We didn’t create a complicated program to tell people to stop smoking – but people are on their own,” Hanna said. “Because moms by and large know what they need to do. They know what’s important, everybody loves their babies, and they want healthy babies. If you just give them a little bit of an economic cushion during this window, we see all these improvements.”
A letter from Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer to new babies, included in a care package Rx Kids sends out to all families in Rx Kids communities.
In Michigan, the absence of bureaucratic and systemic barriers allowed the program to garner bipartisan support. Michigan Sen. John Damoose, a Republican who represents a rural swathe of northern Michigan, recalled going from a skeptic to a champion of the program. 
“My immediate first thought was, ‘I’m a Republican – we don’t support giving away free money,’” Damoose told Mississippi Today. “But, as a pro-life Republican, I did wonder whether this program might give some young mothers the courage they need to choose life, so I decided to dig a little deeper. What I found was a brilliantly crafted initiative that was totally efficient and through its simplicity, addressed some of the most critical needs facing young families and children throughout our society.”
Damoose said he found the economics of the program compelling, since it “avoids the massive costs of bureaucracy.”
The program has almost no overhead. Once the money is allocated, there is very little that states have to do to administer it. Hanna estimated a pilot program in two Mississippi counties would likely require two staff members on the ground. 
“We are not hiring offices of people to figure out who’s in, who’s out, who’s deserving, who’s not deserving,” Hanna explained. “Plus, everybody needs help during this window. That’s why this program is more focused on poor places, rather than poor people.”
In Michigan, the program is made possible through a combination of state funds, federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funds, and philanthropic funds. 
Mark Jones, director of communications at the Mississippi Department of Human Services – which oversees the TANF program – said they have not allocated any money toward the program and won’t know whether they have the funding to do so until early 2026. 
“We have been approached by those who have operated the program in other states and are always open to hearing solutions that would benefit Mississippians,” Jones said. 
A private foundation called The Families and Workers Fund, headquartered in New York, has already pledged $2 million to implement the program in Mississippi – contingent on the state putting up funds, Hanna said. The state’s funds don’t have to be TANF funds, and they don’t have to be a direct match – it could be less than $1 million. 
“About $2.5 million is needed to start a pilot program, and we have $2 million,” Hanna said. 
The use of philanthropic funds means the assistance counts as a gift, rather than income. That saves people from falling off “the benefits cliff,” a phenomenon where needy families who see a small increase in income get kicked off of social safety net programs, such as Medicaid or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
This kind of direct investment in families influences outcomes beyond poverty or infant mortality, Hanna said. It bolsters community and strengthens public trust in government. 
“As much as we are eliminating poverty and improving health, we are sending a message,” Hanna said. “This is all very much about shifting the narrative about how we can care for each other. We are literally telling people: ‘We love you, we are investing in you, and we cannot wait to see what you become.’”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/06142416/Infant-mortality-hearing-1.jpg,,,2025-11-06 18:01:39.496617

(Photo by Jacob Orledge/North Dakota Monitor)UNDERWOOD, N.D. — WBI Energy on Thursday released new details of the timeline for the planned Bakken East natural gas pipeline connecting the two halves of North Dakota. 
The development will kick into high gear in 2026, a company representative said during a meeting of the Legislature’s Energy Development and Transmission Committee. 
WBI will hold a binding open season during the first quarter when shippers will commit to ship natural gas on the pipeline. Then WBI expects to sign agreements with gas customers along its planned route by the midpoint of the year. 
“We feel good about where we are today based on our ongoing conversations with a host of potential customers,” said Mark Anderson, vice president of business development and marketing for WBI. The potential customers include utilities, industrial users, and others such as data center developers. 
WBI will apply for federal regulatory approval between July and September 2026, Anderson said. The company is optimistic the regulatory process will go smoothly. 
“We feel tail winds at the federal level at the moment, which gives us some comfort that our schedule is manageable and predictable,” Anderson told lawmakers during the meeting at Coal Creek Station power plant. “We would look to get our first certificate in early 2028.”
WBI to receive $500M state financial guarantee to build natural gas pipeline in North Dakota

WBI is planning to begin construction of the pipeline in the second half of 2028. Phase one, from McKenzie County to Washburn, is expected to be in service by the end of 2029. The second phase of construction, from Washburn to Mapleton near Fargo, is slated to be completed by the end of 2030. 
The pipeline is expected to transport up to 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas out of the Bakken per day. WBI also plans to construct “laterals,” extending away from the main route, to serve communities like Ellendale, the site of a large data center. 
The North Dakota Industrial Commission approved a $500 million financial guarantee earlier this year to help get the project off the ground. This deal, Anderson said Thursday, is “in progress” and has not been finalized. 
The financial guarantee represents $50 million worth of shipping capacity per year, over 10 years. Justin Kringstad, director of the North Dakota Pipeline Authority, said that represents between 15% and 17% of the pipeline’s total capacity. The state plans to transfer that pipeline capacity to private businesses.
Anderson said WBI views the financial backstop as a “bridge” between the pipeline’s construction and the demand from potential customers. 
2 natural gas pipelines compete for $500M financial backstop from North Dakota

WBI has not finalized the design of the pipeline, nor secured easements from landowners for the planned route. The company has received permission to survey the route from 98% of landowners along the 350-mile mainline, 93% of landowners along a potential lateral to Spiritwood, the site of a large industrial park, and 53% of a possible lateral to Ellendale. 
The pipeline will tie into WBI’s broader network of pipelines in North Dakota and other states. Even though the new pipeline will begin in McKenzie County, the company’s pipeline network connects to the majority of natural gas processing plants in northwest North Dakota, Anderson said. 
Anderson said WBI’s goal is to enable community growth and economic development across the state by providing access to natural gas for power generation. 
“All signs point to Bakken production continuing to grow. We want to do our part to ensure that Bakken production, gas production can access markets safely, reliably in support of the crude oil production,” Anderson said.

June Robinson, D-Everett, seen here in 2023, chairs the Senate Ways & Means Committee and is the lead budget writer for the majority Democratic caucus in the Washington Legislature. (Legislative Support Services)With the state strapped for cash, Democrats’ chief budget writer in the Washington Senate has told colleagues there’s no money available for new spending they might desire next year.
Don’t even bother asking, Sen. June Robinson, chair of the Senate Ways and Means Committee, warned fellow lawmakers in an email Tuesday.
“I will not be soliciting or accepting any member requests for the operating budget in the upcoming session,” she wrote. “Please help set expectations around this with your constituents and advocates as you meet with them.”
Early each session, lawmakers typically submit requests to budget writers for new or additional funding for programs and services. Wish lists are the product of legislators’ conversations with a wide berth of individuals and interests.
Robinson, an Everett Democrat, said in an interview Wednesday she reached out before any submissions arrived in hopes of tamping down expectations. 
“We don’t have money to pay for what is needed, let alone new spending that members might request,” she said. 
Recent economic forecasts show a steep decline in tax receipts in Washington, sending the two-year state budget spiraling toward a deficit. This is in spite of billions of dollars in new and higher taxes approved earlier this year by the Democratic-controlled Legislature and Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson.
Robinson shared her email with Sen. Chris Gildon, R-Puyallup, the lead Republican on the budget writing committee. Gildon, in turn, forwarded it to members of his caucus Wednesday evening.
“I thought she did a good job in making clear that the budget is not in good shape,” he said. “It was a wise move to set expectations, not just among legislators but among all the interest groups who might be planning to come forward with requests.”
Rep. Timm Ormsby, D-Spokane, chair of the House Appropriations Committee and Robinson’s budget-writing counterpart, said Wednesday he’s not sent any emails but tries to deliver a similar message when meeting with those in his caucus.
“We have in the past explained that we are in really tight times and are really discouraging member requests,” he said.
The operating budget Ferguson signed in May calls for $77.8 billion in spending over two years across government, including public schools and colleges, health care, social services, housing, corrections, and environmental protection. It also funds new two-year collective bargaining agreements with most, but not all, public employee unions.
It relied on about $4 billion from new and higher taxes and transfers from other accounts into the general fund, the central pot of money used to pay for most state spending. It projected the state would end the fiscal cycle with $225 million in cash reserves and $2 billion in its emergency, or rainy day, fund. 
That picture is evolving. The September forecast showed revenue fueling this budget will be $74.3 billion, including new and higher taxes that legislators and Ferguson approved.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Federal cuts, tariffs and the economic effects of the ongoing government shutdown further complicate the ledger as Ferguson and legislators prepare to make changes to the current budget in the 2026 session.
Ferguson will get the ball rolling with his proposal due in December. It will serve as a template for lawmakers in the 60-day session that begins Jan. 12.
“It’s really bad,” Robinson said. “I don’t walk around with a number in my head. It’s billions and it’s going to require cuts.”
If the fiscal challenge doesn’t deter a lawmaker from making a funding request, the prospect of a gubernatorial veto might.

WILMINGTON, Del. — Kurt Foreman, president and CEO of Delaware Prosperity Partnership, will step down at the end of November to become president of Ithaca Area Economic Development in upstate New York, closing out a tenure in which he helped solidify Delaware’s public-private model as a competitive force in business recruitment.
Foreman will take the helm of Ithaca Area Economic Development (IAED) in January 2026 following a national search. In his new role, he will lead business attraction, retention, and expansion efforts for Ithaca and Tompkins County, a region anchored by Cornell University and known for research, clean energy, technology, and advanced manufacturing. He will be responsible for setting IAED’s long-term strategy, guiding major capital and redevelopment projects, supporting existing employers, recruiting new companies and strengthening collaborations among higher education, local governments, workforce partners and private investors.
IAED board leaders have framed Foreman’s appointment as a move to position the region to compete more aggressively for high-quality jobs and innovation-driven investment. They point to his more than 30 years in economic development across several states, his experience working directly with site selectors and corporate decision-makers, and his record at Delaware Prosperity Partnership (DPP) as key factors in their decision.
Foreman has served as DPP’s president and CEO since 2018, following the organization’s creation in 2017 as Delaware’s statewide public-private economic development agency. Under his leadership, DPP reports that it has helped attract or support projects representing more than $3.5 billion in capital investment and thousands of jobs, while marketing Delaware as a nimble, business-friendly location and building stronger ties with employers and investors.
No announcement has been made about Foreman’s successor.
DPP board members and investors are scheduled to gather for their annual meeting Nov. 17 at CSC Station in Wilmington, where the leadership transition and the organization’s next phase are expected to be central topics of discussion. While DPP’s formal mission remains business recruitment, retention and expansion, many observers will be watching to see whether Gov. Matt Meyer and the board move to place greater emphasis on startup support and innovation-focused ventures as they shape the organization’s future direction.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/foreman-leaving.png,,,2025-11-06 18:01:39.496617

The ruling by U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell Jr. gave President Donald Trump’s administration until Friday to make the payments through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, though it’s unlikely the 42 million Americans — about 1 in 8, most of them in poverty — will see the money on the debit cards they use for groceries nearly that quickly.
The order was in response to a challenge from cities and nonprofits complaining that the administration was only offering to cover 65% of the maximum benefit, a decision that would have left some recipients getting nothing for this month.
“The defendants failed to consider the practical consequences associated with this decision to only partially fund SNAP,” McConnell said in a ruling from the bench after a brief hearing. “They knew that there would be a long delay in paying partial SNAP payments and failed to consider the harms individuals who rely on those benefits would suffer.”
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.
McConnell was one of two judges who ruled last week that the administration could not skip November’s benefits entirely because of the federal shutdown.
The Trump administration chose partial payments this week
Last month, the administration said that it would halt SNAP payments for November if the government shutdown wasn’t resolved.
A coalition of cities and nonprofits sued in federal court in Rhode Island and Democratic state officials from across the country did so in Massachusetts.
The judges in both cases ordered the government to use one emergency reserve fund containing more than $4.6 billion to pay for SNAP for November but gave it leeway to tap other money to make the full payments, which cost between $8.5 billion and $9 billion each month.
On Monday, the administration said it would not use additional money, saying it was up to Congress to appropriate the funds for the program and that the other money was needed to shore up other child hunger programs.
The partial funding brought on complications
McConnell harshly criticized the Trump administration for making that choice.
“Without SNAP funding for the month of November, 16 million children are immediately at risk of going hungry,” he said. “This should never happen in America. In fact, it’s likely that SNAP recipients are hungry as we sit here.”
Tyler Becker, the attorney for the government, unsuccessfully argued that the Trump administration had followed the court’s order in issuing the partial payments. “This all comes down to Congress not having appropriated funds because of the government shutdown,” he said.
Kristin Bateman, a lawyer for the coalition of cities and nonprofit organizations, told the judge the administration had other reasons for not fully funding the benefits.
“What defendants are really trying to do is to leverage people’s hunger to gain partisan political advantage in the shutdown fight,” Bateman told the court.
McConnell said last week’s order required that those payments be made “expeditiously” and “efficiently” — and by Wednesday — or a full payment would be required. “Nothing was done consistent with the court’s order to clear the way to expeditiously resolve it,” McConnell said.
There were other twists and turns this week
The administration said in a court filing on Monday that it could take weeks or even months for some states to make calculations and system changes to load the debit cards used in the SNAP program. At the time, it said it would fund 50% of the maximum benefits.
The next day, Trump appeared to threaten not to pay the benefits at all unless Democrats in Congress agreed to reopen the government. His press secretary later said that the partial benefits were being paid for November — and that it is future payments that are at risk if the shutdown continues.
And Wednesday night, it recalculated, telling states that there was enough money to pay for 65% of the maximum benefits.
Under a decades-old formula in federal regulations, everyone who received less than the maximum benefit would get a larger percentage reduction. Some families would have received nothing and some single people and two-person households could have gotten as little as $16.
Carmel Scaife, a former day care owner in Milwaukee who hasn’t been able to work since receiving multiple severe injuries in a car accident seven years ago, said she normally receives $130 a month from SNAP. She said that despite bargain hunting, that is not nearly enough for a month’s worth of groceries.
Scaife, 56, said that any cuts to her benefit will mean she will need to further tap her Social Security income for groceries. “That’ll take away from the bills that I pay,” she said. “But that’s the only way I can survive.”
The next legal step is unclear
This type of order is usually not subject to an appeal, but the Trump administration has challenged other rulings like it before.
An organization whose lawyers filed the challenge signaled it would continue the battle if needed.
“We shouldn’t have to force the President to care for his citizens,” Democracy Forward President and CEO Skye Perryman said in a statement, “but we will do whatever is necessary to protect people and communities.”
It often takes SNAP benefits a week or more to be loaded onto debit cards once states initiate the process.

May 13, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen is “not into the mood of negotiation” for a tobacco tax compact with the Omaha Tribe of Nebraska, coming as the tribe moves forward with medical cannabis and, eventually, recreational marijuana.
The comments came at an unrelated news conference Thursday where Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers, whom Pillen had appointed to negotiate a contract, also addressed the Omaha Tribe’s marijuana law and a tobacco tax compact. Pillen’s main opposition is the potential that the tribe pursues recreational marijuana after fully implementing medical cannabis.
“My view is really simple: There’s not going to be Nebraskans going into the Omaha Tribe and buying recreational marijuana,” Pillen said. “We’ll take whatever steps it is to keep our state in the values and keep that from happening.”

Asked how that would happen, Pillen directed questions to Hilgers but said the pair had some “early conversations” about dealing with the possible expansion to recreational marijuana on tribal lands. Pillen said he isn’t into “speculation.” Pillen did not say whether he wanted the state to prevent medical cannabis sales to Nebraska residents.
“When that time comes, we’ll figure out the right way and obviously make sure we’re doing it legally as well,” Pillen said of recreational marijuana.
Omaha Tribe Attorney General Cartier has alleged that in light of the tribal law on marijuana, Hilgers’ office shut down tax compact negotiations in “direct retaliation.”

In a Thursday statement, Carter said the state can’t dictate internal licensing on tribal lands and that the tribe would continue to work in “good faith” to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
“But we caution him [Pillen]: if he is relying solely on the attorney general’s flawed interpretation of the law, personal crusades are clouding his legal judgment as they have before,” Cartier said. “If the state continues to retaliate or attempts to block our lawful enterprise, we will defend our sovereignty through all available means.”

In July, the Omaha Tribe Council unanimously approved a law legalizing medical cannabis and adult-use recreational marijuana. Also this summer, the tribe reached out to Pillen to begin discussions on a tobacco tax compact. The state has one with the Santee Sioux Nation.
In short, such a compact would allow the Omaha Tribe to access hundreds of thousands of dollars in tobacco tax revenue currently all going to Nebraska. The Omaha Tribe has asked for 90% of taxes while also taking on some state regulatory duties to track tobacco sales and save the state money. The Santee Sioux have an agreement to retain 75%.
Cartier said that if Pillen prefers a 75-25 split similar to the Santee Sioux, the Omaha Tribe is prepared to accept that structure, which he said was already offered before. Another possible consideration could be the state budget, which already faces a significant projected deficit.
‘Poison’
Hilgers on Thursday and earlier this week said the state doesn’t have to enter into a compact with the Omaha Tribe. He described the agreement as an “arm’s length transaction” that would need to be “good for both sides” to be finalized.
One of the first things Hilgers learned as a “baby lawyer,” he said, was not to talk about private conversations or risk losing his credibility. He said he didn’t want to negotiate through the media and detested the negotiation tactics he felt Cartier and the Omaha Tribe were using.

Cartier previously said the Omaha Tribe was speaking out because the tribe wants to remain in the “driver’s seat” on an issue that could lead to economic development and workforce gains. The tribe also is focused on public health compliance and product testing, Cartier said.
“The people of Nebraska and the Omaha Tribe deserve decisions grounded in the actual law, not partisan or personal crusades,” Cartier said.
Hilgers said the deal he sees is of no benefit to Nebraska and that the real proposal before Nebraska is to accept what he called an “unlawful” medical and recreational marijuana “scheme.”
“We’re going to violate your law,” Hilgers said of the tribe’s position. “We’re going to sell a poison, contrary to your law, to your citizens. You’re going to have to deal with the fallout in the State of Nebraska.”
Tribal sovereignty
On Wednesday, Hilgers said that even if medical marijuana is available in Nebraska, it doesn’t mean “some dispensary in Alliance can just whip up a dispensary and just start selling.” Alliance, a city 334 miles west of the Omaha Tribe, is not a sovereign nation like the Omaha Tribe.

Hilgers said the Omaha Tribe was looking to “flaunt” or “thumb” its nose at Nebraska laws and “make life more difficult” in the Cornhusker State. He said he worried about “mental health fallout” from expanded marijuana and said a main concern is sales to nontribal citizens.
“If you are not a licensed dispensary or cultivator, you cannot operate in the medical marijuana world under current state statute,” Hilgers said.
Pillen and Hilgers have taken subtle differences in their approaches to medical cannabis, with Pillen providing some administrative support to the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission if it sticks to medical cannabis. Hilgers’ office had said it would sue the commission if it issued licenses. 
Though two cultivators were licensed last month, that lawsuit threat hasn’t yet materialized. At the news conferences, Pillen focused on recreational marijuana worries, while Hilgers spoke more broadly.
‘At their own peril’
Voter-passed state law allows patients to possess up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis in any form or THC level with any health care practitioner’s recommendation.
A second law leaves the regulation of “registered cannabis establishments” in the state to the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission. No transporters, product manufacturers or dispensaries are yet licensed.

The tribe seeks to operate on tribal lands, and tribal leaders have been cautious that whatever actions they pursue, they know Hilgers is watching. Cartier has said tobacco and marijuana are separate issues.
Nebraska voters overwhelmingly legalized medical cannabis in Nebraska and set up a regulatory system one year ago this week. It’s a decision Hilgers has openly opposed and said his office will seek to overturn. 
The AG has repeatedly argued Nebraska’s cannabis laws violate federal law, even as dozens of other states have medical cannabis programs on the books. 
The federal government has not challenged Nebraska’s laws, and Congress has repeatedly barred the U.S. Department of Justice from interfering with state medical cannabis laws.
Some Nebraskans hoping to get medical cannabis have looked to the Omaha Tribe as an escape valve and told the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission as much this week. 
Hilgers did not respond to a question Thursday of whether there was a difference between Nebraskans who ultimately go to the Omaha Tribe for medicine or are currently going to surrounding states for medical cannabis, including Colorado, South Dakota or Missouri.
Hilgers said anyone who goes to the tribe to buy marijuana will do so “at their own peril, and I would highly discourage them from doing that.”

(Photo: HUgh Jackson/Nevada Current)NV Energy estimates it overcharged customers at both ends of the state by a total of $65.4 million from 2002 through 2024, the company reported in response to an investigation by the Nevada Public Utilities Commission.
The utility initially acknowledged overcharging some 60,000 customers by roughly $17 million, the Current reported in May, but the utility later found through an audit it had overcharged another 20,000  “previously unidentified ‘multi-family accounts’ for an undisclosed amount.” 
NV Energy overcharges at least 80,000 customers, scrimps on refunds

It’s unknown how much of the money has been paid back. NV Energy first attempted to reimburse a portion of customers a total of $2.5 million, based on what PUC staff alleged was an inapplicable rule limiting reimbursement of overcharges to six months. 
A law passed by the Legislature this year in response to NV Energy’s failure to make customers whole requires that utilities pay back all overcharges with interest. Active customers will get a credit to their bills, while previous customers will receive a refund, according to the law. 
The overcharging began in 2002 when the company began to charge different electricity rates to single-family residential customers than those in multi-family units. The overcharges were primarily assessed to ratepayers in multi-family developments who were misclassified and charged the higher, single-family rate.  
The commission, as part of its investigation, ordered the utility to estimate the total dollar amount of overcharges to customers, including tax and other charges, between 2001 and 2025.  
From 2002 through 2017, NV Energy overcharged customers in Southern Nevada by $27.4 million, and overcharged ratepayers in Northern Nevada by $17.7 million, the utility said Wednesday in its response to the PUC. 
The estimates were determined by using the average amount of electricity from the date the units were misclassified, without any deduction for disconnections or vacancies, NV Energy wrote in a response filed Wednesday. 
“As a result, the estimate likely overstates the actual amount of overcharges that occurred,” the company wrote Wednesday.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/clarkstncropped-1024x620.jpg,,,2025-11-06 18:01:39.496617

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Polk County pledged Thursday to allocate $1 million to local food organizations during the lapse in funding for federal nutrition programs.
Due to a lawsuit, the federal government is set to partially fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program during the shutdown, but experts say the rollout of these partial payments could take weeks. 
Polk County Supervisor Matt McCoy said Thursday that SNAP recipients don’t know when that money will show up in their accounts. 
“Because this is fluid, and because people are concerned about where their food will come from, they’re hitting the food banks now,” McCoy said.
“We hope (the administration) will fund this program, but until that happens, we need an immediate infusion of cash. And the check is cut from Polk County, and it will go out the door immediately.”
Kathy Underhill, the CEO of Des Moines Area Religious Council or DMARC, said Polk County is “living up” to its tagline: “leading the way.” 
“I know that all of our partners in the DMARC network are seeing increased need; in fact Monday, we broke our 50-year record, Tuesday, we broke that record,” Underhill said. 
As visitors wait in lines, or in the waiting room to visit the pantry, Underhill said staff are able to tell them: “We will have food for you, do not worry. Be patient, there is food.” 
“And Polk County is ensuring that we can keep saying that, and we’re just so grateful,” Underhill said.

Polk County’s funds
The Board of Supervisors voted unanimously on the $1 million allocation during a special session meeting Thursday. 
The majority, $750,000, will go to Food Bank of Iowa, which serves 55 Iowa counties. DMARC, Polk County’s largest food pantry, will receive $230,000 and Caring Hands, a community organization with a food pantry in Altoona, will receive the remaining $20,000. 
McCoy said the $1 million came from “interest earning” dollars the county had that were not allocated to a budget. McCoy said the county also budgets $5 million annually to support county-run food pantries, a commodity supplement food program, community meals and home delivered meals for seniors and qualifying adults. 
Tami Nielsen, president and CEO of the Food Bank of Iowa, said the food bank serves more than 200 partners in Polk County alone, and that during “regular times” the food bank delivers four full trucks of food, five days a week, to these partners. 


Food security vocabulary:
Food bank: A broader coalition that transports large quantities of food within a given region. There are six food banks serving Iowa.
Food pantry: The drive-by windows, charitable closets,  free grocery store setups and the like that serve individuals experiencing hunger.
SNAP eligibility: The gross income limit for SNAP eligibility in Iowa is 160% of the federal poverty level, which is $25,040 for a single individual or $51,440 for a family of four.


“Now, our partners are seeing some community members visit them for the very first time, people who have never before visited a pantry and are understandably worried about how to keep food on the table,” Nielsen said. 
In addition to new visitors, she said food pantries and feeding centers have noted an increased frequency from some visitors, because the “hard times just got harder.” 
According to McCoy, the county’s allocation will be enough to purchase roughly 473,000 pounds of food for the county. Nielsen said the Food Bank of Iowa serves nearly a million pounds of food on average each month to Polk County partners. 
“This extra million dollars going into Polk County is — we are so grateful for it, because the need has skyrocketed,” Nielsen said. 
The $1 million from the county is earmarked specifically for food procurement at the receiving organizations.
While the board voted unanimously to pass the measure, Supervisor Angela Connolly first proposed an amendment to make the allocation $1.5 million instead. Connolly said the additional half a million dollars would help to cover some of the administration costs the organizations face, like increased staffing and drivers. 
“It costs money to ramp up,” Connolly said. “They’re all, I’m sure, grateful for what we’re doing, but they are under the gun getting this food out as quickly as possible.” 
The amendment failed 2-3 with Connolly and Tom Hockensmith voting for the measure. 
McCoy said the board will meet again in two weeks “to evaluate where we are” and can decide then if another $500,000 is necessary. 
Nielsen said the food bank has operational costs of $0.32 per pound of food delivered. She said there will be costs associated with the distribution of additional food that the bank will “have to absorb.”
Iowa receives roughly $45 million in SNAP benefits each month to serve the nearly 270,000 enrolled individuals in the state. Polk County has close to 50,000 SNAP recipients each month.
Gov. Kim Reynolds dedicated $1 million in state funds to match monetary donations made at Iowa food banks. The $1 million match was spread among Iowa’s six food banks depending on the number of SNAP recipients in the food banks’ areas. 
McCoy said the suspension of SNAP funds is an “extraordinary time.” 
“Exceptional times call for exceptions to policies and finding dollars that are available,” McCoy said. “We would encourage all the partners in government at the state and local level to do what they can to step up.” 
Recipients set to receive about 65% of max benefits
On Monday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said recipients would receive 50% of SNAP benefits for the month, as a result of a lawsuit from cities and nonprofits against the Trump administration. The same coalition of cities and nonprofits that sued USDA to release the funds, said the 50% calculation was incorrect. 
The department’s initial calculation would have spent $3 billion from a USDA contingency fund, but the court required the department to spend all $4.65 billion from the fund. 
USDA department officials responded to the error in the court filings Wednesday and said instead that maximum SNAP allotments for November would be 65% of typical maximum allotments. 
The partial distributions would be calculated by subtracting 30% of the recipient’s net income from 65% of their typical SNAP allocation. 
An analysis of USDA’s updated benefit allotment tables from the Iowa Hunger Coalition found that a family of five that typically receives $597 in SNAP benefits, would instead receive $183. Some households, the coalition said, would receive no allotment under the new guidelines.
Iowa Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment on the status or expected timeline of distributing benefits in the state. 
President Donald Trump posted on social media, following the initial order to partially fund SNAP, that the benefits would be “given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!” 
Citing the president’s post, U.S. District Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. in Rhode Island, on Thursday, ordered the Trump administration to pay the full $9 billion in SNAP benefits for the month of November. The administration has not yet responded to the order.  
“Washington is broken, and when Washington is broken, we have to step up and do what we need to do at the local level,” McCoy said. “That’s what we’re doing today.”

Brandon Prichard, R-Bismarck, attends a special session of the Legislature on Oct. 23, 2023. (Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)A former North Dakota lawmaker is seeking to overturn a state law that makes it a crime to lie or make intentionally misleading statements in political ads.
Brandon Prichard, who represented Bismarck in the Legislature in 2023 and 2024, on Tuesday filed a federal lawsuit challenging the state’s corrupt practices law, claiming that it violates the First Amendment.
The Republican is a controversial figure in North Dakota politics in part for his attacks on incumbent Republican lawmakers.
Prichard says he’s been subjected to multiple investigations under the law, which makes it a class A misdemeanor to knowingly or with “reckless disregard for its truth or falsity” publish something false or misleading about a candidate or ballot measure. 
He claims the investigations are baseless, but that they’ve caused him to self-censor for fear of further legal repercussions.
“I’m not opposed to there being some regulations on egregious political speech that defames people,” Prichard said in an interview Thursday with the North Dakota Monitor. “But what we have here is something that’s overly broad.”
Bill seeks to strengthen North Dakota law against false political ads

Prichard’s political action committee, Citizens Alliance of North Dakota, is also listed as a plaintiff in the case.
The lawsuit names Attorney General Drew Wrigley, Burleigh County State’s Attorney Julie Lawyer as well as the North Dakota Ethics Commission and its executive director, Rebecca Binstock, as defendants. 
In court documents, Prichard claims he and his wife, Kathryn Prichard, are under investigation by the Burleigh County State’s Attorney’s Office for alleged violations of the corrupt practices law. The lawsuit doesn’t contain specifics about what prompted the inquiry.
Prichard also references in the suit a cease and desist letter he received from an attorney for Rep. Jason Dockter, R-Bismarck. The letter claimed Citizens Alliance of North Dakota violated the corrupt practices statute by funding a billboard that said Dockter stole North Dakotans’ money, the lawsuit says.  
Prichard says the billboard was referencing the fact that in 2024, a Burleigh County jury convicted Dockter of a conflict-of-interest misdemeanor for voting on legislation that he had a financial interest in. Dockter was not charged with stealing money.
The lawsuit says Prichard has also had multiple North Dakota Ethics Commission complaints filed against him under the statute. That includes an active complaint filed against him in 2023 and two others filed against him and Citizens Alliance of North Dakota in 2024 that have since been dismissed, according to the complaint.
Prichard believes the 2023 complaint accuses him of lying about his residency and student status while serving as a state representative. The Ethics Commission keeps details about complaints confidential unless they’re found to be substantiated and the accused has a chance to appeal, so the content of the complaints cannot be corroborated.
Prichard caught criticism in 2023 after he publicly described himself as a law student at the University of Minnesota. Prichard was an undergraduate student at the university at the time, though not enrolled in the law school.
He also says that even though he was a University of Minnesota student, he still lived in his legislative district.
Prichard to decline recount, likely losing House seat

Prichard notes in the lawsuit that legislative candidate Duane Sand was accused of violating the corrupt practices statute in 2018. 
Burleigh County prosecutors charged Sand with publication of false information in political advertisements after opponent George Keiser filed a police report alleging Sand had misstated the incumbent’s voting record, The Bismarck Tribune reported.
Sand later made police reports accusing Keiser and others of breaking the same law. Prosecutors dropped the charge against Sand after all involved reached a private settlement and agreed to stop pursuing the complaints.
During the 2025 legislative session, lawmakers amended the corrupt practices law to include not only things like political mailers and billboards, but also statements made through phone calls, texts and social media.
Sen. Sean Cleary, a Bismarck Republican who was campaign manager for U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak, introduced the amendment that added text messages and phone calls. On the day of the June 2024 primary, anonymous text messages falsely claimed that Fedorchak had dropped out of the five-way race.
Prichard testified during the session that the Legislature should repeal the law entirely or at least make it less restrictive.
He said that the proper way to deal with false political speech is to counter it with truthful speech.
“The other option is you’re going to use the forceful hand of the government to say what’s true and what’s not,” he told the Monitor.
Pat Finken, a retired North Dakota political consultant, said he supports the law. 
“I think that accountability in that way is necessary,” he said. “The bottom of that downward slide is a pretty ugly place if you can say anything you want without any kind of accountability.”
The lawsuit on Thursday was assigned to U.S. District Court Judge Dan Traynor.
The Attorney General’s Office on Thursday afternoon said it had not yet reviewed the complaint.
Binstock, the North Dakota Ethics Commission’s executive director, said to her knowledge the commission had not been served with the lawsuit and that the commission does not comment on pending litigation. 
The Burleigh County State’s Attorney’s Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“He calls himself a cultural documentarian. He says it a bit tongue-in-cheek, but that is really what he is,” said Rowell's friend Sara Tucker, who is publishing the career-spanning photo book locally.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Jack Rowell’s portrait of Vermont, 5 decades in the making.","One of Rowell’s earliest photos, “Man on the Midway” (1973), serves as the cover photo for his new photo book. Photo courtesy of Jack Rowell
This story by Isabel Dreher was first published in The Herald on Nov. 6, 2025.
Photographer Jack Rowell is on the verge of releasing his magnum opus — that’s what his publisher calls it, anyway, he said. The project is a 121-page book of photos, an epic of Rowell’s favorite images of his career.
“It gave me an opportunity to archive what I’ve done for the past 55 years, which I never would’ve done,” he said. “It’s my legacy, and I hope people like it.”
Sara Tucker, who owns a local book publishing company, Korongo Books, is publishing Rowell’s photography book. “He calls himself a cultural documentarian. He says it a bit tongue-in-cheek, but that is really what he is,” she said. “As a photographer, he has documented and preserved part of Vermont culture.”
Tucker and Rowell went to high school together and their professional relationship is built on decades of friendship. For Tucker, as a lover of stories, having a local publishing company is a way to share the important stories of Vermont. That, she says, is exactly what Rowell does.
“I think its important for individuals to give us their perspective on a given period of time and place,” she said. “His perspective on the 50 years that he’s been largely a documentary photographer is an important part of our story. So in sharing it, he’s sharing a part of our common heritage, and it’s important to capture that and preserve it.” Rowell speaks with a thoughtfulness gained by decades of observing people around him. It’s something he’s done through the lens and beyond, evidenced in his ability to share detailed stories of every face on the pages of his book.
The coffee table-style book, which will be released on November 22, has taken Rowell three years to compile. While he gives high praise and credit to his publisher and designer, much of the beginning of the process was undertaken alone as he went through decades upon decades of archived photos, including the thousands of rolls of film that dominated his career until the early 2000s.
One notable photo, unearthed from the depths, was one he called “Man on the Midway,” an image that Rowell took at the Tunbridge Fair in 1973. Centered in the frame is the figure of a man with one hand stuffed in the pocket of his large coat. A cigarette hangs lazily out of his mouth, in contrast with the intensity of his eyes, bordered by the lines etched in skin from the sun and smiles that are trademarks of the life of a hard-working Vermonter. A cap is pulled low on his forehead.
The photo’s publication potential though, was not always guaranteed. It suffered damage in its time as a negative that Rowell said he wouldn’t have been able to repair before Photoshop came along. “Somehow I knocked that negative onto the floor and stepped on it, and it had these huge gouges. I mean, the emulsion was literally gone. … It was just black,” he said.
“It’s a very powerful image,” Rowell said. “It was the last photo on the roll. … We used to hand roll our own film then, and where the film would stick out and you’d attach it to the cassette would get exposed, so it was white. You can almost see a little bit of that white there.” He ran his finger along the top of the photo.
One of the things that makes that image, and, in fact, many of Rowell’s photos, so striking, is the way he captures his subjects’ faces. “Remember,” he said, “the eyes are the key.”
Life with Fred
In the 1990s, Rowell became an associate producer on “Man With a Plan,” John O’Brien’s 1996 film about Fred Tuttle, the real-life Tunbridge farmer and his fictional run for U.S. Congress. Tuttle occupies his fair share of pages in Rowell’s book.
“This was before the movie came out,” he said, poring over one of the book’s final pages, an image of Fred Tuttle in front of the U.S. Capitol building, which ultimately became a movie poster for “Man With a Plan.”
“We went to D.C., and we did it just in time too, because they replaced parts of the dome after that, and the Capitol was shrouded. This was all scaffolding,” he pointed to the grand white dome behind Tuttle. “I posed Fred on a knoll in front of the Capitol, and I had some trouble dealing with light, because it was sunny out, but then it got a little overcast.”
After the release of the film, Tuttle did actually make a run for U.S. Congress during which Rowell continue to photograph him, including for People Magazine. Tuttle ended up endorsing incumbent Patrick Leahy and losing the race.
Shifting style
Rowell grew up in Groton, moving to Randolph by the time he started high school. He was a heavy drinker and smoker, but gave up both vices decades ago. 
Later in his career, Rowell began to focus more on studio photography. He has a small studio in Randolph, and the latter half of his book features many photos taken there or in other studios nearby. Rowell said his photos became more focused after he stopped drinking, and many of those shots represent that time.
However, Rowell has always stuck with a mantra about his favorite photographic subjects. “I just came up with this once when this artsy-fartsy type asked me. … My favorite things to photograph, that would have to be big fish and good looking women,” he said. 
When asked if that was really true or just something he likes to say, Rowell gave a shrug. “Its kinda true,” he answered with a laugh.
Bringing ‘Jack Rowell Photographs’ to life
The photos in the book span from 1973 to 2025. Some of his first-ever photos are featured, like one of a pair of laughing men perched on the back of a garbage truck, taken in Braintree when Rowell was 18. The most recent photo in the book was taken in May of this year, and features Mary Frances Leahy playing fiddle at at the Chandler Music Hall. The 19-year-old daughter of Celtic fiddler extraordinaire Natalie MacMaster (whom Rowell has photographed many times and who is also featured in the book), Leahy stretches across a wide frame with her right arm extended away from her fiddle, the bow blurred as she quickly draws it far from the strings. Her body is angled, almost as if in a triumphant bow, but her gentle smile looks proud as she keeps eye contact with the audience. As Rowell says, the eyes are the key.
It was important to everyone, Tucker said, to keep the book’s production as local as possible. She was able to find a printer in Lewiston, Maine. As of publishing, the books are available for pre-order and cost $85 dollars each through the end of the year.
“Photography is [Jack’s] thing. It defines him, but he’s also incredibly generous as a person and as a photographer. It’s all one thing, meaning his art, his photography, really does serve the community,” Tucker said. “The people he’s interested in are people who are doing an outstanding job at something, or they’re just very intriguing interesting people who have caught his attention.
“And so his instinct is to tell the world about what he finds valuable,” she continued, “and to me, that’s a very generous act, and he does a beautiful job.”
The White River Craft Center in Randolph will host a launch party on November 22 from 2–5 p.m. Preordered books will be available then for pickup and may be signed by Rowell at the party.

“There is work that just got approved for the bid with the federal government, and I would expect that the second phase will be ready in the first part of the new year,” Pillen said.

He offered the update Thursday at an unrelated news conference, telling reporters he had talked this week to McCook Mayor Linda Taylor. 
A group of McCook residents led by former State Sen. DiAnna Schimek of Lincoln have filed legal action to stop the center from serving as an ICE hub. A Red Willow County District Court judge denied a request to halt the project while the case works through the judicial process. 
A spokesman for American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska said advocates meanwhile are on alert and will monitor the access migrants at the McCook center have to legal counsel, health care and language services as they await or fight deportation proceedings.
ACLU spokesman Sam Petto lamented that “Nebraska has signed up to be part of a mass detention and deportation program” that advocates have seen “separate families, violate people’s rights and create fear in our communities.”
He referred to a high-profile ICE-led worksite immigration raid in Omaha in June, saying that South Omaha merchants and families continue to feel negative impact and fear of increased ICE presence. 
Attorneys from ACLU, the Omaha-based Center for Immigrant and Refugee Advancement and more stepped in to help many of the more than 70 undocumented workers detained during that raid. Those migrants were held in a Lincoln County jail in North Platte, in space leased by ICE. Immigrant advocates expect access to be worse in the state-federal McCook facility.

“This is a bizarre set up of a state-owned and -operated ICE detention center,” said Petto. “We’re going to make sure, as best we can, that people’s rights are respected inside that facility and that there is access to counsel and that there is appropriate oversight.”
He said many questions remain about the McCook facility and that access will be “stress tested” over the next few months.
At least some of the ICE detainees in McCook came or are coming from the Polk County jail in Iowa, Petto said. Information on who is being held at the facility is less forthcoming than in county jails, he said.
On Thursday, a spokesperson for Nebraska Corrections said inquiries regarding detainees should be directed to the federal ICE media office. She also said that, for security reasons, the state’s renovation plans would not be shared at this time.
Monday, Pillen had said he expected the McCook facility to start accepting its first detainees this week. He and others are calling the repurposed facility the “Cornhusker Clink,” a place the governor described as a Midwestern hub for ICE. 
About 186 male state prisoners had been held at the state’s low-security Work Ethnic Camp, receiving rehabilitative programming and performing work in the community before Nebraska officials reached out to the Trump administration to offer ICE detention space.
The planned conversion of the facility was announced Aug. 19. The WEC inmates have since been transferred to other state facilities, with a small portion discharged or paroled. 
Pillen’s office has estimated the contract with the feds would annually net Nebraska about $14.25 million. The Work Ethic Camp had an annual operating cost of $10.2 million. ICE has also agreed to also pay Nebraska a one-time lump sum of $5.9 million for “facility renovations.”

(Photo by Don Petersen/Associated Press)A new Trump administration rule issued late last month would override state laws that prevent consumers’ credit reports from including medical debt, potentially weakening financial protections for millions of Americans.
In recent years, more than a dozen states have taken steps to keep medical debt from hurting residents’ credit scores, passing laws with bipartisan support. But new guidance from the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau repeals a Biden-era rule that allowed states to impose their own bans. The Trump administration has interpreted the 1970 Fair Credit Reporting Act to say that it overrides state laws around reporting debt to credit bureaus.
American consumers had at least $220 billion in unpaid medical bills in 2024, according to an analysis from research nonprofit KFF. About 6% of American adults, or 14 million people, owe more than $1,000 in medical debt.
“Medical debt is a tremendous weight keeping so many families from financial security, and, unlike most other forms of debt, it’s not a choice,” North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, said last month in a statement announcing that a new state program had wiped out more than $6.5 billion in medical debt for more than 25 million North Carolinians.
People rarely plan to take on debt from medical care, as they do when they borrow money to buy a house or car. A one-time or short-term expense such as a single hospital stay causes about two-thirds of all medical debt, according to a 2022 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau report.
And even though most Americans have health insurance, many get stuck with unexpected medical bills because their policies have high deductibles or don’t fully cover some treatments, procedures or drugs. People in worse health and those living with a disability are more likely to report medical debt, as are middle-aged adults, Black Americans, and people with low and middle incomes, according to KFF.
In the past two years, a dozen states have passed laws forbidding medical debt from appearing on credit reports, bringing the total number of states with such laws to 14: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.
Another five states — Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Nevada and Utah — limit how and when medical debt can appear on credit reports, according to the nonprofit Commonwealth Fund.
Republican and Democratic legislators in other states, including Michigan, Ohio and South Dakota, have introduced similar bills this year.
Now the new state laws face an uncertain future. In January, while Biden was still in office,  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finalized a rule prohibiting credit reporting agencies from reporting medical debt in certain circumstances. Credit bureaus and credit unions sued to stop the rule. The incoming Trump administration agreed with the plaintiffs and declined to defend the rule in court, so a federal judge blocked it.
Maine state Sen. Donna Bailey, a Democrat, said in a September statement that Maine’s new law barring medical debt from appearing on consumer reports was even more important in light of the demise of the federal rule.
“Although Americans no longer have the federal protection, Mainers will continue to have protection here in our state,” she said in September. “When we go to the hospital for medical care, especially for emergencies, any debt that we take on should not hold us back from buying a car, renting a home or taking out a loan.”
But the Trump administration’s latest order would render state laws such as Maine’s moot.

Republican lawmakers on Monday called on Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to broaden the upcoming special session agenda and de-emphasize looming federal spending cuts. (Patrick Lohmann / Source NM) New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said Thursday she would call lawmakers into a special session to extend food benefits to New Mexico residents reliant on federal food aid.
At the end of October, the governor and state legislators announced $30 million in state funding to compensate for SNAP after the United States Department of Agriculture announced it would not pay Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits during the federal shutdown. Federal judges since then have ordered the Trump administration to pay out the benefits, but they remain delayed and are expected to be less than usual.
The $30 million appropriation runs out on Monday.
A news release from the governor’s office said the special session is expected to last one day. It will be the second time the governor has called state lawmakers into session to address federal fallout from reduced appropriations for benefit programs. During the three-day session that began Oct. 1, lawmakers ultimately passed an approximate $162 million spending package to compensate for health care and food assistance cuts at the federal level
That’s a wrap: Special session ends with funding for health care, food assistance and more

In a statement Thursday, the governor—who is currently attending the U.N. Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Brazil— said the state “acted fast in October when the Trump administration abandoned New Mexican families, and now the legislature is coming back to finish the job. We are fortunate that several years of economic prosperity and sound fiscal management have enabled us to support New Mexicans in this time of need. However, we will not be able to fund these state supplements forever. Republicans in Congress need to come back to the table to end the longest government shut down in American history and get everyone back to work.”
Approximately 460,000 New Mexico residents receive SNAP benefits. In their absence, food banks across the state have reported a spike in clients.

“Our responsibility is to ensure that families don’t go hungry waiting for this essential nutrition program to resume,” Health Care Authority Kari Armijo said in a statement. “This special session will allow us to continue serving New Mexicans while federal funding for the SNAP program remains uncertain.”
Democratic legislative leaders Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth and House Speaker Javier Martínez, of Santa Fe and Albuquerque, respectively, both backed the special session in statements provided in a news release from the governor’s office.
“No New Mexican should go hungry because of inaction and uncertainty in Washington D.C.,” Wirth said. “The legislature is ready to step up again to ensure our families have the food assistance they need.”
State Republican legislative leaders, however, said congressional Democrats are to blame for the federal shutdown and the lost benefits and called out New Mexico’s two U.S. senators in particular.
“Ben Ray Luján and Martin Heinrich have made it crystal clear: They don’t care about you,” Senate Republican Leader Bill Sharer (R-Farmington) said in a statement. “They have repeatedly prioritized party politics over serving their constituents back home. While we’ve seen their antics before, Senators Luján and Heinrich have set a new low by holding the hard-working people of New Mexico hostage as political pawns for their partisan theatrics, forcing state lawmakers to have to shoulder the cost so that vulnerable New Mexicans can put food on their tables for the holidays.”
House Republican Leader Gail Armstrong (R-Magdalena), issued a comparable statement that said Luján and Heinrich “are refusing to fund SNAP benefits for the neediest New Mexicans. I would much prefer the Governor use her authority and influence to urge our Senate delegation to end this crisis by voting to reopen the federal government. Instead, they are holding vulnerable New Mexicans hostage for political leverage.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/roundhousepat-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-06 18:01:39.496617

(Courtesy of the Backemeyer campaign)LINCOLN — Democrats have another candidate in eastern Nebraska’s 1st Congressional District primary. 
Former U.S. State Department diplomat Chris Backemeyer will face renewable energy advocate Eric Moyer in the Democratic primary. Both are vying to challenge Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Flood. 
“Frankly, I see our country is just going really in the wrong direction,” said Backemeyer. 
Backemeyer has worked for the State Department for 20 years in Washington, D.C., with a focus on counterterrorism, economic policy and the Middle East. He moved back to Lincoln last month after accepting a buyout from the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, which thinned out the ranks of the federal bureaucracy in the early days of the second Trump administration.

He said he felt there was “no mission or purpose left” in working for the State Department after the DOGE cuts, and that serving in Congress was the only way to push back against Trump’s approach to governing. Backmeyer’s pitch to voters is a moderate focus on affordability, reasserting congressional authority over tariffs and addressing rising health care prices and the national debt. 
“Both parties are moving in opposite directions … I think there’s a lot of people in the middle that just want good … middle-of-the-road policies that will solve the problems that they see on a day-to-day basis,” Backemyer said.
Whoever emerges from the Democratic primary will most likely face Flood, who as yet has no GOP opponent and has won his past two elections by 20 and 16 percentage points, in a seat considered safely Republican by the nonpartisan Center for Politics, The Cook Political Report and Inside Elections. 
The 1st District comprises 12 Nebraska counties, including heavily Democratic Lancaster County, which is often drowned out by the region’s more conservative rural areas.

Backemeyer said while it will be a “tough race,” the district being considered a safe seat isn’t a good reason not to “get into the fight.” He pointed to his work at the State Department as an example of his being able to work with people regardless of political differences. 
One of Backemeyer’s areas of emphasis as a diplomat was Iran. He was a senior State Department negotiator for Obama’s Iran nuclear deal in 2015. During Trump’s first term, He was replaced by Andrew L. Peek in 2017 as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Iranian Affairs and moved to a new role. Trump withdrew from the nuclear agreement in 2018. 
Backemeyer was also a national security advisor to former Vice President Kamala Harris. 
Daniel Bass, a spokesperson for the Flood campaign, criticized his work with former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris. He said Backemeyer has “spent more of his life in Washington than in Nebraska, so it’s no surprise that he was inspired to run by coastal Democrat wins this week.” 
“Meanwhile, Mike Flood has fought for Nebraskans,” Bass said. “To represent us, you have to be one of us.”
 During Flood’s Lincoln town hall in August, Backemeyer asked Flood a question: “Who do you work for?” referring to his vote on Trump’s “big beautiful bill.” He used it as a part of his campaign lunch video. The Flood campaign pointed out that Backemeyer was still living in D.C. at the time.

Moyer, asked about a new opponent, said the entrance of another Democratic candidate in the race validates that there is “no such thing as a safe congressional seat when Donald Trump’s failed policies are on the ballot.” 
“My campaign is building momentum throughout the district, and a competitive primary will serve the people of Nebraska well,” Moyer said 
Backemeyer said a competitive Democratic primary will only make the Democratic nominee stronger. He said he respects Moyer, but argues his experience in Washington prepares him for Congress. 
“I’ve been working on some of the country’s most difficult national security challenges … I’ve briefed presidents and vice presidents and secretaries of state. I think I have the ability to hit the ground running,” said Backemeyer.

Jeremy Moss, the first openly gay state senator in Michigan, has introduced a resolution in the Senate to put a proposal on the ballot that would remove Michigan’s constitutional ban on same-sex marriage.  “Our constitution should reflect the values of our state, and same-sex couples should be granted the same protections as heterosexual […]","Senate Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair Jeremy Moss (D-Southfield) hears testimony on a bill cutting back on incoming changes to Michigan's earned sick time law during a Feb. 11, 2025 meeting. | Kyle DavidsonState Sen. Jeremy Moss, the first openly gay state senator in Michigan, has introduced a resolution in the Senate to put a proposal on the ballot that would remove Michigan’s constitutional ban on same-sex marriage. 
“Our constitution should reflect the values of our state, and same-sex couples should be granted the same protections as heterosexual couples,” the Bloomfield Township Democrat said in a press release from his office.
Moss’ resolution removes language in Article 1 of the state Constitution that defines the only legally recognized marriage as “the union of one man and one woman in marriage,” as well as removing gendered language from the section of the constitution that deals with estates between spouses. 
The resolution comes as the U.S. Supreme Court will consider Friday whether to take up a case that seeks to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in 2015. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Even a decade after the landmark marriage equality decision, the LGBTQ+ community still faces increasingly hostile attacks, including a renewed political movement to re-ban same-sex marriage,” Moss said in the press release. “This effort will soon reach the Supreme Court for review. Regardless of the outcome of Court action, it’s well past time to remove the discriminatory and, as of now, unconstitutional marriage ban language in our state’s constitution.” 
If the nation’s highest court does decide to take the case, and does overturn the Obergefell decision, same-sex marriage would become illegal in Michigan, though the 2022 Respect for Marriage Act would ensure that previous marriages, as well as same-sex marriages in other states, would have to be recognized by the state. 
“In the 10 years since marriage equality became the law of the land, one thing has become abundantly clear: granting same-sex couples the right to marry, start a family, and build a life here in Michigan has brought hope and joy to so many in our communities, while hurting absolutely no one,” Attorney General Dana Nessel said in the press release from Moss. “We cannot take these rights for granted.”
Moss’s resolution mirrors a similar resolution put forward by State Rep. Jason Morgan (D-Ann Arbor) in March, which would also put same-sex marriage on the ballot. That came just after State Rep. Josh Schriver (R-Oxford) introduced his own resolution condemning Obergefell and urging the Supreme Court to overturn the decision. 
Moss made headlines when he sat in on Schriver’s press conference on the resolution — and took over answering questions from the press after Schriver left.

“I think that people respect their LGBTQ neighbors, their LGBTQ family members. These marriages have been the law of the land for 10 years,” he said at that time. 
The Senate resolution has been referred to the Senate Committee on Civil Rights, Judiciary and Public Safety to be debated. Morgan’s House resolution was referred to the Committee on Government Operations — sometimes known as where bills go to die — shortly after its introduction in March, where it still sits. 
In order to make it onto the ballot, the resolution would need to pass with a two-thirds majority in both chambers.

Democrats voted at disproportionately high levels across New Mexico in the local elections that concluded earlier this week, according to a Source New Mexico analysis. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Tuesday’s statewide local elections were for nonpartisan races, but a Source New Mexico analysis shows New Mexico Democratic voters showed up at the polls at disproportionately high rates. 
Consider this: Even though Democrats comprise 43% of New Mexico’s registered voters, they made up 53% of the voters who cast ballots in elections this week.
That pattern is true in 32 of 33 counties in New Mexico, where Democrats turned out at rates higher than registration statistics would suggest, according to a Source New Mexico analysis. 
Even in an off-year election in which voters cast ballots in nonpartisan races, Democrats showing up at a disproportionately high rate shows their enthusiasm, Gabe Sanchez, a University of New Mexico political science professor, told Source New Mexico on Thursday. 
“We’re seeing the same trends nationally, like Democrats had a huge night across the country on Tuesday, and a lot of that was higher turnout in those jurisdictions the last time around,” Sanchez said. “New Mexico tends to follow, in many cases, national patterns.”
Energized Dems trumpet wins in state elections, buckle up for midterms

Democrats made up 53% of roughly 350,000 New Mexico voters who cast ballots in Tuesday’s election. In some counties, they turned out at rates 10 or more percentage points higher than their registration statistics. 
Republicans, on the other hand, made up 31.7% of the voters in the election this week, slightly less than the 31.9% they comprise of all statewide registered voters. They overperformed their registration in just 22 counties, as well. 
As for voters who don’t belong to the two major political parties, including members of third parties and those who decline to register with a party, they represent about 26.5% of statewide voters but only about 15% of those who voted in the recent elections. 
According to Source’s analysis, Lea County was the only county in the state where Democrats constituted a smaller proportion of voters on Tuesday when compared to county-wide registration. The difference is small: About 18.3% of Lea County’s registered voters are Democrats versus a 17.6% Democratic turnout.
Sanchez, who said Source’s analysis was a reasonable way to gauge enthusiasm, said he wasn’t all that surprised to hear Lea County stood alone in that respect.
“That county has always been a little bit of an outlier, but it’s hard to draw a lot of conclusions from it,” he said. “I’ve always said I felt like that area has been the most sensitive to seeing Trump on or off the ballot.” 
Republicans far outnumber Democrats in Lea County, which sits in the Permian Basin, and Sanchez said the county’s turnout depends heavily on whether Trump is on the ballot. That’s less true in other counties, based on his experience.
The story the Democratic turnout tells in the rest of the state, he said, is one being told across the country, with Democrats winning races up and down the ballot.

(Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)I’ve never been one to sit still. As a youth, I was a gymnast and figure skater, and competed in the World Cheerleading & Dance Championships. Today, I’m an avid rock climber, biker, and skier. As a young adult, I studied computer engineering and management science, worked at some of the biggest tech firms, and helped launch one of the first mobile analytics platforms.
As mobile technologies took off, I realized I could combine my passions for fitness and technology, and co-founded an app business that offers free and affordable personalized fitness coaching. Our app is AI-powered and expert-led, and has helped members log millions of exercise minutes.
But there’s a new challenge on the horizon. This year, lawmakers across the U.S. have introduced nearly 1,000 bills regulating AI, and several states have already passed new AI laws. To be clear, I’m in favor of AI regulation. The challenge is that the new and proposed laws vary widely from state to state, which means independent app developers like me will have to navigate scores of different compliance requirements. As more states pass AI laws, we’ll face an increasingly complex regulatory patchwork that’s likely to raise costs, slow innovation, and make it harder for people to access our app. We’d be much better served by smart, comprehensive, national AI legislation.
My company’s mission is to help people live stronger, healthier lives — and AI plays a vital role in our work. For example, we offer video-based AI-assisted feedback on members’ exercise technique. That helps them maximize their workouts’ effectiveness and minimize their chance of injury, and means millions of people can access the kind of personalized training long reserved for elite athletes and affluent individuals.
We’re always thinking about integrating new AI tools to make our app even more helpful and accessible. But a patchwork of state AI laws could make that much harder. Utah’s law takes a light-touch approach, requiring only AI-use disclosures. But our customers come from across the country, and many states’ laws are likely to be far more demanding. The Colorado AI Act, for instance, requires costly audits for some companies that develop or use AI. The Colorado AI Act is an ambitious, well-motivated effort to mitigate AI’s risks. That’s a good thing. My concern is that if lawmakers in numerous states enact different but similarly ambitious AI laws, they’ll inadvertently snare small developers in a tangle of complex regulations and high costs.
In the European Union, requirements similar to those in Colorado typically cost businesses tens of thousands of dollars to implement. Small developers, many of whom are self-funded, will struggle to pay those costs in even one state. If multiple states adopt such requirements, it will quickly become prohibitively expensive for entrepreneurs to launch and grow AI-powered startups.
Even tracking the different rules and determining whether we fall within a law’s scope will require lawyers and compliance teams. That could put us at a major disadvantage against bigger industry players that can handle those requirements and costs. Worse, it means we’ll have to spend time and money on compliance instead of improving our app, and we may be forced to raise prices for our end users.
Lawmakers’ concerns about AI are understandable; AI needs guardrails. But a haphazard patchwork of state regulations is likely to stifle innovation and prevent app developers from succeeding, and could lead to dramatically inequitable outcomes. In states with strict regulations, residents may miss out on life-enhancing AI-powered tools that help with things like job searches and medical care. In states with weak — or no — regulations, residents may be subject to dangerous scams and misinformation.
The U.S. urgently needs a national AI law. It’s time for lawmakers in Washington to craft smart, balanced AI legislation that gives developers clear, consistent rules, protects all Americans from AI’s risks, and allows all of us to benefit from its transformative capabilities.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/capitolnov262024miranda-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-06 18:01:39.496617

(Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Beneficient executives and attorneys pleaded Thursday for patience and understanding from the Kansas Legislature after indictment of the firm’s founder, who used spectacular predictions of wealth creation to charm state legislators into awarding the company a special bank charter.
Interim Beneficient CEO James Silk joined Derek Fletcher, company’s president and chief fiduciary officer, at a House and Senate committee hearing in the Statehouse two days after the arrest of former CEO and founder Brad Heppner.
Silk delved into the indictment controversy, which he referred to as “the elephant in the room.” He said a Beneficient auditing committee discovered evidence Heppner engaged in fraud during his leadership of the company.
“What that internal investigation determined was consistent with … what was set out in the indictment,” Silk told legislators. “While the indictment is upsetting to all of us and serving a legitimate red flag for any organization, … we are aligned with the U.S. government about identifying, remedying and moving forward on this. You don’t have to be a Venezuelan drug cartel boat driver to know that you want to be on the U.S. government side of that.”
The indictment unsealed in New York City asserted Heppner enriched himself by illegally siphoning about $150 million from GWG Holdings, which was at a time linked to Beneficient. Heppner led both companies and allegedly controlled a shell company where he purportedly moved large amounts of cash for personal use on property, travel and other expenditures. GWG Holdings was forced into bankruptcy, which cost 15,000 investors about $1 billion.
The U.S. Department of Justice contended Heppner engaged in securities fraud, wire fraud, made false statements, falsified records and engaged in a conspiracy to commit fraud. He was arrested Tuesday in Dallas.
Silk said that, unlike Heppner, he wouldn’t try to bedazzle legislators by claiming Beneficient was on the verge of of expanding its business in Kansas and making people very rich. He said Beneficient had a few transactions in the pipeline, but it would be folly to claim the company was on the cusp of deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
“It’s fair to say that we have, in the past, overpromised and underdelivered,” he said. “We’re not about chasing stock price. We want to build fundamental value.”
Fletcher said Beneficient was headed in the right direction but would need time to reshape the company into something worthy of trust from investors and regulators.
“We understand the seriousness of the moment and the circumstances that have arisen, and we’re committed to moving forward with integrity,” Fletcher said. “The news over the last few months, and particularly the last 48 hours, has been disappointing, troubling and, quite frankly, for me, one of sadness.”
Heppner was the key Beneficient contact as Republicans and Democrats were showed with campaign donations and the Legislature passed a bill in 2022 that guaranteed Beneficient a bank charter like no other in Kansas. Heppner remained a presence at House and Senate committees with oversight of financial institutions before forced out of Beneficient in June.
The state passed a law enabling Beneficient to engage in alternative asset deals in exchange for financially supporting economic development activities in rural Kansas. The agenda included construction of a grocery store in Hesston, a city in Kansas where Heppner grew up. So far, Beneficient officials said, $9 million was set aside for Kansas economic development. Work on the grocery store has been slow, but a Hesston foundation devoted to the project said Heppner’s resignation led to a reappraisal of the plan that could make it more likely the project was built.
The state law crafted to serve Beneficient’s interests prevented the Kansas Office of State Bank Commissioner, or OSBC, from regulating the entity as it would a traditional bank or trust. The Dallas-based firm has specialized in exchange of cash or stock for illiquid assets held by large investors. The company sought the bank charter to give it leverage in the marketplace.
David Herndon, the state bank commissioner, also addressed the Joint Fiduciary Financial Institutions Committee. He opposed awarding Beneficient a charter. For years, he urged the Legislature to strengthen regulatory oversight of the company or repeal the statute entirely. In Herndon’s view, Beneficient could conduct its alternative asset business without the charter. Beneficient executives disagreed with that conclusion.
Herndon said concerns about Beneficient included financial stress on the company, tardy filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company’s low stock price, claims that employees weren’t being paid, the low number of Beneficient transactions, the company founder’s abrupt exodus and the subsequent indictment. A financial examination by bank regulators revealed violations by Beneficient, he said.
“Significant and repeated violations of the Kansas statutes and regulations have been cited,” Herndon said. “Due to the volume of these violations, OSBC has proposed issuance of a formal corrective action.”
Sen. Stephen Owens, a Republican from Hesston, asked Herndon why regulations hadn’t been issued by the state to guide the business model adopted by Beneficient. Herndon said OSBC didn’t have authority to adopt those rules.
Owens criticized Herndon for questioning the state’s ability to provide meaningful regulatory oversight of Beneficient.
“There is such strong opposition, yet zero evidence … that there’s been any harm to the Kansas taxpayer,” the senator said. “While the business certainly hasn’t gone in the way that I think anybody has expected, I continue to reiterate the fact that there is no risk and no harm has come to the Kansas taxpayer for the passing of this (Beneficient) legislation and allowing an industry to get a foothold.”
Rep. Nick Hoheisel, R-Wichita, said allegations against Heppner contained in the indictment were disappointing. It was important to remind Kansans that Heppner was no longer part of Beneficient, he said.
“It’s a new day for the company,” Hoheisel said. “We need to figure out was Beneficient … built on those lies that Mr. Heppner described here? Or, is it an actual business model that can succeed? That’s what we’re going to get to the bottom of.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Beneficient-executives-gang-of-four-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-06 17:18:29.587566

Free.,"US Senate talks continue on end to 37-day shutdown, but final deal elusive","Ariana Figueroa, Ashley Murray",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-talks-continue-end-37-day-shutdown-final-deal-elusive,,"WASHINGTON —  Senate Democrats left their Thursday caucus lunch tight-lipped as an agreement to end the government shutdown, now the longest in U.S. history at 37 days, remained elusive.Republicans have floated a deal that includes the reinstatement of federal workers laid off by President Donald Trump, but no votes were scheduled on a spending bill as of late Thursday afternoon. There was some speculation senators could work through the weekend.The chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, said negotiations are still underway. But she said as part of a deal, she supported the rehiring of the thousands of federal workers the Trump administration fired in its Reductions in Force, or RIFs, during the government shutdown that began Oct. 1.“Those who were RIF’d during the shutdown should be recalled,” she said. “We’re still negotiating that language.”Emboldened by this week’s Election Day victories, where Democrats swept major local and state races, Senate Democrats are seeking to use that momentum as leverage to get Republicans to also agree to a health care deal to end the government shutdown.While Democrats have pushed to extend tax credits for health care, Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Thursday that the best he can offer is a vote on extending those subsidies, which expire this year. The coming expiration has resulted in millions of people who buy their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace receiving notices of a drastic spike in premium costs.“I can't speak for the House, and obviously I can't guarantee an outcome here, and they know that,” Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said. “I think the clear path forward here, with regard to the ACA issue, is they get a vote, and we open up the government, and we head down to the White House and sit down with the president and talk about it.”

Democrats that represent states with a high population of federal employees, such as Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, are also seeking to strike a deal on RIFs. A federal judge blocked those Reductions in Force last month.Kaine told reporters Wednesday that those negotiations are occurring with the White House.“It is an item that is being discussed with the president, with the White House,” Kaine said.The progressive wing of the Democratic Party has stressed that unless there is a commitment from House Speaker Mike Johnson and President Donald Trump to extend health care tax credits, Democrats should not agree to pass a stopgap spending bill to reopen the government. In session next week?Senators are still scheduled to leave Capitol Hill late Thursday and be out next week on recess for the Veterans Day holiday.But a couple Senate Republicans said late Thursday afternoon that lawmakers might stay in Washington, D.C. into Friday or later.“I think they're trying to work towards a vote tomorrow, maybe through the weekend. I'm pro-through the weekend,” Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said in an interview following a GOP lunch meeting.Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., likened the situation to a “goat rodeo,” which is a hyperbolic phrase to refer to a disaster.“We're probably going to have a vote tomorrow, and then we will get on, and then we will know where we are, and we'll know whether the Democrats are serious or not,” Kennedy said, adding that he was unsure exactly what they were voting on.Democrats quiet about any dealFollowing their Thursday caucus lunch, Democrats did not seem closer to an internal agreement on how to move forward with resolving the government shutdown as they left their huddle. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats had a “very good, productive meeting.”One of the top negotiators for Democrats on finding a deal, New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, declined to comment.Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman threw his hands up as he left the room.“I don’t know how productive it was,” Fetterman, who has voted with Republicans to move legislation to reopen the government, said. Some Democrats said they were unified, such as New Jersey Sen. Andy Kim, Michigan’s Gary Peters and Connecticut’s Chris Murphy, a top appropriator. Peters did not specify what issue Democrats were unified on. “I don't want to get into that, but it was an encouraging caucus (meeting) because there's a great deal of unity as we came out,” he said.Revised stopgap?Additionally, a new continuing resolution, or CR, is needed, as the stopgap funding measure would have funded the government until Nov. 21, now just two weeks away. The House, which Johnson has kept in recess since September, would also need to be called back to pass a new version of a CR.As the government shutdown continues, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned this week that if funding is not restored, flights will need to be reduced by 10% in some air spaces due to a shortage of air traffic controllers, who have worked without pay for weeks.The government shutdown has led to millions of federal workers furloughed or required to work without pay and has created uncertainty for vulnerable people who rely on food assistance and  heating services, as well as stoppages in vital child development and nutrition programs. In an effort to force Democrats to vote to reopen the government, the Trump administration has tried to withhold Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits for 42 million people, until a court ordered the U.S. Department of Agriculture to release those benefits. Frustrated with the government shutdown, Trump has also tried to pressure Republicans into doing away with the Senate’s filibuster, which requires a 60-vote threshold, but Thune has resisted those calls. Progressives: ‘Do not cave’Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said during a Thursday press conference that he’s “not promising anyone anything” when it comes to a House vote on extending health care tax subsidies.  Johnson criticized Senate Democrats for wanting a guarantee that the House would also take a vote on extending the ACA taxes.“That’s ridiculous,” he said. House progressives said they have one message for Senate Democrats: “Do not cave,” as Rep. Pramila Jayapal put it during a Thursday morning press conference outside the U.S. House.“Any deal must secure the extension of the ACA tax credits and ensure health care for the American people with agreement from the House, the Senate and the White House, full stop. We have the momentum,” the Washington state Democrat said.Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pa., who publicly confronted Johnson during a press conference Wednesday, said, “We require a deal that actually addresses the health care crisis, not that promises to think about addressing it down the road in two weeks, with concepts of a plan.”“Sadly, at this point in time, even I say it's impossible to trust our Republican colleagues to honor their promises and their obligations,” Houlahan said.April Verette, president of the labor union SEIU, which represents roughly 2 million members, spoke alongside Jayapal and Houlahan and praised Democrats as “courageous.”“We are determined to say ‘Stick with this fight’ because righteousness, morality is on our side,” Verette said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-11-06 18:01:39.496617

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current)The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) must use available contingency funds and other allocated emergency subsidies to restore the full $9 billion in November food stamp benefits by Friday, a Rhode Island federal judge ruled Thursday. 
Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. expressed his displeasure with President Donald Trump’s administration for its failure to comply with his Oct. 31 order to pay for partial Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits using emergency money during a Zoom hearing.   
But in a court filings, Patrick A. Penn, USDA’s Deputy Under Secretary, had argued that making partial payments would result in weeks, if not months, of delays.
“If that continued to be the case, then the administration was required under this court’s order to immediately make the full payment for November SNAP benefits considering the finding that irreparable harm would occur,” McConnell said.
“Just to be clear, irreparable harm means harm to families, elderly and children and others that cannot be undone. The evidence shows that people will go hungry, food pantries will go empty and needless suffering will occur. That’s what irreparable harm means.”
About 42 million people who receive SNAP benefits, including 145,000 Rhode Islanders, have been without benefits since Nov. 1, as the ongoing government shutdown leaves the program unfunded.
“Last week, SNAP benefits lapsed for the first time in our nation’s history,” McConnell said. “This is a problem that could have and should have been avoided.”
On Oct. 30, a coalition of cities and nonprofit organizations filed a lawsuit against USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins to force the government to pay SNAP after November funding dried up. The Trump administration had refused to use contingency funding to keep SNAP funded, something his administration did during his first tenure in 2019.
At the start of Thursday’s hearing, McConnell gave both parties 15 minutes to rehash their arguments in court, but most of the hourlong hearing was consumed by the judge’s own arguments that the federal government had betrayed the terms of the order he issued from the bench Oct. 31 and in writing a day later.
The feds had two options: Fund SNAP fully for the month of November, or “expeditiously resolve the administrative and clerical burdens” that would block payments from going out later than Wednesday, McConnell’s original order prescribed.
“Nothing was done consistent with the court’s order to clear the way to expeditiously resolve it,” McConnell said. “Maybe it’s a state problem, maybe not.”
Whether the responsibility fell upon states or not was irrelevant to the harm that would come to hungry people, McConnell said.
“It’s likely that SNAP recipients are hungry as we sit here,” he said. 
McConnell cited Trump’s social media post on Tuesday  saying he would cut off all SNAP benefits unless U.S. Senate Democrats voted to reopen the government. 
USDA previously said on Monday it would partially subsidize the program, but states were left to calculate a new funding formula for partial benefits. On Tuesday, the feds first erroneously cited that it would furnish recipients with 50% of their typical benefits; new court filings a day later stated up to 65% of full benefits would be funded. 
Additionally, USDA’s guidance Tuesday noted that 30% of a household’s net monthly income would be subtracted from the reduced benefit allotment. That would have resulted in some recipients receiving no benefits at all. The additional layer of number crunching also meant states were slowed in their attempts to dispense benefits. 
Minutes before the hearing, Gov. Dan McKee announced that state officials threw away their calculations for partial SNAP payments ordered by the courts last week and started over after receiving new guidance from the Trump administration late Wednesday night.
“Despite these ongoing changes from the USDA, our team at the Rhode Island Department of Human Services is working urgently to complete calculations in compliance with the latest federal guidance,” McKee wrote.
McConnell said because the government did not “expeditiously resolve” the stemmed flow of benefits that came from having to set up partial payments, USDA will need to make the full payments by Friday. The money will come from the existing contingency fund available for SNAP — which, in its partial satisfaction of the request, the agency said it could not exhaust — plus money from Section 32, a flexible USDA fund that has also been used to sustain the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) during the shutdown. 
The feds had argued that use of Section 32 would deplete the money for the Children’s Nutrition Program, but McConnell countered and said that, even if $4 billion was diverted to SNAP for the month of November, there would still be enough money to fund the Children’s Nutrition Program through “May and beyond” of next year. 
“After creating this SNAP crisis, President Trump and his administration continue to present states with unnecessary barriers in implementing these critical benefits swiftly,” McKee said. “These funds should have been released long before the court order, with a single, straightforward set of guidance that ensured recipients received the maximum benefits possible.

(Amanda Mills/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and the Arkansas Department of Agriculture announced a farm-to-table program Thursday for Arkansas schools that will provide meals to students using ingredients raised or grown in-state.
Called the Arkansas Plate Initiative, it will start as a pilot program in five schools in 2026, a press release from Sanders’ office said.
“Arkansas students deserve access to healthy, nutritious foods at school, and the Arkansas Plate Initiative shows meaningful progress in our effort to improve child nutrition and support our farmers and producers across the state,” Sanders said in the release. “Not only will this program give students access to fresh, locally sourced products, but it will also teach them about Arkansas’ largest industry and what it takes to keep it.”
Starting in January, the program will feature “monthly ‘Arkansas Plate Days,’” with school cafeterias serving meals using Arkansas-grown foodstuffs such as poultry and rice, and fruits and vegetables.
New report ranks Arkansas’ food insecurity rate worst in the U.S.

Participating schools will also “receive educational materials, promotional signage, and ‘Meet the Farmer’ profiles to help students discover more about where their food comes from and learn the importance of supporting Arkansas agriculture,” according to the release.
The program appears to be similar to the federally-funded Farm to School and Local Food Purchase Assistance programs administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The latter program also helps local schools purchase locally-sourced ingredients for school meals. It faced sweeping cutbacks in the early days of President Donald Trump’s second term, despite support from state agriculture commissioners, including Arkansas Department of Agriculture Secretary Wes Ward. 
The Arkansas Department of Agriculture did not respond to questions regarding the new initiatives’ relation to federal school meal programs nor about how the initiative would be funded.
The new initiative is the latest in a series of nutrition-related moves made by the Sanders administration and state legislators this year. After signing the bipartisan Act 123 of 2025, which provides free school breakfasts to all Arkansas students, earlier this year, Sanders also announced that the Department of Corrections would provide produce harvested by incarcerated individuals to the Marion School District for breakfasts and lunches.
The announcement also comes at a time of precarity for Arkansas’ agriculture industry, which is heavily reliant on commodity farming. Commodity farmers are facing some of the worst market conditions in years as prices for commodities drop and the costs of producing continue to rise.

The state NAACP, Common Cause and a group of voters known as the Williams plaintiffs asked the federal judges to block the state from holding an election using the new district lines Republican legislators approved last month. 
Republicans in the state legislature joined the national redistricting war when they reconfigured election boundaries for the 1st District to draw in more GOP voters. President Donald Trump has asked Republican-led states to redraw their congressional district maps to maximize GOP advantages in the midterm elections. 
The redrawn North Carolina map is likely to take the state’s congressional delegation from 10 Republicans and 4 Democrats to 11 Republicans and three Democrats. 
The new 1st District lines dismantle a region known as the Black Belt, where a cross-county bloc of Black voters has helped elect a Black Democrat to Congress since 1992. 
Republican legislators said during debates over the district that the redraw was strictly partisan, and no racial data was used to create the new lines. 
The 1st Congressional District was already included among other districts in a federal racial gerrymandering case. Oral arguments were held in that case last summer. The judges have not issued a ruling yet. 
The NAACP plaintiffs told the judges that the new 1st District boundaries are even worse than the district lines used in the 2024 election. They claim the new plan retaliates against voters based on how they voted. 
States usually redistrict once a decade after the census. North Carolina redistricts more often to comply with court orders. This year was the first time district lines were redrawn at a president’s request. 
A mid-decade redistricting “for the sole purpose of targeting the other party’s voters is a very distinct and clear attack on constitutional rights,” Dan Vicuña, senior policy director for voting and fair representation at Common Cause, told reporters during a video news conference Thursday.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4636-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-06 17:18:29.587566

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator) Three days before they were hired, LSU’s next leader and the incoming chancellor of its Baton Rouge campus started discussing a plan they would pitch to the Board of Supervisors to restructure the university’s system of campuses across the state. 
Incoming President Wade Rousse, currently the head of McNeese State University in Lake Charles, and newly hired Chancellor Jim Dalton, currently provost at the University of Alabama, were two of three finalists for the LSU presidency. Their discussion did not include the third finalist, former University of Arizona President Robert Robbins, in their discussion. 
The pair came to the board with their plan to split the president and chancellor roles, which had been merged in 2012. They also wanted Dalton to become an executive vice president overseeing the research-intensive entities in the system, which include Pennington Biomedical Research Center, the LSU AgCenter and LSU’s medical schools in New Orleans and Shreveport. 
LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard had said multiple times he didn’t think the positions should be split, most recently Oct. 29, just after the presidential search committee narrowed the candidate pool down to the three finalists. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In addition to a new president and chancellor, the LSU Board of Supervisors announced Tuesday its intent to significantly reorganize the system to boost the university’s research goals. 
While the new plan is in flux and will not be finalized until the board votes next month, Ballard said about 95% of the new structure is solidified. 
Rousse said he and Dalton have an “agreement in principle” that Dalton will oversee the academic side of things, while Rousse will manage the public facing aspects of the university, including external affairs, government relations and athletics. 
“The LSU research enterprise will now report as a unified system, reflecting the collaborative strengths of our institutions, unified,” Ballard said at a news conference earlier this week. 
Unifying LSU’s research institutions under Dalton is being done to boost the university’s total research spending figures, one of several research metrics LSU needs to boost to join the prestigious Association of American Universities, an organization of the nation’s top higher education research institutions.  
Unifying LSU was a key part of the strategic framework for the system put forward by former President William Tate, who left his job in June to accept the same position at Rutgers University in New Jersey. 
In 2023, the most recent year data is available from the National Science Foundation, LSU spent $384 million on research, which ranks 83rd among universities. LSU Health Shreveport spent $35 million, and LSU Health New Orleans spent $68 million. Adding their amounts to LSU Baton Rouge would elevate it to the 69th slot, overtaking Carnegie Mellon University, a member of the Association of American Universities. 
But according to the National Science Foundation, LSU can’t compile all of its campuses statewide into a single slot to improve its research rankings. 
“Each campus with its own chancellor, president or similar head is considered its own institution, a categorization established in 2010… That allows for more comparable data between private institutions and multi-campus state institutions,” a foundation spokesperson said. “We approach the Louisiana State system as we approach all state systems, per those parameters.” 
While details are still sparse about what it will look like, LSU leaders have said they are reworking the system’s organizational chart, indicating they may have developed a new reporting structure that could mitigate the National Science Foundation’s concerns. 
Having athletics at the flagship campus report to the system president, rather than that campus’ new chancellor, is an unusual arrangement. Before the two roles were merged, athletics reported to the chancellor of the main campus. Having athletics report to the system president essentially elevates it to being treated as an institution of its own rather than part of the Baton Rouge campus. 
The arrangement separating Rousse from the academic side of the university comes as a relief for faculty, who expressed skepticism about Rousse’s qualifications to run a major research institution. 
Rousse lacks several of the key qualifications the search committee established for presidential applicants. Unlike LSU, McNeese does not hold a top research designation, and Rousse did not ascend to his administrative rank though the traditional academic promotion path. He also hasn’t published a significant amount of research. 
Rousse also provided vague answers when asked about LSU’s goal to become a top-50 public research university. 
Dalton has an extensive research background and has served for five years as the chief academic officer of the University of Alabama, which, like LSU, holds the top research designation.

But on Thursday, the State Board of Education heard that none of them met those goals, and one missed by nearly 70%.
“We hear a lot about the waiting lists for charter schools,” said vice chair Alan Duncan during Thursday’s meeting. “But this year’s openings have not attracted anywhere near the number of projected students. Have there been any discussions among the Charter School Review Board members about what this trend means for further opening of charter schools?”
State Board of Education meeting on Nov. 6. 2025 (Photo: Ahmed Jallow/NC Newsline)
Duncan raised the question during a presentation from the Charter School Review Board, which provides monthly updates to the state board. Ashley Logue, director of the Office of Charter Schools, said one reason is that new charter schools, especially those in larger counties, face stiff competition from both established charter and traditional schools.
Logue said enrollment projections are difficult to “lock down” because parents have so many options, particularly in large counties where they often apply to multiple schools. This makes it hard for any single charter school to accurately anticipate which students will actually enroll.
“There’s the LEA, there’s magnet options, there’s charter options, there’s voucher options — so many options that you have parents applying to multiple places,” Logue told the board. “It’s hard to kind of lock down those numbers, which, again, is why I think we need to start earlier with doing checks on that.”
Several new schools missed their projections by wide margins.
Triad International Studies Academy in Guilford County projected to enroll 144 students in its first year but drew just 45, below the state’s required minimum of 80. Last month, the Charter Review Board voted to close the school effective December 31, but financial problems forced it to shut down two weeks later.
Liberty Charter, also in Guilford County, projected 500 students but enrolled only 172, nearly 66% below its projection.
“This is not an isolated problem,” said Logue, “We’re seeing fewer parents committing to new charter schools. Historically, a school might lose 10% of its projected enrollment. Now, some are seeing losses closer to 25%.”
Not all missed their enrollment projections by such wide margins. Anderson Academy in Forsyth County and North Oak Academy in Durham only missed by 5% and 14%, respectively.
Moving forward, Logue said, the review board is exploring stricter guidance for applicants.
“Our proposal would be that there are stricter guidelines earlier in the process to say, ‘Hey, you’re not where you need to be with enrollment,’” Logue said, “and to slow that process so that either they delay and have more time to prepare, or they realize that perhaps this is not going to work.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/AdobeStock_CharterSchool-wo.jpg,,,2025-11-06 17:18:29.587566

(Peelee Clark / Northwest Team 2)A bipartisan piece of legislation that could have big impacts on the nation’s forest land continues to move quickly through Congress, pushing through a Senate committee last month.
The Fix Our Forests Act was introduced in the U.S. Senate in April and co-sponsored by Sen. Tim Sheehy, along with Senators from California, Utah and Colorado. 
The legislation seeks to promote prescribed burns, expand the state-federal Good Neighbor Authority program, increase collaboration among fire agencies and improve reforestation efforts after fires. It also makes some rule changes that could impact how areas designated as high fire danger are managed and how projects in those areas proceed.
“Better stewardship of our forests is not a partisan issue; it’s an imperative to securing a stronger economy, healthier forests, and safer communities,” Sheehy said in a press release. “I’m proud to see the bipartisan Fix Our Forests Act move forward in the legislative process, and I’ll continue fighting alongside my colleagues to enact commonsense reforms that ensure proper forest management, unleash the resource economy, and protect American communities from the threat of wildfire.”
The governors of those four states, including Gov. Greg Gianforte, signed on to a letter in support of the legislation in late October. The bill has already worked its way through the U.S. House, though doesn’t include new appropriated funds.
The legislation has received some support from environmental and outdoor advocacy groups, with the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership calling it a “comprehensive” approach to tackling forest health and wildfire issues. The Nature Conservancy and the National Audubon Society is also in support of the legislation. 
But there has also been some concern with it, namely around how it could change the process of forest projects, especially those in a declared “emergency fireshed management” area. That’s a Biden-era designation which essentially prohibits projects from exploring alternatives on forestry projects — the only options are what’s called an “action” or “no action.” It essentially shortens the review period for projects within that designation.
Forestry actions falling within that designation are usually small in scope, but the federal legislation would push that number to include projects as large as 10,000 acres.
Even with the renewed interest in prescribed burns and other forestry projects to help with forest health, there’s still a lack of action, said Riva Duncan, the vice president of Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, an advocacy group made up of former firefighters.
According to Forest Service data, hazardous fuels reduction work across their lands was down 38% in 2025 when compared with the same period during the previous four calendar years. 
Federal cuts and Department of Government Efficiency actions caused chaos last winter and some mitigation projects never happened or were delayed. Between the cuts and needs for firefighters around the country, the work just isn’t getting done, she said.
And while DOGE actions mostly spared firefighters, supporting positions around fire mitigation work were not.
“There’s a huge network of specialists and biologists and things behind the scenes that do the environmental work to allow these fuels projects to continue,” Duncan said. “And so they were hit really hard by (DOGE cuts) and by the deferred resignations and things like that. A lot of issues are exacerbated by this administration, who has been very open about not supporting a Federal workforce.”
Prescribed burns can help mitigate risk by removing fuel that otherwise might add to the intensity of a fire. During the last 100 years the Forest Service has consistently embraced suppression as its main method of fire defense.
Land management policies “vilifying” fire have led to overgrowth and climate change continues to impact forests, Duncan said, adding suppression has been a renewed focus this summer. U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz, who spent 14 years with the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, has said the nation’s forests are in trouble because they’re not being logged enough.
“Every year the Chief of the Forest Service puts out their fire season letter, and it made pretty clear that suppression was going to be the primary focus,” Duncan said. “And I think when you look at the chief and his background coming from the timber industry, there are a lot of people who have commercial timber lands, commercial timber interests, who don’t like fire, who still will not recognize the value it brings. All it does is hurt their bottom line, right?”
Duncan also pointed out not all logging is necessarily fuel mitigation work and added she’s not specifically against logging; however, saying logging alone will solve the issue is disingenuous. 
“A lot of people who want us to log more, want more trees to come off national forest lands, will try to make that argument,” Duncan said. “Sometimes it is, sometimes it’s not. Often it’s not.”
Grassroots Wildland Firefighters did submit a comment on the Fix Our Forests bill and she said it’s an acknowledgment that more fuel work needs to be done.
“Fire is non-partisan. It doesn’t recognize boundaries or recognize if it’s private or federal land, if it’s commercial versus being managed for ecological reasons,” Duncan said. “And so we need a comprehensive solution with everybody at the table who has a stake, and everybody has a stake.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Windy-Rock-Fire-Peelee-Aug-30-3Medic-1024x649.jpg,,,2025-11-06 16:56:58.434930

Ed Stafman looking at the art and architecture before he presents his first bill in committee. (Eric Seidel for the Daily Montanan)Bozeman Democratic Rep. Ed Stafman resigned from the Legislature on Nov. 1, effective immediately. 
The 71-year-old former trial attorney and Rabbi Emeritus was first elected in 2020 and served his third Legislative session in Helena this year, representing House District 59.
In his resignation letter to the Montana Secretary of State on Nov. 1, Stafman said serving in the Legislature was “one of the greatest honors of my life.

“This decision was not made lightly,” he wrote. “Public service is a calling, but it also requires sacrifice. And at this point in my life, I feel a strong pull toward my family — especially welcoming and spending time with my new grandchild. I believe this is where I am most needed now.”
Stafman told the Daily Montanan on Thursday that opting to step down during the interim came after he made the main decision not to run for a fourth full term.
“My interim work is relatively speaking, minimal,” said Stafman, who was appointed to the Law and Justice Interim Committee. “It’s not something I need to be in there for the big fight or something like that. I think it’s mostly sensible stuff that’s going to have mostly bipartisan support. I kind of felt I’d served 98% of my term.”
He added by allowing a new representative to be appointed in the upcoming weeks, they would be able to start their work in an interim committee and then he have a leg up going into the 2027 session, assuming they ran and won the seat.
Stafman won his seat during the 2024 election with 63% of the vote.

Stafman said he thought of himself as a moral compass in the Legislature, and he told the Daily Montanan since his resignation over the weekend, he had been “inundated with emails and texts from Republican legislators saying they’ll miss that aspect of me being there.”
Serving in the minority while Republicans held a supermajority, and then near-supermajority, Stafman said much of his work in the Capital was playing defense, away from the debates on the House floor.
“A lot of the work is behind the scenes so that the public and even the press doesn’t know quite how a bill was defeated,” he said. “I played quite a role behind the scenes in marshaling the resources and people to defeat some really bad legislation.”
While few of his ideas garnered support from his peers  – just one of his 17 introduced bills in 2025 made it to Gov. Greg Gianforte’s desk, and was subsequently vetoed — Stafman said there’s a long game that needs to be played. Bills have to be introduced in multiple sessions to move them through the process — first they might die in committee, then they might die on the floor, and eventually they’ll make it to the other chamber.
“Success doesn’t necessarily mean completing the task, but moving it forward,” Stafman said. “We moved a lot of things forward, and I hope others will pick up the ball and keep it rolling.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/B86A4179SN-scaled-e1762463159967-1024x577.jpg,,,2025-11-06 16:56:58.434930

The concept — where veterans can share their experiences directly with their communities — was created by journalist and author Sebastian Junger, who spent years reporting from active war zones. Vermont held its first event in 2017.

This story by Katie Lyford was first published in The Bridge on Nov. 4, 2025.
When East Thetford’s Bonnie Holbrook arrived at the Vermont Statehouse for the Vets Town Hall on Nov. 2, she wasn’t sure what to expect. She had spent her life around veterans and none of them would talk about their experiences. Holbrook decided to attend the event — a place where veterans and civilians come together for listening sessions — to better understand her family and community.
About 20 people joined Holbrook at the Town Hall, organized by Kristin Eaton, the group’s deputy director. It was one of seven similar events across the state in the weeks surrounding Veterans Day on Nov. 11, and it moved Holbrook. “Having the folks share their feelings openly is such a change from my experiences from family members, friends and my ex-husband,” she said. “So many of them had not and still do not know how to deal with it.” 
The concept of a Vets Town Hall was created by journalist and author Sebastian Junger, who had spent years reporting from active war zones. He envisioned a place where veterans could share experiences directly with their communities: no politics, no debate, just listening. 
“Historically speaking, humans overcome trauma far better when processing within a community rather than individually,” Junger said.
Vermont held its first Vets Town Hall in 2017, thanks to Eaton and Marine veteran Jon Turner, both of whom worked to bring Junger’s idea to life. Eaton said the gatherings evolve but keep the same intention: “What sticks with me most is the experience of sitting in a room with my community, listening to the stories of veterans in person,” she said. 
Turner finds reward in the veterans who decide to speak for the first time. “Some veterans, who have never spoken of their military experiences, come to listen and they realize how genuinely listened to and supported their fellow veterans are, and that moves them enough that they in turn decide to share.” 
This year’s event at the Statehouse was the first in such a historic and symbolic space, thanks to James Ehlers, chief of staff to Lt. Gov. John Rodgers and this year’s emcee. 
Ehlers, himself a veteran, said he wanted to hold the event somewhere that reflected the honor and dignity veterans deserve and that might also draw in more of the state’s elected officials. “These are real stories,” he said. “They deserve a space like this.” 
One participant was Marlon Fisher. The veteran, father and community leader had never spoken publicly about his own time in the military, and this was his first time attending a Vets Town Hall.
“I’ve talked about my military experience a few times, but only if it came up,” Fisher said. “Now, I’m working on community building, and veterans are a unique community in and of themselves that not a lot of people get. [But] in so many ways, I get it. And I think it’s important for me to share that.”
Fisher said he served as an all-source intelligence analyst for the U.S. Army in Germany with one deployment to Afghanistan. 
“I was sitting next to soldiers with guns in their holsters, my weapon of choice a laptop,” he said. “My first night of deployment, I was terrified. There was a rocket attack and horrific conditions.” He described food poisoning that left him extremely ill. “I was scared. But thanks to my ‘battle buddies’ I was able to pull through. Fast-forward to the end of my year there, and it was like the first night repeated, another rocket attack. But as I looked around, seeing my battle buddies, I realized I was no longer afraid. That is the power of community.”
Vietnam War Army Captain and Chief Nurse Maureen L. Dwyer shared a similar experience. 
“The night we arrived in Vietnam, it was so surreal,” she said. “Not seeing a bunker, having armed sergeants escorting us saying, ‘Stay behind us.’ I said to myself, ‘You’re not in Kansas anymore,’” she added. She said her time in Vietnam taught her the “oneness of community.”
“There was no family there, so it was a very different nursing experience because even though it was ‘off to the races’ every day, we were like a family, both your colleagues, as well as the patients, who were mostly young men,” she recalled. “You couldn’t help but love them, more than a professional nurse in the States would, because there’s no family. And because some of them were not going to make it out of there.”

Army Ranger Scott Wood graduated from Montpelier High School in 1987. Shortly after, he went to the Berlin Armory to enlist. 
“I was sick of people telling me what to do, so I decided to join the Army,” he said. Never having flown before, on his second flight he found himself standing in the door of a plane about to jump out. 
“I recall thinking, ‘I can’t believe I’m getting paid to do this!,’” he said. “And then I have the other experience of seeing and doing things that no one should ever have to. But in a way, I feel fortunate to have gone through the dark stages and be able to now help other veterans.” 
He recounted coming upon another Ranger who had suffered a spinal injury. “We came upon him literally five minutes after the jump. And he is lying there, so broken, begging for help. This was just a small moment, one, maybe two minutes in time. But it was like an image captured with the world’s best camera. It is engrained in your memory. You move on, because you have to. … And then that moment pops up while you’re in traffic or at a family dinner.”
Not all veterans will share and many do not even attend such events. Several told The Bridge they cannot bear to think about their service time at all. Turner said he hopes they have what they need and that he has made it his mission to help as many as possible. 
Misha Pemble-Belkin, a soldier whom Junger met while filming in Afghanistan and whom many credit as their inspiration to speak out, frames this silence as part of what veterans are taught: “You learn to not feel,” he said. “Then, when you come home, you have to learn to feel again.” 
Wood noted: “What I tell veterans all the time is, ‘It’s okay not to be okay, but it’s not okay to struggle in silence. The more you get it out, instead of bottling up, the better it gets. If I could have anything to say to somebody, it’s ‘Reach out, connect. It does get better. You shouldn’t have to live with that on your own.’”
Rodgers co-sponsored the event due to a personal experience. One of his sons and his daughter in law are veterans, and their childhood friend was deployed Afghanistan and struggled upon returning home. When their friend took his life, Rodgers’ other son, who had attempted to help, fell into a depression. The family now does all they can to try to help others. “The statistics show there are more veterans lost to suicide than war,” Rodgers said. “That means we are failing and need to do better.”
Sen. Joe Major agreed. “Veteran issues are often talked about but not always understood,” he said. “It’s vital we know what our veterans are going through — whether it’s PTSD, challenges with the VA, or adjusting to civilian life. Giving them a voice helps us learn how to help.”

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Paul Tine celebrated his six-month anniversary as commissioner of the NC Division of Motor Vehicles Thursday with something his predecessor never received – praise from state legislators.
When Tine walked into the job May 6, replacing former commissioner Wayne Goodwin, North Carolinians were waiting on average more than three hours to renew their registration or driver’s license. Booking an appointment was near-impossible and often required motorists to wait months or drive to another county with hopes of finding an open slot and a shorter line.

Over the last 28 days, the average total wait time has been one hour and 19 minutes.
Tine, a former state representative, told the Joint Legislative Transportation Oversight committee Thursday that he believes better  efficiency and agility will allow his agency to cut wait times even further.
“15 minutes is where we’re setting our goal. I think it’s attainable,” he said.
Senator Bill Rabon (R-Brunswick), co-chair of the oversight committee, signaled his approval.
“Mr. Commissioner. You have taken great strides. Don’t shorten your step. Keep it going,” Rabon told the commissioner.
Tine said his top priority has been to address the low morale in understaffed offices.
“I sat down on a listening tour to make sure that I understood the needs of our customers and the needs of our frontline staff. Last week, I finished up at all of our 113 offices,” Tine said.
To prove to current DMV examiners he was hearing their concerns, he found one-time money to repaint offices, fix flooring and replace uniforms.
“Our examiners hadn’t had new uniforms in about five years. Some of them were wearing sweaters because they were threadbare at that point, and down to one or two uniforms,” he shared.
Beyond those cosmetic changes, Tine said his office now provides direct communication all the way down to the examiner’s level, not filtered through several management layers. “People did not have a shared understanding of what the expectations were for the group,” said Tine.
Training has been revamped to get new examiners working sooner. The DMV has filled 87 positions since early August. The vacancy rate for examiners sits at 4%.

To improve how the DMV interacts with the public, the division refreshed its website and hired a social media director.
“You’ll see a lot clearer understanding of what’s necessary when you come to see us, what the steps are for each of the services. We also put in a chatbot so that you can go in there and ask questions,” Tine said.
The AI-driven chatbot is still learning. Tine acknowledged it will take a little time for it to be fully trained before it gives the best output, but it’s constantly improving, he said.
For state lawmakers who have routinely received angry complaints about the DMV, Tine said there were two improvements they could offer constituents.
The DMV now accepts walk-in customers all day, and a new software system allows customers to enter their mobile number when they sign in.
“We’ll text you. We’ll show you what your place is online. You can go and wait anywhere, watch your number, come down, and then we’ll call you into the office,” said Tine.
In September, 87% of customers served were walk-in customers seeking licenses and registration.
Tine credits Senate Bill 245 with helping expand the use of online license renewals. More than 32,000 North Carolinians have used that feature, saving customers time and preventing a backlog of appointments at local DMV offices.

“Commissioner Tine, I’m so happy that you’re here and all the work that you’ve put into helping us in southern Wake County,” said Rep. Erin Paré. The Wake County Republican said she was impressed with his responsiveness as the county looks at potential sites for a new DMV office in Fuquay-Varina.
Brunswick County Rep. Frank Iler offered his own praise as he closed out the hearing.
“I appreciate what you’re doing. I need you to do a good job. You’ve exceeded my expectations so far,” said Iler.
In December, the DMV will release a new strategic plan and select a vendor for its long-awaited IT modernization initiative. In 2026, the agency will open new offices in Brunswick and Sampson Counties.

Glenn Youngkin stepped out of the Executive Mansion on Thursday with their spouses, smiling as they paused to talk with reporters. The couples had just shared a lunch of crab cakes and “Virginia wine,” Youngkin said, as he and Spanberger discussed their transition of power in the months ahead. 
Because governors are statutorily required to live in the mansion — part museum on the ground floor and living quarters upstairs — the Spanberger family will soon need to learn the layout and get briefed on the quirks of living and governing from within Richmond’s Capitol Square for the next four years. 
“It was a wonderful discussion about the transition process and some of the basic realities of what this is going to be for our family,” Spanberger said. “We’ve got our transition office open up and running.” 
She expressed gratitude to Youngkin, his wife and his team for sharing their insights. 
Spanberger’s transition team, announced this week, includes people she worked with during her time in Congress, others with White House experience, and experts from across the state, including higher education and health care. 
Co-chair Yohannes Abraham is a visiting professor at the University of Virginia and served as director of former President Joe Biden’s transition team. Fellow co-chair Kelly Cannon is the CEO of the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association Foundation. Bonnie Krenz-Schurman will serve as chief of staff and Karen Mask as transition director — both worked for Spanberger in Congress. Another co-chair, Samson Signori, managed her campaign for governor. 
 Health care and food on the table

Asked about her first policy priorities as governor — with Democrats also controlling both the House of Delegates and state Senate — Spanberger pointed to affordability issues she emphasized on the campaign trail. 
“Increasing housing supply, lowering costs in housing, in energy, and ultimately in health care,” she said. “Obviously, there’s going to be some challenges along the way with some of the specific federal legislation.” 
Those challenges stem from Congress’ reconciliation bill passed this summer, which includes changes to Medicaid and hospital funding that could leave thousands of Virginians without coverage health insurance and strain vulnerable hospitals. 
Congress has also been gridlocked since early October over annual appropriations bills, triggering what has now become the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. 
The U.S. House has not met since mid-September, while the U.S. Senate has repeatedly failed to advance resolutions. Both parties have blamed the other as Democrats push to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies — affecting about 100,000 Virginians — and Republicans accuse them of holding the government “hostage.” Republicans, however, currently control both chambers of Congress and the White House. 
In her Election Night victory speech, Spanberger called on both parties in Congress and President Donald Trump to work together to end the shutdown as soon as possible. 
Spanberger, once ranked as one of the most bipartisan members in Congress, campaigned on bringing the same pragmatism to the governor’s office. 
Thanks to the budget decisions under Youngkin and the General Assembly, Virginia currently has a surplus that Spanberger and lawmakers will decide how to use in the 2026 budget, which could include addressing health care fallout from federal policy changes. 
Meanwhile, food assistance has become an immediate concern for roughly 850,000 Virginians who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The shutdown has prevented beneficiaries from receiving payments, though the Trump administration was ordered by a court to release part of the national contingency fund, covering only about 65% of the usual benefit amount. 
Youngkin recently established a temporary state-level version of SNAP using surplus funds to bridge the gap. He also set in motion longer-term changes — which Spanberger will inherit — to help social service agencies reduce error rates. 
Under the reconciliation bill, states with high error rates in SNAP payments may be forced to cover more of the program’s cost in the future. 
“There are many things that are still in motion that we will talk about, that hopefully will continue,” Youngkin told reporters  Thursday. “That’s what this is all about and why this transition period is one of cooperation to make sure that Governor-elect Spanberger’s administration is ready to go on Day One and any way we can help in that we will do.”

That number is higher among women, at about 71%, but lower among men, at about 58%. There is also a stark partisan split, with 80% of Democratic Latino voters feeling their civil rights are eroding but just 26% of Republicans who think the same.
“They see immigrant families being used as scapegoats and political props, even as those same workers keep Colorado’s farms, restaurants and resorts running,” Alex Sánchez, CEO of Voces Unidas de las Montañas, said during a briefing on the survey results Thursday morning. “We see Congress failing to protect families from reckless deportations and racial profiling, and they see their reproductive rights, voting rights and civil rights under attack.”

The Colorado survey was part of a national bipartisan effort to understand where Latino voters stand about one year before the 2026 midterm elections. There was an oversample of Colorado voters. The survey was conducted between Oct. 8 and Oct. 22.
When it comes to immigration issues, 40% of voters fear arrest even though they have legal status, 35% believe the workforce is shrinking because immigrants are afraid to go to work, and 30% are more afraid to report crimes and interact with local law enforcement. About 44% said they most want elected officials to create a path to citizenship for immigrants, the most popular policy choice, followed by ensuring that immigration detention facilities are safe and humane.
The survey comes about 10 months into Trump’s second term, which has been marked by a steep increase in immigration detentions and deportations, deployments of the National Guard to Democratic-led cities and a record-breaking government shutdown over whether to extend health insurance subsidies.










While Democrats continue to hold an advantage in Colorado, it's not guaranteed. Latino voters are pragmatic. We reward action, not party labels.


– Alex Sánchez, CEO of Voces Unidas de las Montañas


Overall, economic concerns such as rising costs and stagnant wages were top of mind for voters. They cited inflation, housing costs and the economy as the top issues elected officials should address, which is similar to responses in previous years. About 45% responded that the minimum wage is too low and 45% said one job does not pay enough. Another 59% said access to affordable health insurance should be a priority for lawmakers.
Over half of Latino voters predict their economic situation will be worse in a year.
“As we head into another pivotal election cycle, data like this helps ground the conversation and what matters most to our communities,” said Dusti Gurule, the president and CEO of Colorado Organization for Latina Opportunity and Reproductive Rights. “It really provides us with our marching orders to continue the work.”
A generic Democrat would get 55% of the vote for a 2026 congressional race, according to the survey, compared to about 21% for a Republican. But both parties are underperforming as compared to their 2024 numbers, which could be a sign of voter discontent with the political and electoral systems, according to researcher Gary Segura.
Among Latino voters who voted for Trump in 2024, which is about 35% of the Colorado Latino electorate, 20% said they either would not vote for Trump or did not know if they would vote for him in a do-over of 2024. For comparison, there was an 8% bleed among voters who picked former Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate last year.
“A 20% bleed for Trump voters should be very concerning to GOP political operatives,” Segura said.
About two-thirds of Latino voters disapprove of Trump’s job performance and disapprove of how the Republican Party is handling its majority in Congress. About 60% blame Republicans for the ongoing federal government shutdown that began Oct. 1. Additionally, 81% think Congress is ceding too much authority to Trump and should be using its checks-and-balances role more often.
About 51% of respondents said the Democratic Party cares “a great deal” about the Latino community, compared to the 27% who said the same about the Republican Party. At the same time, 43% said Democrats and 40% said Republicans don’t care too much about Latino interests. That could reflect the “alienation” Latino voters might feel from the political system, Segura said.
“While Democrats continue to hold an advantage in Colorado, it’s not guaranteed. Latino voters are pragmatic. We reward action, not party labels,” Sánchez said. “This poll should be a wake-up call, not just to Republicans, but for Democrats too.”

(Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)A new proposal from a pair of legislative Democrats would institute a number of labor, energy and sustainability requirements on tech companies seeking to build data centers in Wisconsin. 
The proposal from Sen. Jodi Habush Sinykin (D-Whitefish Bay) and Rep. Angela Stroud (D-Ashland) comes as data centers have continued to pop up across the state — largely in southeast Wisconsin — sparking heated local debates about land use, local jobs and the centers’ heavy use of water and electricity. 
There are now 47 data centers in Wisconsin, with more under consideration by local governments. The data centers house computer servers to store information for cloud-based software and, increasingly, to support the expansion of artificial intelligence. 
For local governments, the construction of data centers offers an easy opportunity for property tax revenue from a business that won’t require many local government services. But the servers have high energy and water needs, are often sited on land that has long been used for farming and raise concerns associated with AI. Experts and advocates have been looking for the state government to weigh in more forcefully on how to regulate the centers, the Wisconsin Examiner reported last month. 
So far, the only mentions of data centers in state law are a provision in the 2023-25 state budget which exempts data center construction costs from the sales tax and a law enacted earlier this year to study the growth of nuclear power in the state. 
The proposal from Habush Sinykin and Stroud, announced Thursday, would establish rules beyond current incentives for data center growth. 
“The new legislation being proposed today is about making sure that we have clear, statewide guardrails in place that provide people in communities across Wisconsin with the information and transparency they need to engage in the local decision-making process in an informed, effective manner from the start,” Habush Sinykin, whose district includes a controversial data center project in Port Washington, said in a statement.
Under the proposal, electric companies in the state will be required to submit quarterly reports to the Public Service Commission on the amount of energy being used by data centers in the state. Those reports will be required to include information on the source of the energy and be made public. Water utilities in the state will also be required to publicly report when a single customer will account for more than 25% of the total water usage in the district. 
The data center companies would be required to pay an annual fee to the Department of Administration, which will put that money towards renewable energy programs. Data center buildings would also be required to obtain sustainability certifications. 
The bill would also give data centers an incentive to encourage utility companies to expand clean energy and it would also require the PSC to establish a class of “very large customers” and ensure that normal ratepayers aren’t bearing the increased energy costs caused by the data centers’ growing energy demands. 
“It’s mind-blowing that the only regulations we have on the books are to just incentivize data centers with no expectations for them being good environmental partners with the communities they’re going to be located in,” says Jen Giegerich, the government affairs director at Wisconsin Conservation Voters, which was involved in helping draft the proposal. 
“It’s really important that what this bill does is actually make sure that the data centers are paying their own way,” Giegerich continues. “We’ve just seen energy costs rising, and the fact that we would continue to put costs for energy development for tech giants who are making unheard-of profits, and then expecting Wisconsin ratepayers to pay for that is really a problem. So this bill rectifies that, and I think it’s sorely needed.”
The proposal also includes labor requirements for data center construction. Under the bill, any workers at construction sites for data centers must be paid the local prevailing wage rate or, if the worker is a member of a union, the wage rate in that worker’s collective bargaining agreement. The data center company will have to pay whichever wage is higher. 
To qualify for the sales tax exemptions already available for data centers under current state law, the companies would be required to meet the labor requirements in the bill and source at least 70% of their energy from renewable sources. 
Steve Kwaterski, a spokesperson for the Wisconsin Laborers’ District Council, says data center projects have already been a source of consistent, good paying construction jobs for his members and the bill will go towards ensuring that these jobs support families in the state. 
“We want to make sure that any project that’s as complex as a data center is being done with the most skilled and trained workforce that’s out there,” he says. “That ensures that it’s being done right on time, on budget, and done safely as well.”

(Photo provided by Administrative Office of the Courts)Kentucky Supreme Court Chief Justice Debra Lambert is asking the state’s legislature to greenlight more funding to improve judicial employees’ pay and court facilities across the state. 
Lambert, who became the state’s first female chief justice earlier this year, spoke to lawmakers on the Interim Joint Committee on Judiciary Thursday during her first State of the Judiciary address. The Kentucky General Assembly will return to Frankfort in January for the 2026 legislative session, which will include debate on the next two-year state budget. 
Throughout her address, Lambert called for a “better approach” to how the judicial branch is funded to shore up its operations for the future. Among her funding requests for the state’s judicial branch, Lambert is asking for a 15% pay raise for all judicial branch employees, which would mean a general fund increase of $37 million. She added that Kentucky judicial branch employees make about 17% less on average than executive branch counterparts. 
The chief justice said the judicial branch faces “serious challenges” when attracting and retaining qualified employees. 
“Successful attorneys may have previously chosen to take a cut in pay to serve as a judge because of the potential for good retirement benefits, but that doesn’t happen anymore,” she said. 
Kentucky general jurisdiction judges ranked 48th in pay in comparison to other states, according to the National Center for State Courts. 
Lambert also emphasized a need to better maintain court facilities across the state. Following April floods, some Kentucky courthouses sustained heavy damage, including the Franklin County Courthouse in the state capital of Frankfort. The Franklin courts system moved operations back into the courthouse in September, but flood remediation was still ongoing. The judicial branch is asking for a one-time funding request to offset more than $8.5 million in flood related damages in Franklin and Hardin counties. 
The chief justice also proposed that the judicial branch have a dedicated revenue source to support long-term technology needs, such as subscription software and courtroom audio and video systems. 
“We must ensure that our courts remain strong, stable and accessible for generations to come,” Lambert said. “But great optimism does not mean that we can ignore a very harsh reality.”
The budget for Kentucky’s judicial branch is now about 3% of the state’s General Fund budget, or more than $466 million. In comparison, the executive branch is 97% of the General Fund budget, or $16.8 billion. 
Additionally, Lambert requested that the judicial branch have early access to its reserve account to make up for a projected shortfall of roughly $14.3 million in the next fiscal year. The legislature must sign off on the request, even though the judiciary would access its own funds and would not require supplemental funds. 
Lambert also gave updates about various court programs to support Kentuckians in the court system. In particular, the Kentucky Judicial Commission on Mental Health has repeatedly heard that “our system is strained, but it can be repaired and improved,” Lambert said.Challenges described include transportation. For example, current rules around regional mental health hospital assignments can mean that a person who is suicidal doesn’t get taken to the closest hospital, like a person suffering a medical emergency would. Lambert said there is a need for “greater consistency, improve coordination and quicker access to treatment.” 
‘Do what we can do’

House Republican Whip Rep. Jason Nemes, of Middletown, said legislators will “do what we can do” to approve a pay raise for the judicial branch. He added that the General Assembly increased pay for general jurisdiction judges by 20% over four years to $156,000, but Kentucky has still fallen behind other states.
When responding to Nemes’ comments, Lambert added that she would like to expand resources for truancy prevention for students from the courts, such as a curriculum that judges can offer schools. About 25% of Kentucky students were chronically absent from school during the 2024-25 school year, according to data from the Kentucky Department of Education. 
Nemes then said that chronic absenteeism is an issue in Jefferson County Public Schools, which is the state’s largest public school district centered around the Louisville metro area. 
“I would note that Jefferson County Public Schools has 92,000 kids in it, and we have to do things differently for Jefferson County Public Schools. Because anybody who would say that we must treat JCPS the same as we treat Robertson County, which has 3,000 people in the entire county, I don’t think is understanding the real world,” Nemes said. “So, we have to regulate things that are different, and we hope that the court of justice understands that in cases that might be before it or might be coming before it.” 
The Supreme Court agreed to rehear oral arguments in one of those cases this year, where JCPS challenged a 2022 law that shifts power from the elected school board to the appointed superintendent. Justices narrowly voted to vacate a previous ruling and renew the case after the election of Justice Pamela Goodwine last year. 
Nemes published an op-ed in the Louisville Courier-Journal before the second round of oral arguments saying that the court’s next ruling “will not only determine the future of Jefferson County’s schools but could also unravel critical local policies that benefit urban, suburban and rural communities.” 
Though they didn’t address the committee Wednesday, Goodwine and Deputy Chief Justice Robert Conley were in the audience behind Lambert during the meeting.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SOJ_Chief-Justice-Lambert_110625-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-06 16:56:58.434930

(Main photo by Getty Images; logo courtesy the State of Iowa) A Polk County company is suing members of the Iowa Ethics and Campaign Disclosure Board, alleging they unlawfully directed the company to remove campaign signs from its property in advance of this week’s school board elections.
Acco Unlimited Corporation and its owners are suing IECDB members James Albert, Elaine Olson, Jonathan Roos, Daniel Jessop and Leah Rodenberg, as well as the executive director of the IECDB, Erika Eckley, in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
In addition to the corporation itself, the plaintiffs in the case include Cris Christenson and Connor Christenson, who are trustees of the trust that owns Acco’s real estate.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The lawsuit alleges that Cris Christenson supported a slate of candidates in the Nov. 4, 2025, election for Johnston Community School District Board. The candidates backed by Cris Christenson included his son and co-plaintiff, Connor, and Alicia Penner and Patrick Green — all three of whom were defeated in Tuesday’s election.
To show his support for their campaigns, Cris Christenson placed campaign signs for the three on property that Acco Unlimited occupies within the school district. Sometime in mid-October, the lawsuit alleges, the IECDB staff contacted Cris Christenson to inform him it had received a complaint alleging signs that advocated for the election of school board candidates were on Acco’s corporate property — a potential violation of laws that restrict corporate backing of candidates.
According to the lawsuit, Cris Christenson explained that while the business is a for-profit company, the property is owned by a revocable trust controlled by the Christenson family. The IECDB staff allegedly responded by indicating that because a corporation occupies the property, the signs could not be displayed.
The IECDB staff also contacted Connor Christenson, Penner and Green to tell them to remove the signs from the Acco Unlimited property. According to the lawsuit, each of the three initially refused to do so, arguing that the IECDB had not adequately explained the legal basis for such a demand.
On Oct. 27, 2025, Eckley presented the issue to the board at a public meeting and asked for authorization to initiate a formal investigation, which the board provided. The next day, Acco and the three candidates removed their signs from the Acco Unlimited property, the lawsuit alleges.
Hours later, Eckley informed the board the signs had been removed. Albert proposed that the board issue a reprimand, noting that Cris Christenson and the three candidates had “defied” the board’s attorneys when first contacted about the violation, the lawsuit claims.
Albert’s subsequent motion to issue a reprimand and an accompanying warning of additional consequences for future violation was approved by the board without dissent.
As part of the lawsuit, Cris Christenson says the board’s actions deprived him “of his ability to advocate for candidates of his choice from property occupied by a corporation that he controls.”
His co-plaintiff, Connor Christenson, alleges the board deprived him of his ability to “communicate his message to potential voters and to associate himself with a well-regarded Johnston family business.”
In addition, the Acco Unlimited company claims the board deprived it of the ability to “associate with reputable candidates who will implement policies at the local level that they find agreeable.”
Although the 2025 school board election has now passed, the lawsuit claims all of the plaintiffs intend to engage in similar political activity in the future, including the 2026 primary and general elections.
Iowa laws specifies that campaign signs shall not be placed on “property owned, leased, or occupied by a prohibited contributor,” such as corporations, unless the sign advocates the passage or defeat of a ballot issue or is otherwise exempted by law. A separate section of the law bars corporations making any “monetary or in-kind contribution to a candidate or committee” except for a ballot-issue committee.
The lawsuit cites a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court case, Citizens United v. Federal Elections Commission, which involved politically oriented speech by a corporate entity.
“The court has recognized that First Amendment protection extends to corporations,” the U.S. Supreme Court held in that case, adding that “political speech is indispensable to decision-making in a democracy, and this is no less true because the speech comes from a corporation rather than an individual.”
The lawsuit contends that under the Citizens United ruling, the question of whether advocacy for a candidate in the form of campaign signs is permitted “cannot turn on whether than advocacy is done by an individual or a corporate entity.”
The lawsuit also contends that the “restriction on placement of candidate signs on corporate occupied property does not further any governmental interest” and that the board has violated the First Amendment rights of the plaintiffs.
The Christensons and their company are represented in the lawsuit by Alan R. Ostergren of Iowa’s Kirkwood Institute, a self-described “conservative public-interest law firm.” The institute describes itself as “nonpartisan” and has been recognized by the IRS as a tax-exempt public charity.
The IECDB has yet to file a response to the lawsuit. Eckley declined to comment on the case, noting that she had yet to see a copy of the complaint.

Lahn launched his campaign in Belle Plaine at his family farm, according to a news release. He said he plans to emphasize strengthening rural communities, supporting anti-abortion measures and “making Iowa healthy again.”
The Republican candidate has some political experience, having worked for a member of the Colorado state senate and running campaigns for Republican candidates in Iowa. He also has worked for Americans for Prosperity, a conservative political advocacy group. Lahn, who has not previously held political office, emphasized his status as an outsider to Iowa politics and said he was backing the campaign with his own funds.

“I’m not a politician — I’m my own biggest donor, and I can’t be bought,” Lahn said in a statement. “I’m running for Governor because I believe we’re losing the Iowa we love — who we are as a people, our heritage, our culture.”
Lahn said his campaign would be focused on issues like supporting family farms, increasing border security and improving Iowa’s education system. His campaign website states he would “restore parents to their rightful place in education” and “keep ideology out of classrooms” as governor. He also said he would work to tackle large corporations’ influence on Iowans in industries like agriculture and pharmaceuticals.
“The people who built Iowa are being pushed aside by greed and corruption,” Lahn said. “Big ag and big pharma have rigged the system against farmers and poisoned our families for generations. When I’m Governor, we’ll sue them, break up their monopolies, and make them answer for what they’ve done to Iowa.”
Lahn is joining a field of candidates aiming to become the Iowa GOP candidate for governor in 2026 after Gov. Kim Reynolds announced she will not seek reelection. Other Republicans in the race include U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, Iowa Rep. Eddie Andrews, R-Johnston, former director of the Iowa Department of Administrative Services Adam Steen and former state Rep. Brad Sherman. Iowa Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, has an “exploratory” committee for governor, but has not officially launched a campaign.
Democrats criticized Lahn’s campaign Thursday, with Democratic Governors Association spokesperson Izzi Levy saying, “if two’s company and three’s a crowd, Zach Lahn’s entrance into the five-man race for Iowa’s GOP nomination for governor is nothing short of a clown car.”
“Just like his opponents, Lahn’s toxic record includes opposing Medicaid expansion, championing plans to gut public education, and supporting tariffs that are jacking up costs on Iowa farmers,” Levy said in a statement. “And just like them, Lahn would continue the last decade of disastrous one-party leadership that has led to a failing economy, underfunded schools, widespread government corruption, and a ban on abortion that restricts women’s care before they even know they’re pregnant.”
Iowa Auditor Rob Sand and Julie Stauch, a former Democratic political operative, are running as Democratic candidates in the 2026 gubernatorial election.
Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart also criticized Lahn, calling him “just another member of the gang of insiders that would continue Iowa down the wrong direction” in a statement.
“Iowans need new leadership that will solve some of our toughest challenges, not more tariffs, vouchers, and health care cuts from a staffer for Kim Reynolds’ favorite special interest group,” Hart said.

Josh Stein said in a news conference Thursday, Nov. 6, 2025 in Raleigh. “Because if [lawmakers] fail to do so, people are suffering. And it is unacceptable.” (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Gov. Josh Stein renewed his demand Thursday for North Carolina lawmakers to pass additional funding for Medicaid, calling a special legislative session more than a month after his administration slashed payments to providers.
Stein, a Democrat, has maintained that the Republican-led legislature needs to approve additional funding to reverse the cuts, which range from 3% to 10% across providers. But House and Senate leaders have thus far failed to come to an agreement on a funding package, while widely criticizing Stein for cutting rates.
The governor, in a press conference Thursday, further sharpened his criticism of lawmakers, saying they had “failed North Carolina and the people of North Carolina” and calling their inaction “shameful.”
“It is time to fund Medicaid,” Stein said. “Because if they fail to do so, people are suffering. And it is unacceptable.”
Stein is expected to issue a formal announcement of a special session, planned for Monday, Nov. 17. But it remains to be seen whether any substantive agreement will be reached; although lawmakers are scheduled to return to Raleigh that week, leaders in both chambers have signaled they are done with votes for the year.
Spokespeople for House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) and Senate Leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday.
North Carolina health officials, including state Health and Human Services Secretary Dev Sangvai, have said the state’s Medicaid program is underfunded by around $319 million. Stein has previously laid out three options for lawmakers: lay out $319 million for full funding, lay out $190 million to delay cuts through the new year, or allow the executive branch to tap into a reserve fund.
Both the House and Senate have separately approved plans to fund the program. In the House, one bill would have let the state dip into that reserve fund to delay cuts through the end of the year; another contains just language to fund Medicaid. The Senate’s proposal to fund the program also includes line items for rural health care and the N.C. Children’s hospital.

Those disagreements have led to a months-long standoff on the issue (as well as one on the broader state budget). Senate Republican leaders have called on the House to “stop playing politics and come to the negotiating table”; Hall has said he believes “[the House’s] bills are better.”
Stein said Thursday he had spoken to Hall and Berger last week about the issue. The conversation “didn’t go as well as I wanted it to go,” he said.
“Both chambers agree that we need more money, and how much money to get,” Stein said. “But what they cannot do is come to an agreement on a bill because of a dispute on an unrelated issue.
“I actually take the side of the Senate on [that issue],” he added. “But this is not the time or place to fight that fight.”
Republican leaders could choose to return to Raleigh and declare Stein’s special session unconstitutional. They did so in 2017, after former Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper called on them to redraw legislative maps after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling.
Democratic leaders in both the House and Senate issued statements in support of Stein’s special session call Thursday.
“It’s long past time for Republicans to stop playing games with people’s health,” Senate Democratic leader Sydney Batch (D-Wake) said.

The cuts mean health care providers are receiving less money to care for the 3.1 million North Carolinians enrolled in the program. Primary care doctors, dentists, hospitalizations, community care and nursing homes are all dependent on the program’s funding.
Stein and Sangvai were joined Thursday by two such enrollees and one family physician whose practice participates in Medicaid. Demi Eckhoff, a Medicaid participant who is also an advocate for people with disabilities, said the cuts put several support services she relies on at risk.

Lawmakers, religious leaders and anti-abortion activists rallied on the steps of the Michigan State Capitol on Thursday to call out what state Sen. John Damoose, a Harbor Springs Republican, referred to as “the devastation wrought by Proposal 3.”
The second “March for Life” rally, hosted by Right to Life of Michigan, was hosted on the anniversary of the passage of Proposal 3, the ballot initiative that enshrined the right to an abortion into Michigan’s state constitution. A release from Right to Life of Michigan estimated that thousands of people attended the event, which filled the lawn in front of the Capitol steps.
Damoose, as well as Jennie Bradley Lichter, the president of national organization March for Life, categorized the situation in Michigan as grim for anti-abortion activism. Lichter spoke to the “challenging legal, political, and cultural landscape here in Michigan,” while Damoose said, “the world does look very dim right now in the wake of Proposal 3.”

A lawsuit to overturn Proposal 3, filed by Right to Life of Michigan and others, was dismissed last month by Judge Paul Maloney of the U.S. District Court Western District of Michigan’s Southern Division, though plaintiffs have filed an appeal in the case in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
Speakers at Thursday’s rally largely centered their speeches around shifting narratives around abortions and providing pregnant people with information about alternatives to abortions. One of the main calls was support for Pregnancy Resource Centers. Those organizations, also known as crisis pregnancy centers, have been criticized by many reproductive rights advocates for providing misleading, often religious-influenced information to discourage people from seeking abortions. 
“You can get an abortion now with no regard for your safety, and there are no physical or psychological consequences,” said Angi Lok, a nurse at the Pregnancy Resource Center of Grand Rapids. “We, the PRCs, are empowering women with knowledge to take a moment, a breath, a pause, to have the opportunity to make an informed life decision. And when women are supported and informed, most often they choose life.”
Amber Roseboom, president of Right to Life of Michigan, similarly characterized her organization’s work as seeking to support pregnant individuals. 
“We stand with, not against women facing unplanned pregnancies,” she said. “We offer compassion, the truth and love, hope, including the practical care and support to make a choice for life.”

But abortion advocates pushed back against the idea that people are being pressured into abortions. Jex Blackmore, a founding member of the Hydra Mutual Aid Fund, a mutual aid project supporting abortion access in Michigan, called those categorizations “a fabricated crisis to rationalize restricting access to care that is proven to be safe and necessary.”
“It is a condescending and cynical approach that treats the public as unable to understand their own medical decisions and attempts to replace personal autonomy with political ideology,” they wrote. “It is deeply disrespectful to the people whose lives and health are actually at stake.”
Lichter also announced during the rally a package of three bills, introduced on Tuesday in the state House of Representatives, that are seeking to re-introduce reporting requirements for abortion providers that were eliminated in early 2024. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Your pro-life Michigan representatives just filed three bills that would reestablish reporting requirements about abortions obtained in Michigan, and about the complications that result from them,” she said. “This proposed legislation is so important. It would not only provide women with important information about the risk of abortion, but would demand transparency and accountability from big abortion. Women have a right to know about the rates and types of serious complications, especially given the shocking recent 38% increase in serious abortion complications initiated.”
That statistic cited by Lichter originates from a misleading 2021 analysis published by the Charlotte Lozier Institute, an anti-abortion think tank, according to Blackmore. 
“Peer reviewed population-level studies consistently find that serious complications from medication abortion occur in well under 1 percent of cases, placing it among the safest medical interventions in routine clinical care,” Blackmore added. “Major medical organizations, including ACOG [American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists] and the WHO [World Health Organization], affirm this evidence.”
Despite the new legislation being introduced, Damoose’s remarks were not focused on legislative action at either the federal or state level. 
“This has never been just a political battle. It’s a moral and spiritual battle,” he told the crowd. “Our mission has shifted from trying to pass a policy to where it probably should have been from the beginning and where it has been for many of you all along. And that is building a culture of life so strong that legal or not, people would never even dream of taking an innocent life.”
U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) also made an appearance at the rally to discuss federal legislation, including the “Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act,” a House bill that he has supported. In telling the crowd to call for Michigan’s senators to vote for it, he also jabbed to say, “while you’re at it, maybe ask them to open the government up, too.”

Lok, like many of the speakers, criticized pro-choice rhetoric for being misleading to pregnant people. 
“Their deception is centered around the mother. ‘My body, my choice’ being one example,” she said, referring to a common pro-choice slogan. 
Similarly, Mayra Rodriguez, a former Planned Parenthood Arizona administrator who won a wrongful termination lawsuit in 2019 after reporting her concerns about unsafe medical practices in the clinic, told the crowd, “Abortion does not empower women. It wants them, it changes them in silence.”
“What occurred at the March for Life event was not a good faith conversation about health. It was an orchestrated effort to weaponize misinformation in order to frighten the public,” Blackmore noted. “This is not medically or intellectually serious.” 
The event concluded with a march to Michigan’s Hall of Justice.

(Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — New Kansas businesses with demanding electricity requirements will be subject to additional costs and restrictions after the Kansas Corporation Commission approved a large-load tariff Thursday morning. 
Evergy applied earlier this year to the state’s regulatory body to create a large-load tariff that would mitigate the effect of such users on other customers. 
After numerous filings and negotiations among convenors, including environmental organizations, a data center association and school districts, the tariff affects new businesses using more than 75 megawatts of peak load energy per month.
Existing businesses that increase their pull on the system by 75 megawatts per month will also come under the tariff, said Brian Fedotin, the KCC staff member who summarized the bill for the three-member commission. 
All convenors unanimously approved the tariff and on Thursday, it received unanimous approval from the KCC.  
The final order sets multiple requirements for large-load users, including a minimum contract term of 12 years, plus an optional five-year period as the company ramps up, Fedotin said. 
It also requires those customers to pay a minimum of 80% of their contract, even in months where they don’t use that much electricity, and to post collateral for two years of minimum bills. 
In Evergy’s third-quarter earnings call Thursday morning, CEO and president David Campbell said the company projects 2% to 3% load growth by 2029 with current customers, including big customers like Panasonic. That projection may increase to 4% to 5% load growth if negotiations for two data center projects come to fruition, he said.
In addition, Campbell said, there’s an additional data center project in the works and multiple customers that would represent about 2 to 3 additional gigawatts of peak demand. They were not included in the 4% to 5% forecast, he said, so demand could increase. 
“Overall, we continue to see an incredible level of interest in our service territory,” Campbell said on the call. “We’re making progress with potential new large customers across all phases of discussion. Each category reflects potential new entrants that will empower growth, investment and drive prosperity for our region.”
Evergy spokeswoman Gina Penzig said any new business coming on line with projections of 75 megawatts of load would be subject to the tariff, but there could be exceptions. 
“These tariffs will apply to any new load expected to be 75MW or greater unless certain state incentives are offered to new prospective customers, which in that case could lead to a special contract,” she said. 
In September, Evergy executive vice president of utility operations Chuck Caisley called Kansas’ design of its large-load tariff “a model” for other states because it seeks to distribute costs without affecting small businesses and residential customers.
The Sierra Club was represented in the docket by Great Rivers Environmental Law Center and signed the unanimous agreement, although the organization still has concerns. 
Sarah Rubenstein, a Great Rivers staff attorney, said without the tariff and clear protections, families and small businesses could foot the bill for data centers and other large load users. 
“This settlement ensures that large energy users share responsibility for the infrastructure they require while also creating new opportunities to move the grid toward clean, renewable energy,” she said. 
Sierra Club supported changes in Evergy’s original tariff proposal during the negotiations, such as decreasing the threshold from 100 megawatts to 75 megawatts and allowing large-load customers to shape climate goals through Evergy’s integrated resource plan, the organization said in a news release. 
Sierra Club’s statement said it is concerned because Evergy is delaying coal plant retirements and building natural gas plants to meet energy demands. 
“Evergy is going in the wrong direction by delaying coal plant retirements that are increasingly expensive and less reliable, but we joined this agreement alongside tech companies and the utility because it places reasonable protections on existing customers while enabling new investments in clean energy,” said Ty Gorman, Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign senior organizing strategist.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/KCC-building-1024x584.jpg,,,2025-11-06 16:02:38.106389

But the distribution on the first Thursday of November occurred after the disruption to federal food benefits, and surpassed the high need volunteers already see on a regular basis.
According to Amanda Bregel, The Food Depot’s communications director, the first distribution last month served 595 households. The last October event—when people had heard about the possible forthcoming halt to benefits through the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program—served 662. Thursday’s distribution served 743 households, she said—nearly 3,000 individuals.

The United States Department of Agriculture initially announced they would not be providing SNAP benefits until the federal shutdown ended. Two federal judges last week blocked the Trump administration from not paying the benefits, but even as of Thursday, litigation over the issue continued, as the USDA acknowledged it had miscalculated the decreased benefits it would be paying.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced at the end of October the state would distribute $30 million through emergency declarations to compensate for SNAP, the equivalent of approximately 10 days worth of benefits. The governor also said during a news conference announcing the funding that another special legislative session to address the rest of the month could happen.
In the meantime, food banks in Albuquerque and Las Cruces also have reported higher numbers of people showing up for food distributions.
The Food Depot serves people in nine counties and has 85 different partners, such as schools, churches and other nonprofits. Bregel told Source NM on Thursday that “every single agency that ordered last week ordered more food than they ever have before. So everybody is needing more support for their distributions.”
At the same time, she noted, donations also have increased, both food and monetary ones.
“We are really excited that people are supporting us with food, but also funds, which help us purchase more food,” she said. “Because we’re purchasing so much more food than we usually do. We’ve purchased like three months of food in just the past week or two.”

Monica Garcia came to the food distribution for the first time on Thursday. A single mother, she said, the SNAP upheaval “is really tough on me right now. It’s just really hard and stressful, me working 40 hours a week and dividing my time with my kid and work. Now that they cut our SNAP, sometimes I don’t know what to do.”

The Food Depot’s volunteers were waiting in the early-morning chill before gates opened to the public at 7 a.m., some drinking coffee and eating donuts as they listened to Pauline Montoya, the volunteer coordinator, explain how the morning would work. In anticipation of more attendees, they would distribute for three, rather than the usual two hours.

Montoya started volunteering with The Food Depot during the COVID-19 pandemic when she saw distributions in her community on the San Ildefonso Pueblo. “That just kind of opened my eyes,” Montoya said, “like, ‘wow, I can actually help.'”
The work is rewarding, she said, “just going home and knowing that someone has food at their table at the end of the night.” And while the current SNAP problems are upsetting to clients and staff: “We are doing our best to stay positive and help our clients through this hard time.”
Paige Rodriguez, one of The Food Depot’s clients, came through Thursday morning with her 5-year-old son in the back seat. “It’s hard,” she said, choking back tears. “It’s hard to keep a roof over your head right as it is. I really struggle…but I’m just trying to get through it.”
Bregel said in response to the current heightened need, The Food Depot is also providing pop-up emergency distributions each week. The organization has an online interactive map where people can find food near their locations.
Program coordinator Diego Salinas bagged lettuce with volunteer Patty Karlovitz on Thursday and remarked that the large distributions “feels like the culmination of all our work, everybody’s work, in all our different departments.”
Volunteers greeted car after car, wishing everyone a good morning, smiling, and filling their cars with a variety of fresh and pantry foods. “It’s nice to sort of see the clients smiling, to interact with them,” Salinas said. “It’s really joyous work.”
Karlovitz added: “When you’re 83 years old, you think you don’t have anything to offer anymore, but you have this.”
Thursday marked Steven Freemire’s first day volunteering at the distribution, though he had helped pack food at The Food Depot before. “I thought it would be a wonderful opportunity to actually give food directly to people,” he said. “All the more so now.”
Even so, he noted. “I was really shocked to see the line of cars, how many people were waiting. It’s very moving to be that much more aware of the need out there.”

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Tuesday’s municipal elections across Montana featured six mayoral contests in the state’s largest cities.
While a couple featured incumbent candidates, residents in several cities will have new executives in office in the near future. All of Montana’s mayoral races are nonpartisan.
Here’s a short roundup of the changes in city halls across the state. All results are considered unofficial.
Kalispell
In the state’s fastest growing city, Ryan Hunter, an incumbent city councilor supported by the Flathead County Democrats, won a three-way race against Republican-endorsed Kisa Davison and Sid Daoud, former chair of the Montana Libertarian Party. Hunter campaigned heavily on pushing for fair and responsible growth in the city, addressing the housing and homelessness crisis, and bolstering walkability and open spaces.
Helena
In the capital city, two sitting city commissioners with roots in Democratic politics faced off to replace Mayor Wilmot Collins, who served in the role since 2018.
Emily Dean held a 203-vote lead over Andy Shirtliff according to the county’s unofficial votes, a reverse of the results of the city’s primary election, which saw Shirtliff prevail. Dean was endorsed by Collins and city commissioner Sean Logan.
Billings
With Billings Mayor Bill Cole on his way out of office, two city council members, a local businessman and a young, political newcomer vied for the open seat to lead the state’s largest municipality.
Unofficial results show hotel owner and developer Mike Nelson with a 185-vote lead over city councilor Jennifer Owen, who has a background in law and community development. Montana’s automatic recount law kicks in at a victory of less than 0.5%, and the Nelson’s lead is roughly 0.6%.
The narrow lead could change as the county elections department deals with rejected ballots that voters were able to fix on Wednesday, and counts provisional ballots.
Missoula
Missoula Mayor Andrea Davis has been in office since winning a special election in 2023 to serve out former Mayor John Engen’s term after he died in 2022.
Davis won her first full four-year term this week over Shawn Knopp by roughly 38 percentage points. Davis said she was running for re-election to work to implement new land-use and zoning regulations to work on housing affordability in the city, as well as prioritizing sustainability and a clean environment.
Knopp had run on a platform of changing the status quo, increasing fiscal responsibility and addressing high property taxes.
Bozeman
The City of Bozeman has a unique governing system where mayors are elected two years out from when they begin their term, and serve as deputy mayor in the interim.
City Commissioner Douglas Fisher took a commanding lead over environmental lawyer John Meyer and a political neophyte Brendan O’Connor with 61.5% of the vote. Fisher was endorsed by six former and current mayors, including current Mayor Terry Cunningham and Deputy (and soon-to-be) Mayor Joey Morrison.
Great Falls
Great Falls was the only big city with a full-term incumbent mayor running for reelection. Mayor Cory Reeves, first elected in 2023, won his second term with 72.5% of the vote. He has drawn on his background in law enforcement working for both the Great Falls Police Department and the Cascade County Sheriff’s Office.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/montana-election-day-2024-5-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-06 16:02:38.106389

He said rates for CFI caretakers are so low it makes it nearly impossible to get the care he needs. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)It costs the state of New Hampshire roughly three times more to place someone with physical disabilities or older adults in a nursing home than it does to pay for in-home care, according to evidence presented in an ongoing court case. More importantly, most of these people want to stay in their own homes.
Still, many who take advantage of the state’s Choices for Independence program, which provides this type of in-home care, say the program is so lackluster due to state underinvestment it’s forcing many of them into nursing homes.
The state of the CFI program is at the heart of a civil lawsuit filed in 2021 by a group of nonprofits that has since expanded to a massive class-action suit. A trial in federal court could begin next year.
A program in disarray
Dan Hebert, a Concord software engineer who uses a wheelchair because of his disability, is a CFI participant and a member of the plaintiff class.
“I’m 43 years old,” Hebert said. “I want to say I’m just like you. Career, hopes, dreams, family, friends, hobbies, you know, the life that we all want to live and lead. And by accident of birth, I’m here and you’re there, so, yeah, I don’t want to go to a nursing home.”
CFI provides people with physical disabilities and older adults who want to live at home the care they need to make that happen using Medicaid funds. To be eligible for the program, participants must have a medical condition that qualifies for residential care at a nursing home. Roughly 5,000 people participate in the program and in 2024 the state paid $111 million for their care, the state said in court filings.
For Hebert, the state puts money into an account that’s managed by a payroll company. Hebert hires caretakers to help him with his daily life and the payroll company pays those caretakers. He said the rates the state allows him to pay caregivers is so low it makes hiring close to impossible. He’s had a vacancy for one of his caregivers since April. His ads get few calls. He has no-shows for interviews. People mislead him about their criminal records. Without caretakers, Hebert is unable to get out of bed in the morning, feed himself, or use the restroom. When Hebert doesn’t have a caretaker, it means he has to wait.
“You can just run into that bathroom when your stomach rumbles,” Hebert said. “Me? I’m looking at the clock. That’s my reality.”
Without caretakers, Hebert is stuck in his wheelchair or bed, something that if done for too long, results in bed sores and other health complications. He said he’s had to go to the hospital because of the sores as well as digestive issues due to not being able to get to the restroom.
Ideally, a caretaker comes four times a day, he said, to help him get ready in the morning, for meals and bathroom trips during the day, and again at bedtime. He said keeping that schedule is often impossible with his staffing issues.
He doesn’t have any ill will towards caretaker who quit because of low pay or have to call in sick, he said. He knows the rates are too low.
“Caregiving is a team,” he said. “Everyone that works for me has their own life, their own challenges, family, health issues, whatever is going on for them and they’re taking time out of their day to come over to my house to get me out of bed in the morning.”
Hebert said the situation needs to be “symbiotic.”
”The healthiest caregiving situations I’ve ever had were the ones where it worked for both of us,” he said. “I think it’s hard not to care from both sides. Like, they care about me, about my well-being, and I do too for them.”
Hebert said he doesn’t “think they’re (DHHS officials) bad people.” He just “fundamentally disagrees” with them.
A five-year legal battle
The case has been playing out in federal court since January 2021, when two CFI participants sued the state. In 2023, U.S. District Court Judge Paul Barbadoro certified the case as a class-action, opening the door for many more CFI participants, including Hebert, to join in. On Oct. 29, Barbadoro heard a series of arguments from both sides asking him to end the case with a pre-trial ruling — or at least rule on a couple of issues. Early on in the hearing though, Barbadoro made it clear that he wasn’t going to “rubber stamp” the case.
The CFI participants are represented by a coalition of nonprofits including the AARP Foundation, the Disability Rights Center-NH, New Hampshire Legal Assistance, and the private law firm Nixon Peabody. Attorneys argue that because of a lack of funding and support for the CFI program the state is putting people at risk of being institutionalized in a nursing home, a violation of their rights under the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act.
Meanwhile, the state has hired boutique Washington, D.C. law firm Brown & Peisch to represent DHHS alongside its in-house counsel. In last week’s hearing, the attorneys argued the court can penalize DHHS only when people are actually institutionalized or “on the precipice” of institutionalization. DHHS’ attorneys argued anything more was going beyond what Congress mandated in the ADA.
Barbadoro cast doubt on this assertion, arguing that it is too vague.
“So super serious risk of institutionalization?” he said. “That would be your standard?”
The judge also expressed frustration with what he sees as a lack of specificity from the plaintiffs, telling them any potential order he issues will include specific demands of DHHS and he wants them to offer specific ideas for those demands.
In an interview with the Bulletin, lead counsel for the AARP Foundation and the plaintiffs Kelly Bagby pushed back on the idea that they haven’t been specific.
“I think that the judge has just not focused on it,” Bagby said. “But when you look at the actual injunction we have, there’s like 15 sub parts of what they have to do.”
Most of all, the plaintiffs want DHHS to undergo a thorough review of the program, the rates they pay providers, and what it would take to meet the needs of CFI participants.
Still, Bagby thinks the judge understands the issues they argue are plaguing the program.
DHHS’ attorneys referred the Bulletin to the Attorney General’s Office for questions. Michael Garrity, spokesperson for the office, declined to answer the Bulletin’s questions on the case. DHHS acknowledged in court there is a staffing shortage in the program. Still, it wouldn’t elaborate on whether it has plans to address that shortage independent of a court order.
Barbadoro will need to review a series of motions from both parties, but he warned the process could take months, especially given a slew of immigration-related cases that are inundating the courts. After that, if the judge doesn’t give summary judgement, a trial could take place in 2026.
“This is already five years old,” he said. “I want to resolve it.”’
If DHHS is forced to comply, will lawmakers get on board?
Even if the judge orders a rate analysis and DHHS complies, the department would still need lawmakers’ support to implement a rate adjustment. The Joint Legislative Fiscal Committee — a panel of lawmakers from both the House and Senate — would need to approve a transfer within DHHS to the CFI program. If DHHS doesn’t have the money to transfer, a funding bill would need to be approved by the House, Senate, and Gov. Kelly Ayotte.
The plaintiffs are confident that their proposal for DHHS would be enough for the department to persuade lawmakers.
“You need to educate the Legislature about why this is essential,” Bagby said. “And if they make it clear to the Legislature that it is essential for the citizens of New Hampshire, if they get whatever it is that the court is ordering, then they’ll do it. But, I mean, you have to make the argument. It’s part of the process.”
Indeed, the Legislature has given rate hikes before. In 2023, it increased rates across several Medicaid programs, including CFI, by roughly $134 million in that year’s budget.
Meanwhile, CFI participants continue to deal with the program’s challenges. Hebert said he understands “this is how the sausage is made.”
“The issues that they talk about in this lawsuit are happening all the time, and they have over the duration of this lawsuit, and for however long this goes on,” Hebert said, “There’s frustration, for sure, but I understand it’s a process, and if this can fix it, it’ll be worth it.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/hebertcfi-1024x709.jpg,,,2025-11-06 16:02:38.106389

(Credit: Michael Moline)Former House Speaker and Republican gubernatorial hopeful Paul Renner is calling for Congress to eliminate the Affordable Care Act and for the Florida Legislature to nix “medical vaccine mandates” and prohibit patients who refuse to be vaccinated from being excluded or segregated  from others.
While Florida leads the nation in enrollment in the federal health exchange with more than 4.6 million residents relying on the marketplace (healthcare.gov) for their insurance, Renner, called the law a failure and said its caused the costs of health care to skyrocket.
“I think the key thing is government can, and obviously does, is to go in to help people financially when they need it. Where we get in trouble is when government tries to run things or they over regulate, and that’s the problem with Obamacare,” Renner told the Florida Phoenix in a phone interview.
“Health care costs have gone up since Obamacare, more than inflation, and more than even wages. And that latter part is the problem. It’s that people can’t afford Obamacare. They can’t afford it anymore, which is why then, Congress is looking at more and more subsidies. So the solution is not to keep subsidizing.”
Renner told the Phoenix that when he was in the Legislature he was enrolled in the state group health insurance plan which itself is heavily subsidized by taxpayers while premiums have been kept at the same level for years.
Renner’s platform, dubbed the “Florida Health Freedom and Wellness Initiative,” addresses four broad policy areas: protecting medical freedom; increasing safety and transparency;  parental rights and healthy schools; and community wellness and preventative care. Under each umbrella topic, Renner lists the ways he plans on achieving his objectives if elected Florida’s next governor.
Renner faces U.S. Congressman Byron Donalds in the Republican primary, who has been endorsed by President Donald Trump.  Donalds is on the record opposing the ACA, but, unlike Renner, he has not released a health care platform. And health care isn’t included in a list of  seven issues posted on Donalds’ campaign website.
Renner supports Gov. Ron DeSantis and Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo’s call to eliminate vaccine mandates, though the issue hasn’t gained any traction in the Florida Legislature to date and is not supported by all Republicans.
Renner’s health care platform goes further, ending what he calls “medical mandates for vaccines” and prohibiting exclusion or segregation of patients based on vaccination status. That also is an issue the DeSantis administration supports and worked, albeit unsuccessfully, to pass during the 2025 session.
No vax, no mask, but still service

The push to require physicians to treat all patients fell short after several senators raised concerns, including Sen. Gayle Harrell, who said the move could expose physicians to greater liability. Sen. Jason Pizzo also cried fowl and said the requirement contradicted a law (passed under Renner’s term as House speaker) that guarantees Florida physicians legal protections to not treat patients on the basis of their conscience.

The group Stand for Health Freedom praised Renner’s platform.
“Paul Renner’s Florida Health Freedom and Wellness Initiative embodies what Stand for Health Freedom has championed from the start: empowering parents, restoring transparency, and promoting personal responsibility in health policy. It takes vision and conviction to set moral boundaries around public health authority,” Leah Wilson, co-founder and executive director for Stand for Health Freedom said in a prepared statement. “Renner has both and will work tirelessly to secure a brighter, freer, and healthier future for our children.”
Included under parental rights and healthy schools category includes proposals to remove harmful additives from school meals, expand local farm-to-school purchasing, restore student fitness standards, and promote active childhood development.
That section also includes a proposal to “end all unnecessary medical and mental health interventions performed on minors without prior parental consent, both inside and outside of schools.”
“I applaud Paul Renner for his steadfast commitment to parental rights. With Paul Renner as governor, Florida will continue to respect and uphold the fundamental right of parents to direct the upbringing, care, and education of their children. I look forward to working with
him to protect and strengthen Florida families,” Patti Sullivan, state coordinator for Parental Rights Florida said in a statement.
Specific to community wellness and preventive care Renner says he wants to expand Medicaid patients’ access to chiropractic, naturopathic, nutritional, and integrative medicine medicine. He also said he wants to establish a Florida “Whole Health Advisory Council” to coordinate chronic disease prevention. Also included under the community wellness and preventive care category is “promoting clean water, toxin-free spaces, regenerative agriculture, and local food systems.”
Renner also said he wants to support workplace wellness programs and healthier environments for state employees.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-06 20:21:59+00:00,CT Mirror,Replacing Whiting Forensic Hospital could cost $700M. Now what?,Emilia Otte and Laura Tillman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/06/whiting-forensic-hospital-proposed-design/,"A task force concluded the facility was in desperate need of replacement. Lamont set aside $50M, but a recommended design would cost $700M.","Patients at Whiting Forensic Hospital in Middletown have a long list of complaints about their living quarters: unhygienic conditions and mice, the closure of the woodworking shop and vegetable garden, frustrations about staff behavior and a lack of privacy. 
State leaders are working to address some of those shortcomings. But it’s been a deliberate process. 
A state task force, convened in 2019 to investigate complaints at Whiting, concluded that the facility was in desperate need of replacement. The task force recommended the construction of a new building — one that would “promote recovery and healing” and provide long-term care in a modern and secure setting. In the state’s fiscal year 2026 budget, Gov. Ned Lamont set aside $50 million in design costs toward a replacement for Whiting. 
Sen. Saud Anwar, D-South Windsor, co-chair of the legislature’s Public Health Committee, said that the new facility was a critical next step in addressing issues raised by the task force. “This is a necessary responsibility of the state to address these issues,” Anwar said. The new Whiting facility should be “reflective of the current times, a safe and healing environment,” he said.
But efforts to replace the old facility — a cramped, aging building from the 1970s that was planned by an architect who designed prisons — appear to have hit a roadblock. 
An architectural firm hired by the state to study the best option for a new hospital has recommended a design that would cost the state $700 million.
The plan, which would involve razing the former Connecticut Juvenile Training School in Middletown and constructing an entirely new 246-bed facility, offered several benefits. According to Page Southerland Page Inc., the firm contracted to perform the study, the new plan would make it possible to keep patients in one space, without having to transport them outside the facility; it would create more efficiency for staff and allow for private bedrooms and green spaces for patients.

But the price tag was more than state budget officials were comfortable with spending. They have now asked the design firm to conduct a new study in search of a less-expensive middle ground — potentially reusing portions of the former training school buildings rather than knocking them all down for a new building.
A spokesperson for Lamont did not respond to requests for comment in time for publication.
Christopher McClure, spokesperson for the state Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, said no option has been taken off the table yet, and it will ultimately be up to the state’s executive and legislative branches to make the final determination. 
Whiting CEO Joe Crego said he supports conducting the new study. “It’s going to give a lot of options, and ultimately the optimum way to utilize taxpayer dollars to build the best facility possible,” he said.

Ongoing problems
The shoddy conditions in Whiting Forensic Hospital have come under the scrutiny of state lawmakers for nearly a decade. 
An abuse scandal in 2017, in which Whiting staff were videotaped physically and psychologically torturing patient William Shehadi, Jr., shocked the public. Staff members abused Shehadi over an extended period, and dozens were found to either be involved in or aware of the abuse. 
The case also led to the state legislature’s creation of the task force that was charged with evaluating conditions at the forensic hospital and making recommendations for improvements. Members were appointed by state lawmakers and included advocates and experts.
The task force’s inquiry included hearings with patients, a tour of the Whiting building, and meetings with patient advocates, staff members and the Psychiatric Security Review Board — a group of mental health professionals and criminal justice experts charged with determining whether it is safe for a patient to transition from the hospital back into the community.
Patients who spoke to the task force described a lack of educational programs and 12-step recovery groups; staffing shortages and quality-of-life concerns like cold showers; and cockroaches in the building. A 2019 report from Disability Rights Connecticut found that the facility had inadequate treatment plans for patients, used restraints as a form of discipline and was overreliant on psychotropic medication. 
The report the task force released in 2021 described the facility as being in “poor condition” and outlined numerous safety concerns. And the task force concluded that opportunities for learning, recovery and vocational advancement were more apparent in the state’s correctional facilities than at Whiting — despite the fact that Whiting is, by its nature, not a punitive environment but rather intended to help people recover from illnesses that are preventing them from successfully rejoining society.
The task force ultimately recommended exploring options for constructing a new building — one that would “promote recovery and healing” and provide long-term care in a modern and secure setting.
Sen. Heather Somers, R-Groton, has been an advocate for improvements at Whiting since the Shehadi abuse came to light, and she has visited the facility multiple times. 
“It’s not a facility that would encourage wellness,” Somers said. “I could see it actually going the other way, being detrimental.” 
Somers said the history of abuse and the long slog to funding a new facility was important context for the public to be aware of as they watched a significant amount of money be set aside — $50 million by Lamont in the state’s fiscal year 2026 budget for design costs toward the replacement of Whiting, and likely hundreds of millions more for construction in coming years. 
The decision to invest in Whiting is not coming out of nowhere, she said, but from revelations of dangerous conditions over many years of inquiry. 
“We have to recognize that we have to spend money to protect and serve those who are the most vulnerable,” Somers said. “I think that this is one of the most vulnerable populations that we have.” She also pointed to the costliness of litigation for the state, which paid out $9 million in a legal settlement with Shehadi’s family.

Not enough space
Staff and patients suggested many improvements needed at Whiting, but one, Crego said, was key: more space. 
Steve Morgan, a patient at Whiting, said the lack of space can irritate patients with paranoia and other mental health issues. “People get amped up,” Morgan said. 
Whiting serves three groups of patients — people who have committed a crime and been found not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI); people who have been arrested but found not competent to stand trial; and people who have not been accused of any crime but who have been deemed too mentally unstable to rejoin the community. 
For all patients, it’s important that the environment be therapeutic. And that’s often not the way it goes.
Crego said patients at the maximum security facility, for example, move up and down a single hallway when they need to traverse the building — an arrangement that became problematic during the COVID pandemic. While there’s a courtyard in the center, patients aren’t able to see much beyond the tops of trees.
“There’s not a lot of room,” Crego said. That can be a problem when a patient is upset, he said. “One of the biggest de-escalators is just to allow someone who’s upset space,” Crego said. 
It’s also a safety hazard, Crego explained: if someone starts behaving violently, having space allows that person to calm down naturally rather than having to step in and physically restrain the person. 
“There’s a lot of studies that show that 30 minutes of physical activity a day for any one of us — it’s almost better than an antidepressant or an anti-anxiety medication,” Crego explained. “So for someone with a pretty significant serious mental health issue, the ability to have more space in and of itself is therapeutic.” 
If the state moves forward with the CJTS site in Middletown, Crego said it might be possible to reuse some of the buildings that already existed, which would save some money. And there are opportunities to add programs at the site.
Crego said the facility’s larger building, located next to the football field, already has a training kitchen, treatment areas and places for school and vocational training. Another plus is the “mirrored spaces” in the building, which allow residents to see others on the opposite side. 
“If we’re able to show a patient who’s here in [maximum security] and is working on this side of that building that, hey, there’s another side … that I can be able to get a job working in the kitchen and start to work my way out, it instills that sense of hope, which is so important for all of us as human beings,” Crego said.
There are some areas that would have to be revamped, Crego said, particularly the sleeping areas. The dorms at the training school were set up like cells, not like hospital rooms, and were designed for children rather than adults.  
Crego said patients were given a great deal of input during the study — they were part of work groups, on steering committees and in policy groups. 
“Some of our folks, unfortunately, stay here for quite some time. So we want to make sure that they’re able to have some input into their homes,” Crego said. 
The task force’s study presented some alternative options, like the construction of a smaller 102-bed facility or the renovation of Dutcher Hall, the current building housing lower-security patients. But those options have some key drawbacks, including the need to transport patients and distribute food between two buildings, and the space limitations present at Dutcher Hall.  
Somers was skeptical of whether a renovation of existing buildings at CJTS would ultimately deliver the necessary cost savings. As a perennial renovator of older homes and as a former mayor who oversaw the renovation of local schools, Somers said that she’s learned over the years that costs are usually far more than anticipated because of unexpected problems. 
“I don’t know of any renovation that has ever come in under budget,” she said. “Sometimes it’s more cost effective to just build new, and I hate to say that, but that’s the reality of what I faced.”
Ultimately, she said, building a new facility would allow the state to have more control and create the environment of healing that is the end goal.

A new building can’t fix everything
In order for Whiting to improve care and operations, staff, patients and state officials say it will take more than just new space. 
Representatives from the hospital and the state Department of Administrative Services said natural light was key, and they proposed things like a cafe that would be open to community members, a chapel, a room for art therapy and woodworking, a comfortable visiting area, places where they could host outdoor activities like cookouts and basketball games, and vocational programs that would serve patients when they’re released into the wider communities. 
A key priority was creating a facility that would be clearly focused on recovery and that would prepare patients for a successful return for their communities. They said they wanted to decrease the stigma associated with the facility and improve understanding from the general public.
Staff also said that while a new building has been promised for years — and repairs were “long overdue” — that wouldn’t magically fix some of the systemic problems plaguing the institution. 
“Our job is to care for your loved ones during their most vulnerable moments. Yet, we’re understaffed, not properly supported, and lacking the equipment to do the jobs we were trained to do. Morale is low because leadership isn’t listening,” said Rob Baril, president of SEIU 1199 NE, the union representing workers at Whiting Forensic Hospital, in a statement. 
“If this is really about improving care, it must start with treating staff with respect, hiring enough people, and committing to real oversight,” he added. “A new building means nothing without a new approach.” 
Whiting has struggled with large numbers of employees suffering injuries at the workplace that take them out of work for a period of time, leaving their colleagues to work mandated overtime shifts, sometimes for days on end.
Patients say that even without a new building, there are things the administration could change at the current hospital to make life better for the residents. 
For example, Morgan mentioned the mice problem and suggested improving the food, which has few fresh vegetables, or reducing the excessively bright lighting in the hallways. Morgan said that among the most healing places at Whiting was a vegetable garden in the courtyard that no longer exists. “It was one of the most positive things, I think it was appreciated by everyone — patients and staff,” he said.
Aaron Ramsey, also a patient at Whiting, said that privacy was a key issue, and questioned whether it was necessary for patients to dorm together in rooms with up to four people. 
“There’s no real privacy, and obviously if you’re calling people so dangerous, why would you have four people in one room on this unit?” Ramsey said.
Ramsey also said that the removal of curtains from some rooms was degrading for patients. “That’s such an easy fix, and that’s why my perspective, as far as spending hundreds of millions of dollars on a new building is not the best idea if you’re not going to fix all the other stuff that’s wrong with this place, which there is a lot,” he said. 
“It looks like something new and shiny, but it fixes none of the problems,” Ramsey said.
In response to patient concerns, McClure said in an email that the facility does offer a private phone for legal calls, there’s a unit cell phone for patients to call family, and Whiting is working to get tablets as well.
McClure said that staff “routinely monitor and maintain the cleanliness” of the day room. He noted that while the leather and woodworking shops were closed because of safety concerns, the hospital is developing new “therapeutic spaces” that will include a sensory treatment area, a live kitchen, space for group therapy and a screen for games and entertainment. 
While there’s no longer a large vegetable garden, each unit has a planter box. Room size meets or exceeds minimum requirements, he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201012_WhitingForensic_Middletown_KIM_06.jpg,,,2025-11-06 16:02:38.106389

Reagan National and Dulles International, both in Northern VirginiaBusy Nashville, Raleigh-Durham not on listWhile there is significant overlap of the list with the nation’s busiest airports, there are some exceptions. The busiest passenger airport not included was in Nashville, Tennessee, the 28th-busiest airport in the country in 2024, according to Airports Council International-North America.Austin, Texas; St. Louis; Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina; Sacramento, California; New Orleans; Kansas City; and San Jose, California, were also among the 40 busiest airports that will not see reductions Friday.Memphis, Anchorage and Louisville rank outside the top 40 for passenger traffic, but are the top three for cargo movement.Oakland and Indianapolis ranked just outside the top 40 for passenger travel. Teterboro’s airport did not rank in the group’s top 50 busiest.$327 million in daily lost revenue A 10% reduction at the listed airports would decrease revenue at airports by about $327 million daily, according to the council.Because the reductions are to the nation’s busiest airports that serve as hubs for the major airlines, they will also affect airports that aren’t on the list but depend on flights to and from those hubs.The group’s president and CEO, Kevin M. Burke, said in a statement that the group and its members had adapted to quickly changing conditions during the shutdown, but that they were “reaching a breaking point.”“The current trajectory is unsustainable,” Burke said. “With the busy holiday season on the horizon, Congress and the administration must come together now to reopen the federal government with a clean, bipartisan continuing resolution, pay federal employees, and restore operational certainty for the millions of air travelers who take to the skies every day.”Prioritizing safetyAt a press conference Wednesday, Duffy said the decision was made to keep flying safe. He urged overworked air traffic controllers not to work second jobs, but was “not naive” that many would have to in order to pay their bills.He said the agency’s decision was made to prevent any accidents that could result from overworked controllers, while assuring the flying public that commercial air travel remained extremely safe.President Donald Trump was less explicit during an Oval Office appearance Thursday. “Fair question,” he said when asked by a reporter if flying remained safe. “Sean Duffy announced they're cutting in certain areas 10%, and they want to make sure it's 100% safe. That's why they're doing it.”Dems call for shutdown endSome Democratic lawmakers, who have blocked a bill to temporarily reopen the government at fiscal 2025 levels in an effort to force Republicans to negotiate an extension to tax credits for insurance purchased on the Affordable Care Act marketplace, renewed those calls in light of the FAA’s decision.Sen. Tina Smith, a Minnesota Democrat, said in a statement the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport sees a daily average of 60,000 passengers on 750 flights.She called on Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to negotiate with her party on the expiring health insurance tax credits to reopen the government “so we don’t see the impacts like the ones at MSP.”“The only path forward is through negotiating, so air traffic in the skies above Minnesota and the country can keep operating safely and at full capacity and our government can finally open up again,” she said.House Transportation and Infrastructure ranking Democrat Rick Larsen of Washington state called the Duffy move “drastic and unprecedented” and requested the FAA share data that went into the decision. He also called for an end to the shutdown to allow air traffic controllers to be paid.“Shutting down parts of our National Airspace System is a dramatic and unprecedented step that demands more transparency,” he said. “The FAA must immediately share any safety risk assessment and related data that this decision is predicated on with Congress. If we want to resolve issues in the NAS, let us fix health care, open government and pay transportation and aviation safety workers.""",,,,2025-11-06 15:17:30.688497

(Photos courtesy of Library of Congress)Two military veterans in the Legislature introduced bills Thursday that would require elementary students in Florida to take their classes with former presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.
The bills, HB 371 and SB 420 would require portraits of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln to be hung in a “conspicuous place” in all K-5 classrooms and in social studies classrooms for grades 6-12. 
The portraits to be used would be determined by the state Department of Education, which would also “make them available to each school district,” per the bill text. The measure would go into effect July 1, 2026, if passed. 
The initiative was introduced by Sen. Danny Burgess, a veteran of the U.S. Army Reserve and Republican from Zephyrhills, and Rep. John Snyder, a Marine Corps veteran and Republican from Stuart.
“For years, Florida’s classrooms proudly displayed portraits of George Washington, our first president, and Abraham Lincoln, our 16th president,” Burgess, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee on Pre-K-12 Education, said in a news release. “These portraits weren’t just on display to echo lessons to our students; they served as a symbol of the foundation of America and our democracy.”

The lawmakers cite the nation’s 250th birthday on July 4, 2026, “to restore a proud tradition that reminds students of the nation’s history, the principles it stands for, and the vision the founders set in motion.”
Burgess in particular cited a trip he took during the summer to “a historic classroom where portraits of Presidents Washington and Lincoln still hung on the wall.” 
The portraits would be meant to keep the presidents and their accomplishments in the forefront of student development.
If Washington could fight for independence and Lincoln could unite a post-Civil War nation, “then our students can overcome the trials and setbacks they face as they grow into their full potential,” Snyder said in a prepared statement.
“As much as we hope to build a bright future for Florida students, that’s only possible if our students have the foundation of lessons learned from generations past,” Snyder continued. “Presidents Washington and Lincoln are shining examples of servant-leadership, grit, determination, and resolve in the face [of] adversity.”
Last month, Rep. Tom Fabricio introduced a bill that would require teachers to take an oath to the Constitution and swear to be nonpartisan. That bill, HB 147, was referred to two House committees.
Gov. Ron DeSantis’ administration is in the process of installing statues of founding fathers in Florida counties named after the historical figures in advance of the 250th anniversary. He kicked off the initiative with a statue of Washington in the Capitol and has placed statues of Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin in the counties named in their honor.
Washington, Hamilton, Madison, and Monroe counties await statues.
In Louisiana in June, a federal appellate court rejected a state mandate to include the Ten Commandments in every classroom.

But what do those wins really mean for the state’s midterm elections in 2026?
In interviews with NC Newsline, political scientists around the state said the major wins by Democrats could pave the way for U.S. Senate and other statewide wins in North Carolina next year, though much can still change, and congressional and General Assembly districts favoring Republicans will be challenging to surmount even if Democrats win a large share of the vote overall.
They attributed the big night to dissatisfaction with President Donald Trump, particularly over the ongoing government shutdown, which more voters blame on Republicans than Democrats. But they also stressed that the issues on voters’ minds could change drastically by the time of next year’s elections.
“A year out is a very long time in politics, but generally, things tend to solidify in an election year by late summer, early fall,” said Michael Bitzer, professor of politics and history at Catawba College. “Democrats had a very good evening, and that lays a foundation for building a really good evening a year from now in ’26.”
Democratic victories in statewide races
In Virginia, Democrat Abigail Spanberger won the governor’s race by a margin of 55% to her opponent’s 45%. In New Jersey, Democratic nominee for governor Mikie Sherill won 56% to 43%. Both candidates significantly outperformed Vice President Kamala Harris’s margin of victory, which was about 6% in both states.

“Democratic enthusiasm is high,” said David McLennan, a political science professor at Meredith College. “What I saw in terms of the results was not just the fact that Democrats won, but that they won by double-digit numbers in Virginia and New Jersey.”
Chris Cooper, a political scientist at Western Carolina University, said he saw even stronger signs for Democrats’ chances in the midterms in lesser-known races in Georgia and Mississippi.
Georgia saw Democrats win two seats on the state’s Public Service Commission, the first state-level offices the party has won in that state in 20 years. The margins were greater than those in Virginia and New Jersey as well, with both Democratic candidates winning 60% of the vote. And in Mississippi, Democrats broke a two-thirds Republican supermajority in the state Senate for the first time in more than a decade.
“I think the Democratic gains were real, and they were even more important when you dig under the surface,” Cooper said.

A major factor contributing to Democrats’ success on Tuesday was that Republicans bearing more of  the blame for the ongoing government shutdown, according to Catawba College professor of politics and history Michael Bitzer. A Catawba College-YouGov poll conducted in October — written and commissioned by Bitzer’s Center for North Carolina Politics and Public Service — showed about 41% of North Carolinians blame either Republicans or Trump personally for the shutdown.
“The popular perception is that Republicans control the federal government — why can’t they get a budget passed?” Bitzer said, though he noted that Republicans do not control enough Senate seats to pass a budget alone.
He added that this may encourage Democrats to stand firm in their budget demands even as more government services lose funding. “It may be the pressure on Republicans to say, we’re the ones who are going to suffer, President Trump’s no longer on the ballot, but we’re the ones that have to bear the brunt of this.”
What the results mean for Roy Cooper’s campaign
Chris Cooper said while much can still change going into the 2026 midterms, the results are good news for former Gov. Roy Cooper as he competes against Republican Michael Whatley for the U.S. Senate being vacated by Republican Sen. Thom Tillis.

“It does show that Democrats know how to mobilize voters, and that the Democrats are, whether it’s angry or excited or excitement caused by anger, they are willing to get off the couch and go vote,” Cooper, the political scientist, said. “It does not mean that this election is over, however. We need to remember that this is a very different kind of electorate than you’re going to see in a midterm.”
The party that doesn’t control the White House historically tends to do better in the midterm elections. Cooper said that’s compounded in this case because throughout the Trump era, Democrats have performed especially well in off-year and midterm elections, in part because of highly engaged, reliable core voters who can carry lower-turnout races.


McLennan said another positive sign for North Carolina Democrats ahead of next year’s Senate race were big swings among young, Black and Latino voters away from the Republican party after a notable shift toward it in 2024.
“Assuming that Cooper needs a very strong turnout among traditional Democratic constituents and voters, you know, young voters will help Cooper, Hispanic and Black voters will help Cooper,” he said. “The fact that they turned out reasonably well and supported Democrats yesterday was a good sign for him.”

After Tuesday’s losses, Republicans have sought to capitalize on the victory of Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayor’s race to paint all Democrats as radical socialists, including in North Carolina.
On Election Day, for example, the subject line of a press release from the National Republican Senatorial Committee warned of next year’s election: “Roy Cooper Would Bring Mamdani Radicalism to the U.S. Senate.”
Bitzer doesn’t think that’s likely to work well in North Carolina.
“I think if any North Carolina voter looks at that and says, you know, ‘Well, I just can’t vote for Roy Cooper because he’s like the New York mayor,’ they weren’t going to vote for Roy Cooper to begin with,” he said, laughing. “Roy Cooper has a very long history in this state. He has proven time and time again that he’s able to win in North Carolina.”
Democrats gain in NC towns and cities
While North Carolina had no statewide elections in 2025, Democrats performed better than expected in municipal elections in the state. Bitzer, Cooper and McLennan all highlighted Democratic strength in races in cities, suburbs and small towns.

In Cary, for example, longtime Republican council member Jennifer Robinson was unseated by challenger Brittany Richards. Democrats won mayoral races in typically Republican areas like Burlington and Warsaw, and defeated multiple-term Republican incumbent mayors in Wake Forest, Graham, and Fuquay-Varina.
“What a lot of people took as a surprise is a larger trend of people who live in municipalities leaning increasingly left,” Cooper said. “We’ve known that’s true for a long time for Charlotte, for Raleigh, for Asheville, for Wilmington, but I think what we saw is the same thing is also true in some small towns, right? That just the act of being in a municipality means you’re selecting more left-leaning voters.”

That trend has played in reverse in the state’s rural areas in recent years, McLennan said, with voters outside of towns and cities increasingly moving toward Republicans, as has been the case throughout the country. Because most of them did not have the opportunity to participate in an election this year in North Carolina, how they may vote in the midterms remains unknown.
McLennan said Democrats did especially well running on an economic message in this year’s races. “They won on talking about prices, jobs, that sort of thing,” he said. “I think it has to give Democrats confidence going into 2026.”
Whether those apparent strengths are enough to help Democrats win unexpected House victories in North Carolina, however, remains an open question. Under the state’s new congressional map, there are no traditional swing districts in the state — the closest two seats, the 1st Congressional District and the 11th Congressional District, were won by Trump by about 12 and 10 points in 2024, respectively.



Cooper said “it’s going to be tough” for Democrats to win in these districts, adding that the party’s increased margins in Virginia and New Jersey this year still wouldn’t be enough to flip them on their own.
“What the Democrats are going to have to do is to improve upon how much Spanberger improved upon Harris to be able to flip these districts,” he said. “And so they’re just these districts that are resistant to almost any electoral shock.”
Whether the coming year will help or hurt Democrats as they seek to build on those results remains “the great unknown,” Bitzer said, but so far, conditions have proven favorable. “If you want to be in one of two camps when it comes to next year’s midterms, I think Tuesday shows you want to be on the Democratic side.”
“If we see this kind of level of energy and enthusiasm and interest on the Democratic side and it’s not there on the Republican side, I think the size of a Democratic wave could be one that could overcome some of these hurdles that the district lines have created,” he said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7262871-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-06 15:17:30.688497

Central Vermont residents voted overwhelmingly against a $149 million measure to build a new technical education center on Tuesday. 
Across the 18 towns in Washington County that form the Central Vermont Career Center District, about 60% voted against the ballot item, while 40% voted in favor of it, according to results collected by the Barre Town Clerk’s office. 
The district proposed the bond as a response to the lack of space and inadequate facilities at the career center’s current home at Spaulding High School in Barre. For the current school year, the district received 414 applications for 228 spots, according to district data. 
District Superintendent Jody Emerson said last month that the career center also hoped a standalone building would allow it to offer additional programs and expand opportunities to younger grades. Two consulting firms drew up plans for a 167,000-square-foot facility at a currently vacant lot in Graniteville. 
But central Vermont residents raised concerns about the cost of the bond at an informational meeting in October. According to district projections, the bond was expected to raise property taxes between $99 and $420 per year on a $300,000 home. 
The district had set a target date of September 2029 to open the facility if the bond was approved, according to its website. Emerson has said if the bond failed, the district may be able to come back to voters at a later date with a different plan. But what that plan looks like depends on the future of the education redistricting proposals and school construction aid proposals being discussed in the Legislature this year. 
After the results were announced, Emerson said she was grateful for the high turnout because it provided information for the district to determine what its next steps should be. 
She blamed the failure of the vote on the state’s cost-of-living issues and the uncertainty around the future of redistricting, rather than opposition to technical education. “I know the voters support our kids,” she said.

The fund is intended to offset the budget impacts on rural areas due to sweeping Medicaid cuts. However, the temporary fund could only offset a little more than one-third of the package’s estimated $137 billion cut to federal Medicaid spending in rural areas over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan health research organization KFF.Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Dr. Mehmet Oz said the program “moves us from a system that has too often failed rural America to one built on dignity, prevention, and sustainability” in a Thursday statement alongside the announcement. Oz said “every state with an approved application will receive funding so it can design what works best for its communities — and CMS will be there providing support every step of the way.”Each state was asked to “design a plan for transforming its rural health care system” and outline in proposals how they “intend to expand access, enhance quality, and improve outcomes for patients through sustainable, state-driven innovation.” The program allocates $25 billion equally to approved states between fiscal years 2026 and 2030. CMS said states meeting the baseline criteria will then “undergo a rigorous, data-driven merit review” for the remaining half of the funds. In September, when announcing the application opening, CMS said the remaining half of funds would be administered to approved states based on “individual state metrics and applications that reflect the greatest potential for and scale of impact on the health of rural communities.” CMS said approved awardees will be notified by Dec. 31.",,,,2025-11-06 14:56:28.809904

The order came on the 37th day of the federal shutdown, which began Oct. 1 and is the longest in the country’s history. During much of that time, air traffic controllers, customs officers and Transportation Security Administration agents have worked without pay. Last weekend was the worst weekend for traffic controller staffing since the shutdown started, according to CNN. 
The FAA oversees more than 44,000 flights daily, a number that includes passenger, cargo and private aircraft. 
Nearly 31 million people flew through Philadelphia in 2024, according to the airport, across more than 17 million flights. That number doesn’t include cargo planes delivering mail or freight. BWI saw more than 26 million passengers in 2023, while Dulles reported nearly 54 million passengers last year.

(File photo by Dan Reynolds Photography/Getty Images)Five homebuilders will construct 130 new homes in South Carolina and sell them for far less than the state’s median price.
The state Housing Finance and Development Authority began the effort, called the Made It Home! program, in August to expand the inventory of affordable homes in the state.
While the builders are still finalizing locations, the $175,000 to $200,000 homes are largely expected to be spread across Richland, Orangeburg, Dorchester, Florence, Darlington, Spartanburg, and Sumter counties.
The companies include:

McGuinn Homes, building 45 homes
D.R. Horton’s Myrtle Beach office, building 40 homes
Gainey Construction of Sumter, building 15 homes
Oak and Ave Property Group, a real estate company that has pushed to increase affordable housing in Spartanburg, will provide 15 homes
Housing Development Corporation of Rock Hill, a low-to-moderate income focused nonprofit, will provide 15 homes

National housing expert: US must build its way out of housing crisis

How it works
The participating firms will build either 1,000-square-foot homes with two bedrooms or 1,200-square-foot homes with three bedrooms. Both sizes must have two bathrooms.
The builders must price the homes at or below $175,000 for a two-bedroom and no more than $200,000 for a three-bedroom.
By comparison, the median listing price of a home in South Carolina is $350,000, according to data from the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank.
In exchange for the reduced price, SC Housing will subsidize the construction with a $12,500 payment to the homebuilder for each home constructed.
The state housing agency also will help families buy them.
SC Housing, working with its lending partners, will provide the eligible homebuyers with $25,000 in forgivable down payment and closing cost assistance. The agency also will require buyers to take out a 30-year mortgage through one of its partner lenders. To qualify, the buyers must have household incomes of $135,000 or less, depending on the county.
The buyers must then live in the home and not rent it out or use it as a second home.
The Legislature put $5 million toward the program in this year’s state budget, allowing SC House to more than quadruple its original plans for a 30-house pilot program.
Making it happen
The state’s Home Builders Association expressed concerns early on about whether builders would be able to make the deal pencil out as building costs, land prices and local taxes and fees have soared.
But Howie Mason, the regional construction manager for McGuinn who is leading the project for the firm, said the agency took builders’ feedback on the program into account, which has helped.
For example, Mason said the agency relaxed some of its requirements on the types of materials builders can use. Those rules were largely outdated, he said, and companies now have access to items that are both better quality and more affordable.
Those adjustments coupled with developers willing to give McGuinn a small discount on some of its lots has made participation possible.
“Plus, we want building community to be not just something we advertise but something we do,” Mason said or McGuinn’s decision to get involved.
The company has watched as its primary customer base has shifted over the past couple years. McGuinn had once appealed to first-time homebuyers, but now many of those buyers have been priced out due to higher costs and interest rates.
SC bill would wipe eviction records clean. Advocates say it could help people find housing.

The first homes
Mason said McGuinn plans to start building its first 10 to 15 homes in the Lower Richland area, south of Columbia in a neighborhood called the Reserves at Mill Creek. Construction begins in January, and the homes will hit the market in the spring.
In addition to meeting the bedroom and bathroom requirements under the program, Mason said the homes will have a one-car garage. And while they might not come with certain extras, such as a fenced yard or blinds in the windows, the homes will largely look the same as every other house in the neighborhood.
Next, SC Housing has asked McGuinn to look for lots in Orangeburg County, where the existing housing stock tends to be older and built on larger lots. Because there are fewer homes available and more land under the ones that do exist, Mason said it can be nearly as hard to find a place to live in these more rural counties as it is in the state’s larger metro areas.
With offices in Greenville and Hilton Head, as well as Columbia, Mason said McGuinn might also build some of its allotted homes near Spartanburg or Beaufort as the program continues.
Mason also said this is not McGuinn’s first foray into affordable housing. The builder has worked with the Greenville County Redevelopment Authority and the Columbia Housing Authority in the past.
As for the Made It Home Program, Mason said McGuinn’s executives and investors like the way it was designed, and he thinks it’s something the state should be able to repeat for years to come.
“It puts more power and ability into the hands of the builders,” he said. “And if you let us help, we will.”

In a three-page letter posted to social media, Uthmeier demanded the American Bar Association not “horsewhip” St. Thomas University, a Catholic law school in Miami that the ABA in August declared to be out-of-compliance with the association’s anti-discrimination and equal opportunity standards.

“Admittedly, you currently have considerable power. But reform is in the air,” Uthmeier wrote, addressing St. Thomas University. “Your treatment of STU Law looks like religious discrimination under Florida civil rights law. Leave STU Law alone.”
He accused the ABA of engaging in “woke,” left-wing political activism, claiming the body “hates” religious values.
“It cannot use its accreditation monopoly to put law schools to the tortuous choice of accepting the ABA’s discriminatory, repugnant standards or suffering the fallout of withheld accreditation,” he continued.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The ABA is a national agency that serves as the primary accreditor for multiple states. In Florida, it’s been the sole accrediting body for law schools recognized in the state Supreme Court since 1992, according to the Florida Bar. Losing ABA accreditation would affect STU’s access to state bar exams and could impact the school’s legitimacy.
But the Florida Supreme Court in March created a workgroup to propose alternatives to the ABA in the Bar admissions process, partially because “reasonable questions” have arisen about the ABA’s accreditation standards on “racial and ethnic diversity in law schools and about the ABA’s active political engagement.”
This comes as the Texas Supreme Court announced its plan to end reliance on the ABA for law school oversight, and as Gov. Ron DeSantis moves to create a new accreditation system for state universities.
In August, the ABA found that St. Thomas fell out of compliance with an accreditation standard requiring law schools to not discriminate, to treat people equally and to be fair in hiring, admissions and retention, the ABA reported. That standard requires law schools to “provide the reasons—such as state or federal laws, other authorities, or university policy—which limit the inclusion of any specific group” during their accreditation review.
This follows notice the ABA’s notice in June alleging that St. Thomas Law fell out of compliance with another standard, which requires ABA-accredited law schools to “maintain a budget reflecting anticipated financial resources and expenses for the current and subsequent three fiscal years.”
The ABA also asked the law school to submit a report by Oct. 20 and appear before the ABA council at its February 2026 meeting. St. Thomas Law did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
87.3% of St. Thomas’ students taking the Bar for the first time passed the test in July 2025. This was above the state average of 82.8%.

The state stands to receive up to $800 million through the new Rural Health Transformation Program. Its application narrowed in on stabilizing hospitals, preventative health and technological tools. 
The post Wyoming hopes to bolster health care workforce, services, access with federal health funds appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s application for up to $800 million in federal money earmarked for rural health care focuses on stabilizing hospitals, bolstering preventative health, growing the workforce and using technology to improve access. 
The state submitted its application Wednesday for money from the Rural Health Transformation Program, a new federal initiative created by President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Wyoming will learn its fate at the end of the year with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services expected to announce winners Dec. 31. 
“Wyoming is taking full advantage of the Rural Health Transformation Program championed under President Trump,” Gov. Mark Gordon said in a statement Wednesday. “These funds will help us transform care for Wyoming families and keep critical services local, where they belong.”
The availability of federal funds comes at a time when Wyoming’s gaps in health care access have grown more conspicuous. From the long distances patients travel for care to nursing shortages to affordability concerns in hospitals, Wyoming has a laundry list of needs and challenges related to its health care network. 
New health policies, such as the expiration of Affordable Care Act tax subsidies at the end of this year, are expected to exacerbate barriers to health care for many residents by hiking costs. 
The opportunity 
The Rural Health Transformation Program is designed to funnel $50 billion to states to stabilize and strengthen rural hospitals and providers. Program funding is intended to support priorities like chronic disease prevention, sustaining health care access, workforce development and technical assistance. Funding will be dispersed over five years.
The application was released in September, which created a short timeline for health officials to collect public feedback and determine the state’s priorities.

Starting in September, Wyoming Department of Health staff hosted eight in-person and three virtual meetings on the topic. Meetings took place from Newcastle to Lander, Buffalo to Saratoga. The state also received 1,300 responses to an online survey it circulated. 
Five priorities emerged from the public meetings: 

Improve the financial viability of small rural hospitals to provide basic services. 
Expand affordable health insurance options. 
Recruit and retain primary care physicians.
Train and recruit more nurses and direct care workforce. 
Strengthen OB-GYN services, labor and delivery and related care so women can safely deliver babies. 

Health department staff condensed the priorities into four initiatives in the application. 
The first is “improving access to basic medical care.” That entails consolidating and right-sizing Wyoming’s rural hospitals and EMS systems around sustainable payer sources with a focus on basic services, including maternity care. 
The second is building up the state’s health care workforce. This initiative would expand educational opportunities for nurses, paramedics and other health professionals to smooth career pathways. 
Third is improving residents’ health by promoting healthy diets, exercise and lifestyles. This would help Wyoming fight back against high diabetes and cardiovascular disease rates and alleviate pressure on the health care system.  
The fourth initiative involves using technology to improve health care access and management of chronic disease. 
“Our application reflects a clear vision for Wyoming’s healthcare future,” Gordon said in his statement. “Just as we have done with other transitory federal programs, we recognize this money is not forever and it is taxpayer money. So the investments we make must stand the test of time and not further burden our grandchildren.”
The holes  
At the same time that the Big Beautiful Bill created the rural health fund, it also made changes that many say will make health care less accessible and less affordable, weakening the system and harming communities. 
The act is projected to reduce federal Medicaid spending by $793 billion over 10 years, resulting in an estimated 10.3 million fewer people enrolled nationally. The cuts in the federal bill could cost Wyoming nearly 200 jobs per year and shrink the state’s economy by $140 million over five years, an economic analysis finds. 
Enhanced premium tax credits on the Affordable Care marketplace are set to expire at the end of 2025 — and the act did not renew them. That will result in significant premium spikes for some patients, who are just seeing this week what their new plan costs will be. According to Healthy Wyoming, a 60-year-old couple with an annual income of $82,000 will face an increase of $37,422 in annual health care costs due to the tax credit loss. The premium increase for a 45-year-old who earns $62,000 annually could be upwards of $6,000.
Between 11,000-20,000 state residents are at risk of losing their coverage due to the anticipated marketplace cost increases, according to Healthy Wyoming.

In the maternity care landscape, Banner Health announced in September that it would pause labor and delivery services at Platte County Hospital in Wheatland. It marked the fifth Wyoming hospital in recent history to shutter a birth facility.
A legislative committee will bring two bills in the 2026 session aimed at fortifying maternity care. 
One would authorize freestanding birth centers to be covered by Medicaid for births handled by midwives. 
The second bill, a divisive measure that ignited lengthy debate, would set rules and regulations aimed at protecting pregnancy centers, which are typically intended to discourage women from seeking abortions.

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate) The Arkansas Department of Education released district level rankings for the first time as part of a redesigned school report card website that launched Thursday. 
The updated website and A-F rankings are aimed at making it easier for families to better understand how their districts and schools are performing, according to an ADE press release.
“They also allow school leaders, district administrators, researchers, and policymakers to dig deeper into the data and identify where improvement is needed so we can direct resources and support to the students that need it most,” Hope Worsham, ADE’s assistant commissioner for Public School Accountability, said in the release. 
Education officials developed district rankings as a result of the Arkansas ACCESS Act, a wide-ranging 2025 education law that, among other things, directed the education department to develop a new formula for determining a letter grade ranking for public school districts and education service cooperatives. 
Under the new formula, each district receives an overall score out of 900 based on achievement, growth and readiness, which is then converted to a letter grade, according to ADE. A district’s letter grade cannot be higher than the highest-performing school or lower than the lowest-performing school in that district. 
The education department released ratings for individual schools under a revised formula in September. On Thursday, ADE announced it was awarding $7 million to 151 schools that “displayed exceptional performance in student achievement and growth” through the Arkansas School Recognition Program.
The formula used to calculate rankings for individual high schools was applied to school districts. Using that formula, education officials reported that 23 districts received an “A,” 98 received a “B,” 98 received a “C,” 24 received a “D” and 11 received an “F.” 
Education Secretary Jacob Olivia told reporters on a virtual call Thursday morning that having both district- and school-level rankings is useful because, while a district might be performing well overall, there may be one school within that district that’s struggling and needs more help.
Oliva mentioned a North Little Rock school that’s had an “F”-ranking for a dozen years as an example of a school where change is needed.
“It’s time for us to start having conversations about how we’re going to close that school and make sure those kids are afforded the high-quality teachers and a high-quality learning environment,” he said. “We have failed a generation of kids by letting districts hide behind individual school grades, so that’s no longer acceptable.”
Arkansas education board approves performance levels for new student assessment

Debates over school accountability have extended to private schools and home schools in recent years with the creation of the Educational Freedom Account program, a school voucher program that allows state funds to be used for allowable education expenses, such as private school tuition. 
Students in the EFA program are required to take an annual assessment, but it doesn’t have to be the same statewide test administered to public school students, the ATLAS exam. The Arkansas Teaching, Learning & Assessment System (ATLAS), which was developed by state education officials, replaced the discontinued ACT Aspire and was first administered to students in spring 2024. 
Because private and homeschool students receiving EFA funds may not take the ATLAS exam, it’s difficult to make an even comparison between students. However, ADE officials said Thursday they’re working on that. 
About 2,000 homeschool students are expected to take the ATLAS exam in the spring, Worsham said. Additionally, ADE is working with the University of Arkansas’ Office for Education Policy to conduct a study that would convert scores from a handful of the more popular assessments to what those scores would be on the ATLAS exam. Worsham said they expect to work on that process during the summer.

Patrick Morrisey's lectern sign read ""Operation feeding families"" during his news conference in Charleston, West Virginia, on Wednesday, Nov. 5, 2025. (Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey)West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey has sent another $2.5 million to state food banks, which are seeing increased need as the federal government shutdown continues to delay SNAP benefits.
The state of West Virginia has now directed a total of $11.1 million to the Mountaineer Food Bank in Gassaway and Facing Hunger Foodbank  in Huntington to distribute to pantries and feeding programs across the state. 
“Every day we’re looking at the situation closely,” Morrisey said in a news release Thursday. “At this time, it was prudent to send another infusion to the food banks so that they stay ahead of the demand. As the Schumer Shutdown continues, we’re going to keep working to ensure that no one goes hungry.” 
The federal government has been shut down for 37 days, causing SNAP benefits to be delayed and leaving federal employees without pay.
Democrats in Congress have repeatedly voted against stopgap funding bills to reopen the government because they want a guarantee that certain health care subsidies will be extended and funded. Republicans don’t want those subsidies included, which are set to expire at the end of the year.
If they do expire, West Virginians will be particularly hurt, with thousands potentially losing their health insurance. Others could see premiums increase by an average of 133%.
Morrisey has said the state would direct $14.1 million to the food banks, and then call in the Legislature for a special session to appropriate more funds if the need exceeds that amount. He’s also asked West Virginia residents and businesses to match the money the state has contributed by donating to Facing Hunger and Mountaineer Food Bank.
The governor has directed the West Virginia National Guard to continue to support food banks, pantries and other programs with logistics and distribution efforts.
“We stand ready to support our state partner agencies, local food banks and nonprofit organizations with critical logistical support to assist West Virginia families and individuals who face food insecurity,” Major General Jim Seward, adjutant general of the West Virginia National Guard, said in the news release.
About 275,000 — nearly one in six — West Virginia residents rely on SNAP. 
The Trump administration initially refused to use contingency funds to pay the benefits during the shut down. The benefits would have been issued Nov. 1. After two courts ordered the administration to do so, the White House announced that it would partially fund the benefits during the month of November.
In court filings on Thursday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, said benefits would be reduced by about 35%, a smaller reduction than it initially estimated, according to reporting by States Newsroom. 
State officials have not given a timeline for when West Virginians might have their benefits.

(Courtesy of the Indiana Department of Health)Nearly 50 Indiana Department of Health staffers face being furloughed starting next week because of the ongoing federal government shutdown.
State health officials confirmed Thursday it had notified 48 employees that they could temporarily lose their jobs effective Nov. 9 if the federal shutdown that began Oct. 1 isn’t resolved.
Those employees work for the department’s Consumer Services and Health Care Regulation Commission, which has functions funded by both state and federal sources, agency spokeswoman Lisa Welch told the Indiana Capital Chronicle.
“Since the shutdown, these employees have focused primarily on state-funded responsibilities, which has reached its limit,” Welch said in an email response.
The Consumer Services and Healthcare Regulation Commission’s work includes health care facility licensing and certification, health care quality and ensuring radiation safety and protection among health care providers, according to the Health Department’s website.
The Health Department has nearly 900 total employees, according to the Indiana Transparency Portal.
The state will cover the employer portion of insurance premiums for the furloughed workers and they will be eligible for unemployment benefits, Welch said. Those workers, however, will not be eligible for back pay which federal employees have typically received following furloughs during previous government shutdowns.

(Photo by Melissa Sue Gerrits/Getty Images)Hoosiers who oppose early redistricting are more vehement in their convictions than proponents, a new poll says.
Indiana lawmakers will meet in December to consider redrawing the state’s two blue congressional districts red ahead of the 2026 midterm elections — following a months-long pressure campaign by President Donald Trump and his administration officials for a mid-cycle flip.
In a statewide survey of 800 registered voters, 51% didn’t want redistricting now — with 45% “strongly” opposed. About 39% supported the prospect, but just 23% “strongly” backed it.
Virginia-based Bellwether Research, led by prominent Hoosier pollster Christine Mathews, performed the survey for Indiana Conservation Voters. The group is against redistricting.
“The negative intensity on the opposition is 2-to-1 over the positive intensity,” Matthews said. “So what I’m saying about this is: the folks who are are really against this, are really against this. And the folks that say they support it are mildly supportive of it.”
During a Thursday news conference, she said the sample “is robustly reflective” of Indiana’s GOP voters, noting, “I have seen the other polls on redistricting. I think our survey is probably the most solidly Republican … in terms of sample composition.”
Of the 800 respondents, 49% were Republicans, 35% were Democrats and 16% were independents.
Pollster Christine Matthews presents the results of a survey during a virtual news conference. (Screenshot of virtual meeting)
The poll was conducted Oct. 29-30 and Nov. 1 — after Gov. Mike Braun announced a special session — with an overall margin of error of 3.5%.
Bellwether Research also targeted more than 600 voters living in the state’s 40 Republican-held Senate districts. Of those, 48% opposed redistricting — with 43% “strongly” against it. About 42% professed support for redistricting, with 26% feeling “strongly” in favor.
Indiana’s Senate has become a potential stumbling block for early redistricting proponents. While the House’s GOP leader has confirmed enough support within his caucus to pass new maps, his counterpart in the Senate has repeatedly said the votes “aren’t there.”
Other findings
Voters are generally aware of the redistricting push, per the poll.
Most respondents — 63% — reported following redistricting news “fairly” or “very” closely, with Democrats more likely than Republicans to be keeping up on developments.
Bellwether Research also looked at how voters’ sentiments could translate into action at the ballot box.
Asked how they’d feel if their state legislator voted to redraw the maps, 43% said they would disapprove and be less likely to vote for them. About 6% would disapprove but wouldn’t change their vote.
Meanwhile, 27% said they would approve and be more likely to vote for that legislator. About 12% wouldn’t pay much attention either way.
Some questions were asked only of Republican voters.
New Indiana polls show Hoosiers losing faith in both parties — and their own leaders

Bellwether Research presented them with a pair of options, for example. One proclaimed that GOP lawmakers who oppose redistricting are “standing up for fairness” and “keeping politics out” of the process, and the second asserted those lawmakers are “betraying” Trump and “helping Democrats keep power.”
Republican respondents were fairly split, with 38% choosing the “fairness” perspective, 37% choosing the “betrayal” version and 26% unsure. That’s although 90% of them viewed Trump positively.
The survey also tested various anti-redistricting arguments, ranging from a proposed focus on kitchen-table issues — which voters found most convincing — to accusations of D.C.-led election-rigging.
“If I were state legislator, I would not be worried about where I stood on redistricting in terms of backlash,” Matthews said. “I would be worried about not doing enough for voters in their real lives.”
She described little evidence that Hoosiers are connecting their support for the president to state lawmakers’ actions.
“I know that the folks who want Republican legislators to do this are threatening retribution, but I’m not seeing in the data that individual voters are going to be incredibly responsive to that,” Matthews said. “… They could run candidates against these folks, but I don’t see average, rank-and-file Republicans in Indiana getting super fired up about this.”
Indiana’s elections are largely uncompetitive, so many races are decided at the primary election in May — and primary voters tend to lean further one way or the other on the partisan spectrum.
Still, Matthews said, “I’m not seeing a lot of evidence that even when you shrink this down to a low-turnout, Republican primary election, that this is going to be the kind of issue that is a single-issue determinant.”
The poll also asked voters how they feel about the country and state’s top two political leaders.

Trump: 50% favorable, 45% unfavorable
Vice President JD Vance: 50% favorable, 42% unfavorable
Indiana Gov. Mike Braun: 32% favorable, 50% unfavorable
Indiana Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith: 16% favorable, 32% unfavorable, with many unsure or unaware of him.

The results echo other surveys conducted in October by North Star Opinion Research on behalf of Independent Indiana, and in August by the left-leaning Change Research.
District lines are typically reconfigured every 10 years, after the release of new decennial census data. The Statehouse’s GOP supermajorities constructed the current 7-2 maps in 2021.

She pointed to an increase in scores statewide but acknowledged there is more improvement to be had (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri public schools showed continued improvement in annual performance reports released by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education Thursday, with 56% of districts and charter schools raising their scores.
The state is in its fourth year of the Missouri School Improvement Program 6, which education officials deem “more rigorous” than the previous iteration of the program. In 2022, the system’s pilot year, 112 school districts and charters scored lower than 70% — the score required to be fully accredited by the education department.
Accreditation decisions based on the MSIP6 scores are a year away, but the number of districts at risk for a lower classification has decreased dramatically in four years.
Based on districts’ three-year composite scores, which the department will use to determine accreditation, 29 school districts are in range to be provisionally accredited. None scored below 50%, which would put them at risk for being unaccredited.
Three charter schools scored below 50% and 29 scored below 70%, but these scores will not be part of next year’s classification decisions. Despite MSIP6 being used to score charters, they have separate methods of accreditation.
“I am so proud of our educators and students,” Commissioner of Education Karla Eslinger said in a press conference Thursday afternoon. “You must take some time to celebrate the good, but we also know there is room for improvement.”
The scores include a variety of factors, like standardized test scores, student growth and career readiness. Student performance comprises 70% of the score. The other 30% is based on continuous improvement measures.
Of the 553 districts and charter schools in the state, 152 raised their score by at least 5% this year. Some showed dramatic improvement.
Neosho School District boosted its score from 61.5% in 2024 to 85.5% this year. Superintendent Jim Davis, who took the role in August 2024, told The Independent that the improvement is largely because of a district-wide focus on proficiency and literacy.
“There was a lot of work that was put into it to get us to take that jump,” he said, “but we’re proud of that, and we’re expecting to continue moving up with the systems that we built here.”
Classroom instruction in Neosho is expected to meet grade-level standards, he said, which pushes struggling students to catch up.
“Students expedite their academic growth when they are given grade-level content,” Davis said. “So the more time that we spend in grade-level content, the faster they’re going to move.”
The district is one of 32 districts and charter schools in Missouri’s Comprehensive Literacy State Development program, a grant program which provides literacy resources and professional development among other assets.
The district received top scores for student growth in reading, math and science and received 50% of the points possible for social studies growth among the full student population. It got a quarter of the points possible for social studies growth in student groups deemed “historically underperforming” by the education department, such as low-income students and English-language learners.
“We want to create success,” Davis said. “But also we have got to continue developing our team so that, moving forward, all students can be successful.”
The Southern Boone School District in Ashland also showed dramatic improvement, going from 78.9% in 2024 to 95.9% this year. It is one of 22 school districts with a score of at least 90%.
“You can contribute our growth to continued work with our teams of teachers and administrators on our curriculum development and making sure that we’ve got the right resources for kids and teachers to use, along with making sure that our teachers are well-prepared,” Superintendent Tim Roth told The Independent.
The district has invested in new textbooks and software to bolster curriculum. At the middle school level, the district has instituted an assessment system that gives continuous checks on student achievement. Teachers review the results regularly and brainstorm ways to improve in small-group settings, Roth said.
The district received 100% for student growth on standardized tests across subject areas. It also earned top scores in attendance.
“Something that stands out for us is just the value that our parents and community put on education,” Roth said. “With our students being here on a regular basis, we’re very happy that we have that support and that learning is a priority.”
Eslinger told reporters that attendance and literacy are a focus for the department.
“We are on the right track,” she said. “Our data points are showing improvement, but we still have work to do.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/110625_Eslinger1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-11-06 14:01:46.372455

Green International Airport officials are urging travelers to check with their airlines, even as the Warwick airport so far remains unaffected by the Trump administration’s plan to cut flights starting Friday to ease pressure on unpaid air traffic controllers during the federal shutdown.
U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced Wednesday the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) would restrict air travel in 40 “high-traffic” areas beginning Friday. The Associated Press on Thursday reported a list of affected airports, which includes Boston Logan International Airport and airports in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.
T.F. Green is not on the list, but airport spokesperson Bill Fischer said in a statement that “every airport in the country will likely be impacted by this situation in some manner.”
“We are working with every airline that services PVD to understand local impacts,” Fischer said. “Each airline will have to make independent decisions on how they will operate.”
Airlines that serve the T.F. Green are Allegiant, American Airlines, Breeze Airways, Delta, JetBlue, Southwest, Sun Country, and United.
Breeze Airways spokesperson McKinnley Matson said early indications suggest a minimal impact to the airline’s operations at its growing base of operations at T.F. Green.
“The safety of our Guests remains our top priority and we’re committed to working with those who are impacted to ensure they’re fully supported. We’ll transparently communicate any updates to our Guests as we learn more.
Reached for comment Thursday, the FAA issued an automated response that due to a lapse in funding, the agency is not responding to routine media inquiries — though it did include a statement on air traffic controller staffing.
“As Secretary Duffy has said, there have been increased staffing shortages across the system,” the automated response stated. “When that happens, the FAA slows traffic into some airports to ensure safe operations.”
Air traffic controllers have worked without pay since the shutdown began Oct. 1, many logging six-day weeks with mandatory overtime.
“It’s pretty tragic,” Sal Corio, president of the Rhode Island Pilots Association, said in an interview Thursday. “I can’t imagine having to go home from work each and every single day and not taking in any pay.” 
That’s why the association is in the midst of collecting money to support the 39 Rhode Island air traffic controllers and their families amid the ongoing shutdown. Corio declined to share how much has been collected for gift cards but said the total will be announced at the group’s annual meeting Tuesday, where some controllers will speak about their work.
General aviation pilots don’t often rely on the system of controllers, except when flying through inclement weather. But Corio said without the air traffic controllers, the system falls apart.
“They’re essential workers,” he said.

Jim Pillen, left, shakes hands with Attorney General Mike Hilgers after signing a new executive order shutting off Medicaid dollars for abortion providers in Nebraska. Nov. 6, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Gov. Jim Pillen signed an executive order Thursday cutting off state tax dollars from medical service providers in Nebraska that offer abortions.
Local abortion clinics primarily receive state aid through Medicaid funds, which supports various services beyond abortions, including birth control and cancer screenings. This summer, Congress cut off federal funds to Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers and restricted Medicaid funds going to abortion providers through the passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill.”
Under the order, Pillen said any abortion provider terminated from another state’s Medicaid program will have their enrollment terminated in Nebraska.
“We’re not going to let abortion providers skirt accountability while claiming our money,” Pillen said.
Planned Parenthood officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Kenny Zoeller, director of the governor’s Policy Research Office, said Nebraska abortion providers currently receive about $250,000 per year in state tax dollars.
“From my seat, $1 is too much,” Pillen said.
Pillen announced the executive order at a press conference alongside Attorney General Mike Hilgers and Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services CEO Steve Corsi.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Hilgers clarified that state and federal law already prohibit tax dollars from supporting abortion procedures, but the executive order expands that restriction to cut off funding for any services offered by an abortion provider.
Hilgers said state officials have considered taking this action for some time but were waiting on the results of the U.S. Supreme Court case Medina v. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic. The high court’s ruling prohibits Medicaid enrollees in any state that excludes Planned Parenthood from using their Medicaid coverage to obtain other services from Planned Parenthood, including contraception..
Hilgers said the ruling gave Nebraska “unassailable ground,” to enforce Pillen’s order.
“It is quite clear that Nebraska can take the action that it is taking today,” Hilgers said.
The executive order is titled, “Protecting the Life, Health, and Welfare of Pregnant Women, and Unborn Human Life.” The order specifically names Planned Parenthood, but Hilgers later clarified that the restriction would also apply to Bellevue’s abortion clinic, CARE Reproductive Health.
Though Planned Parenthood has two clinics in Nebraska — one in Omaha and the other in Lincoln — the Lincoln clinic’s website specifies that it does not offer abortions. Hilgers said the order will only apply to clinics that provide abortions. However, Pillen speculated that any Planned Parenthood clinic has the ability to provide abortions.
Both Hilgers and Pillen noted that Nebraska has a collection of other clinics that offer services to pregnant women but don’t offer abortions. They argued there are plenty of resources for pregnant women to access care in Nebraska. They were likely referencing pregnancy help centers, which have been both praised and criticized for steering people away from abortion clinics and other reproductive care.
The executive order was met with praise from anti-abortion lobbying groups, including Nebraska Family Alliance and the Nebraska Catholic Conference. In an email statement, Nebraska Family Alliance Executive Director Nate Grasz said “Nebraska is rightfully taking action to protect life and uphold our state’s pro-life values.”
“(Planned Parenthood) is not an organization that deserves public money or public patronage,” Marion Miner, assistant director of pro-life and family for the Nebraska Catholic Conference, said in a separate statement.

Delaware Leaders Host “Unified by Service” Fireside Chat Honoring Veterans and Military Families
By Jamie Kleman| Delaware LIVE | November 6, 2025
The Delaware Department of Human Resources, in partnership with the Delaware Department of Veterans Affairs and the Delaware National Guard, hosted a “Fireside Chat” in New Castle this week to honor veterans and military families while highlighting their impact on Delaware’s workforce and communities.
The event, held in recognition of Veterans Day and National Veterans and Military Families Month, gathered state officials, service members, and families for a candid conversation themed “Unified by Service.” The discussion focused on supporting veterans transitioning into civilian careers, the strengths they bring to the workforce, and ways Delaware can continue to empower military families.
Panelists included Brig. Gen. (Ret.) Karen Berry, Secretary of the Delaware Department of Veterans Affairs, and Maj. Gen. James A. Benson, Adjutant General of the Delaware National Guard. The conversation was moderated by Richard M. Potter Jr., Director of the Division of People and Culture within the Department of Human Resources.
Berry, who has long championed Delaware’s veteran community, reminded the audience that the skills veterans develop through service are invaluable to both public and private employers. “Veterans and their families give so much every day,” she said. “Their leadership, discipline, and problem-solving abilities strengthen every organization they join.”
Benson echoed that message, noting that military experience shapes individuals who thrive under pressure and value teamwork. “Our service members carry the values of leadership, teamwork, and resilience into every part of their lives,” he said. “When they return to their communities, those qualities make Delaware stronger.”
Governor Matt Meyer offered his gratitude in a recorded message, emphasizing the importance of recognizing not only veterans but also the families who serve alongside them. “Delaware is stronger because of the commitment and service of our veterans and their families,” Meyer said. “We owe them more than thanks; we owe them opportunities to succeed.”
Potter encouraged attendees to continue building bridges between state agencies and the veteran community, highlighting how Delaware is working to make employment more accessible for service members and their spouses. The Department of Human Resources has introduced programs aimed at improving hiring practices, mentorship, and awareness across state agencies to ensure Delaware remains a leader in veteran-friendly employment.
Audience members, many of whom were veterans working in state departments or family members of active-duty service members, shared personal experiences and discussed ways to strengthen outreach efforts. The conversation concluded with a moment of recognition for Delaware veterans who have transitioned into leadership roles within state government.
Organizers said the “Unified by Service” initiative will continue through additional events and forums that celebrate the contributions of veterans and military families while addressing the challenges they face in the workforce.

A decade ago, a group of engineers and water experts from the Netherlands visited Hampton Roads and helped reshape the region’s approach to rising tides.
The group met with local leaders in a series of summer 2015 workshops known as the Dutch Dialogues, sharing lessons learned from managing water in the low-lying country.
The event helped inform and inspire numerous flood control projects across Hampton Roads, such as stormwater parks and reconstructed wetlands.
“The original Dutch Dialogues challenged us to see water not as an enemy to defeat, but as a neighbor to live with,” Scott Smith, coastal resilience engineer with the city of Hampton, said Wednesday at a conference in downtown Norfolk.
“That shift from resistance to relationship has transformed plans, projects and partnerships across the region. We’ve made real progress.”
This week’s event, Dutch Dialogues: Life at Sea Level, celebrates the 10th anniversary of the landmark event and charts a path forward.
 ‘Living with water’

The Netherlands has been battling water for centuries.
About a third of the country along the North Sea is below sea level, and the rest is not much higher.
Victoria Elema, who works for the country’s Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management and the Netherlands International Water Ambition, said they used to focus on “gray” infrastructure – hardened, manmade structures such as large storm surge barriers.
“Gradually, we also saw that just fighting water wouldn’t be sufficient, so we changed our approach a little bit to also living with water,” she said in an interview at the conference. “Give the river more space, give water more space, show people that it’s nice to have water in your surroundings, and water is not your enemy, things like that.”
The Dutch have become renowned for extensive water management techniques, including a series of dikes and dams, canals, floating houses and windmills that pump water.
“We’re in the process of looking forward to the years to come, because we are facing increasing sea level rise,” Elema said. “So we’re not done yet. Water is part of our DNA in the Netherlands, so we will always work with that and think of new solutions.”
They also want others to learn from their mistakes, she said. That’s how they ended up in Norfolk, which is also deeply tied to and threatened by water. (Even the Hague water body in Norfolk has connections: Two Dutchmen helped develop Ghent in the late 1800s.)
David Waggonner, founder of the New Orleans-based architecture firm Waggonner & Ball, helped develop the Dutch Dialogues program. After the city’s levees failed during Hurricane Katrina, he tagged along with a group looking at flood defenses in the country.
The Dutch Dialogues were first held in New Orleans before coming to Norfolk and later Charleston. Waggonner said the goal was to keep spreading lessons learned.
“You can’t maintain awareness if you’re inside your own bubble,” he said. “You have to look outside.”
The 2015 event focused on boosting Norfolk’s application to the federal government in the National Disaster Resilience Competition.
Working with the nonprofit Wetlands Watch, students from Old Dominion and Hampton universities had been working in the Chesterfield Heights neighborhood to identify potential solutions to chronic flooding.
Their ideas helped inspire Norfolk’s grant application and the Dutch Dialogues helped refine it, leading to the $112 million Ohio Creek Watershed Project completed in 2023.
Smith said the discussions shaped the last 10 years of his career in the resilience field, including the Resilient Hampton initiative. Hampton’s City Council codified the “Living with Water” concept as a strategic priority.
“We realized the threat and now we’re working to see how we can adapt,” Smith said.
For example, Hampton is working on the Big Bethel Blueway, transforming an existing drainage canal into public green space while adding storage capacity.
At this week’s conference, local leaders acknowledged challenges, such as how to effectively and equitably move people out of harm’s way and how to fund investments.
 Moving forward

Much of Virginia’s resilience work has relied on money and leadership from the federal and state governments, said Ben McFarlane, chief resilience officer for the Hampton Roads Planning District Commission.
“That model is no longer going to work anytime soon,” he said. “The impacts that we’re already seeing in terms of flooding on our communities demand that we model new approaches to decision-making, to planning, to designing, to building infrastructure to help our communities deal with these issues.”
Protecting Hampton Roads is not just a local issue, he said. The concentration of military facilities also makes it a matter of national security. Officials have worked regionally on resilience, such as agreeing to regional stormwater design standards that incorporate sea level rise.
But more needs to be done, “piloting new solutions to old problems,” McFarlane said.
Carol Considine, director of applied projects at ODU’s Institute for Coastal Adaptation and Resilience, said the Dutch Dialogues prompted many flooding projects.
To maximize time and money, the region needs to prioritize projects with broader advantages, she said, such as greenery that protects people from extreme heat, buffers pollution and absorbs excess water.
“Hard conversations will hopefully happen here about how we need to be getting multiple benefits out of solutions, and not addressing one piece of climate change, which is flooding,” Considine said.
Smith said he hopes this week’s event will “re-energize” local officials.
“We don’t want to become complacent,” he said. “We want to advance.”

By Staff Writer | Delaware LIVE | November 6, 2025
As winter approaches, the Delaware State Fire Marshal’s Office is urging residents to protect themselves and their families from the silent killer of carbon monoxide during National Carbon Monoxide Awareness Month.
Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas produced by fuel-burning devices such as furnaces, generators, fireplaces, grills and vehicles. Because it cannot be detected by human senses, it can pose a hidden threat in homes, garages and other enclosed spaces.
High concentrations of carbon monoxide can be fatal within minutes, while lower, long-term exposure can cause lasting health problems. Symptoms are often mistaken for flu or fatigue and may include headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, confusion, shortness of breath, weakness, blurred vision, or sleepiness.
The Delaware State Fire Marshal’s Office emphasized that awareness and prevention are the best protection and shared several safety reminders for households:

Install carbon monoxide alarms in your home, garage or any area with fuel-burning appliances, especially near sleeping areas.
Take a portable carbon monoxide alarm when traveling, as some hotels are not required to have them.
Know the difference between alarms. A carbon monoxide alarm typically beeps four times in a row, while a smoke alarm beeps three times.
Test alarms monthly and replace batteries as recommended by the manufacturer.
Schedule annual inspections of furnaces, fireplaces and chimneys, and keep vents and exhausts clear of snow or debris.
Use generators safely, keeping them at least twenty feet from buildings and never operating them indoors.
Never use a gas stove or oven to heat your home, and do not run a vehicle inside a closed or attached garage.

Officials reminded Delaware residents that carbon monoxide incidents are completely preventable when basic safety measures are followed. The risk rises during colder months as families use heaters, fireplaces and backup power sources more often.
The Fire Marshal’s Office encourages homeowners, renters and travelers to check their alarms this month and review safety steps with all members of the household.

The report, which was prepared following an executive directive from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, draws on data from several state departments, including Agriculture & Rural Development, Transportation, the Housing Development Authority and others.



 Key Highlights

In Michigan’s agriculture sector, the report notes a sharp drop in exports: wheat exports declined 89%, cherries down 62%, apples down 58%, and soybeans down 46%.
Rising consumer food costs: the report estimates a 3.6% increase in food prices this year due to tariffs, with households in the bottom 10-20% income bracket facing as much as a 5% drop in disposable income.
In the housing market, tariff-driven material cost increases are estimated to raise the price of a new home by about $10,900.
Infrastructure and construction projects are also being affected, with state transportation officials projecting that the combined effects of tariffs and inflation could raise costs up to $218 million for road and bridge projects.




“Michigan families and businesses are all facing rising prices and constant uncertainty because of our chaotic national tariff strategy,” Whitmer, a Democrat, said in a press release. “While I cannot change the national tariff rate, I will continue advocating for Michigan every chance I get so we can keep lowering costs for families.”
The report cautions that higher food prices and rising housing costs may squeeze household budgets, particularly for lower-income families. Additionally, delayed or more expensive public projects could slow job creation and economic growth.
The analysis was released the same day that the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on the legality of Republican President Donald Trump imposing sweeping global tariffs under an economic emergency powers statute.

The order followed reports Wednesday evening of an ammonia leak at the facility.
Yazoo County Emergency Manager Jack Willingham said he wasn’t sure what caused an explosion that led to the leak, but said there was no fire from the burst. There were no injuries or deaths from the event, he said, and all roads are back open after diversions last night on U.S. 49.
“My building’s a mile away, and I could feel it shake,” Willingham said. “And when I walked outside you could see the huge plume. But there was no fire I’m aware of.”
The county lifted the evacuation order, he added, around 1 a.m. on Thursday. There were about 15 families who live along Renshaw and Generette Roads who needed to evacuate, Willingham said. The shelter order applied to everyone living north of 15th Street in Yazoo City.
Gov. Tate Reeves posted on social media Thursday around 9 a.m. that the shelter-in-place order was still in effect, but posted shortly after that it had been lifted. 
Air quality levels were safe in the area as of about 6 a.m. Thursday, the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality said. The agency said it will continue to monitor air levels through the day.

“Faculty across all disciplines have begun to factor AI use, as well as its challenges and limitations, into their course design,” said Coe College Provost Angela Ziskowski in the release. “To be able to utilize AI effectively is an emerging skill that will have applications everywhere and we want our students to be prepared.”
Through a “guided learning mode” embedded in Gemini Pro, the release stated the AI tool will operate as “a learning companion,” asking questions of students and providing support to help students find the answer rather than just generating it. According to the release, Google consulted students, instructors and researchers in developing the mode to ensure it helps with critical thinking skills and finding true understanding of a subject.
Coe College President David Hayes said in the release AI is being used “with intentionality” by professionals and students who know how to “responsibly utilize AI” to bring greater efficiency to the workplace will be a step ahead of their competition for jobs.
“Utilizing this technology builds practical skills students will need for high-paying careers today and tomorrow,” Hayes said in the release. “By collaborating with industry leaders like Google, we are ensuring our students have the resources they need to innovate and succeed while fostering a spirit of innovation on campus.”

(Getty Images)Following community input and critique, the New Mexico Public Education Department this week submitted its final draft of the court-ordered remedial plan for a long-running educational equity lawsuit, meeting the final court deadline.
Advocates say they intend to analyze the plan and meet with community members later this month about it, but some already have noted what they described as its shortcomings.
The plan, ordered by First Judicial District Court Judge Matthew Wilson, marks the latest action taken by the state to improve educational opportunities and outcomes for at-risk New Mexico students, including students with disabilities, low-income students, English Language Learners and Native American students. Wilson ordered the state in April to complete a final plan—as part of the ruling in the landmark Yazzie/Martinez lawsuit—outlining specific steps the education department, Legislature and school districts will take to ensure all students receive quality education. 
The department, along with the Los Alamos National Laboratory Foundation and WestEd, collected stakeholder and community input over the summer and submitted an initial draft plan to the court in early October. The New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty and other educational advocates in the state last month criticized the plan for being too “vague” and not including the voices of all entities that provided input. 
According to a Tuesday PED news release, the department updated the plan to include “clearer outcomes and accountability measures based on feedback from students, families, educators, tribal leaders and community members statewide.” The release also stated that the plan now includes “more specific performance targets and expands support” for the at-risk students identified in the initial court finding. “We listened to what communities told us they need, and this plan reflects those priorities,” PED Secretary Mariana Padilla said in a statement. 
The release stated that the state also revised the plan to include expanded training for educators on “cultural and linguistic responsiveness;” stronger collaboration between the PED, school districts, tribal governments, institutions of higher education and other state agencies and community organizations; and an online “accountability and transparency tool” that highlights funding, implementation of programs and student outcomes.
New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty Education Director Melissa Candelaria said during a news conference Wednesday that while she and her colleagues have not yet completed an in-depth analysis of the latest plan, community experts maintain that what matters the most is culturally affirming curriculum; adequate staffing; wraparound services; behavioral health support; “robust” resources for multilingual learners and students with disabilities; and addressing funding inequities.
“Our communities have long shared a vision for a world class education: one that is grounded in the rich cultures, languages, histories and values of New Mexico,” Candeleria said during the news conference. She said the organization, which represents the plaintiffs in the Yazzie/Martinez case, will analyze the newest version of the plan this month and will meet with students, teachers and community experts on Nov. 21 to discuss what it lacks.
Andrew Montoya, director of Community Schools for the National Education Association’s New Mexico chapter, said during the news conference that the PED’s plan does not make adequate changes that will improve student support and outcomes. 
“The Public Education Department’s plan treats equity as an add-on, misses the mark on community collaboration, is constitutionally insufficient and will accelerate the educator exodus already harming our students,” Montoya said. 
He pointed out that his department’s analysis found that the plan added five to 10 more hours of work for teachers without removing current duties; between $400 and $500 million of unfunded obligations; and did not take into account teacher retention and why educators leave their positions. 
“This plan also omits the tribal remedy framework entirely, ignoring requests from New Mexico’s pueblos, nations and tribes for indigenous-led curriculum and training centers,” Montoya said. “We urge the Public Education Department to reject this plan as-written; rebuild it with students, educators and tribal leadership at the table; and fund the support our students and teachers deserve. When we fight for student-led solutions, fair pay, manageable work loads and respect for tribal sovereignty, we’re not protecting the status quo, we’re fighting for educational justice for every child in New Mexico.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/teacher-in-a-classroom-1536x864-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-06 13:02:04.777855

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Candidates for office may not need to close and open a bank account each election cycle, according to two draft opinions from the Oklahoma Ethics Commission.
In both opinions, the Commission recommended that those running for reelection for the same office in a subsequent election cycle not be required to open a new bank account. They would still be required to close and reopen a campaign committee with the commission.
Rep. Judd Strom, R-Copan, requested clarification of the Commission’s existing rule in September. 
Strom wrote that the current rule, as he understands it, requires a candidate or officeholder to close their current bank account, open a new one and transfer carry-over funds each election cycle, even when running for reelection of the same office. 
“I have found the action to be cumbersome, be confusing, and possibly lead to the unintended consequence of observers being misled by the transfer of funds,” he wrote. 
The first opinion also proposes that the campaign committee’s bank account can be opened with a bank without specifying a year on the account’s name. 
The commission is expected to hear written or oral public feedback on the preliminary opinions at its Nov. 13 meeting ahead of any vote to finalize either.

By cutting the maximum benefit by one-half, the department would have spent about $3 billion from a SNAP contingency fund instead of the full $4.65 billion in the fund, which is what the court ordered it to spend.The error was first reported to U.S. District Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. by the coalition of cities and nonprofit organizations that sued to force the government to pay SNAP benefits this month. An analysis submitted by Sharon Parrott, a former White House budget officer who now leads the left-leaning think tank Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, showed that the table the department submitted to the court and sent to states on Tuesday would fall short of the court’s order to spend the entire contingency fund.The groups said the department’s error was another reason the court should compel the government to transfer funds to pay out full benefits for November.“Defendants’ approach means that only around $3 billion—out of the $4.65 billion Defendants have said is available—will be spent on SNAP benefits in November, leaving more than $1.5 billion in contingency funds unspent,” they wrote in a Wednesday brief. “Defendants opted for partial (and delayed) SNAP payments, but even then, did not manage to do that correctly.”The department said in its filing later Wednesday that it independently discovered its miscalculation and worked to fix it before Parrott’s declaration hit the court docket.“Defendants realized this error and worked to issue new guidance and tables as soon as it was discovered, not in response to Plaintiffs’ notice filed earlier this evening,” USDA’s brief said.The parties are scheduled to argue before McConnell again Thursday afternoon.This report will be updated.",,,,2025-11-06 13:02:04.777855

McConnell Jr., who was appointed by Democratic former President Barack Obama, said the administration blew its chance to choose to pay only partial benefits for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, when it failed to release funds by a Wednesday deadline.He said a social media post by President Donald Trump showed the president sought to use hunger for political leverage during the government shutdown, which stretched into day 37 on Thursday.Earlier, in a Friday oral order that he expanded in a Saturday written order, McConnell had said the government must either pay full benefits by Monday or partial benefits from a contingency fund by Wednesday. The government did neither, he said Thursday.The administration had argued it was impossible to pay the benefits, which go to 42 million Americans, within a few days, saying that the USDA had never calculated partial benefits and that coordinating new payments for SNAP, a federally funded program administered by the states, was difficult. The administration quickly appealed the ruling to the 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.“Today is a major victory for 42 million people in America. The court could not be more clear – the Trump-Vance administration must stop playing politics with people’s lives by delaying SNAP payments they are obligated to issue,” said Skye Perryman, President and CEO of Democracy Forward, co-counsel for the coalition challenging the administration.‘USDA cannot now cry’But McConnell said the department created the problem, in part by failing to prepare for it far earlier. USDA was obligated to spend from a contingency fund to ensure SNAP benefits flowed into November uninterrupted, he said. “USDA did not do so,” he said. “Even when Nov. 1 came, USDA refused to use the congressionally mandated contingency funds. USDA cannot now cry that it cannot get timely payments to beneficiaries for weeks or months because states are not prepared to make partial payments.“USDA arbitrarily and capriciously created this problem by ignoring the congressionally mandated contingency funds and failing to timely notify the states.”McConnell also pointed to Trump’s post on Truth Social on Tuesday that indicated he would not authorize payments consistent with the judge’s order until Democrats agreed to his terms to end the government shutdown.“The day before the compliance was ordered, the president stated his intent to defy the court order when he said, ‘SNAP payments will be given only when the government opens,’” McConnell said Thursday.Child nutrition funding suggestedThe USDA had said it would pay only partial November benefits from a contingency fund holding about $4.5 billion, rather than tap into other money at its disposal, including a $23 billion fund for child nutrition programs.The coalition of cities and nonprofit organizations that sued to force the administration to pay SNAP benefits for November has argued the court should force USDA to pay full benefits for November. In addition to the missed Wednesday deadline, the move violated a fundamental administrative law requiring federal agencies not to make arbitrary and capricious decisions, Kristin Bateman of the Democracy Forward Foundation, which is representing the groups, said Thursday.The child nutrition program would not need its billions of dollars until June, she said, meaning that transferring funds for SNAP would only actually hurt the child nutrition program if the shutdown persists until then.“A decision on such a highly unlikely set of events is not reasoned decision-making,” Bateman said. “It's particularly unreasonable because the defendants have not explained why they would choose to let 42 million Americans, including 16 million children, go hungry now in order to guard against the extreme outside chance that come June, there won't be enough money to fund child nutrition programs.”McConnell agreed that invoking the child nutrition fund was “entirely pretextual,” which was demonstrated in part by Trump’s post and other statements by administration officials.“The defendants’ stated desire to conserve funding for the child nutrition programs is entirely pretextual, given the numerous statements made in recent weeks by the president and his administration officials who admit to withholding full SNAP benefits for political reasons,” he said.McConnell also noted that the case should be resolved as soon as possible to help provide food to hungry people or “needless suffering will occur.”‘A state problem’Tyler Becker, who argued on behalf of the USDA, said the department had done its part by making available to states a table showing how they should allocate partial November benefits for households of differing circumstances.SNAP is a complex program, requiring coordination between the federal government and all 50 states, each of which has a different system for distributing benefits.“The government did make the payments, is making the payments to the states,” he said. “That's all the government does in the SNAP program.”He added that the government had shown earlier in the case some of the administrative difficulties of paying partial benefits.In a separate case in Massachusetts federal court, some states said they could process the benefits immediately, while others cannot.“This is a state problem,” he said.But McConnell cut him off shortly after, saying the federal government was responsible for ensuring people got their SNAP benefits.“The problem that the government identified needed to be resolved one way or the other by Wednesday,” he said. “And if it wasn't resolved by Wednesday, then you had to make the full payments, because that's the only way we could get money to people immediately and alleviate the irreparable harm, whether you could or couldn't do anything about that.”In a Sept. 30 contingency plan about how to proceed during a government shutdown, the USDA itself said it would pay for continuing benefits through the contingency fund, which at the time held $6 billion. The administration later reversed that plan and said it could not tap the contingency fund.In the Massachusetts case, which was brought by 25 Democratic states and the District of Columbia, the states argued Thursday that confusion stemming from a miscalculation the USDA made in determining November partial benefits was a reason to force the administration to pay for a full month.USDA corrects miscalculationThe hearing followed a late Wednesday night filing from the USDA correcting an error it made in calculating the amounts beneficiaries would receive under its plan for partial payments. The department said it will reduce the largest monthly food assistance payments by about 35% in November, down from a 50% cut the department initially estimated.USDA miscalculated how to adjust benefit payments for SNAP to account for a lack of full funding during the government shutdown, a department official said in a filing to the U.S. District Court for Rhode Island. The formula the government initially used and sent to states Tuesday would have resulted in about a 50% cut to the maximum monthly benefits, and left some households without benefits. SNAP pays benefits on a sliding scale depending on the size of a household, the household’s income and other expenses such as housing. By cutting the maximum benefit by one-half, the department would have spent about $3 billion from a SNAP contingency fund instead of the full $4.65 billion in the fund, which is what the court ordered it to spend.The mixup created confusion for state administrators, the states in the Massachusetts litigation said.“The fact they have been asked to suddenly shift on a dime yet again as a result of these entirely new tables, causing further chaos and delay, underscores that USDA’s approach here is untenable and unlawful,” the states wrote in a Thursday brief.The error was first reported to McConnell by the coalition of cities and nonprofit organizations that sued to force the government to pay SNAP benefits this month. Think tank discovers discrepancy An analysis submitted by Sharon Parrott, a former White House budget officer who now leads the left-leaning think tank Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, showed that the table the department submitted to the court and sent to states on Tuesday would fall short of the court’s order to spend the entire contingency fund.The groups said the department’s error was another reason the court should compel the government to transfer funds to pay out full benefits for November.“Defendants’ approach means that only around $3 billion—out of the $4.65 billion Defendants have said is available—will be spent on SNAP benefits in November, leaving more than $1.5 billion in contingency funds unspent,” they wrote in a Wednesday brief. “Defendants opted for partial (and delayed) SNAP payments, but even then, did not manage to do that correctly.”The department said in its filing later Wednesday that it independently discovered its miscalculation and worked to fix it before Parrott’s declaration hit the court docket.“Defendants realized this error and worked to issue new guidance and tables as soon as it was discovered, not in response to Plaintiffs’ notice filed earlier this evening,” USDA’s brief said.",,,,2025-11-06 18:01:39.496617

Kay Ivey speaks at the Alabama County Commission Association convention at the Perdido Beach Resort in Orange Beach, Alabama, on Aug. 20, 2025. Ivey announced Thursday morning that the state has submitted a plan for the Rural Health Transformation Program to the federal government. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)Gov. Kay Ivey on Thursday said the state had submitted a plan to secure public money to offset projected cuts in Medicaid funding.  
The Rural Health Transformation Program is part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) that was signed into law this summer. It distributes $50 billion in grants to the states over five years for rural health care. According to a brief from KFF, a national health policy research organization, the fund could partially offset just over a third (37%) of the estimated federal Medicaid spending cuts in rural areas, which are projected to be $137 billion over ten years.
Ivey’s office said in a statement that program will have 11 initiatives: Collaborative Electronic Health Record (EHR), IT and Cybersecurity; Rural Health; Maternal and Fetal Health; Rural Workforce; Cancer Digital Regionalization; Simulation Training; Statewide EMS Trauma and Stroke; EMS Treat-In-Place; Mental Health; Community Medicine; and Rural Health Practice.

The governor’s office did not say Thursday how much funding it was requesting; a message seeking comment was left with a spokesperson for Ivey on Thursday. Additional details on each of the initiatives were not provided, but a group of 20 experts and lawmakers will meet on the proposal on Wednesday. 
“My team left no stone unturned as it gathered information to submit our plan,” Ivey said. “It is a thoughtful, strategic plan that must be coupled with state policy changes to maximize effectiveness. Once implemented, the initiatives and policy changes will make meaningful improvements to healthcare in rural Alabama.”
According to the University of North Carolina’s Sheps Center, nine rural hospitals have closed in Alabama since 2009. Only 30% of the state’s rural hospitals have labor and delivery units, leaving many expectant parents to drive long distances for care. Alabama is one of ten states that has not expanded Medicaid. Alabama’s hospitals have long pushed for expansion, saying it would help hospitals on the brink of collapse survive, but Republican leaders have resisted it. 
While Alabama House leaders have signaled openness to a public-private hybrid approach to expansion, the Senate has been hostile, and removed a provision from a 2024 gambling bill that could have provided money for the program.  
The initiatives aim to help rural health care facilities become more financially viable, increase access to critical healthcare services and improve quality of care and patient health outcomes, according to the statement. 
“As someone from Wilcox County, making meaningful improvements in how we deliver health care in rural Alabama is critically important to me,” Ivey said. “Making America Healthy Again begins in rural America, and I look forward to the state and federal governments working together to improve health care across the state.”
Awards are expected by the end of the year, according to the statement, and will be administered by the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs. Half of the $50 billion grant will be evenly distributed to states, with the other half at the discretion of CMS.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0294-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-06 12:03:43.159461

On Wednesday, a jury found Avery Bankston, 38, guilty of first-degree murder for the death of Tyrone Wilson. 
The night of Feb. 23, 2023, the Hinds County Sheriff’s Department and Mississippi Bureau of Investigation found 50-year-old Wilson dead and lying on his back in the cell he shared with Bankston. 
Video camera footage showed both men enter and exit the cell and visible movement from under the cell door: a struggle and a red-sleeved arm reach from under the cell, according to the Hinds County District Attorney’s office. Later, video captured Bankston using a white cloth to clean the inside cell window and door. 
“For our system of law to work, prisons have to be safe. We will not tolerate our detention centers to become battlegrounds,” Hinds District Attorney Jody Owens said in a statement. “Every act of violence behind bars will be prosecuted as aggressively as one on the street.”
Owens said he hopes the verdict will bring closure to Wilson’s family who lives in Illinois and didn’t have the chance to say goodbye to him. 
At the time of the killing, Bankston was being held at the Raymond facility awaiting trial for burglary charges. Charge information for Wilson was not immediately available. 
Bankston’s attorney asked the court to suppress or limit testimony about any alleged previous altercation between Bankston and Wilson as hearsay because no one personally witnessed an altercation, and to limit allegations of Bankston’s prior arrests. 
At least six people have died at the Hinds County Detention Center this year, including the homicide of a man whose body was found in his cell after an apparent assault.

For the past two years, federal clean energy tax credits have offered a welcome relief. Thanks to programs created under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), homeowners across Michigan and the rest of the country were able to save thousands of dollars on solar, home energy efficiency improvements, and other clean energy upgrades. These incentives lowered the cost of everything from rooftop solar systems to home insulation, giving families a chance to reduce their consumption, cut their monthly bills, and insulate themselves from ever rising utility prices.
The scale of the impact was significant. In 2023 alone, more than 3.4 million American families received $8.4 billion in tax credits that reduced the cost of clean energy and efficiency improvements. And many probably don’t realize those solar tax credits pale in comparison to annual subsidies the oil and gas industry continue to receive year after year. Additionally, here in Michigan, more than 117,000 households were among the beneficiaries, collectively saving over $134 million.
These upgrades didn’t just lower bills in the short term; they created lasting savings that will continue for many years to come, along with providing significant benefits to the grid as a whole, reducing demand and helping to slow down ever increasing rate hikes for all Michigan residents.
But now, those credits are being rolled back. Under a recently passed Republican tax bill, key clean energy incentives will expire by the end of this year. Some, like clean vehicle credits worth up to $7,500 for new electric vehicles and up to $4,000 for used EVs, have already disappeared. Residential clean energy and home energy efficiency credits will vanish at the end of December.
The result is that families who had been counting on these programs to help with the cost of upgrades will lose access altogether.
The consequences of eliminating these programs are serious. According to an Energy Innovation analysis, the Republican “Big Beautiful Bill” will raise annual energy bills by $20 billion in 2030 and $37 billion by 2035. Instead of giving families tools to lower their bills, the rollback forces them to pay more for the same energy. Experts estimate that, had the credits remained in place, Americans would have saved $38 billion on electricity bills by 2030. Now, those savings are off the table, all while oil and gas corporations will continue to receive $10-40 billion in annual subsidies.
These changes come at a time when energy costs are already rising faster than inflation. Nationally, one in six households is behind on electric or gas bills. The combination of higher rates and the loss of federal support means that more families will face difficult choices about how to cover their energy needs.
There are broader challenges on the horizon as well. Energy demand is increasing sharply, driven in part by the growth of data centers. Between 2021 and 2024, the number of U.S. data centers nearly doubled and grid operators are starting to sound alarms. PJM Interconnection, which oversees power across 13 states, warned for the first time that it may not be able to reliably meet demand in the future. If clean energy investment slows, the pressure on the grid — and on family budgets — will only intensify.
Industry leaders are also voicing concern. Energy companies warn that scaling back clean energy tax credits will make electricity more expensive in the long run. One clean energy CEO put it bluntly: “If you take renewables and storage off the table, we’re going to force electricity prices to the moon.”
For Michigan households, the stakes are clear. Federal clean energy credits have provided real, measurable relief from high energy bills. Without them, families will not only miss out on upfront savings but also face higher costs in the years to come.
The coming months represent a narrowing window of opportunity. Families who were considering clean energy or efficiency upgrades need to be aware that the federal support that has made these projects much more affordable is disappearing. Once the credits expire, so will the chance to capture thousands of dollars in savings. And unfortunately for most this window has passed, as wait times and schedules for installations are pushing into the very end of the year.
The silver lining is the fact that as rates continue to climb, especially during peak demand time frames during summer afternoons, solar alone provides the best path to reduce these spiking demand charges and to be insulated from future rate increases. Because solar produces the most energy for system owners at the exact time when energy costs the most. So, as rates climb faster and faster with demand outpacing supply, solar energy systems will only get more and more valuable in the coming years.
Overall, the bottom line is simple: at a time when utilities are raising rates faster than ever and energy demand is putting pressure on the grid, cutting back on clean energy incentives will only make life harder and more expensive for Michigan families. These programs were designed to lower costs, promote energy independence, and build a stronger grid for the future. Losing them now means losing one of the few tools that has actually worked to keep household energy bills under control.
But, no matter how much pressure is applied to slow solar adoption, it cannot be stopped because the return on investment will simply be too good to overlook with rapidly rising utility rates, and it is one of the keys to unlocking a successful collective future for us all.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/clean-energy-saves-money-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-06 11:04:06.439654

On Wednesday, Put Missouri First reported two $50,000 contributions — one from the National Republican Congressional Committee and the other from the Republican National Committee. It marks the first contributions to the PAC, which was created last week to counter the referendum campaign seeking to put the state’s congressional map on the 2026 ballot.
The Democratic National Committee announced in September that it would contributing staff and financial resources to bolster a referendum effort.
Matt Belz, a St. Louis attorney serving as treasurer of Put Missouri First, could not be immediately reached for comment.
Missouri’s new congressional districts are part of President Donald Trump’s push for Republican states to revise maps to increase the GOP majority in the U.S. House before next year’s midterm elections.
State lawmakers returned to the Missouri Capitol in September to redraw the map to ensure Republicans have an advantage in seven of the state’s eight districts. The new map carves up the 5th District, based in Kansas City and represented by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver since 2005, to make it easier to flip the seat for Republicans.
Immediately after the map was approved, a PAC called People Not Politicians filed a referendum to place it on the ballot. The group has until Dec. 11 to turn in at least 106,000 signatures in order to force a vote on the plan. On Wednesday, it said it had already exceeded 200,000 signatures.
The referendum campaign faces a lawsuit filed by Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway claiming it is unconstitutional and numerous procedural hurdles enacted by the secretary of state’s office.
But People Not Politicians has raised more than $3 million in just two months, mostly from out-of-state groups. And it is getting help from the Missouri AFL-CIO, which led the referendum campaign in 2018 that collected 300,000 signatures and repealed the state’s a right-to-work law.
“We’re continuing to gather signatures because Missourians want their voices to be heard. We will not stop collecting or be deterred,” said Richard von Glahn, executive director of People Not Politicians. “Every attack from politicians trying to silence us brings us more volunteers and more support.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesotans voted on Election Day to approve 60 out of 96 referendums from 70 school districts asking for more funding through higher taxes.
The referendums give more taxpayer dollars to school districts that will use them for operating, building and capital improvements for the state’s schools, including maintaining staffing and academic programs for students.
Several referendums are renewals of previous referendums that expired thanks to the state’s law that referendum funding can only last 10 years, said Kirk Schneidawind, executive director of the Minnesota School Boards Association.
The number of referendums this year was higher than average but not unusually high, Schneidawind said. He added that part of the driving force behind schools needing more money is high inflation “in almost every sector of their business from transportation to labor costs to health insurance.”
School districts are also financially preparing for uncertainty in federal funding, said Monica Byron, president of Education Minnesota, the state’s largest teachers’ union. Byron pointed to cuts in special education services as a particular concern.
St. Paul, one of the largest districts in Minnesota, approved a $32.7 million tax levy for its schools. The tax levy will “help us avoid millions of dollars in budget cuts that would be detrimental to our schools and the people who work so hard to help our students thrive,” St. Paul superintendent Stacie Stanley said in a statement.


Rural and urban school districts alike voted yes — 80% of referendums passed in rural districts, including in small districts such as Badger Public Schools in northwestern Minnesota. Badger, which currently enrolls 223 students according to Minnesota Department of Education data, approved a $429 levy increase per pupil, along with $5.3 million for school building improvements.
“We know that investing in education, especially during these uncertain times, helps our communities build this skilled workforce that we need and can build economic stability,” said Byron of the teachers union.
Also on Tuesday, the state’s largest school district, Anoka-Hennepin, re-elected three incumbents for a politically split six-person school board in an election that received over $400,000 in campaign spending.

More than a dozen residents since received 'notices to quit.'","Residents of several apartment complexes in New London are facing eviction, just weeks after a corporate landlord purchased the properties.
In October, Shelton-based Alpha Capital Funds bought five apartment complexes in New London previously owned by a local landlord. In total, the buildings have 61 units, according to Connecticut Tenants Union Vice President Luke Melonakos-Harrison.
By late October, more than a dozen residents on month-to-month leases received notices to quit, marking the first step in the eviction process. The evictions are in buildings on Redden Avenue and Williams Street, Melonakos-Harrison said.
“They’ve issued 14 notices to quit so far, and they’ve told the city of New London that they plan to issue 26 total,” Melonakos-Harrison said. “So we’re kind of bracing ourselves to see who else is going to get hit.”
All of the evictions qualify as “no fault,” meaning the new landlord chose not to renew the leases without stating a specified reason. It’s something housing advocates have petitioned against in the state legislature in recent years.
Connecticut’s existing Just Cause eviction law protects residents who are at least 62 years old or have a disability from being evicted from their home without being given a reason, such as nonpayment of rent or a violation of the lease agreement.
Alpha Capital Funds is known for purchasing apartment buildings not listed for sale and seeking evictions or rent raises, according to Melonakos-Harrison. Last year, a similar situation played out in Niantic, Connecticut, when Alpha Capital Funds purchased an apartment complex and tried to increase rents by as much as $900.
Across Connecticut, Alpha Capital Funds owns more than 400 apartments, including buildings in Middletown, Wallingford, Bridgeport and Groton.
The company’s owner, Tyler Smith, is unwilling to recognize the unions or negotiate, according to Melonakos-Harrison. Smith did not agree to an interview with Connecticut Public.
“It’s not only the individual tenants being threatened with eviction who are damaged by this, but it’s the social fabric of neighbors who have developed a safe environment in their long term home,” Melonakos-Harrison said.
So far, the buildings on Redden Avenue and Williams Street banded together to form tenants unions.
Michael Duffy has lived in his Redden Avenue apartment for eight years and received a notice to quit.
“On the back of the notice, it said we are here to help, and it confused the hell out of me, because if you’re here to help, then why are you giving me a notice to quit?” Duffy said.
Duffy said he’s always paid his rent on time and done landscaping maintenance around the property.
Residents are now waiting on Alpha Capital Funds to recognize the unions, or for local lawmakers to try and mitigate.

Read this story in English.
Los subsidios que ayudan a reducir los costos de los planes de salud de la Ley de Cuidado de Salud Asequible (ACA) expirarán a finales de año y, sin la intervención del Congreso, se prevé que las primas aumenten en 2026.
Los subsidios mejorados para las primas han estado en el centro de atención en las últimas semanas debido a la prolongación del cierre del gobierno federal.
Los Demócratas están presionando para que se extiendan nuevamente los subsidios con el fin de asegurar sus votos en un proyecto de ley que reabriría el gobierno y pondría fin al cierre que ya dura un mes. Pero muchos Republicanos lo consideran un gasto excesivo del gobierno y quieren, al menos, abordar el tema por separado de la financiación gubernamental. Se prevé que los aumentos de las primas entren en vigor el próximo año si los créditos fiscales caducan después del 31 de diciembre.
La incertidumbre sobre los créditos fiscales coincide con el inicio del período de inscripción abierta para comprar planes para el próximo año, en el mercado de seguros del Estado, Access Health CT. La inscripción abierta para los planes que entran en vigor a principios del próximo año comenzó el 1 de noviembre y se extiende hasta el 15 de diciembre. Los residentes tienen hasta el 15 de enero para inscribirse en planes que comienzan en febrero.
Esto es lo que necesita saber:
¿Qué son los subsidios y por qué expiran?
Los subsidios mejorados para las primas se crearon en virtud de la Ley del Plan de Rescate Estadounidense, la legislación federal de 2021 que los Demócratas del Congreso aprobaron para brindar ayuda durante la pandemia de COVID-19.
Los inscritos pueden calificar para varios subsidios para reducir los costos de atención médica según sus ingresos. Los hogares que ganan entre el 100% y el 400% del nivel federal de pobreza son elegibles para recibir ayuda financiera para pagar los planes.
El proyecto de ley de 2021 amplió la elegibilidad a quienes ganan más del 400% del nivel federal de pobreza, limitando el costo de un plan de referencia al 8.5% de los ingresos anuales de ese hogar.
Para calificar para cualquier subsidio, debe ser ciudadano estadounidense o tener residencia legal. También debe presentar la declaración de impuestos conjuntamente si está casado.
Según el Plan de Rescate Estadounidense, los subsidios mejorados habrían expirado un año después, en 2022. Pero el Congreso logró extenderlos por otros tres años en virtud de la Ley de Reducción de la Inflación de los Demócratas. Esa ley estableció la expiración de los créditos fiscales para el 31 de diciembre de 2025.
¿Veré un aumento en mis primas si expiran?
Es probable que vea un aumento en su prima si el Congreso no toma ninguna medida antes de fin de año. Para quienes ganan menos del 400% del nivel federal de pobreza, es probable que reciban menos asistencia. Pero aquellos que superen el 400% verán desaparecer por completo su ayuda.
Recientemente se enviaron cartas a las personas que tienen planes a través de Access Health CT informándoles cuánto más podrían tener que pagar cuando expiren los créditos.
Si los subsidios caducan a finales de diciembre, los residentes de Connecticut podrían ver aumentar sus primas en un promedio de $2,380 por año, o alrededor de $198 al mes, según las estimaciones de mediados de octubre proporcionadas por Access Health CT. Un hogar de cuatro personas vería aumentar sus primas en un promedio de más de $10,000 por año.
El mercado de seguros de salud estatal atribuye estos aumentos de primas a la expiración de los subsidios mejorados, además de los aumentos generales de tarifas para los planes de 2026.
Access Health CT dijo que utiliza dos factores para determinar las primas: la edad y el condado. Para las personas mayores, las tarifas de las primas suelen ser más altas porque se espera que utilicen los servicios de salud con más frecuencia.
¿Quiénes se verán afectados en Connecticut?
La expiración de estos subsidios afectaría a quienes compran planes de salud a través de Access Health CT. No afecta a quienes obtienen cobertura a través de planes proporcionados por el empleador, Medicare o Medicaid.
Pero no todos perderán por completo el apoyo financiero y otros subsidios que ayudan a reducir los costos para las personas que compran en el mercado de seguros del Estado.
Alrededor de 143,000 afiliados en Connecticut reciben algún tipo de subsidio para ayudar a cubrir los costos de las primas. De ese número, casi 32,000 afiliados califican para el subsidio mejorado y, por lo tanto, perderían por completo su asistencia financiera el próximo año. Los 111,000 restantes seguirán recibiendo apoyo financiero, pero este disminuirá.
Actualmente, un total de casi $105 millones mensuales se destinan a la reducción de las primas para los afiliados en el Estado.
Los estadounidenses mayores y los jubilados con anticipación podrían experimentar algunos de los mayores aumentos en sus primas, según Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF). De las personas en Connecticut que corren el riesgo de perder toda la ayuda financiera, poco más de un tercio tienen entre 55 y 64 años.
¿Ampliará el Congreso los subsidios antes de fin de año?
Actualmente, el Congreso está inmerso en una prolongada disputa sobre cómo y cuándo abordar la expiración de los subsidios, que es el eje central del conflicto que ha provocado el cierre parcial del gobierno.
No está claro si el Congreso votará para extenderlos o si caducarán el próximo mes. Existe un debate sobre la duración de cualquier prórroga, o incluso sobre si se deben renovar. Algunos Demócratas quieren que sean permanentes. Pero algunos Republicanos que están a favor de su renovación solo quieren una extensión temporal y límites de ingresos.
Los Demócratas quieren abordar la extensión de los créditos fiscales al mismo tiempo que la financiación a corto plazo, conocida como resolución continua, para mantener el gobierno en funcionamiento. En su propia versión del proyecto de ley de financiación, los Demócratas buscan que los subsidios sean permanentes, entre otras disposiciones relacionadas con la atención médica y Medicaid.
Los Republicanos por su parte, argumentan que deberían tratarse por separado. El liderazgo Republicano no ha apoyado la extensión de los subsidios, pero algunos miembros del partido sí lo han hecho. Existe un proyecto de ley liderado por los Republicanos que los extendería por un año más, el cual ha sido rechazado en gran medida por los Demócratas.
Debido a la incertidumbre sobre lo que hará el Congreso y al cierre parcial del gobierno, los funcionarios de Connecticut han recomendado posponer la inscripción inmediata en los planes de 2026 para ver si la situación se resuelve.
“Si pueden, esperen un poco más”, dijo James Michel, director ejecutivo de Access Health CT, a finales de octubre. “En lugar de inscribirse el 1 de noviembre, denle más tiempo, porque sé que se están llevando a cabo conversaciones para intentar resolver el tema de los subsidios”.

(Photo by Rob Levine for The Minnesota Reformer)TOPEKA — China’s plan to increase soybean and sorghum purchases moved the market in a positive direction and gave Kansas farmers a measure of relief amid high input prices and tariff challenges.
“It was great to see that America’s farmers, our soybean producers especially, were a priority in conversation last week with China,” said Kaleb Little, CEO of the Kansas Soybean Association. “September 1 started that new crop year, and up until last week, China had bought zero new crop soybeans from the U.S.”
China has traditionally been the largest international purchaser of U.S. soybeans, but this year’s trade tariffs caused the country to cancel all purchases.
China buys 20% to 25%, or about 25 to 30 million metric tons, of the U.S. soybean crop in any given year, Little said. Trade agreements made in Washington, D.C., last week indicate China committed to purchasing 25 million metric tons of soybeans annually from 2026 through 2028, and this year they will buy 12 million metric tons, he said.
That leaves sales to make up this year, and Little said the soybean industry is diversifying and expanding sales to other countries. About half of U.S. soybeans are sold domestically and the other half internationally, he said.
 
Sorghum crops
China also pledged to resume sorghum purchases, which Kansas State University grain economist Daniel O’Brien said on K-State’s Grain Outlook program offers potential relief to Kansas farmers who are at least able to cover production costs with current prices.
Kansas is the leading sorghum-producing state, planting 3 million acres of the grain crop, and produces a direct economic impact to the state of $686 million, according to K-State’s extension office.
“We take whatever we can get over direct costs of production for grain sorghum and then we apply it to machinery and to land and to family living,” O’Brien said. “I think the thing to watch over the next month or so will be the strength with which China would come into the sorghum market.”
If China comes into the market with enough purchases to improve prices, that could mean improved sales for Kansas farmers, who have had a good crop this year, O’Brien said.
 
Missing federal reports
The federal government regularly puts out agricultural reports on a variety of topics that help farmers make decisions and various entities track ag production.
But the government shutdown has canceled multiple reports, including crop reports that Little usually accesses to understand where Kansas soybean farmers are in their harvest. Anecdotally, he believes farmers have harvested 60 to 70% of their crop, which is about typical for this time of year, Little said.
In the K-State crop program, O’Brien expressed concern that lack of federal reports could affect farmers and their decision-making processes well into next year, depending on when the government shutdown ends.
For instance, information isn’t available on whether hard red winter wheat exports are strong, something usually available on a weekly basis from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, O’Brien said.
“I think we’ve no doubt had some buying, but I’d be really curious to see once we do get that information back, what the pace had continued to be during that time frame,” he said.
Even more concerning is that right now is when the USDA agricultural statistics teams would be going to field to collect samples for yields.
“They’d be sending out surveys to farmers to find out what their expectations are, what they’ve observed from their harvest numbers,” he said.
That process would have started Nov. 1, and the information would have contributed to important reports that would come out in mid-November.
But the missing data will probably “push” reports out to reports that normally occur in December.
“We typically don’t have much happening during that report, but given the different extraordinary circumstances we’re facing this year, the importance of that December report could be really heightened,” O’Brien said.
If that report is also delayed and crop production numbers aren’t available in December, O’Brien said, the uncertainty could cause crop volatility if farmers are unsure of data they use to make decisions.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/soybean_harvest_4-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-11-06 10:17:43.203462

Free.,Former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to retire from Congress,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/former-us-house-speaker-nancy-pelosi-retire-congress,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, who made history as the first woman to hold the speaker's gavel, announced Thursday she will retire, ending a 40-year legislative career as one of the most powerful Democrats in Congress. Her announcement came after Tuesday’s elections. Pelosi had a hand in crafting what was known as Proposition 50  in California to redraw the state's congressional districts, in response to Republican redistricting efforts in Texas to gain more GOP seats in the House.  The remap passed, and Democrats swept major state races across the country, including the governorships in Virginia and New Jersey.In a video posted to social media, Pelosi, 85, thanked her constituents in her San Francisco congressional district. “I will not be seeking reelection to Congress,” Pelosi said. “With a grateful heart, I look forward to my final year in service as your proud representative.""",,,,2025-11-06 09:57:01.341274

Her retirement, which comes amid Democrats’ cries for a new generation of leadership, sets the stage for a showdown between a progressive challenger and a well-known moderate state senator. 


Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, the trailblazing lawmaker who made history as the first woman to lead the U.S. House of Representatives and a singular force in Democratic politics, announced Thursday that she will retire at the end of 2026 and not seek a 21st term in Congress. 
Pelosi, 85, who has represented San Francisco in the House since 1987, announced her decision Thursday in a nearly six-minute cinematic love letter to the city and her constituents. 
“I’ve always honored the song of St. Francis — ‘Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace,’ — the anthem of our city,” Pelosi, who is a devout Catholic, says near the end of the mini film. “That is why I want you, my fellow San Franciscans, to be the first to know: I will not be seeking re-election to Congress.”
Interspersed with the montage of San Francisco scenes were nods to Pelosi’s signature legislative accomplishments, including the passage of the Affordable Care Act under President Barack Obama and the passage of former President Joe Biden’s infrastructure and climate agenda. 
Pelosi is known for her political prowess, strict leadership and laser-focused vision that made her an exceptionally effective and fearsome speaker. She frequently twisted arms within her own party, quelling an uprising from the progressive flank of the Democratic caucus known as “the Squad” in 2018 and even backchanneling the pressure campaign that led to Biden’s exit from the 2024 presidential race.

She also gained a reputation for her not-so-subtle sass of President Donald Trump, going viral for ripping up his State of the Union speech and mockingly giving him the now-iconic “Nancy clap” of disapproval. Her antagonism of the president also made her a target for political violence. When Jan. 6 rioters stormed the Capitol in 2021, many were looking for her specifically. Pelosi’s husband of more than 60 years, Paul Pelosi, was brutally beaten by an intruder with a hammer who’d broken into the couple’s San Francisco residence looking for her. 
Her video features clever shout-outs to the wide array of industries and interests that have supported — and tangled with — her over the years: labor unions, tech companies, public transit and housing advocates, environmentalists and entrepreneurs. She also notes the city’s struggles, focusing on the recovery from the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and the AIDS crisis. 
“Here we don’t fear the future, we forge it,” Pelosi says. “From the Gold Rush to the miracles of science and technology, our city has always been the cradle of innovation, buzzing with optimism and creativity.”
Pelosi is a longtime force of the city and the Democratic Party, serving as chair of the California party from 1981 to 1983. She raised five children and was active as a volunteer in local politics for years, but didn’t seriously consider running for office until her 40s. She has spoken often of her Catholic upbringing in Baltimore, where her father served as mayor for 12 years. Her brother later followed in his footsteps. 
Her announcement comes amid an outcry from Democrats to let a younger generation take the helm. State Sen. Scott Wiener, who has called Pelosi his mentor, announced last month that he would seek her seat next year. 
Wiener joins a race that also includes progressive challenger Saikat Chakrabarti, the former chief of staff to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York. 
Her idyllic video notably steers clear of any mention of Trump, who has threatened repeatedly to send troops and immigration agents to San Francisco.
“San Francisco, know your power,” Pelosi says. “We have made history, we have made progress, we have always led the way, and now we must continue to do so.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/062323_Nancy_Pelosi_REUTERS_CM_02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-06 09:16:40.919024

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The number of people working in Alaska’s famed seafood industry has set a new record low, surpassing last year’s record low, according to figures published this month by the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development in its magazine, Alaska Economic Trends.
In 2024, an average of 5,393 people were employed as fishers, processors or other seafood workers each month in Alaska, wrote analyst Joshua Warren. That’s down by 443 jobs from the same figure in 2023.
Alaska remains the No. 1 seafood producer among U.S. states, according to federal statistics, and produces more seafood than every other state combined.
The state department of labor has kept a monthly tally of seafood jobs in the state since 2001, and industry employment has been in a steady decline since 2019 due to a variety of factors, including a lack of available fish, competition from cheaper international sources, and high operating costs that can make fishing uneconomic. 
Since the start of 2001, the high point of fishing employment was in 2015, when an average of 8,501 people were employed in the seafood industry each month.
Historically, seafood employment was significantly higher due to reduced rates of automation and the fact that Alaska seafood tended to be processed and packaged locally. 
The modern trend has been toward direct export and processing internationally, where wages are lower.
Seafood employment in Alaska is extremely seasonal, with a peak in June and July during the salmon season and a low ebb in December, before a new season of fishing in federal waters offshore.
In July 2024, only 17,361 people worked in the Alaska seafood industry, the lowest annual peak on record since January 2021. In July 2013, the highest peak, more than 25,000 people were employed in the state’s seafood industry.

Sign up for Chalkbeat Detroit’s free newsletter to keep up with the city’s public school system and Michigan education policy.
Career and technical education programs in Washtenaw County will get a big boost after voters approved a tax increase to add a new funding stream for the programs.
The passage of the special tax proposal may be a good sign across Michigan, given that 41% of schools have limited CTE opportunities for students. The Michigan Department of Education describes these areas as CTE deserts, because data show participation in career tech programs is lower than expected. Tax measures like the one that passed Tuesday in Washtenaw County mean the career programs will have a steady stream of funding.
The proposal passed with 35,947 votes in favor and 29,676 opposed.The tax measure will last 10 years, at which voters would have to approve renewing it.
“This investment by our community will help shape a generation of hope,” said Ryan Rowe, the career and technical education director for the Washtenaw Intermediate School District.
“Our goal is for every student to cross the stage at graduation with an informed and inspired plan for what comes next, whether it’s college, an apprenticeship, the military, or a high-skill career,” Rowe said. “This funding allows us to build stronger pathways, connect learning to the real world, and help students see their future within reach.”
The outcome wasn’t as good for school districts that are part of the Cheboygan-Otsego-Presque Isle intermediate school district in northern Michigan. A similar career and technical education tax proposal failed, according to the Cheboygan Tribune. It would have allowed for the expansion of CTE programs and for funding to allow students to travel to and from school districts in the three counties to take CTE classes.
CTE is particularly limited in Washtenaw County. A report from the University of Michigan’s Youth Policy Lab said access in the county is inequitable, and that students from low-income homes and Black and Hispanic students “have less overall access to CTE programming compared” to more affluent and white students.
At Ypsilanti Community High School, Principal Chelsea Harris-Hugan told Chalkbeat last month that the school would add more CTE programs based on student interest if the measure passes.
“The millage is incredibly important to our students and to our community,” she said. “It provides a bigger pathway and a better opportunity for our students.”
Officials from the Washtenaw Intermediate School District, which will oversee the funding from the tax measure, told Chalkbeat recently that the additional money will allow the ISD to sustain current programs across the county, expand those with waitlists, and create new regional programs. Much of the initial efforts will expand access in Ypsilanti and Whitmore Lake school districts, because they have significantly fewer CTE opportunities than other districts.

From CalMatters economy reporter Levi Sumagaysay:
The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday considered whether President Donald Trump is exceeding his authority in imposing wide-ranging tariffs on imports from most of the rest of the world.
The nation’s highest court heard arguments about the Trump administration’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to justify his tariffs. Some justices expressed skepticism about the president’s ability to act on tariffs unilaterally.

Chief Justice John Roberts: “Imposition of taxes on Americans … has always been the core power of Congress. So, to have the president’s foreign affairs power trump that, that basic power for Congress seems to me to kind of at least neutralize between the two powers, the executive power and the legislative power.”

California filed a similar lawsuit over Trump’s tariffs earlier this year. That suit is essentially on hold pending the high court’s decision on this case, which was brought by a dozen other states and some small businesses. 

California Attorney General Rob Bonta, outside the Supreme Court after arguments on Wednesday: “American people deserve not to be the victim of unlawful taxes. Tariffs are taxes.”

The Consumer Technology Association, whose members include some of California’s biggest tech companies, co-submitted an amicus brief with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The president’s tariffs are “causing irreparable harm” to the groups’ members and in some cases are “threatening their very existence,” they said in the brief.
If the Supreme Court decides the president does not have wide-ranging tariff authority under the law he has cited, the U.S. government will have to issue an estimated $90 billion in refunds to businesses that have paid the tariffs — which Justice Amy Coney Barrett speculated would be “a complete mess.”

Prop. 50 serves multiple purposes for Newsom

For years Gov. Gavin Newsom fended off speculations that he was eyeing the presidency, an ambition that appeared to be a longshot at many points during his governance. But Proposition 50 has catapulted the governor onto the national stage again — and potentially as a frontrunner for the Democratic presidential candidacy.
As CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang explains, Newsom’s national prominence wasn’t always a guarantee, despite his efforts to confront Republicans outside of California, such as debating them on Fox News. In 2023, he urged other states to follow his lead for a constitutional amendment on gun control, though none heeded the call.
But since Prop. 50, Newsom’s national standing has risen: This year, for the first time, he acknowledged he’s considering a possible run for president. The tens of thousands of new nationwide donors who supported his ballot measure could also now serve as a roster of supporters for a potential campaign. And in his Prop. 50 victory speech on Tuesday, he called on other Democratic-led states to advance their own redistricting efforts — and essentially follow his lead.

Celinda Lake, Democratic pollster and strategist: “It was a really outside-the-box idea, implemented well, implemented fast, united the party. And it also showed he was tough.”

CA Republicans plan legal action against Prop. 50

Speaking of Prop. 50, CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller dives into the notable takeaways of its overwhelming victory and what comes next for California.
Hours after Prop. 50 passed, the California Republican Party said it plans to sue over Prop. 50, arguing that it is unconstitutional because it carves out districts in favor of Latino voters, at the expense of other ethnic groups. The U.S. Supreme Court could also issue an upcoming ruling that would give Republicans a big advantage in the South.
Five California Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives are also at a higher risk of losing reelection next year, raising questions about whether they should run in their current, redrawn district; switch to a new one; or drop out entirely. 
That includes Rep. Ken Calvert, whose 41st District that he has represented for more than 30 years in Riverside County will be redrawn eastward into Los Angeles County. On Wednesday he said he would run for reelection in the neighboring 40th District, setting up an intraparty clash with GOP incumbent Rep. Young Kim.

Watch it here.

California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: With paperwork to run for California’s next governor opening next month, the field of would-be Newsom successors is even cloudier — especially since U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla decided to opt out of the race.
More Walters: The passage of Prop. 50 has kicked off a litany of political and possibly legal maneuvers that will determine whether increasing Democratic congressional members becomes reality.

Gavin Newsom has been looking for a way to win national attention. Proposition 50 puts him “light-years ahead.”,"In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom has been looking for a way to win national attention. Proposition 50 puts him “light-years ahead.”


Gov. Gavin Newsom has a message for Democrats around the country: Follow my lead. 
Declaring victory for Proposition 50, his Democratic redistricting ballot measure, he named five other states led by Democrats and urged their governors to tilt their own congressional maps in favor of the party and help it secure the U.S. House in next year’s midterms. 
“We need to see other states, their remarkable leaders that have been doing remarkable things, meet this moment head-on as well,” he said. “We can de facto end Donald Trump’s presidency as we know it, the minute Speaker Jeffries gets sworn in as speaker of the House of Representatives. It is all on the line.”
It had the decisive air of a politician claiming the national mantle. And though he nodded to House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries’s role, the subtext was clear: Newsom was the one who just delivered the party the likelihood of five new seats in Congress. 
With Prop. 50’s overwhelming passage, the governor has vaulted — for the moment — into the role of Democratic favorite in the 2028 presidential campaign. Newsom’s national ambitions have never been veiled, but this year he for the first time acknowledged he’s considering it. Having amassed more than tens of thousands of new donors nationwide to support his ballot measure, he also now has a roster of supporters to call on in a potential campaign.
Cable news shows lit up with mentions of the governor’s success at pulling off the redistricting gambit. MSNBC commentator and former Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill declared Newsom has “moved to the front of the pack” among potential 2028 Democratic presidential contenders  such as Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker. 
“He’s in the top tier,” said Democratic pollster and strategist Celinda Lake. “It was a really outside-the-box idea, implemented well, implemented fast, united the party. And it also showed he was tough.”
Yet one victory in an off-year election driven by the nationwide mood of angry Democrats decidedly set against Trump does not necessarily predict a future successful campaign. Prop. 50 was purely anti-Trump, and Democratic strategist Matt Rodriguez said Democrats still need an independent vision to win back Congress or the White House. 
But looking at possible 2028 contenders, “there’s no question (Newsom is) light years ahead of everyone else.”
“He’s the only one driving his own news,” he said. “Everyone else is like a moth to flame.”
‘Iterating’ a vision and a message
Newsom’s prospects for national prominence weren’t always so bright. For years, he’s been experimenting with how to get attention by confronting Republicans on the national stage, challenging them to debates on Fox News and bankrolling red-state billboards advertising California’s reproductive rights. In 2023 he similarly called on other states’ lawmakers to follow his lead for a constitutional amendment on gun control. No other state joined the effort.
In the first few months of 2025, as Democrats struggled with how to recover from the 2024 loss to Trump, Newsom was podcasting with right-wing activists and mulling their successes. It was the latest in a series of his efforts to try on new political approaches, which the governor frequently describes to reporters as “iterating.”
When Texas Democrats approached Newsom for support over the summer as they tried to fight off a Trump-backed GOP gerrymandering effort there, a counter-proposal from California was considered an extraordinary political risk for the governor. 
It wasn’t clear all Democrats in California’s congressional delegation or the state Legislature were on board, let alone a majority of the state’s voters. But by the end of a 10-week campaign, so many people had donated to support the measure that Newsom told them to stop sending money, while two opposition campaigns failed to capture attention with a cohesive message. 
“I don’t think I’ve ever seen the entirety of the left of politics in California come together in this way in a campaign,” said Neel Sannappa, an organizer with the left-wing California Working Families Party and chair of the California Democrats’ Progressive Caucus.
A knack for trolling
Newsom succeeded, strategists said, by taking a risk in an almost impromptu way that was well-timed with voters’ mounting alarms about Trump’s deployment of the National Guard to American cities, aggressive immigration raids and redistricting efforts in other states. 
It didn’t hurt his own standing that he was also engaging in a social media trolling campaign against Trump, adding to perceptions that he was willing to embrace the brash, unconventional politics that led to the president’s own rise. The posts — often AI-generated, sometimes crude, and always extremely online — have delighted Democrats in a way even skeptical progressives like Sannappa commended. 
“He was thrust into the spotlight as a result of this particular situation (with Texas) and I think he made the most of it,” said Brian Brokaw, a strategist who advises Newsom. “One of his greatest strengths is his ability to evolve with changing times and changing dynamics … It’s reflected in the positive results of last night.”
Months ago, Newsom already acknowledged that one day the tweets will get old, and he would need a new strategy.
“We’re iterating,” he said at an August event hosted by Politico. “That’s been the cause of my life.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/110425_Newsom-Election_JK_CM_04.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-06 09:02:21.592601

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Funding for a Head Start program in South Dakota is delayed because of the federal government shutdown, forcing the program to obtain its own temporary funding and consider a potential closure next month.
Aberdeen-based Northeast South Dakota Head Start expected to receive just over $3 million on Nov. 1 for its fiscal year 2026. The program is funded almost entirely by the federal government, serving 265 children and employing 70 people in eight towns across 13 counties. Children from low-income families receive free early learning, health and family well-being services. 
The program remains open because of a line of credit through Dacotah Bank, said Juli Schultz, executive director of Northeast South Dakota Head Start. The credit will cover the cost of food and staff salaries for November.
States, donors and schools scramble to keep Head Start centers open — for now

If the shutdown continues into December, Schultz said the program will temporarily close.
“The shutdown needs to stop. People here are not puppets,” Schultz said. “What’s happening is they’re playing with our lives, and they just need to move forward.”
Head Start programs are funded annually, though at different times of the year. If the shutdown lasts until December or later, more programs would see their funding run out. 
Eight of South Dakota’s 16 Head Start programs are tribally operated. None of the other non-tribal Head Start programs has been affected yet, said Schultz, who is president of the South Dakota Head Start Association board. South Dakota Searchlight reached out to all tribal organizations, with three responding that their grants have not yet been impacted.
Nationally, about 140 Head Start programs have been affected since the beginning of the shutdown last month; 21 programs in 18 states and Puerto Rico have closed temporarily, according to the National Head Start Association. Other programs have not been affected yet, or have stayed open thanks to a line of credit or because they’ve been able to secure funding through philanthropic organizations.










The shutdown needs to stop. People here are not puppets. What’s happening is they’re playing with our lives, and they just need to move forward.


– Juli Schultz, Northeast South Dakota Head Start


Launched six decades ago as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty, Head Start programs provide a range of services beyond early education, such as medical and dental screenings, school meals and family support to children from low-income households who can’t afford other child care options. Northeast South Dakota Head Start provides preschool classes, along with breakfast, lunch and a snack.
Schultz said the federal government had never previously failed to fund her program by the beginning of the Nov. 1 grant cycle. 
Schultz worries about the effects on children and families if she has to temporarily close the program next month. In addition to providing many children “one main nutritious meal” for most of the week, Head Start is a safe space for children and provides families with child care and help accessing resources within the state and community.

For many of them, the cost will go up next year if Congress doesn’t extend particular tax credits.","Senate Minority Assistant Whip Jen Plumb, D-Salt Lake City, is pictured on the first day of the legislative session at the Capitol in Salt Lake City on Tuesday, Jan. 16, 2024. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)More than 1 in 10 Utahns relies on the Affordable Care Act marketplace for health coverage. For many of them, the cost will go up next year if Congress doesn’t extend particular tax credits. 
On Wednesday, a Democrat in the Utah Legislature and two in Congress urged Republicans in Washington, D.C. to agree to keep the subsidies going so Utahns don’t get priced out. The enhanced tax credits are at the center of the federal government shutdown, the longest in the nation’s history. 
Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar said in a virtual news conference that more than 421,000 Utahns get their health insurance through the marketplace.

Brian Schatz. (Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)
If the subsidies end, a 60-year-old Utah couple earning about $83,000 will see their premiums increase by more than $19,000 per year, Klobuchar said. For a family of four bringing in $64,000, she said the cost would triple, going up by more than $2,500. 
“That’s a real gut punch,” Klobuchar said, reiterating points she’s made recently in North Carolina and Iowa. 
With the end date approaching, Salt Lake City filmmaker Stan Clawson said he’s worried. 
“I’m really looking to the future, as many other people are, and wondering, will I be able to afford a doubling of my premiums?” Clawson said during the news conference. 
Clawson fell 49 feet while rock climbing almost 30 years ago, injuring his spinal cord and paralyzing him below the mid-torso, he said. He uses a wheelchair and catheters, and his insurance helps keep the costs of medical equipment low.  
Still, he’s spent about $12,000 out of pocket on medical expenses this year, he said, on an income of about $42,000.

“This tax credit going away really impacts me and my business,” Clawson said. 
State Sen. Jen Plumb, D-Salt Lake City, said Utah’s hospitals and emergency rooms will take on a bigger burden if thousands drop their insurance because it’s too expensive. 
Plumb, an emergency room pediatrician, said she already sees patients on a routine basis who can’t afford coverage and wait until they’re in crisis to seek medical attention.
“This isn’t like an abstract policy concept,” Plumb said. “It’s what we see on the faces of patients every shift.” 
Sen. Ron. Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, foresees ripple effects. Even those insured through their jobs, not the Affordable Care Act, could see their rates go up due to cost shifting, Wyden said. 
Some Republicans, including Utah Sen. John Curtis, have said the enhanced credits were meant to be a short-term solution during the COVID-19 pandemic and keeping them in place could add to rising health care costs. 
“A lot of Republicans are very sympathetic to increasing premiums. We’d love to have a discussion about that,” Curtis told reporters last month. But he does not believe the current enhanced subsidies should continue for those at four times the poverty level, he said – $63,600 for an individual; $128,600 for a household of four. 
Utah Republican Rep. Mike Kennedy, a physician, told reporters on Monday that he wants to see the premium increases discussed in Congress, but blamed Senate Democrats for not opening the government first.
“To me, this is an essential issue for us to work through, and I’m committed to understanding how important these premium increases are to people,” Kennedy said. “Not to negate the issue, but as we debate and discuss that issue, if you would like to tell me why five Democrats aren’t willing to open up the Senate side of the government, and then we can have these discussions.”
Klobuchar said the COVID-19 pandemic did drive up medical costs, and “our job is to make this affordable, and it’s not affordable when the premiums double.”
With a monthly average tax credit of $463, the monthly average marketplace plan premium for Utah residents is $70, according to a report from the University of Utah’s Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute.

Without an extension of enhanced tax credits for the Affordable Care Act, Alabamians will see a surge in premium costs.(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)Alabamians could see major surges in the cost of Affordable Care Act (ACA) plans without enhanced tax credits for ACA premiums, which lie at the center of the federal government shutdown. 
According to a report from KFF, a nonprofit health policy research organization, ACA premiums are estimated to increase 114% on average nationwide. 
An analysis by KFF found that most of ACA enrollees live in Republican Congressional districts and in states won by President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election. In Alabama, about 478,000 people, about 9.3% of the population, get insurance through the Affordable Care Act.  
The number is about 10.5% in Alabama’s 1st Congressional District, represented by Barry Moore, R-Enterprise, and in the 2nd Congressional District, represented by Shomari Figures, D-Mobile. 
Debbie Smith, the director of Alabama Arise’s initiative Cover Alabama, said in an interview Wednesday that while a 114% increase is the average, she has heard from Alabamians whose monthly premiums will increase by 980%.
“We also have someone who reported in from DeKalb County that her current premium is $35.33 and it will go up to $343 in 2026,” she said. “Almost 10 times the amount.”
She said another ACA participant in Geraldine, also in DeKalb County, who works at a small business will have a $636 monthly premium. In 2025, it was $363 per month.
For the most part, ACA enrollees in Alabama are employed, but their employers don’t offer insurance. Some are older enrollees who are not eligible for Medicare yet. She said the yearly premium for a 60-year-old couple making $85,000 per year will increase from $7,000 to $32,000 per year. 
“That’s insane, $7,000 to $32,000, you might as well not even have health coverage at that point. And I’d say that’s a pretty moderate income for a household of two,” Smith said. “So where else are these individuals supposed to go?”
The tax credit that Democrats in Congress want to keep allows anybody to purchase health care through the government. It was established by Democrats in 2021 as part of a  COVID-19 relief package, and was extended in 2022 through the Inflation Reduction Act. They are set to expire at the end of 2025.
The possible loss of the premiums are at the heart of the federal government shutdown that began in early October. Republicans, who do not have the votes to overcome a Senate filibuster, want to pass a budget bill. Democrats said they will not pass a bill without an extension of the credits. Republicans say they will not discuss extensions until a budget bill is in place.
The tax credits currently allow those enrollees to have no premium in a silver plan, which has “moderate” deductibles, according to healthcare.gov. Smith said that 252,644 Alabamians fall in this category, about half of all Alabamians enrolled in the ACA.
“A lot more people being uninsured like that is not good for, obviously the people who are impacted, who don’t have access to healthcare, being able to see a doctor when they want to, but also for the system as a whole,” Smith said.
Without the enhanced tax credits, only Americans who make less than 400% of the federal poverty level will be able to purchase coverage. That is an annual income of about $62,600 for an individual and $106,600 for a family of three.
While Cover Alabama does not keep track of how many Alabamians enrolled in Obamacare make less than 400% of the poverty level, Smith said she is more concerned about those who make between 100% and 138%.
“If they lived in a different state, they would be on Medicaid. Since we haven’t expanded Medicaid, healthcare.gov, fills in the gaps for us big time,” Smith said.

Padilla elects not to run for governor, leaving a cloudy field of candidates",Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/11/senator-padilla-run-for-governor/,Sen. Alex Padilla joins other prominent people who elected to not seek California's highest office. Now there's no clear frontrunner — so far.,"In 362 days California voters will choose a new governor. That’s just around the corner in political terms, given the expense and organizational lift a statewide campaign requires in the nation’s most populous state.
The winner almost certainly will be — as certain as anything in politics can be — a Democrat. If nothing else, the passage of Proposition 50, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s mid-decade congressional district gerrymander, confirms anew that California is a one-party state.
But which Democrat?
As the 2026 election cycle gears up — candidates can start filing paperwork next month — the field of would-be successors to Newsom is becoming even cloudier.
U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, who political media had been portraying as leaning toward running for governor, abruptly dropped out of consideration Tuesday during a Washington press conference to discuss the federal government shutdown.
“It is with a full heart and even more commitment than ever that I am choosing to not run for governor of California next year,” Padilla said. “I choose not just to stay in the Senate, I choose to stay in this fight.”
Had he opted-in, Padilla would have been the immediate frontrunner. By opting-out, he adds himself to the list of seemingly heavyweight contenders who decided governing California isn’t an attractive career move.
Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis was the first to go, dropping out in August, four months after announcing her candidacy. She was followed by former Vice President Kamala Harris, who wrote a book to explain how she failed to win the presidency last year. Toni Atkins, former president pro tem of the state Senate, also exited, acknowledging she probably couldn’t succeed.
Padilla’s decision leaves a handful of announced Democratic hopefuls still running, but none with anything close to dominant status, along with a few more potentials who have yet to declare one way or the other.
Of those who have announced, former Congresswoman Katie Porter had an early lead in polling, although under 20% support, but she was heavily damaged when videos surfaced of her harsh reaction to a reporter’s question and snapping at one of her staffers. Porter apologized but the incidents undermined her likeability, no small thing in political terms. 
At the moment, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former Attorney General and Biden cabinet member Xavier Becerra seem to have the best prospects among the declared candidates, but once again we’re waiting for other potential candidates to get in or get out.
All eyes are on businessman Rick Caruso, who’s weighing whether to seek the governorship or run again for mayor of Los Angeles. He lost his first mayoral bid to Karen Bass, but her popularity has waned due to her handling of the city’s disastrous fires.
Austin Beutner, a businessman and former superintendent of Los Angeles Unified School District, has already declared that he’ll challenge Bass, which puts some pressure on Caruso to make his intentions known.
Wealthy investor Tom Steyer, who ran for president in 2020, pumped millions of dollars into his own campaign for Proposition 50, sparking speculation he might run for governor.
Caruso and Steyer could easily finance campaigns for governor, freeing themselves from the chore of raising money and thus incurring political debts to supporters. That alone would make them viable candidates.
Former state Controller Betty Yee and Tony Thurmond, the state superintendent of schools, are still declared candidates but don’t appear to be gaining traction.
Finally, there’s some buzz in political media about Bay Area Congressman Eric Swalwell, after one private poll included his name.
Until the field becomes clearer, political media, would-be campaign contributors and California voters will just have to twiddle their thumbs.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/092425_Padilla-SD-Court_AH_CM_06.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-06 08:17:08.918036

Joe Lombardo. (Photo: Richard Bednarski/Nevada Current)Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo is slated to attend a $5,000-a plate fundraiser in his honor Thursday in Washington, D.C., as close to half a million Nevadans struggle to make do with a fraction of federal food assistance benefits, another 100,000 face the prospect of unaffordable health insurance, and an unknown number lose jobs or go unpaid as a result of the federal government shutdown. 
President Donald Trump and Senate Republicans have refused to negotiate with Senate Democrats, who have thus far held fast against passing a continuing resolution to reopen the government unless Republicans negotiate a plan to address skyrocketing Affordable Care Act premiums. Expanded premium tax credits that previously made policies affordable are set to expire at the end of the year, leaving some with lower credits and higher premiums, while others lose eligibility for the subsidy. 
Nevadans who get their health care through the ACA could see premiums increase by 26%, though Democrats as well as industry researchers warn the additional costs will be much higher for many people if they no longer receive enhanced premium tax credits. A 60 year-old couple in Nevada could see annual premiums rise by $18,100, the New York Times reported last month.
In addition to curtailed food assistance programs and rising costs, Nevada is confronting other economic headwinds, including visitation to Las Vegas plunging 8.8% in September, the ninth straight month of declines this year. Would-be tourists are contending with uncertainty as industry and government officials juggle a barrage of presidential edicts, including aggressive immigration enforcement actions, and shutdown fallout, such as a shortage of air traffic controllers.
Last week, Trump directed the government to renew nuclear weapons testing, which took place for decades at the Nevada Test Site, just 65 miles from Las Vegas. Lombardo, who said last year he opposed revived testing, has not commented on Trump’s directive.
Lombardo’s office did not respond when asked whether the governor considered cancelling his fundraiser in light of challenges facing Nevadans. 
Special session looms
The governor’s trip comes amid criticism from members of Nevada’s congressional delegation and State Treasurer Zach Conine regarding Lombardo’s response to the loss of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program funds, and as state lawmakers wait to learn when he will schedule an anticipated special session of the Nevada Legislature, and whether augmenting SNAP will be on the agenda. 
Attorney General Aaron Ford, a contender in the Democratic primary for governor, joined other Democratic attorneys general in suing the Trump administration for suspending SNAP payments, and won. 
Ford’s campaign declined to comment on Lombardo’s trip to D.C. 
Invitation to Lombardo fundraiser.
“Lombardo is doing exactly what we’ve learned to expect from him in this moment of crisis. He’s gone and kissing Trump’s ring,” Washoe County Commission Chairperson Alexis Hill, who is also running in the Democratic primary race for governor, said via text. “This state needs leadership. There’s no place I’d rather be than serving my community in Nevada.” 
There was no indication Lombardo was expected to see Trump while in Washington.
It’s the second time in recent months that Lombardo has put critical state business on the back burner and prioritized his reelection effort over an emergency. 
In August, the governor missed the first news conference on a cyberattack of state computer systems and the resulting shutdown of state government offices to attend a campaign event in Elko. Some government services were disrupted for weeks.    
‘Problem-solving outsiders’
“I sure hope the people of Clark County know how hard I’m working,” then-Sheriff Lombardo told the Current in 2022 when he was running for governor. A review of data from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department at the time indicated Lombardo was showing up at the office roughly three times a week over a 14-month period, from Jan. 1, 2021 through March 25, 2022, during his first campaign for governor. 
Lombardo, who generally mentions Washington D.C. only to note its tangled bureaucracy, is being hosted at an undisclosed location by former Republican Governors Association Executive Director Phil Cox, according to an invitation provided to the Current.  
Cox, who has led numerous Republican campaigns, is an opponent of expanded Medicaid, and as head of the RGA, opposed the Affordable Care Act and issued statements from Republican governors in opposition. 
In 2013, Cox told The Hill a then-ongoing federal government shutdown “is giving Republican governors with White House ambitions a new opportunity to burnish their credentials as problem-solving outsiders armed with solutions to Washington’s dysfunction.”
Last year, Cox began a leadership role at America PAC, which was founded and funded by Elon Musk to support Trump’s 2024 campaign to the tune of $250 million.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/pondrous-joe-1024x731.jpg,,,2025-11-06 08:17:08.918036

Lawmakers said that Tuberville is politicizing the situation, while also faulting Republicans for enacting laws that made the city more vulnerable to violent crime, particularly gun violence.
“Cities are not ‘war zones,’” said Rep. Kenyatte Hassell, D-Montgomery, in an interview on Monday. “It is an injustice to say that about any of our cities. We have working-class citizens who work in the city every day. I live in Montgomery. I don’t hear gun shots every day.”

Alabama’s senior senator made the remarks in a video released on Oct. 27, referencing a mass shooting that left two people dead and 12 injured.
“We are not a third world country,” Tuberville said in the video. “But Montgomery has been turned into a war zone. We must take ACTION to keep Alabamians safe.”
In the video Tuberville also said that “residents need to feel safe in our capital city, and right now that is not the case.” He then said he would help make the downtown area a “safe zone.”
The senator has had a history of making inflammatory and racist statements.
In 2022, he compared the descendants of those who were once enslaved to criminals. Earlier this year, Tuberville said in an interview that he would allow President Donald Trump latitude for his actions he wants to take against metropolitan areas that attract immigrants.
“‘President Trump can do anything he wants when it comes to the federal,” he said in an interview in June. “Again, these inner-city rats, they live off the federal government. And that’s one reason we’re $37 trillion in debt.’”
About two weeks earlier at a Montgomery Area Chamber of Commerce event, Tuberville said he had received notice from Kash Patel, the director of the FBI, that additional FBI agents would be deployed to Montgomery.
“They will not be noticeable,” he said in an interview with the media following his speech. “There will be more investigative people, people coming in and backing up local law enforcement. They have done that in several cities; it is nothing new.”
Alabama has some of the nation’s highest mortality rates from firearms. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 1,300 people died from gunfire in 2023, a rate of 25.6 per 100,000 that was the fourth-highest in the nation. The total number of gun deaths in Alabama was higher than in New York State, which has four times Alabama’s population.
Cities such as Montgomery, along with Birmingham and others, continue to deal with persistent crime, particularly with incidents that involve firearms. Democrats point to some of the laws enacted by the Legislature that made the state more vulnerable to gun violence.
In 2022, lawmakers repealed a law requiring Alabamians to purchase permits to carry a concealed weapon. Law enforcement said it endangered and have since lost a key source of revenue used for training and to buy equipment.
Republican lawmakers said they passed the legislation because residents should not have to pay for their constitutional right to carry a firearm.
“When you stop politicizing an issue, you can start to focus on what the major problem is, and if you talk to most law enforcement who are responsible for patrolling our streets, they will you the streets got much less safer once we passed permit less-carry because it became very difficult to differentiate who can legally carry and who can’t,” said Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, said in an interview on Monday.
In the spring, Republicans in the statehouse passed a series of measures that eliminated bail and enhanced penalties for people who were allegedly involved in crimes that involve firearms.

Councilor Ed Flynn, who represents a section of the city that includes the vulnerable Seaport district along with other coastal parts of the South End, introduced the nonbinding resolution to push for financial relief for homeowners, renters, and businesses with flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program.  
CommonWealth Beacon reported last week that Boston missed a 2021 self-imposed deadline to join FEMA’s Community Rating System program, which rewards flood insurance policyholders with discounts on their premiums in communities that are taking proactive steps to minimize flood risk above and beyond minimum national standards.  
The result since the city missed that goal four years ago: The 5,770 Boston residents and businesses insured through the NFIP have paid at least $785,000 in total unnecessary flood insurance costs, according to state data analyzed by CommonWealth Beacon.  
It’s a substantial financial blow amid high costs of living statewide exacerbated by the increasing precipitation and sea level rise caused by climate change. As more catastrophic storms occur, more Massachusetts residents are purchasing flood insurance.   
Chris Osgood, director of Boston’s office of climate resilience, previously told CommonWealth Beacon that the city has not yet joined the program because of the administrative burdens associated with applying, a perceived barrier shared by several other municipalities and floodplain management experts. Joining the Community Rating System requires robust documentation of construction certificates of buildings in the floodplain and developing a plan to address “repetitive loss” properties.  
Flynn said in a statement that he heard “serious concerns” from his constituents about the city’s failure to apply to FEMA’s Community Rating System program and how that “inaction has left residents prone to higher flood insurance premiums.”  
“It was critical that City Council spoke in one voice today – to say that Boston needs to make this a top priority, and potentially save millions of dollars for policyholders,” he said. “A difficult application process is no excuse for us to delay certification any longer, especially with rising costs for those living in the flood map.” 
Boston isn’t alone. Just 22 municipalities in Massachusetts are enrolled in CRS and receiving flood insurance discounts. Nationwide, only 1,700 communities have joined the program out of 22,600 municipalities that could participate. Coastal cities in New England like Portland, Maine, and New Haven, Connecticut, are participating in CRS.  
Boston plans to apply to join CRS next year, Osgood said.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240925_143408-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-06 07:56:23.761921

(Photo: Getty Images)Moapa residents opposing a planned mine and cement manufacturing facility in the area were handed a win Tuesday after the Clark County Planning Commission unanimously voted to deny a plan to rezone hundreds of acres of residential and agricultural land to industrial use.
The Moapa Valley quarry and cement plant project, proposed by Utah-based Bridgesource, would cover nearly 2,200 acres of private and public land east of the unincorporated town of Moapa located about 50 miles northwest of Las Vegas.
Bridgesource is seeking to rezone about 380 acres of recently acquired private land from agricultural and residential use to heavy industrial use. The zoning change would clear the way for a cement plant to be built within four miles of roughly 500 homes, two elementary schools, and two community parks and recreation facilities in Moapa. 
The company is also looking to build a limestone mine on about 200 acres of public land near Moapa in order to supply the raw materials needed to produce cement at the planned facility. Bridgesource said they expect the limestone deposit at the site to provide enough material to last up to 80 years. 
All seven members of the Clark County Planning Commission voted to deny Bridgesource’s application to make changes to the county’s Comprehensive Master Plan that would redesignate the area for industrial purposes.

While the vote was a welcome development for residents of Moapa who oppose the project, it’s not the end for the project. 
The Board of Clark County Commissioners – who also serve as the Zoning Commission – could overrule the Planning Commission’s vote when they meet on December 3rd.
Merrill Squire, the director of project development for Bridgesource,  also said the company was open to building the cement plant on public land, which would not require a zoning change.
The Clark County Planning Commission vote came after more than two hours of testimony from Moapa residents who overwhelmingly opposed the project, citing fears of air pollution, noise, and the facility’s proximity to residential neighborhoods. 
During public comments, Moapa residents argued the land use amendments and rezoning changes to the county’s Master Plan sought by Bridgesource were inconsistent with the plan’s goals and standards.
“This is probably the largest and most organized objection to an application that I’ve seen,” said Clark County Planning Commissioner Michael Roitman.
Moapa residents said they feared potential adverse health effects from dust and other air pollutants that would be generated from both the mine and the cement plant. Residents argued the project would degrade the community and natural environment by building a massive industrial project in the midst of their rural agricultural community.
Residents also raised concerns about the impact the mine and cement plant would have on water in the area. The project would be adjacent to the Muddy River, often considered the lifeblood of Moapa Valley and a Nevada tributary to the Colorado River.
During public comments, the Sierra Club highlighted the project’s potential negative impacts on endangered species like the desert tortoise and the Virgin River chub, urging a delay in zoning changes until a full environmental impact assessment is completed under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).
Since the proposed limestone mine would be on public land it will need to undergo a strict environmental review process under NEPA.
“I am moved by the concern for the heritage and the environment,” Roitman said. “I’m also skeptical that folks want to build a community around a cement plant and a mine.”
Squire, the director of project development for Bridgesource, argued the cement plant and limestone mine would create economic development for the rural community. The plant is expected to employ 150-200 full-time workers and generate $10 million in tax revenue annually for the first 10 years, said Squire.
Clark County Planning Commissioners said while they don’t oppose mining or industrial development in the Moapa Valley, they questioned the location of the project.
Squire said the company chose the location because it has large quantities of chemical-grade limestone the company has mining rights to, and easy access to a major highway and rail infrastructure.
“Every good job is important, but I don’t think that 100 jobs, or 150 jobs, would outweigh the opposition that I’ve seen here tonight,” Roitman said. “This seems kind of like a raw deal for them, even though it may be a good deal for the applicant.”
The Moapa Band of Paiutes also expressed concerns about the lack of an environmental review and tribal consultation for the project. Ivan Reel, the chairman of Moapa Band of Paiutes, asked the Clark County Planning Commission to deny Bridgesource’s application after the company failed to consult the tribe. 
Squire said the company reached out to more than a dozen tribes in the area, four of which helped advise a cultural survey of the area.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2155895591-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-06 07:56:23.761921

The ordinance, proposed by Mayor Shelley Berkley and Councilwoman Nancy Brune, prohibits the sale of dogs, cats, rabbits, pot belly pigs, and guinea pigs. 
“Pet stores have a well-documented track record of mistreating animals and selling unhealthy pets to unsuspecting customers,” Nevada Treasurer Zach Conine wrote to the council. “Additionally, animal shelters face an overcrowding crisis and are at risk of euthanizing animals for space.”
Nevada Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Executive Director Lori Heeren, a privately funded no-kill shelter, told the Council that on Tuesday, the organization had to stop accepting dogs for lack of space. 
The NSPCA website, she said, has “lots of breeds, including purebred dogs and puppies. We literally have people turn puppies into our shelters with their receipts, including receipts from Pet Land, because the puppy has grown up,” and the owner lacks the resources to care for it.  
 Chris Giunchigliani, who formerly served in the state Legislature and on the Clark County Commission, reminded the council that its predecessors passed a ban on pet sales, only to rescind it a year later. 
“All of the jurisdictions have increased animals coming into shelters and rescues from illegal breeders, causing taxpayers and animal rights people to bear the burden of paying for the inaction,” she said, adding that illegal puppy mills are operating in Nye and Elko counties. “You could liken it to human trafficking, only it’s with animals.”
Giunchigliani suggested that in the next three years, the city obtain addresses of local breeders that provide animals to pet stores. 
“I’m a second generation small business owner, and I don’t feel comfortable, and I don’t think it’s the proper role of government to unilaterally take business licenses away,” said Councilwoman Francis Allen Palenske, one of two council members to vote against the measure. 
The other member to vote against the measure, Councilman Brian Knudsen, suggested the proposed regulation “would probably put several of the businesses in my ward out of business.”  He argued existing pet stores should be permanently allowed to sell pets. “I haven’t taken money from anybody. I asked my veterinarian what I should do.” 
Knudsen did not respond when asked to identify his veterinarian. 
A proposed state law to ban the sale of pets died in the Nevada Legislature this year. The lobbyist representing the pet stores that opposed the ban was Alisa Nave, whose family business owns more than a dozen veterinary practices in Southern Nevada.
Berkley, who was praised by her colleagues for gaining majority support on a contentious issue, apologized for not achieving a unanimous vote. 
“I kind of feel I let everybody down by not working harder to make this more palatable for every member of the city council,” she said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/beagle-in-research-lab.png.avif,,,2025-11-06 07:56:23.761921

(Anne-Marie Caruso | New Jersey Monitor)Hudson County’s GOP leader said it was on Saturday when he started to believe Republicans might lose the governor’s race.
That was the first of November, the day people normally would have started receiving their monthly food stamp benefits — benefits cut off by the ongoing federal government shutdown. Jose Arango, the Hudson County Republican Party chairman, said he grew worried then that voters who helped propel Donald Trump to the White House again last year wouldn’t be as energized to vote for the GOP this time around.
“I started feeling a twist on the community, the Spanish community. And when I saw that, we couldn’t stop it — the car had already left the station, we were where we were, and it was something we couldn’t control,” he said. “The Republican Party in New Jersey couldn’t control what was going on in Washington.”
Republicans grappling with the dismal results of their party in Tuesday’s gubernatorial election told the New Jersey Monitor that the outcome says less about Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli than it does about the national political climate. Ciattarelli, a former assemblyman, was handily defeated by Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill (D), 56% to 43%.
“We were outplayed,” said Sen. Mike Testa (R-Cumberland).
A referendum on Trump
The ongoing federal government shutdown, the longest in the nation’s history, hung heavily over the race in the last month, as did other actions by the Trump administration.

Ciattarelli, who maintained some distance from the president in past bids, broadly refused to criticize Trump as he ran for governor for a third time. During a debate with Sherill, Ciattarelli was asked to grade Trump and gave him an “A.” Democrats seized on that moment.
Sen. Vince Polistina (R-Atlantic) noted his county is home to a federal military base, and families impacted by the shutdown are anxious about the economy. He said New Jersey’s rejection of Ciattarelli was not only a referendum on Republicans, but a message to federal leaders not to create hardships for people, “from a health care perspective or food insecurity.”
“Clearly, the electorate spoke and blamed Republicans, and we took a beating for it,” he said.
Some Republicans were blunter in their analysis.
“This was a referendum on Donald Trump and the reaction in New Jersey, a blue state, to Donald Trump, and since Jack was 100% MAGA, he was part of the referendum on Trump,” said Sen. Jon Bramnick (R-Union), a moderate and frequent Trump critic who was among Ciattarelli’s rivals for the GOP gubernatorial nod. “Things aren’t very complicated in politics sometimes.”
Assemblyman Brian Bergen (R-Morris), a conservative member of the lower chamber, said it appears voters this year cared more about what Trump is doing than what’s happening in New Jersey. He cited Trump’s push to demolish the east wing of the White House to build a ballroom and the president pulling funding for the Gateway project, which Bergen said happened at “the most untimely time for our election.”
“I’m getting the sense from everybody that, more or less, it’s directly connected to that type of stuff,” Bergen said. “And it has very little to do with anything happening in New Jersey, to be honest, and that sucks.”
Ciattarelli should have praised Trump where their platforms overlapped and split on policy where he disagreed, said Bramnick. Not doing so risked straining voters’ credulity or alienating them altogether.
Bramnick noted that during a GOP gubernatorial debate earlier this year, his opponents competed to be the candidate who loves Trump the most.
“I sat there while everybody was saying that they couldn’t find anything that they disagree with the president. I said, ‘Look, nobody believes that,’” Bramnick said. “People want authenticity. Authenticity is sometimes you disagree.”

Testa disagrees that Trump shoulders the blame for Tuesday’s results. After endorsing Trump in the GOP primary, Trump did not appear in New Jersey for any general election campaign events, Testa noted. But Democrats had a better message about the government shutdown than Republicans, he added.
Republicans have sought to reopen the federal government without addressing a spike in health care costs caused by the lapse of federal subsidies for plans purchased on the individual marketplace. Democrats have argued that any budget measure that would end the shutdown should include those subsidies.
The lapse in federal funding for food stamps, in particular, hurt Republicans, according to Testa. Trump has said he won’t tap into an emergency fund to pay out food stamp benefits until the shutdown ends.
“Nobody wants to hear about children potentially going hungry without food, without proper nutrition,” Testa said.
Testa blames GOP consultants on the Ciattarelli campaign for missing a swell of anti-Trump voters coming to the polls, saying bad data enabled ineffective messaging.
“The Republican consultant class in the state of New Jersey, particularly those who were working on this campaign, should never be hired again in the state of New Jersey,” he said.
Moving on
Ciattarelli’s loss was not the only bad news for the GOP on Tuesday. Sherrill’s win helped flip a handful of Assembly seats now held by Republicans, giving Democrats an even firmer grasp on the 80-seat body come January.
Sen. Doug Steinhardt, Warren County’s Republican chairman and a former state GOP chair, said the party failed to energize GOP voters who rarely turn out to vote, including in the 23rd Legislative District, which Steinhardt represents. The district is a conservative area in the northwestern part of the state.
Democrats have not won a legislative race in the 23rd since the 1970s, and though results there were not especially close Tuesday, Republicans’ margin of victory was less than half of what it was in almost every race since at least 2009.

“Speaking for my own county — and I was critical of it last night and again this morning — we didn’t do as good a job as our Democratic counterparts making sure our low-propensity voters were getting to the polls,” he said.
Testa said New Jersey Republicans need to unite around a better message, but it’s too early to say what that message is. Bergen said his party needs to improve on protecting itself from “external factors.”
“We need to build a strong foundation within our party where we’re trusted and people will err on the side of going with us even if crazy sh*t’s happening in the world,” he said.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Secretary Julie Moore and Commissioner Kerrick Johnson: Vermont’s housing needs require decisive action, so step up or step away.","This commentary is by Julie Moore, secretary of the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, and Kerrick Johnson, commissioner of the Vermont Department of Public Service.


Vermont faces a housing crisis that threatens our economic future and the ability of working families to remain in our state. The cost of housing has skyrocketed with median home prices in Vermont more than doubling in the last 10 years, putting both homeownership and rentals out of reach for many. Vermont needs 30,000 new homes by 2030, requiring 8,000 units per year for the next four years. At current rates, we’ll struggle to hit even 25% of that goal.
In response, Gov. Phil Scott recently issued a housing executive order that directs a set of measured yet impactful steps to accelerate housing development timelines and reduce costs.
The governor’s executive order doesn’t eliminate regulatory review or ignore legitimate concerns. It balances the need for affordability with environmental objectives for housing projects in areas identified for development. These are modest, commonsense reforms designed to provide regulatory certainty, moving projects more quickly from planning to construction while maintaining needed protections.

Sadly, if predictably, a number of environmental interest groups and other groups have responded with reflexive opposition.
In voicing their opposition to the executive order, environmental advocacy groups have offered no actionable alternatives. They haven’t proposed how to accelerate permitting while maintaining protections. They haven’t suggested which regulations could be modernized or consolidated. They haven’t identified specific areas where housing could be fast-tracked. Instead, they’ve defaulted to criticism without contribution — the easiest position to maintain and the least helpful for Vermonters struggling to find housing.
This matters because housing isn’t an abstract policy debate. These are real problems affecting our neighborhoods, communities, businesses and schools. It’s about whether a teacher can afford to live in the community where they work. It’s about whether a young couple can start a family here instead of moving to New Hampshire or North Carolina. It’s about whether businesses, from the smallest engineering firm to the general store to our beloved universities are able to thrive right here in Vermont.
Without housing, we cannot recruit and retain staff for our nursing homes, clinics and hospitals as there simply aren’t places for them to live.
Yet in the face of the governor’s modest but concrete measures that should reduce the cost and speed the timeline for constructing homes, these interest groups retreat to familiar talking points and procedural objections. Their response reveals an uncomfortable truth: their real interests lie in preserving the existing regulatory barriers rather than meaningful problem-solving.
This dynamic exemplifies what Ezra Klein, an award-winning columnist with the New York Times, explored in his recent work on abundance: our regulatory systems have become so byzantine, so weighted toward one-off objections and appeals rather than progress, that we actively obstruct the very things we claim to want most.
We say we need affordable housing, then create endless opportunities for delay. We claim we want walkable downtowns and community schools filled with children, and then make land-use policies that limit density and put homeownership out of reach for young families. We declare climate emergencies, then enact policies without regard for the cost of implementation. We bemoan economic stagnation, then strangle development with process.
Within the broader environmental community there is clear expertise and legitimate perspectives. But expertise wielded not to provide constructive input and alternatives but to instead assert picayune process objections is mere obstruction.
Vermont needs an abundance agenda — one that recognizes we can protect our environment while building the housing our communities desperately need. We can say yes to appropriate development while conserving what makes Vermont special. But this requires solving problems rather than simply scoring political points.
To the environmental groups criticizing this executive order: please show us your plan. Tell us how you would accelerate housing production. Identify specific regulatory reforms you support. If you cannot or will not, then most Vermonters will understand your opposition for what it really is — political theater performed at the expense of working families searching for places to live and businesses struggling to bring new hires to the state.
Gov. Scott has taken action. We stand ready to implement solutions. The question now is whether environmental interest groups who claim to care about Vermont’s future will contribute to solving this crisis or perpetuate the status quo.

(Courtesy U.S. Forest Service)An analysis of U.S. Forest Service data by a wildland firefighter advocacy group shows that wildfire mitigation efforts in New Mexico— including prescribed burns and other hazardous fuel treatments—are down by 53% since President Donald Trump took office in January.
When compared to yearly averages over the Biden Administration, the data shows that the U.S. Forest Service is significantly behind on wildfire mitigation in the country’s national forests.
In 2023, for example, the federal government treated just under 203,000 acres of forest for flammable fuels ranging from dead trees and dried up brush to grasses and twigs in New Mexico alone. In 2025, that number dropped to just over 68,000.
“The reason we want to thin and prescribe burn and do the pile burning is because we want a healthy forest, and we want to keep it safe so we don’t lose so when there’s a fire, we don’t lose the entire forest,” said Bobbie Scopa, executive secretary of the advocacy group Grassroots Wildland Firefighters. Scopa also spent 45 years as a firefighter.
Overall, the advocacy group’s data analysis found that the crucial hazardous fuels reduction work done by the Forest Service was down 38% in 2025 compared with the same period over the previous four calendar years.
A crucial part of forest ecosystems, land managers use hazardous fuels reduction such as thinning and controlled burns to curb the severity and intensity of future forest fires that could spread to nearby communities.
In a letter to Democratic U.S. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon last month, U.S Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz blamed “operational challenges” for the lack of prescribed burn work, in addition to ongoing wildfires in both Canada and the U.S. as a drain on otherwise available resources.




Scopa told KUNM that there are other reasons for the dip – including the Trump administration’s aggressive downsizing of executive agencies in tandem with severe budget cuts and the ongoing government shutdown, which is now the longest in U.S. history.
That makes it highly unlikely that the Forest Service will make up this gap before the end of the year.
“It’s like a chess game, trying to manage to get the work done,” Scopa said.
However, Scopa notes that the current fuels work snafu is adding to an already existing 80 million-acre backlog of forest management projects, compounding a large problem with an increasingly diminishing workforce.
“They’re killing themselves. Literally,” Scopa said. “People are ending up in the hospital, not only from the smoke and ruining their joints from carrying weight up and down mountains, but dying from mental health issues because the pace of the work is unhealthy and unsustainable.”
The past few years have been an uphill battle for federal wildland firefighters, who only just recently won a yearslong fight for a permanent pay raise amid rampant issues with agency staffing, low morale, and non-existent protective equipment.
Additionally, these findings come as weather officials predict New Mexico might suffer from a drier and warmer winter as a consequence of the ongoing “weak” La Niña weather pattern, potentially extending this year’s fire season.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/fire-controlled-burns-u.s-forest-service.jpg,,,2025-11-06 07:20:34.607796

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Nuclear energy leaders from across the country and world converged on West Lafayette Wednesday to reenergize an industry they hope will meet booming energy needs.
“Now’s the time. Indiana is the place,” said Indiana Energy and Natural Resources Secretary Suzanne Jaworowski. The state is “ready, and willing, and able to deploy nuclear.”
She spoke on the first of a two-day Global Nuclear Energy Economic Summit at Purdue University’s Loeb Playhouse, which was the launchpad for a flurry of announcements.
There, AES Indiana President Brandi Davis-Handy announced the company — one of the state’s “big five” investor-owned electric utilities — would study the feasibility of building small modular reactors at its Eagle Valley and Petersburg power plants.

The analysis will look at licensing, construction and operations, she said, plus siting factors like how the population is distributed, whether there’s water nearby for cooling, if transmission infrastructure can handle the power generated and emergency planning considerations.
The study will “guide the selection of the most suitable site and provide a clear growth path for future progress,” Davis-Handy said. It’s expected to be done by mid-2026.
Nuclear isn’t part of AES Indiana’s “current preferred portfolio,” spokeswoman Mallory Duncan said in a statement to the Capital Chronicle, but “we remain open to considering it in the future if it becomes more economically viable and aligns with the best interests of our customers.”
First American Nuclear staff also flocked to the stage to celebrate Tuesday’s announcement that the company will site its headquarters, manufacturing facilities and a specialized energy park in Indiana. That park will be the first in the country to operate in “closed-fuel cycle,” meaning that spent nuclear fuel will be reprocessed and reused, according to FANCO.
Purdue also launched a new Institute for Energy Innovation and announced the nation’s first online credential program in small modular reactors. University President Mung Chiang further celebrated a research and development agreement with nuclear manufacturer BWX Technologies.

Chiang later joined Indiana Gov. Mike Braun to headline the summit with a “fireside” chat.
“I feel confident that, if we play our cards right, Indiana will be … first on SMRs, on having data centers without burdening the average taxpayer,” Braun said.
Nuclear development takes years to come to fruition.
A Boston University study found that runaway construction costs and delayed timelines stymie many energy projects.
Nuclear power plants are the worst offenders, with an average construction cost overrun typically twice as much as expected, and the most extreme time delays. To be exact, the average nuclear power plant has a construction cost overrun of 102.5% and ends up costing $1.56 billion more than expected.
Supply chain woes
Panelists repeatedly lauded Indiana’s approach to nuclear.
“It’s going to take a village to do what we’re talking about, and the village in Indiana is strong,” said Brendon Baatz, who works on energy market development at Google. 
He cited “strong state leadership,” supportive utility companies and a pipeline of nuclear engineers coming out of Purdue’s program.
A stunted supply chain could be among the industry’s greatest challenges.
“If there’s going to be a big problem with a project in the future, it’s going to be because of a failure in the supply chain,” said William Magwood IV, the director-general of the Nuclear Energy Agency. 
One supplier missing a deadline could cause a chain reaction, he said, and “that’s when we have these big overruns, and that’s when we cancel projects.”
For Theodore Garrish, the assistant secretary for nuclear energy at the U.S. Department of Energy, a nuclear reactor fuel crunch was top of mind.

He highlighted an ongoing shortage of high-assay low-enriched uranium. It’s set to worsen, as a ban on Russian uranium imports takes full effect in 2028.
“We have really relied, up to 25% in our country’s (uranium) enrichment, on the Russians. When this happens, we are going to have a huge gap that we’ve got to meet,” Garrish said. The federal government will soon award $2.7 billion to develop domestic production, he added.
Getting parts in on time is a “tightrope dance,” said Stephen McKinney, vice president for U.S. commercial operations at Westinghouse. The company is working with Google on an artificial intelligence-powered project to optimize when equipment is needed.
“If you’re waiting on a certain component to arrive at the site, you could have a large amount of labor sitting there,” he said, driving expenses higher.
Eric Williams, the executive vice president and chief operations officer at TerraPower, called for the country to bring back heavy manufacturing from overseas — and develop the American workforce’s skills and knowledge.

The months-long wait on equipment from Asia or Europe “does not fit into a tight schedule,” he said.
Speakers indicated the industry’s pause four decades ago — after the 1979 meltdown at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania and the 1986 explosion at Chernobyl nuclear plant in what’s now Ukraine — has limited American expertise.
Julie Bentz, a nuclear policy and safety adviser to FANCO, recalled graduating from college at a time when about 60 universities had affiliated research reactors. That dropped by half when she returned to university a decade later for graduate-level work.
“You have an unusual 20-year gap in this profession, and when we look at supply chain, that’s going to have an impact across every single component,” she said. Experts, for example, are typically either aged 60 and older or 40 and younger.

Tuesday Nov. 4, 2025. (Photo by Glen Stubbe/Minnesota Reformer)After growing up in foster care, Mary Davis extricated herself and her son from domestic abuse in Chicago and landed in a Minneapolis homeless shelter in 2011 — then quickly found stable housing and enrolled in support programs to receive a stable income and health care. 
“I had to grow up really quick…so that’s always been the way I looked at things — like, no one is going to care as deep as I care about what’s going on in my situation, so I have to get out there and get it,” Davis said. 
But the expiration of funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which helps Davis buy groceries for herself and her 15-year-old son, is testing the resiliency that helped Davis go from the shelter to stability. 
Davis gets $456 on an electronic benefits transfer card every month on the 10th, she said, and supplements the food she purchases through SNAP with trips to food shelves. Her only income is from Social Security — around $1,100 per month — because she is disabled; blind in one eye from domestic violence and diagnosed with several chronic health conditions. 
Davis’ son is on human growth hormones, so she’s trying to feed him plenty of nutritious food. SNAP helps her buy foods at the grocery store that are harder to come by at food shelves, like meat and produce.

The federal government shutdown means SNAP funding has run out. Democratic-led states and advocates have sued the Trump administration to pay out the benefits during the shutdown using emergency funds, and as part of the lawsuits the administration agreed to pay out partial benefits. 
But it’s not clear when the money will get to recipients — Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has said it could take “several weeks” to execute partial payments; the state Department of Children, Youth and Families said Tuesday it does not have a timeline. 
Around 440,000 Minnesotans rely on SNAP; 152,000 children are children, 72,000 are seniors and 52,000 are adults with disabilities. Nearly half of recipients live outside of the Twin Cities.
Davis doesn’t know when she’ll receive her next round of grocery money. Until then, she said, she’ll be looking for free food wherever she can get it — and is considering taking out loans or using risky “buy now, pay later” services to make ends meet. 
And she’ll pray about it. 
“Really that’s the only other option I have,” Davis said.

Food shelves already feeling the pressure
At the Neighborhood House food shelf on Montreal Ave. in St. Paul on Tuesday morning, families loaded carts with food and household items. It was much busier than usual.
For the first time since it opened in June of 2024, volunteers turned families away. There wasn’t enough food for everyone. 
“We have been anticipating this,” said Janet Gracia, president and CEO of Neighborhood House.
Demand at food shelves had already risen in the years following the COVID-19 pandemic, thanks to food inflation. Neighborhood House opened up the Montreal Avenue food market — its second location — and doubled the food budget over the year and a half it’s been open. 
That was all before the government shutdown and impact on SNAP.

The majority of the people served by Neighborhood House rely on SNAP benefits and have been using the food shelf to supplement their shopping, Gracia said. By early November, some Minnesotans were already missing their November credit; those who get their benefits later in the month may have already run out of their October credit.
Neighborhood House is expanding its hours and making emergency food bags available more frequently to its clients who need help.
“The people that you are seeing in our food markets right now…they already have empty shelves and empty pantries in their home,” Gracia said.
Moo Ehpaw is a 28-year-old mother of three who relies on SNAP and food shelves to feed her family. Her husband works at a turkey processing plant, and she stays home with their two-year-old.
She’ll be increasing her efforts to find free food when the benefits run out. 
“I think a lot of other people, they worry too…they are aware of the cuts that are happening,” Ehpaw said in Karen through an interpreter.
Language barriers can be an impediment to immigrants who are searching for food resources, said Mu Lweh, a St. Paul resident who also speaks Karen.

A nightmare for the state
A court order requiring the Trump administration to use emergency funds to pay out partial SNAP benefits isn’t likely to alleviate recipients’ hunger any time soon. 
Guidance sent to Minnesota and other states from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Tuesday outlines how states must implement the reduced benefits.
Recipients will receive a maximum of half their usual monthly benefits, but some new applicants may have 30% of their net household income deducted from their (already-reduced) credit amount, according to the guidance.
“It requires a complete recalculation and a complete recoding of our system,” said Tikki Brown, commissioner of the Department of Children, Youth and Families during a media briefing Tuesday.
DCYF employees are running through “a variety of solutions,” but the department doesn’t yet know when it will distribute the reduced benefits. 
“Initially we were hoping for the least burdensome, cleanest way for us to issue benefits, and unfortunately, the information that we received today is a really highly complex calculation,” Brown said.
(Complicating the situation: President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social after the USDA issued its guidance that SNAP benefits “will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government.”)

Democrats are refusing to vote for Republican-authored spending bills that would reopen the government unless the GOP includes extensions of subsidies that lower the cost of health insurance plans purchased on the Affordable Care Act marketplace. 
Davis, the single mom, blames Republicans for the SNAP predicament and shutdown. 
“I definitely get why [Democrats] are holding back. Like, it all goes together — if your health is not in order, none of it works,” Davis said.
This government shutdown is now the longest in history. There is still no end in sight.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/14-SNAP-1125-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-06 07:20:34.607796

“I didn’t know these people,” she said of festival performers that also included a klezmer band and Hawaiian falsetto singers, “but I’ll never forget them.”
Mayo, local manager for the 82nd National Folk Festival, wants fellow Jacksonians and capital city tourists to grab and take away the same thrill, surprise and bliss when the free, three-day festival takes over downtown Jackson Friday through Sunday. 
The National Council for the Traditional Arts partners with host communities, in this case the city of Jackson, to produce the National Folk Festival around the country, and this is the first one in the Deep South. 
“It’s like the festival is coming home,” council Executive Director Blaine Waide said, noting Mississippi artists’ frequent presence at different festivals it produces, and the state’s impact on American music and musical history. “It’s a really appropriate place to have the festival.”
Jackson remains the host city for the 83rd and 84th National Folk Festivals in 2026 and 2027, laying the groundwork for a locally produced festival after the three-year National Council for the Traditional Arts   residency ends. Ergon/Alliant is the presenting sponsor of the 82nd National Folk Festival.

Mississippi artists hold a vibrant role at this year’s festival as well, Those on the roster include Jackson blues icon Bobby Rush, Bentonia bluesman Jimmy “Duck” Holmes, Greenville blues musician Keith Johnson, Clarksdale’s James “Super Chikan” Johnson, Bay Springs Southern soul artist Ms. Jody, singer/guitarist Vasti Jackson of Hattiesburg and even the Sonic Boom of the South.
“At our event, we’ll have, obviously, what’s near and dear to us, which is the blues and gospel,” Mayo said, “and you’ll hear some new things like go-go music out of D.C., you’ll hear Irish fiddling, you’ll hear so many different types of music presented from world-class musicians.”
The National Folk Festival celebrates traditional arts — the music, dance and crafts of many different communities and cultures that may have roots in farflung places, but call America home. The knowledge, skill and artistic expression are passed down informally, through families and in community. 
“They’re key to identity,” Waide said. “When people think about, ‘Who am I? What defines me?’ it’s often those traditional expressions that have been passed down across generations.
“Folk and traditional arts isn’t just banjo and fiddle music,” he said. It is that, but it encompasses much more. The tremendous sweep of cultural expression enlivening the festival in Jackson also includes zydeco, salsa dura, South Asian qawwali (sung poetry, a meditative form of Islam), cowboy and western, trío romántico, Korean pungmul, flamenco, Cabo Verdean (blend of African and Portuguese influences, familiar in New England), sacred steel gospel, klezmer, West African balafon and more.
“Absolutely amazing performers,” Waide pegged them. “People are going to come to this festival because they want to see Bobby Rush, or they’re going to come to see Ms. Jody or E.U., and they’re going to walk away, going, like, ‘Holy crap, I didn’t know Korean percussion and dance was so cool.’” Many of the artists perform multiple times over the three days.
The closest equivalent to the National Folk Festival is probably Jubilee! JAM, the large-scale, ticketed music festival with a family-friendly, all-ages appeal in downtown Jackson that took place from the late 1980s through early 2000s. Notable differences: the National Folk Festival is free, and it has no “headliners,” or at least performers touted as such.
“The festival is the star,” Waide said, emphasizing that the event’s rich and varied cultures and sheer range of artistic expression constitute its primary draw. “It’s not about elevating any one artist over other artists. There are no headliners, there’s no main stage. It’s about experiencing the whole thing.
“The message is that these folks are all around us, that this level of artistry and creativity across different cultural communities is there in America and it’s a chance to celebrate and honor that.”
The festival presents a chance to riff on that, too, as artists come together and creative sparks fly. Mayo recalled the magical synergy that bubbled up among a zydeco singer, blues band and Beat Ya Feet dancers at one festival, “And, it was one of the wildest things that I’ve ever experienced!” she said with a happy laugh. “You’ll never see that again.”
The National Folk Festival is free to make it accessible and set in downtown Jackson to make it centrally located.
“There’s the symbolic idea of the public square, and welcoming everybody in that space and offering a program that is as representative as possible so that everybody there feels that it belongs to them,” Waide said. 
The pedestrian-only festival site stretches from State Street to Farish Street, and Pascagoula Street to Yazoo Street, with six outdoor stages and a dance pavilion. Concrete barriers will prevent vehicular traffic on the site. Performers take to the streets, too, with Capitol at Congress a prime spot to catch them offstage, including krump dancing from Leaving Legacies in Jackson or New Orleans Black masking craftsman and stilt dancer Chief Shaka Zulu.

Parking options, free and paid, are available at downtown public parking decks and garages outside the festival site. Free festival parking is available at the southwest corner of the State Fairgrounds with a shuttle or walk to the festival site, as well as a free park-and-ride shuttle service from Smith-Wills Stadium.
Food and drink (soft drinks, lemonade, water, beer, seltzers, canned wine) will be for sale at the festival. Food selections, too, reflect a range of cultures, including Jamaican, Southern, barbecue, Mediterranean, Mexican, Colombian, fair food and more, with strong representation from local eateries (including Hen and Egg, Campbell’s Bakery, Hal & Mal’s, Green Ghost Tacos and Lee’s Heavenly BBQ & Soul Food).
A Festival Marketplace highlights traditional and contemporary handmade creations from state and regional artists and craftspeople, including quilts, pottery, jewelry, woodwork and more.
“One of the best parts about the festival is that it’s going to bring everyone together around the arts,” Mississippi Arts Commission Executive Director David Lewis said.
The festival welcomes cultural communities from across the nation to Jackson, plus showcases many right here in Mississippi, particularly in the City with Soul Mississippi Folklife Area and stage on the Old Capitol Green. This year’s “Legacies of Empowerment” theme ties into the centennial of the births of blues legend B.B. King and civil rights champion Medgar Evers. In addition to blues and gospel, hear hip hop, punk and Mexican huapango music, enjoy Choctaw social dancing and see demonstrations of pine needle and Choctaw basketry, and Super Chikan’s guitar-making skills.

“Visitors have an opportunity not only to learn from the artists, but also participate actively in creating something communally as part of the festival,” Kristen Brandt, the folk and traditional arts director at the Mississippi Arts Commission, said. Zinesters lead visitors in creating their own mini-magazines, for example.
The folklife focus also wraps in groups bound by community and culture that may surprise some to find at the arts-heavy festival, such as skateboarders with Skate Jackson, the Motor Mouse Motorcycle Club from Indianola and a fourth generation farming family from Sledge.
The “Legacies of Empowerment” theme echoes, too, in the Family Area in Smith Park, where children can make their own personalized little Lucilles in a nod to King’s famous guitar, and make-and-take buttons reminiscent of the civil rights movement. Traditional Choctaw games and crafts, animal ambassadors from the Mississippi Museum of Natural Science, family crest or flag making and storytelling, and Mississippi State University’s cyber-education team’s STEM trailer all entice engagement from the younger set. Performers such as the Acme Miniature Flea Circus, Leaving Legacies krump dancers and Vasti Jackson with his Soul of Jimmie Rodgers program keep steady entertainment on the park’s stage.
The National Folk Festival’s join-in fun hits its peak at the Welcome to Jackson Dance Pavilion where Pearl and State streets meet, music rules and feet move to klezmer and country western, go-go and zydeco and plenty more.
“That’s going to be the hot spot, the entire weekend,” Mayo said of the pavilion. “You can dance anywhere, but that’s where you learn and that’s where you can participate. There will always be some sort of music that will make you move your body at the dance tent.”
The event, built on partnerships, requires 800 to 1,000 volunteers for efficient operation in backstage support, beverage sales and transportation, and as artist ambassadors, members of the Bucket Brigade collecting donations to help keep the festival free, and more. 
“Really, the festival is about community engagement, civic participation and public service,” Waide said. “It takes the whole community to get behind it.” 
Mayo witnessed the strong, years-long family engagement at other festivals. 
“I talked to one daughter who started volunteering with her mom when she was 6. She’s 22 now, and that story’s not rare in the folk festival world. This is an opportunity for our families here … to build new traditions,” Mayo said.
Stakeholders see potential benefits stretching far beyond this weekend. 
“We have an opportunity to demonstrate to people what a wonderful place Jackson is. It’s not hard to find a lot of negative narratives about the city, but what gets missed is all the wonderful things that are in Jackson,” Jackson Redevelopment Authority Executive Director Christopher Pike said.
“I think it’s going to be a catalyst. You’re going to get people to come to Jackson who’ve never been to Jackson before, and they’re going to fall in love with the things that we have, that we do well here, and you might see other investments to come out of that.”

The initiative would broaden who pays to support conservation beyond just hunters, trappers and anglers. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department to pursue new ‘public access’ license amid ‘financial restructuring’.","The Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife’s workload has expanded in recent decades, and costs have risen, while a primary source of revenue — the sale of hunting, trapping and fishing licenses —  has declined.
Year after year, those trends make budgeting a difficult task. 
Now, the department is pursuing a financial restructuring and plans to push for a new license that would be required for anyone recreating on Fish and Wildlife land, according to its leaders. That new source of funding would include people like kayakers, birdwatchers and hikers, all of whom utilize wildlife management areas and boat launches.
“For the last hundred years, conservation has been paid for by hunters and trappers and anglers,” Andrea Shortsleeve, the department’s chief of operations, said in an interview last week. “Now, (we’re) trying to get everyone else who is using and benefiting from those areas to also pay in.”
Amid historic cuts to federal funding, Vermont’s budget writers are anticipating tough choices this year for departments across state government.  
But Fish and Wildlife’s challenges predate the funding cuts from President Donald Trump’s administration and don’t just involve economic headwinds. 
The Fish and Wildlife Department’s more than $31 million annual budget draws on three roughly equal sources: federal funding, the state’s General Fund and department funds. The latter includes revenue sources like motorboat registrations, timber sales and license fees — which brought in about $7 million last year. 

Over time, that balance has shifted, with licenses and timber sales making up a smaller percentage, leading the department to rely more on the General Fund, the pot of money filled by state taxes.
Despite occasional spikes, annual sales of hunting, trapping and fishing licenses have been on the decline in Vermont for decades. At the same time, lifetime licenses of different types have become increasingly popular, with one in five children born in Vermont receiving one. While that popularity raises money for the department, the funds sit in a special account and limit the number of people who pay annually. 
The worrying financial trends have forced the department to begin restructuring financially, Jason Batchelder, Fish and Wildlife commissioner, told VTDigger. With the help of consultants, the department will compare itself to its counterparts in peer states nationwide. The department is also soliciting bidders to complete a fish culture modernization study, which will recommend new efficiencies to the state’s hatchery system. 
As inflationary pressures on expenses like health care, vehicles and rent have outpaced revenues, Fish and Wildlife’s mission has changed, too. Rather than focusing solely on a handful of game species — deer, turkey and trout — the department’s mission has grown over decades to encompass the 45,000 species that inhabit Vermont and the public and private lands they call home.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fishing-access-4-20251104-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-11-06 07:20:34.607796

He is shown in a 2024 photo when he was a state senator (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).If Missouri’s newly gerrymandered congressional map makes it to the ballot next year, Republican Secretary of State Denny Hoskins wants to tell voters it “better reflects statewide voting patterns” and replaces a “gerrymandered” version that “protects incumbent politicians.”
Hoskins on Friday sent the proposed ballot language for a referendum petition to Republican Attorney General Catherine Hanaway, who must issue an opinion on the wording within 10 days. Unless it is changed, it will be challenged in court, said Richard von Glahn, director of People Not Politicians, which is seeking to put the new map on the statewide ballot next year.
“I don’t think this is going to pass the smell test on whether or not it’s accurate or unbiased or likely to create prejudice,” von Glahn said.
People Not Politicians has until Dec. 11 to submit petitions seeking a vote on the map approved in a September special legislative session. If there are enough signatures distributed among six of the state’s eight congressional districts, the map would not become effective until a statewide vote.
The language Hoskins proposed would read:
“Do the people of the state of Missouri approve the act of the General Assembly entitled ‘House Bill No. 1 (2025 Second Extraordinary Session),’ which repeals Missouri’s existing gerrymandered congressional plan that protects incumbent politicians, and replaces it with new congressional boundaries that keep more cities and counties intact, are more compact, and better reflects statewide voting patterns?”
Chiefs in, Royals out: Missouri secretary of state once again catches flak over ballot summary

If a court finds the language is insufficient or unfair, a new state law will give Hoskins three chances to revise it. If Hoskins strikes out on his three attempts, the courts can prepare a new ballot title. Earlier this year, Hoskins wrote two revisions for a constitutional amendment reinstating Missouri’s abortion ban before it was accepted by the courts. He’s also been accused of exploiting the new law to delay initiative petition campaigns.  
Statewide voting patterns in recent elections give Republicans about 60% of the vote and Democrats about 40%, von Glahn said. The new map would give Democrats 12.5% of the state delegation instead of one-quarter, he added.
“Maybe the secretary of state doesn’t understand the definition of the term gerrymandered,” he said.
Hoskins will not respond to von Glahn’s criticism due to the likely litigation, spokeswoman Rachael Dunn wrote in an email to The Independent. Hanaway’s job reviewing ballot language is “to ensure it is neither argumentative nor likely to create prejudice for or against the measure.”
At the insistence of President Donald Trump, Missouri lawmakers met over two weeks in September to redraw congressional districts so Republicans would have an advantage in elections for seven, instead of their current six, seats. The plan targeted the 5th District, held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City since 2005.
Lawsuits over the special session began before legislators started meeting and a case over the ballot title would add a new layer of litigation to the pending cases. 
There are three lawsuits — two in Jackson County and one in Cole County — asking the courts to declare lawmakers had no authority to revise district boundaries without new census data. The Cole County case is set for trial next week. 
In another case, also originating in Cole County, the Missouri NAACP asked the courts to declare that Gov. Mike Kehoe had no authority under the Missouri Constitution to call lawmakers into session for congressional redistricting and altering the majority needed to pass constitutional amendments proposed by initiative. 
Circuit Judge Christopher Limbaugh denied the request and the NAACP says it intends to appeal the ruling.
The referendum effort itself is the subject of two lawsuits, one in Cole County and another in federal court in St. Louis.
Arguments in the Cole County case, where People Not Politicians is suing over petitions rejected before Kehoe signed the bill, were postponed Monday due to a judge’s illness.
In the federal case, Hanaway argues that redistricting plans are not subject to referendums because the federal Constitution vests power to draw lines solely with legislatures, not the people of individual states. That case is set for trial Nov. 25 in St. Louis.
To succeed, a referendum petition must have at least 106,384 to 115,720 signatures from registered voters, depending on which six districts are used. On Wednesday, People Not Politicians said it had already exceeded 200,000 signatures.
Of that number, 92,000 are for a referendum proposal rejected by Hoskins as premature because it was submitted before Kehoe signed the redistricting bill on Sept. 28.
Gerrymandering is a word coined soon after the establishment of the U.S. Constitution to describe a district drawn to achieve a particular result. In the case of the map drawn during the special session, that result is to win a seat for the Republican Party.
Gerrymandering can also be used to prevent minority candidates from winning office or to preserve the power of political or economic interests. 
A map representative of Missouri should have five districts where Republicans are likely to win, two where Democrats have the advantage and one that is a battleground, von Glahn said.
“What you’re looking at here is dividing the largest metro area in the state into thirds and drawing them in with people 250 miles away,” he said. “It is the definition of manipulation in order to achieve an outcome.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/051724_hoskins1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-11-06 07:20:34.607796

That victory wasn’t a fluke. It showed who we are as a state. Missourians value freedom, fairness and honesty. We believe in minding our own business and letting others do the same. And yet, just one year later, the same politicians who ignored the will of the people are back at it again.
They’ve rewritten the ballot language for a new abortion ban planned for 2026, and they’ve done it in a way that turns the truth on its head. The new summary hides the word “ban” entirely. Instead, it’s filled with talk about “protections” and “exceptions” that don’t actually protect anyone or make abortion care available in any real way.
Let’s call it what it is: a con dressed up in a policy costume.
They know they can’t win honestly. They saw Missourians vote to legalize abortion in 2024, and they know banning it again would be deeply unpopular. So instead of facing us in the open, they’re hoping to confuse us. They’re counting on voters to skim the ballot language and assume it sounds reasonable.
But there’s nothing reasonable about trying to undo the will of 1.5 million voters. There’s nothing fair about rewriting the rules just because you lost.
Don’t forget, abortion is still legal in Missouri today. That’s because of the courage and commitment of Missourians from every corner and across the state. People who had never volunteered before stood in parking lots and farmers markets gathering signatures. Families brought their kids to the Capitol to testify. Friends and neighbors had hard conversations about personal freedom, health care, and trust.
That’s what real democracy looks like. It isn’t flashy and it doesn’t rely on scare tactics. It’s people coming together to do what’s right, even when powerful interests are working against them.
Now those same politicians are hoping we’re too distracted to notice. They’re hoping we’re tired. They’re hoping we’ve moved on. But Missourians won’t fall for the same trick twice.
Strip away the fancy language and it’s the same old ban, just wearing a new costume. And like any Halloween mask, it doesn’t hold up under the light.
As we look back on this past year, we should feel proud of what we’ve achieved together. We changed the law in our state. We reminded the nation that Missourians won’t be bullied or silenced. But we can’t stop now because the people trying to take away our rights haven’t stopped either.
We need to keep talking to our friends, neighbors and coworkers about what’s really happening. The ballot language might be written to trick us, but the truth is simple: politicians are once again trying to ban abortion in Missouri.
Halloween might be over, but the masks are still on in Jefferson City. The only way to stop the tricksters is to shine a light on what they’re doing and refuse to play along.
Missourians deserve the truth, plain and simple. We deserve the freedom to make our own decisions without interference or deception. And we deserve a state government that respects the will of its people.
We’ve been here before and we know how to win. We did it once, and we’ll do it again.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051425_abortionaccess1-1024x615.jpg,,,2025-11-06 07:20:34.607796

Frustration simmers as officials tasked with improving alerts to crime victims continue to disagree over how the state’s automated alert system, VINE, should be managed.
The dissent began after the Department of Corrections, which pays for and manages the system, made staffing changes to its victim services unit without consulting others who interact with VINE and are tasked with changing it. 
It isn’t the first time that the Corrections Department has quietly made changes without consulting members of a task force, who were assigned by lawmakers to fix high-stakes errors in victim alerts. And when the department has made changes in the dark, advocates for victims rights have repeatedly said those changes will do more harm than good.

Crime victims in Vermont have the legal right to get timely notifications about the movements of those charged with or convicted of harming them. But conversations with lawmakers this spring illuminated that victims sometimes got incorrect alerts from VINE, which stands for Victim Information Notification Everyday. Victims can receive alerts from VINE via call, text or email. 
But sometimes VINE alerts went out to the wrong people or didn’t go out at all. In some instances, errors in the system caused victims life-altering harm. 
To address the issue, lawmakers created a task force to convene officials from throughout the justice system and survivors who used the system to make improvements to VINE. 
The task force allows employees from other departments to scrutinize VINE and give their two cents on changes. But the fact that the notification system is solely paid for and managed by the Department of Corrections has recently caused tensions. 
On Oct. 15, Jon Murad, commissioner of the Corrections Department, sent out a memo to task force officials proposing that other departments share the cost of the VINE system, which he estimates to cost the department $70,000 annually. Specifically, he sent the memo to officials from the Center for Crime Victim Services, the Department for State’s Attorneys and Sheriffs and the Department of Public Safety. 
“I am seeking feedback from your organizations on whether a cost-sharing model would
support the future sustainability of this technology and ensure all parties can exercise ownership over this critical system,” Murad wrote. 
Further down in the memo, Murad explains that part of making data improvements to its VINE system involves increasing compatibility with the state’s attorneys data system. His department “does not have additional funds or staff to perform unbudgeted IT work on behalf of other parts of state government,” he wrote. 
Murad also wrote that the department “plans to create a fulltime dedicated position to support the operations and maintenance of VINE.” That person will work on fixing errors in the system and educating department staff, he said. 
Then, during a Thursday task force meeting, Meredith Pelkey, who directs corrections victim services, said that instead of filling two vacant victim services specialist positions, the department would fill only one position. The second position would go mostly toward VINE data work. 
Meghan Place, a state’s attorney victim advocate in Windsor County, responded, asking, “We’re cutting a position?” And Pelkey said yes. 
In an interview, Place said she was “shocked” by the change. 
Place formerly worked as a victim specialist at the Corrections Department. And she thinks that having fewer victim specialists will limit options for victims, she said. Victim specialists can provide emotional support for victims, connect them with other resources and provide victims with trauma-informed communication about their offender. 
It’s concerning that a point of human contact is being taken away to work on a flawed automated system, said Jenn Poehlmann, the executive director for Crime Victim Services who chairs the task force. 
Haley Sommer, a spokesperson for the department, said the department made the change because effectively improving the VINE system involves a lot of data management and improving the data quality of the automated notifications. 
“It’s not going to take away services that we provide to victims,” Sommer said. 
VINE is a tool the department uses to meet its legal obligations to serve victims, Sommer said. Other victim specialists, along with other department employees, will be doing the work of that former victim specialist position, she said.
When asked why the Corrections Department didn’t consult with others before making the change, Sommer said it’s routine for government departments to internally repurpose positions to meet their priorities. 
“I don’t think it’s accurate to say that we’re trying to replace human engagement with more technological systems, we’re really just trying to focus on improving the system that we have,” Sommer said. 
Place agreed that VINE is a tool, but emphasized its limitations. Victims have vocally resented the fact that calls through VINE come from a cold robotic voice reading an automated message. 
The automated system lacks the “smooth touch” that real people can provide, she said. 
Tim Lueders-Dumont, executive director of the Department for State’s Attorneys and Sheriffs, said he shot down the idea that his department would share the cost of the VINE system. His department doesn’t rely on VINE to perform its legal duties and can’t afford the price tag, he said. 
Sommer said that cost-sharing the system with other departments isn’t expected to happen this budget cycle after the Corrections Department put out the “feeler” in the memo.

The bills, introduced by the committee’s Chair Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) and Sen. Ruth Johnson (R-Holly), require an appraisal if a conservator is looking to sell their ward’s home. The package also requires a court to find that it is in an individual’s best interest should their appointed guardian seek to change their residence. 
“When you have this sort of situation where someone has someone else appointed to handle their affairs and handle their personal financial details, that process is not just difficult and nuanced for everyone, but it does create opportunities for abuse,” Irwin said.

During her time as both the Michigan Secretary of State and a lawmaker, Johnson said she’d spoken to dozens of families who watched as their loved one was removed from their home without a hearing and their house was sold far below market value. 
“These families have no legal recourse. That’s because once an order is signed appointing a guardian, they have almost completely unchecked control to make these decisions,” Johnson said, noting that there are currently no minimum standards, education, certification or licensing requirements for guardians who are not related to their ward, often referred to as professional guardians. 
As such, there is not an authority where individuals can report unethical behavior, Johnson said. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Testifying before the committee in support of the bills, journalist Gretchen Rachel Hammond pointed to an investigation she’d conducted alongside a team of journalists and forensic accountants examining 2,278 cases filed before all four of Oakland County’s probate court judges, centered on four probate attorneys acting as professional guardians. 
“At the time of our investigation, the wards of whom they were given charge numbered in the hundreds per guardian,” Hammond said. “In 97% of the cases we examined within a month of being declared an incapacitated ward, an individual, or in some cases, siblings or a husband and wife, were removed from their home by the guardians.”

The investigation saw these individuals removed from their homes and placed into “subhuman and dangerous” living conditions, while their property was dispensed of without further oversight from the probate court judge, Hammond said. 
“It is a lack of oversight in Michigan and states across the country that has opened the door for professional guardians to engage in crimes that were frankly shocking, heartbreaking and occurred in plain view of a state and judge who had given them encompassing unchecked power over the lives of their victims,” Hammond said. 
While the bill received support from members of the Michigan Elder Justice Initiative, the Michigan Guardianship Association and Michigan Realtors, which advocates for real estate professionals, some attendees offered their thoughts on how the bills could be improved. 
Alison Hirschel, program director and managing attorney of the Michigan Elder Justice Initiative, asked for some additional protections within Johnson’s Senate Bill 586 to ensure individuals under guardianship are only moved from their residency when it is appropriate, and to a place that meets their needs. 
Hirschel’s proposal would require guardians seeking to move a ward to include details such as the reason for the move, efforts to keep the person in their home with added support, whether the new setting is more restrictive, the move’s impact on the person and their relationships, and whether the individual agrees with it.
Hirschel also requested language requiring the court appoint a guardian ad litem in these cases to act in the ward’s best interest, and set a hearing, alongside laying out the duties of the guardian ad litem to ensure the court makes a determination in the matter that is in the individual under guardianship’s best interests. 
Hirschel also advocated for the court to appoint counsel for a person who is opposing the move, or for whom the move may not be in their best interest. 
Additionally, she requested language laying out procedures so that a judge can determine in situations like a temporary emergency move whether that move should be permanent, while requiring the guardian to maintain their ward’s residence to the greatest extent possible until permission is given. 
“Finally, if a sale is necessary, we want to make sure that the guardian makes reasonable efforts to communicate with the individual and family about preserving some items that are of great sentimental value to the person,” Hirschel said, noting that her group had heard a number of stories where guardians had disposed of items that held enormous meaning to their wards and the individual’s family.

Rana Lechlitner of the Michigan Guardianship Association said that the group appreciates the intent behind the two bills, but noted Irwin’s Senate Bill 585 would require a conservator to pay for an appraisal of their charge’s home out of pocket, adding additional financial strain to an already stressful role. 
Additionally, in most conservatorship cases, the list price for a house is established before the house is placed on the market, Lechlitner said, though the approval process varies widely across counties. 
“We believe there is an opportunity to build on these strong local practices by considering a uniform statewide standard that protects individuals assets without imposing unnecessary costs or delay,” Lechlitner said. 
Jennifer Warnos, the executive director of Guardianship Finance and Advocacy Services also offered her support for the policies alongside suggestions to improve Johnson’s bill, including clarification that a judge can provide approval to move someone under guardianship from their residency after they have already been moved due to an emergency situation. 
Instead of mandating a full court hearing to determine if an individual under guardianship should be moved, Warnos asked if the judge could place their written approval or denial within a case file to meet the bill’s requirements, in order to avoid burdening with the legal fees associated with a court appearance and filings. 
Warnos urged lawmakers to include family members under the two bills’ regulations and to clarify the definition of “residence” in Johnson’s bill, warning it could pose challenges for high-needs wards who move often. She also noted that guardianship clients range in age from 18 and up, not just older adults.
Committee advances policies on water affordability, energy efficiency improvements for low income households
Before taking testimony on the Irwin and Johnson bills, the committee advanced a package of water affordability bills to the Senate floor after similar efforts stalled last session. 
Senate Bills 248–256, led by state Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit) passed the committee without opposition, though Sen. Jonathan Lindsey (R-Coldwater) opted to pass while voting on several bills in the package. 
The committee also referred another policy, Senate Bill 562, to the Senate floor. The bill would direct more federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program funds toward housing upgrades by removing the state’s 15% cap on weatherization funding and requiring at least 12.5% go to improvements such as insulation, air sealing, thermostat installation and furnace upgrades.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Louisiana stepped in at the start of the month to replace food assistance the federal government was withholding as part of the continuing shutdown. But now that two separate courts have ordered the Trump administration to use a contingency fund to resume assistance, the state has pulled back some of the aid it has already doled out. 
The Louisiana Department of Health said Wednesday it has recalled benefits deposits it has made since Nov. 1 so that those Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients can get more aid from the federal government. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has said it will issue half of the typical monthly SNAP payments it provides for November because the $6 billion emergency fund it will use to pay them won’t cover the full cost. 
That 50% portion is more than the 25% Louisiana had planned to distribute each week in November to SNAP recipients. Last month, Gov. Jeff Landry ordered the Louisiana Department of Health to use $147 million in state funds to provide food aid for the elderly, disabled and families in need, effective Nov. 1.

Rather than issue the entire monthly payment at once, the governor said the benefits would be handed out in 25% portions each week. The elderly and disabled, who usually receive their SNAP benefits during the first few days of the month, would remain first in line, while families would see their payments in numerical order based on their Social Security numbers.  
The governor said any “able-bodied” person who had received SNAP benefits but didn’t fit into one of the priority categories would need to turn to food banks. But with the federal government resuming its payments, all of the nearly 800,000 qualifying SNAP recipients in Louisiana will receive assistance — 50% for the time being — including the 53,000 Landry had pointed to food banks, state officials said.
“We will be waiting for the government to open up and/or additional guidance being published before we make any decision on any further state program expenditures,” Louisiana Department of Health communications director Emma Herrock said when asked whether the state would cover the remaining 50% of SNAP assistance in November.
Before the shutdown, SNAP payments for a family of four averaged $715 per month or just less than $6 per day for each person, according to USDA figures.
Herrock said the people who had state payments removed from their EBT cards are the elderly and disabled recipients who received funds Saturday through Tuesday.
If the D.C. shutdown extends beyond November, the governor can tap into a reserve account the state has set aside for revenue shortfalls. State lawmakers approved a resolution last month supporting the emergency measure.
White House officials said Tuesday the administration would “fully comply” with rulings from federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island that required the USDA to use its contingency funds for SNAP payments. The statement was meant to clarify remarks President Trump made on social media, indicating federal food assistance would not resume until Democrats in Congress acted to end the government shutdown.

(Wisconsin Examiner photo illustration).“Do you ever wonder why there are Black neighborhoods?” Derek Handley, an associate professor of English, African and African Diaspora and Urban studies at UW-Milwaukee, asks his students. How did Milwaukee County become one of the most segregated counties in the country, and what has that meant for the generations of families who either benefited from that bigotry, or were the targets of it?
On Saturday Handley, alongside fellow UW-Milwaukee professor Anne Bonds, will unveil a new project that deeply examines the historic use of racial housing covenants in Milwaukee. From 1-3 p.m. at the Milwaukee Public Library’s Centennial Hall, the professors will present “Mapping Racism and Resistance,” the culmination of three years of work and reflection by thousands of Milwaukee residents.

Racial covenants were legal clauses in property records that explicitly prohibited people who were non-white from living within, occupying, owning or even being present on certain properties. The first covenants in Milwaukee popped up  in the city of Wauwatosa in 1911, 10-20 years before neighboring states established similar practices. Covenants in Wauwatosa and the rest of the Milwaukee area pre-date the practice of redlining,  where financial institutions systematically denied mortgages and financial investments to residents from Black and minority neighborhoods, and which began in 1938. 
In fact, the covenants set the stage for later forms of discrimination like redlining. Bonds explained that redlining was “a process that re-enforced and layered upon racial covenants” and that the level of racism in some communities was so strong it motivated entire neighborhoods to send the message to Black, brown and non-Christian people that they were not welcome. 
Covenants became popular during the 1920s and continued into the 1960s, even after multiple Supreme Court rulings rendered them illegal and, in theory, unenforceable. 
Sometimes the covenants were established before houses were even built in an area. Other times neighbors spent time and money in the courts to create covenants in already developed areas. “It cost money,” said Bonds, “it wasn’t cheap to go and then insert these racial covenants into their property records kind of after the fact.” Not only did covenants root themselves in communities which did not yet have Black residents, there were actually more restrictive covenants than there were Black residents of Milwaukee from 1910 to 1960. Milwaukee had a very small population of Black people when covenants arose, Handley said, adding, “there were three times as many covenants as there were Black people.” Bonds stressed that, “None of this is really passive in any way, shape, or form…It’s a very active whites-only kind thing.” 
That history “disrupts the notion that Jim Crow only happened in the South,” Handley told the Wisconsin Examiner. Never before has a map of racial covenants centralized or visualized those records for study. A network of over 6,000 people helped transcribe and analyze 1.9 million images of deeds, wills, court cases, property records and other Milwaukee County documents from 1910-1960. The records needed to be indexed, converted and checked by five different people to verify that they were covenants. Although computer programs helped organize the bulk of the data, human volunteers were needed to sift out false positives and to verify the findings. 
Anne Bonds, UW-Milwaukee
Mapping Racism and Resistance is both a crowdsourcing effort and a reckoning for the community. Not only does it map where the racial covenants were in Milwaukee County, “but more than anything we wanted the project to be about teaching people more, exposing people to more about the mechanisms and the kinds of techniques that were used to segregate cities,” said Bonds. “And it’s really painful to see this language, and jarring…It’s really jarring. It’s one thing to learn about housing discrimination and to say, ‘Yeah, people didn’t want to live by people who were not white.’ It’s another thing to see that language that says, ‘This home can never be occupied by anybody of the colored race.’ And to see that language inserted in a legal document, it’s pretty eye opening.” 
Mary Roberts, one of the project’s volunteer transcribers who helped upload and verify the covenants, was shocked by what she saw. Having grown up in Sheboygan when the community was essentially whites-only before attending UW-Milwaukee, Roberts had a peripheral understanding of Milwaukee’s housing covenants. Now at retirement age, she was drawn to the project out of a desire to get involved in social justice issues in the city. 
“I have to confess, I did not really understand it,” Roberts told the Examiner. “I understood it in the abstract, but it really deepened my understanding in a way that I just don’t know if I can fully explain. You know, reading in black and white these very calculating and cold and indifferent property deeds…It was incredibly eye-opening to me.” Seeing the racial covenants went far beyond any lesson that can be learned in school, Roberts said. “I was born in 1965, so some of the racial covenants I found were like, they were living, breathing documents in my lifetime. So I went into this thinking that it was really more about history, but it is a living history that was really present in my lifetime. And I think that was very surprising to me.” 










These documents, as I was transcribing, really hammered home to me how systemic the racial inequities were…They were built into the system. And when you read document after document and they’re saying the same thing and you think, every property deed you read is a property, it’s a family, it’s a life, and how widespread it was…


– Mary Roberts, Mapping Racism and Resistance volunteer transcriber on reviewing racial covenants.


A large portion of the covenants reviewed by Roberts were established in Wauwatosa and largely discriminated against Black people. However, she also found covenants from Greenfield, and others which also included Jewish people and other non-Christians including  Armenian people and Asian people. Covenants also existed to the north and east of Wauwatosa, as well as in Milwaukee’s Sherman Park, Sunset Heights and Roosevelt Heights neighborhoods on the South Side near the airport. “A lot of people talk about the way that Milwaukee is surrounded by its predominately white suburbs,” said Bonds. “And certainly when you look at the racial covenants, you can see that pattern playing out, that they surround the city of Milwaukee.” 










Wauwatosa has a significant amount of racial covenants. And folks would know, and Black people would know — and this is across the country — where you couldn’t go, where you shouldn’t go, where you could be, where you can not be. 


– Derek Handley, an associate professor of English, African and African Diaspora and Urban studies at UW-Milwaukee


Roberts noticed that the covenants seemed to put the racial clauses alongside other restrictions like not being allowed to have livestock, or how close a lot could be to a street or property line. She described the covenants as “this very cold, unemotional, sickening language that really is treating people like farm animals, or like an out-building.” 
“So much of the language really was like, you know, no person of African American descent, no one who’s Armenian, could live at this property ever, unless you were a servant. Some of them even excluded servants from properties…It says that in one spot, and then in the next spot it says you can’t have any farm animals at this property. So it was really equating people to really sub-human status, essentially.” 
The Greenfield covenant Roberts found was created by neighbors who’d formed a homeowners association and signed their names to the record. As she transcribed the records, Roberts found herself thinking of her own life, and how the property she lives on now had been passed down through three generations of her husband’s family. “We could never have built the house that we did if we had not inherited land from his dad,” said Roberts. “So it really hammers home in a way that I think other things don’t, that ability to build generational wealth was really denied to a whole class of people in our community. And that those inequities persist today, because that is how things were back then.” 
The same aspect of the project struck Handley when he and Bonds met the descendants of Zeddie Hyler, the first Black homeowner of Wauwatosa. In 1955 Hyler sought to build a home in Wauwatosa, but had to get a white friend to buy the property before he could begin. Local residents attempted to harass him out of the neighborhood, and even resorted to arson. Hyler’s descendants told the professors that Hyler and his brothers were forced to camp out with shotguns in order to protect the house. Hyler died in 2004, and his home has been designated as a historic place.

Handley recalled looking online to compare the value of the Hyler family home with the house he’d moved from in Milwaukee’s Bronzeville neighborhood. “We’re literally talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars, so the racial wealth gap is so significant because of housing discrimination,” said Handley. Resisting racist housing practices took bravery and ingenuity. “Black people in Milwaukee knew about it, NAACP was actively fighting against it,” said Handley.
In the early 1940s, NAACP Attorney George Brawley surveyed plats filed in Milwaukee County and found that about 90 percent of the subdivisions in Milwaukee County since 1910 had some type of restrictive covenant which “pledged the owner not to sell or rent to anyone other than Caucasians.” Wilbur and Ardie Clark Halyard, who founded Columbia Savings & Loan Association in 1924, helped give Black people, poor whites and other disadvantaged groups the opportunity to get a loan to buy a house. While other states focused on winning in court, key players in Milwaukee worked on economic efforts to “break into certain neighborhoods, to provide the economic means for Black people to get the support they need to purchase homes, and then try to find pathways into those neighborhoods,” Handley told the Examiner. 
This history of defiance is also something the professors hope the Nov. 8 unveiling of Mapping Racism and Resistance will reveal to people, especially those who may not believe that the housing covenants really played a role in shaping their community, or who doubt that their legacy continues to endure. Hyler’s story particularly shows how far people would go to maintain whites-only communities. Although the covenants became unenforceable after the 1960s, communities like Wauwatosa maintained racist attitudes. In the late 1980s, a whistleblower exposed that Wauwatosa police officers, firefighters and residents were attending annual Martin Luther King Day parties where attendees wore Black face, distributed fliers suggesting hunting Black people instead of deer, and other racist behaviors. 
In late 2020, Mayor Dennis McBride acknowledged that “the Wauwatosa I grew up in was a racist, almost totally white community,” though he denied that it struggles with racism today. Earlier that year, some Wauwatosa residents received letters which stated: “We Whites must stand together. We must keep Wauwatosa free from Blacks and their lack of morals. We must keep Blacks from destroying our property, raping our wives and daughters, and recruiting our children into street gangs. We MUST keep Wauwatosa great. Together we can keep Wauwatosa White! Together we can keep Wauwatosa safe!” The Wauwatosa Police Department said that it didn’t plan to investigate who distributed the letters, and the department focused on surveilling and disrupting Black Lives Matter protesters that summer. 
Wauwatosa didn’t elect its first Black alderman until 2022. The following year, Wauwatosa’s common council voted to request that the state dissolve its housing covenants, which still exist today as invalid clauses of deeds passed to homeowners upon buying certain properties. Other Milwaukee-area suburban communities, like Brookfield, continue to struggle with accepting affordable housing developments and newcomers.

Bonds cautions against the impulse to erase uncomfortable histories. Most people don’t want to live in a home with racist ownership clauses, Bonds told the Examiner, and “it’s a relic of the past, and something that is obviously really dark.” Yet, Bonds said, “We are wary of erasing the record,” because “removing them today obscures the work that they’ve already done. We can take them out of here now, but it doesn’t mean that they didn’t have an impact. It doesn’t mean that they didn’t do the work that they were set out to do when they were implemented in the first place.” The covenants conferred legal and economic power regardless of whether people who have benefited from them are “able to see it or understand it,” said Bonds.
A fully interactive website planned as part of the project has been delayed due to grant cuts, and Bonds and Handley are also working on a book. Viewers will be able to look up covenants for properties, and get down even to the parcel-level. “I definitely see this as just part of a longer study of trying to understand housing and the availability of housing to all residents of Milwaukee County,” said Bonds. “We really view this as a community project.”  
Roberts says Mapping Racism and Resistance captures an important history for people to see, especially people whose families have lived in communities built on a foundation of covenants and redlining for generations. “It’s important to not look away from that,” said Roberts. “And unless we’re having these tough conversations, I don’t think anything can get better.” Handley agreed, adding, “this is part of Milwaukee’s history, and what we can learn from it, and what we can do moving forward.”

County clerks are anxious about changes made in the last session and what’s now coming down the pike. 
The post Undeterred by tight timeline, Wyoming lawmakers charge ahead with election reform appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming lawmakers will once again consider a slate of bills to remake the state’s election system when the Legislature convenes in February. 
In the legislative off-season, lawmakers in two committees voted to sponsor 14 bills tied to elections. The legislation ranges from restricting how ballots can be returned to county clerks, limiting acceptable voter identification, banning ballot drop boxes, mandating automatic hand recounts in certain instances and upping the campaign filing requirements for independent candidates. 
Most of the legislation comes from the Joint Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee, which held its last off-season meetings Monday and Tuesday in Cheyenne. Elections were the committee’s top priority ahead of the 2026 session. 
While the scale of the legislation pales in comparison to the 45 bills lawmakers filed during the 2025 legislative session earlier this year — only a fraction of which made it into law — local election officials are concerned about having enough time to implement changes ahead of next year’s elections. 
“In a moment of bearing our soul a little bit, there is a lot of anxiety amongst county clerks about the number of bills passed in the last session and have the potential to pass in this session,” Platte County Clerk Malcolm Ervin told the committee. “And some of them have an easier administrative burden, some a significant administrative burden. And so I would ask both sides of this committee really think about that.” 
Wyoming’s primary elections aren’t until Aug. 18, but county clerks’ work begins months before that, as the committee was informed in great detail via presentation during a May meeting in Lander. 
“Realisitically, when these bills are being heard in the session, we’ll be in the first quarter of the football game,” Ervin said Monday. “And it’s hard to change those rules as the game is underway.”
As such, the Wyoming County Clerks’ Association made several suggestions to the committee, including delaying effective dates and forming a working group to study audit-related reforms. The committee, however, charged forward with the encouragement of Secretary of State Chuck Gray. 
“I’m thrilled that these election integrity bills have passed to be sponsored by the Joint Corporations committee in the upcoming 2026 legislative session,” Gray said in a statement. “They include common sense election integrity measures like requiring photo identification for voter ID. I’m going to continue working to pass these bills through the legislative process, just as we worked to pass proof of citizenship for registering to vote and other election integrity bills in the 2025 Session.”
In August, Gray and the Wyoming Freedom Caucus backed the Trump administration’s plans to stop states from using voting machines and mail-in ballots. The exact details of Trump’s plans remain to be seen since no executive order has yet been issued. 
Speaker of the House Chip Neiman, R-Hulett, a member of the Freedom Caucus, reiterated that position in October to a subcommittee charged with investigating the actions of Weston County Clerk Becky Hadlock, who has come under fire for her role in an election miscount last year. 
“Paper ballots and a hand count would have stopped all this and would have never even got out of the gate,” Neiman said. 
Neiman ran unopposed for reelection to House District 1 last year, and found himself at the center of an election snafu when a suspiciously high number of voters appeared to have left their ballots blank in his race. It was soon discovered that Hadlock had used a combination of the correct ballots and misprinted ones. A hand count ultimately resolved the results. 
Since then, however, Hadlock submitted a post-election audit with false information and then failed to appear before the subcommittee at a meeting in Casper, despite being subpoenaed to do so. Gov. Mark Gordon is now tasked for the second time with investigating Hadlock’s actions. 
Jill Kaufmann, a Wheatland resident, pointed to the fallout in public testimony she delivered to the Corporations Committee.
“The one question of all these wonderful bills that we worked through, which one would have stopped Weston County? Not one,” Kaufman said. “We need to get really serious about the purity of our vote.”
In response, Jackson Democratic Rep. Mike Yin asked Kaufman, “Do we need to pass any of these bills if they don’t actually fix the problems that we’re actually facing in Wyoming?”
Without getting rid of the state’s electronic election equipment — which Kaufman encouraged the committee to pursue — she said the legislation was necessary to address “some of the periphery of the problems that we have.” 
In October, the Management Audit Committee voted to sponsor three bills directly related to elections in response to Weston County. 
Two of those bills dealt with the post-election audit process while the third  would expand the process for submitting a verified complaint against a county officer to the governor in instances of election code violations. 
The committee also voted to sponsor a fourth bill to stiffen the penalties for ignoring a legislative subpoena, but that would not be limited to situations related to elections. 
The 2026 budget session starts Feb. 9.

From Deaver to Hanna, small-town libraries struggle as their budgets are slashed. It’s one downstream result of Wyoming’s new property tax relief.
The post Cuts, closures and more to come: Wyoming’s property tax policy ripples into libraries appeared first on WyoFile .","GREYBULL—Shawnea Chestnut grew up immersed in the books of her small-town library, which shares a building with the museum next door. 
“Right over there,” she pointed toward the children’s section. “That’s where I was.” 
Now the 26-year-old is assistant library manager. Chestnut works here four days a week, organizing young-adult fiction programs, looking up books for patrons, assisting users on computers and offering after-school crafts for kids. Outside of her work, the University of Wyoming grad is pursuing a master’s degree in library science. 
But Chestnut knows the Greybull library could land on the chopping block. With shrinking property tax revenues, budget cuts have already closed two branches and reduced services in the Big Horn County Library system.
“It’s depressing and scary,” Chestnut said. 
If the Greybull library suffers a similar fate, Chestnut would lose a job she loves. But more than that, she said, kids would lose a safe place to go when school’s out, and locals would lose the chance to visit a welcoming space for resources and information.
It’s a scenario being batted about in library systems across Wyoming as county governments wrestle with declining tax revenue. 
Nobody, it seems, wants libraries closed. But, many say, this is among the impacts advocates warned lawmakers about last spring when they urged them to vote against a measure reducing residential property taxes. The Wyoming Legislature passed a new 25% exemption on the first $1 million of a property’s fair market value, and as a result, the revenue pools for municipalities and special districts have diminished. 
Impacts have touched everything from park maintenance to hospitals around the state. Several libraries have felt the pain acutely.
In Wyoming, county governments are required by statute to operate one library in their county seat, but they regularly operate additional branches in outlying towns. Because satellite branches are not statutorily mandated, many have been considered for cost reductions.

County officials say library system cuts are a matter of necessity and not a reflection of their support. The tough conversations around library budgets, however, are exposing tensions between library administrators and elected officials. 
With more tax-cutting proposals on the horizon, the budget crunches are only expected to worsen.
“The reduction in property tax, obviously, is harming our counties,” Gov. Mark Gordon said at a recent town hall in Lander. “These consequences are going to be larger and larger.”
Communities are increasingly looking toward non-governmental organizations for fiscal lifelines and rethinking traditional funding of free public services. Outside options, many worry, may not be sustainable in the long run. 
The situation distresses Tina Ely, the director of Big Horn County’s library system. The county’s library branches serve many roles, she said — people visit them to build their résumés, find summer activities for their kids, take continuing education classes and even select seeds for their gardens. 
“It’s not just a place to check out books,” she said. “It’s a community place.”
‘Insufficient funds’
It was a warm and windy Thursday afternoon in Saratoga, and Jane Laughlin walked into the small library on the edge of town a little before closing time. The cottonwood trees were flaming in the golden tones of October, and a sign on the door advertised “books that’ll make you howl.” 
Since the library recently cut its Friday hours, this was the last day of the week for Laughlin to run her errand.
She came to write a check for $100 to the Saratoga Friends of the Library. The part-time resident had recently heard the Carbon County Library System was facing a budget crisis, she said, and she wanted to help.

“I just hope we can keep it going,” she said. Laughlin brings her grandchildren here, uses the computer and checks out books. The nearest library branch is 40 miles away, she noted, too far to just pop in for a visit. She was optimistic that Saratoga patrons would find solutions. 
“I think this community is good at rising to the occasion,” she said. 
Saratoga is among the seven branches operating in Carbon County — a sprawling 8,000 square miles stretching from ranches near the Colorado state line to Saratoga along the North Platte River to county seat Rawlins on Interstate 80. 
The system used to have eight branches. The Sinclair library closed in 2024 due to already-existing budget constraints. 
When the Carbon County Commission tackled its budget this summer, plummeting property tax revenues meant it had to find $900,000 to cut, Commissioner Sue Jones said. In that process, the commission made a significant cut to the library system budget, dropping it from $350,000 in 2024-2025 to $164,462 for ‘25-26. 
The 53% cut sent staffers, board members and patrons into an “all-of-the-above” strategy for keeping the library system afloat, said Library Board Chair Adelaide Myers. A public outreach campaign plastered branches with notices like this one: “OUR LIBRARIES ARE RUNNING WITH INSUFFICIENT OPERATIONAL FUNDS.”

The library system reduced branch hours and dipped into savings, and the board voted to close small branches in Hanna and Medicine Bow. They also leaned into fundraising opportunities. The library system and friends groups managed to raise more than $130,000 in private donations and grants — largely via Embrace the Valley, a matching fundraising event through Brush Creek Ranch. Friends groups, particularly in Saratoga, raised the bulk of the money, and the library board is now working through the process of how those funds can help keep services alive, Myers said. 
It’s not as easy as just replacing the library system’s losses, however. 
“When we have a $186,000 shortfall, $139,000 goes a long way,” Myers said. “But we also have to recognize that that’s not our money. That is the friends groups’ money.”
The funds did spur the library board to delay the Hanna and Medicine Bow closures. However, there is no guarantee they will stay open, she said, especially with the budget picture trajectory. 
“We have to plan for a really difficult year next year,” she said. “We prepare for the worst and expect the best.”
Tensions emerge
On a hot morning in July, a crowd of people gathered in lawn chairs and on the grass in front of the Lander Library for a silent “read-in.” Many brought signs that proclaimed support for Fremont County libraries. No one shouted slogans. They just read in silent solidarity for the library. 
While they didn’t have an explicit message, the sit-in took place on the heels of the Fremont County Commission’s budget process, which created a ripple of dismay in the community after commissioners announced the county would cut library funding by $300,000, or 23%.
The library system was not the only department to suffer cuts. Fremont County made a total of $2.5 million in cuts to its overall budget. Positions were left vacant, contracts reevaluated and fees hiked.

But many supporters felt the library cut was undue and carried a whiff of disapproval from the conservative commission. Fremont County commissioners denied this, pointing to the array of cuts they imposed to balance their budget. 
Ultimately, the Fremont County Library Foundation stepped in with a $100,000 donation, and the system obtained county approval to re-allocate an additional $100,000 earmarked for collection development in order to backfill. And while the remaining shortfall will result in reduced staff hours, the system’s three branches in Lander, Dubois and Riverton will be able to continue most services. 
Similar tensions are playing out elsewhere as county governments reckon with less revenue.
In September, following Carbon County’s budgeting process, Library Director Maria Wenzel resigned after three years on the job. Wenzel declined to comment to WyoFile about the reasons she left. 
Commissioner Jones acknowledged that the process was fraught. But she defended the commission, which imposed hiring freezes and reduced office hours in county government while also making painful cuts to its so-called outside agencies. With the latter, that meant eliminating funding for economic development completely and reducing funding for senior services, the museum and library system.

The county’s budget is easily misunderstood, Jones said, leading the public to think the commission should spend money that it can’t. The commission’s hands are tied in certain matters, she said, and it needs to keep reserves healthy. 
Jones sees encouraging signs like a library fundraising event she attended this fall. “They were doing fundraising for their local library in Encampment, which to me, is absolutely wonderful, because communities need to buy in,” she said. 
Outside fundraisers could play an increasing role in propping up nonstatutory services like libraries and museums, Jones said, and should be seriously considered. 
Little towns lose out
Big Horn County Library Director Ely doesn’t usually get sick, but in late September, she was fighting off the latest in a string of bugs. 
It could have been the stress. 
In the last year, she’s had to contend with the complicated equation of how to keep running the county’s five branches with much less money. 
“We had gotten a cut the year prior,” Ely said, and “we had been kind of warned by the county commissioners that this budget was going to be even worse.”
And it was. When it was presented in July, Ely and her team discovered the county commission had cut the budget from $350,000 the previous fiscal year to $280,000.

With the reduction, Ely said, they axed Wyoming retirement benefits as well as paid time off for all employees. They trimmed employee and operating hours. They cut programming funds and travel costs. 
“The staff took a hit,” Ely said. “So far, they’re all able to hang in there with us. But of course, at least three of them have a second or third job, and they stay with us because they love the library.”
Hardest of all, they closed the Frannie and Deaver branches.  
“We were just desperately looking for places to save,” she said. “It seems minimal, but we saved about $10,000 a year by closing Frannie and Deaver.”
Patrons in those small towns were devastated, Ely said. Even at the branches that remain operating, she said, patrons have been upset about cuts. There’s not a lot that Ely and the Big Horn County Library Board can tell them except the truth, she said. 
“It’s been very difficult,” she said.

Budget cuts have mounted in recent decades, she said, so fretting about closures wasn’t new. But still, she was “very upset” when she heard the news.
“These little towns just tend to lose everything,” Yates said. Local schools have been consolidated, postal services diminished. “They were always kind of proud of having the little libraries, and now they were taking that away.”
In October, the towns of Frannie and Deaver reopened their branches, which now operate on volunteer labor one day a week. Yates intended to be part of that volunteer staff. 
Vicious cycle?
Library directors who spoke to WyoFile feel they have been cut to the bone. When they contemplate future budget choices with ever-shrinking revenue, they’re at a loss.
“We are going to make it through this year,” Ely said. “I just don’t know what the future looks like.”
Ely thinks eroding services will likely come as a hard lesson, demonstrating the kinds of things property taxes fund. “I think it’s going to be a wake-up call,” she said. 
Carbon County Library Board Chair Myers said the current fundraising fix “cannot be our forever plan. We need to be funded.”

She is reaching out to lawmakers and encouraging others to follow suit to let them know that property tax reductions are wreaking damage down the line. 
The roundabout result of cutting residential taxes, she said, could be that property values fall, “because people don’t want to move to a community that doesn’t have a fire department, doesn’t have police, doesn’t have libraries, doesn’t have senior centers, it doesn’t have all these services that we take for granted that our property taxes pay for.”
It triggers a vicious cycle, she added. 
“I don’t know what the answer is,” she said. “I just know that cutting property taxes without backfilling to the counties and municipalities and school districts that lost those revenues is not a good idea.”

Because we never know when we, or someone else, will be in need, it's best to live life ready to share, writes columnist David Romtvedt. 
The post Planning for little emergencies appeared first on WyoFile .","For many years, we cut our winter wood from storm-downed cottonwood along one of the creeks at our family’s ranch. In two or three days, we’d cut the year’s supply for our house in town. The first day was spent scouting a good location where there was a tangle of wood not far from a flat area where we could park our ancient tractor and a six-horse trailer. We’d set up a 36-inch circular saw blade mounted at the end of a hinged platform on which you could place the length of wood to be cut. The blade was driven by a leather belt connected to the power take-off of the tractor. It was a little nerve-wracking pushing the wood toward those steel teeth that were inches from both the hands of the person holding the wood in place and the hands of the person who picked up each cut piece as it fell to be thrown into the horse trailer. 

Opinion

Sometimes the woodpile we found was so tangled we couldn’t pull the branches apart. Using the winch at the front of our Jeep — nearly as old as the tractor — we’d wrap a loop of steel cable around a log to pull it free. In logging, the person who wraps the cable around the log is the choker setter, and maybe because I’d done this work briefly as a young person in the Pacific Northwest, this was often my task. If I picked the right log, its release would untangle the pile, and we could pull out what we wanted to cut. 
When the horse trailer was full, we drove to town and stacked the wood in the garage and in an attached shed. Most years, we cut more wood than would fit under cover — you never know how long winter will last — so some wood would be stacked just inside the fence along the alley in full view of passersby. Squirrels ran in and out of the stacked wood, and neighborhood kids sometimes took a piece or two for some game they were playing.
As I brushed snow off the top of the pile, I imagined that if it were really cold, a person could step quietly under cover of night through the gate and into the yard to take a few pieces of wood for a fire. There was a wheelbarrow by the woodpile that such a person could use to haul off the wood. As each piece hit the wheelbarrow’s metal bottom, it’d ring like a bell. I’d turn in my sleep and smile, remembering my father-in-law who always left the keys in his truck and the doors unlocked. “You never know when someone might have an emergency and need a vehicle,” he told me.
Time passes and things change — our ranch, which is mostly split estate, has largely become a rural industrial site for extensive fossil fuel extraction. Older members of the family have died and the younger have become the older. We’ve admitted how dangerous that unprotected circular saw blade was. The tractor and the Jeep wait patiently in a shed. We buy our firewood from a local woodcutter who delivers it in half- or quarter-round pieces. I stack it and later split it into smaller pieces to burn. 
Just as in the past, I often have some wood left over from the previous year. This fall, I again stacked the excess wood in the alley, but outside the fence, where anyone could reach it as they passed by. A few days after stacking the wood, I was working in the yard and noticed that the wood pile looked different. I hadn’t yet taken any pieces to split and burn, so I asked my wife, who heats her pottery studio with wood, if she’d taken some. “No,” she said, “it’s so warm I don’t need a fire yet.”
“That’s weird — something’s different. I don’t know. It’s not how I stacked it.”
A week or so later, the weather changed. I went to the woodpile in the alley and when I picked up the first piece to split, I found a dollar bill wedged below it. Someone had taken a piece of wood and left me a dollar. I thought of my father-in-law leaving the keys in his unlocked truck, and of how little we know of the needs of others. And I thought how nice it was to find the dollar, a reminder that people mostly try to pay their way. 
Maybe I’ll put a jar out by the woodpile with a note — take what you need, leave what you can.

(Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin Superintendent Jill Underly faced more criticism from lawmakers on Wednesday as the Joint Legislative Audit Committee reviewed the findings of a financial reporting audit and launched an audit of the agency’s licensing procedures.
During the first three hours of the committee hearing, Underly’s absence was a major discussion point for lawmakers on the committee as they reviewed the financial audit. She has also faced criticism for being absent about two weeks ago at the Assembly Government Oversight Accountability and Transparency committee meeting when she was in Indiana to accept an award. 
“This body is extremely disappointed that right now, when we’re going over an audit that probably impacts over $12 billion in what’s spent by our educational legal entities, that Dr. Underly is not joining us,” Rep. Robert Wittke (R-Caledonia) said, adding that the committee provided details on the meeting weeks in advance.
Wittke said Underly is the only agency head who has not come before the committee when it is discussing an audit. 
“You don’t get the governor out of every hearing, do you?” Superintendent Deputy State Superintendent Tom McCarthy said. “Dr. Underly is an elected official and has dispatched us to manage parts of these duties, and that is why you have me at these, because she does take it very seriously and is staying deeply briefed.” 
“It’s interesting, you say that she’s an elected official, but when I had an audit before us that included the Department of Justice, it appeared that Attorney General [Josh] Kaul could be in front of us and comment on that,” Wittke said. “Constitutionally, she supervises the educational system here, whether elected or not, and… so, I would think that it would be something that she would want to address.”
Wittke quipped that maybe McCarthy should be signing off on the audits instead of Underly. 
Sen. Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto) said he found it “very concerning” that Underly was not at the hearing to discuss the first audit and her absence is a sign of “cowardice in a leader.” 
“To send the people who work for you in to take heat and not take it yourself would make me have a lack of confidence in my leader. I wouldn’t expect Superintendent Underly to have all the answers. Oftentimes an executive leader does not. They’re managerial… to defer to you to answer is quite different than not being available to be held accountable,” Wimberger said. 
The committee launched the audit into the financial reporting and the agency’s process for reviewing audited financial statements following a financial reporting scandal at the Milwaukee Public Schools last year. 
MPS faced significant criticism from lawmakers especially as the information came to light shortly after the district passed a $252 million operational referendum.
“The problem was recurring and compounding to a point where DPI was having difficulty appropriating funding accurately. That information was hidden from the public until after MPS convinced voters locally to approve a $200 million referendum,” Wimberger said during the hearing. “I’m sure voters would have had a different opinion of whether MPS needed money if they knew the district was so unaware of their internal finances.” 
In accordance with state statute, DPI monitors financial school districts’ financial statements  with a requirement that schools submit annually. Schools must contract with a certified public accounting firm, which submits the audited financial statements to DPI. 
Financial information from public schools and independent charter schools is required to be submitted by Dec. 15, under DPI policies. Voucher schools are required to submit financial information by Oct. 15 each year.
MPS was a recurrent discussion point during the hearing, though the audit found that MPS is not the only district with difficulties submitting documents on time.
Among schools’ 2022-23 audited financial statements, the Legislative Audit Bureau found that 77% were submitted on time and 22% were submitted late. For school districts that submitted on time, the agency took on average 87 days to complete its review of those audited financial statements.
Of those submitted late, 70% were submitted at least 29 days late. 
The audit looked at a sample of 18 school districts that submitted their statements late, finding that the agency contacted those districts 47 days after the Dec. 15, 2023 deadline. 
Milwaukee Public Schools’ audits for that year were submitted on Dec. 20, 2024, about a year after the due date —  the latest among all 421 school districts.
McCarthy said Milwaukee Public Schools had been historically late in turning in the district’s  annual audit, but it typically came with communication about why they were late and a commitment that the district would have the audit submitted in the following weeks. 
“That was not a normal year of being late for them,” McCarthy said of December 2023. 
When the lateness of the school district’s reports came to public attention, DPI said it had been meeting with MPS quarterly since April 2023, monthly since February 2024, weekly starting in March 15 2024 and then daily in May 2024 to get the district to submit its reports. The agency has since placed the district under two corrective action plans and withheld over $50 million from Milwaukee schools. Gov. Tony Evers has also launched separate audits of the district.
Wimberger expressed concern that MPS was given a “two-year grace period.” 
McCarthy said he believed the agency was “pretty strict” with the district. 
“If you consider withholding $51 million to be grace, I’ll call you next time we have a problem,” McCarthy said. 
“We used the tools and authority that we had at our disposal to compel the district through two separate corrective action plans, stood shoulder to shoulder in trying to clean up some of the local aspects of what’s going on, and I think the current superintendent has been deeply engaged in committing resources and staffing to making sure that this does not happen again,” McCarthy said. 
McCarthy said the situation with MPS has been a “long, painful journey that we don’t ever want to repeat with any other district.” 
The legislative audit found that DPI does not have a requirement that agency staff contact schools that haven’t submitted financial statements and audits on time. 
The Legislative Audit Bureau made 22 recommendations to DPI to improve its processes. 
Those recommendations included establishing written policies to require that it contact school districts within one month if their documents aren’t submitted by the deadline and regularly contacting schools until those audits are submitted. It also recommended that the agency establish a written policy that implements a deadline for starting its review of audited financial statements and completing those reviews. 
The audit bureau  made similar recommendations for DPI in overseeing private voucher schools and for the Department of Administration in overseeing the financial information for independent charter schools. 
McCarthy said that the agency is taking the audit bureau’s recommendations into consideration. That includes putting in writing all communication with district administrators and school boards as late reporting occurs.
McCarthy also noted that the agency has launched a school financial transparency dashboard that allows people to “dive in and look at any district” including reviewing records of compliance for reporting. 
“I’m glad you’re moving forward to try and crack the systemic problem, in my opinion, that deceived the public in the passing referendums without understanding the true financial situation of their respective district,” Wimberger said. 
Licensing and sexual misconduct audit
Underly was present during the latter half of Wednesday’s hearing, testifying on the agency’s licensing policies and changes it plans to make, especially  to investigations into educators accused of sexual misconduct and grooming. 
“Where were you this morning?” Wimberger asked.
“I was at the DPI,” Underly replied. Wimberger did not push the point. 
Underly repeated much of her testimony from the Tuesday Senate Education Committee including laying out some of the steps the agency is taking, launching a new webpage with the list of educators who have surrendered their licenses or had them revoked, as well as the changes she wants to see lawmakers work on, including providing additional resources for the agency’s licensing responsibilities and closing the loophole that allows unlicensed teachers to work in private schools.
The Joint Legislative Audit Committee voted unanimously to launch an audit into DPI’s policies and processes for educational licensure revocation, suspension, restriction and investigation. The audit will look at trends in the DPI’s investigations, its policies and how Wisconsin compares to its midwestern neighbors.
