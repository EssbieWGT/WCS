This massive budget increase comes directly from taxpayer dollars and further expands the SLCPD’s surveillance capabilities even after a recent news story exposed the SLCPD for taking electricity from Rocky Mountain Power customers in order to operate their street cameras throughout the city. The SLCPD claims to use drone surveillance for limited purposes, such as checking the scenes of accidents or crimes and searching for wanted or missing persons. Notably, they claim that drones are not used to monitor peaceful protests or private property. However, the Salt Lake Community Bail Fund investigated the SLCPD’s use of drone surveillance and found that this practice is leading to major violations of constitutional rights through oversurveillance. 
Oversurveillance of unsheltered people
While the police department claims to use drone footage only in areas where alleged crimes have occurred, they fail to disclose that drone cameras also capture footage all along their path to and from each location. This happenstance footage allows the police to unnecessarily pursue more low-level crimes that are rarely enforced due to negligible negative impacts. This oversurveillance disproportionately affects unsheltered people who are already overtargeted by police. With the recent passage of HB0312, Utah can now hold unsheltered people in jail without bail for misdemeanor offenses such as loitering, camping, and riding TRAX without a ticket. Classifying these actions as offenses is an unjust practice known as quality-of-life policing. This type of policing is unjust because it punishes people simply for trying to survive poverty. Quality-of-life policing is also ineffective at reducing homelessness and only makes it harder for unsheltered people to get connected with services that could allow them to eventually find consistent housing. 
Misuse of drone footage to target protestors
The Salt Lake City Police Department states that they do not monitor peaceful protests using their drone program. However, this information is inconsistent with recent court cases demonstrating that the SLCPD authorizes drone surveillance of protests simply for things like marching or not having a permit — both of which are First Amendment protected activities that do NOT justify the use of drone surveillance. Across the U.S., records of police departments show police regularly using drone surveillance to locate and arrest protestors in direct violation of First Amendment rights. The use of drone surveillance against protestors is a blatant attempt by the police to silence and intimidate protest movements. 
Racist facial recognition
In recent years, police departments have also gained access to facial recognition algorithms which are often utilized in drone surveillance footage, which allows the police to identify potential suspects within their facial recognition database. These facial recognition databases are often constructed from government photographs like driver’s licenses. The algorithms typically lack public transparency and demonstrate regular efficacy and racial bias concerns. 
One of the first cases of wrongful arrest based on these inaccurate face matching algorithms was the case of Robert Williams, who was arrested in front of his entire family based on a blurry image fed into a facial recognition algorithm that falsely identified him as the suspect. This case has emphasized that an algorithm match should not be used as the only evidence for an arrest, which has been echoed by countless researchers studying this topic. Just because someone is the best match in a collection of images available to the police does not mean that they committed a crime. The misuse of drone footage through flawed and racially biased facial recognition reinforces the systemic racism within the criminal legal system by continuing to disproportionately lead to the arrest and incarceration of Black people. 
Conclusions
In short, the use of police drone surveillance against the public is clearly a harmful misuse of public funds enabling the police to violate basic constitutional rights. The Salt Lake Community Bail Fund will continue to advocate for the complete shutdown of the SLCPD drone surveillance program as it is regularly being misused to harm the public.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Drone-monitoring-barbed-wire-fence-on-state-border-or-restricted-area.jpg,,,2025-08-22 14:57:15.638999

(Photo by Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado Legislature is meeting in a special session to address a nearly $800 million hole in the state budget. Work began on Thursday morning and is expected to last through the weekend.
After Republicans in Congress passed the federal tax cut and spending bill in July, Colorado’s estimated tax revenue collections shrunk by about $1.2 billion for the current fiscal year, which began July 1. Most of that is a loss of corporate income taxes.
Colorado has to have a balanced state budget, so lawmakers must figure out a way to get backed to a balanced bottom line. The Democratic majority in both chambers, alongside Gov. Jared Polis, plan to do that by dipping into the state’s reserves, cutting program spending and passing an array of tax laws to eliminate some deductions and loopholes.
In his call for the special session, Polis also allowed bills on health insurance premiums and artificial intelligence regulations. A controversial AI law is set to go into effect next February and it has been a longtime goal of Polis and moderates to tweak it before then.
Legislative action is live-streamed and archived on the General Assembly’s website.

Senate gives initial OK to 4 bills on first day of special session


By: Sara Wilson - Thursday August 21, 2025 9:03 pm





By the end of Thursday, the Colorado Legislature made it through the bulk of their committee work for the special session and the Senate gave its initial approval to four bills. Tomorrow morning, the Senate will have formal votes on those bills and the House will begin floor debate on its own set of bills.
The bills the Senate considered on second reading were:

Senate Bill 25B-1: This bill sets a process for the governor to notify and consult with the Joint Budget Committee on mid-year spending cuts needed to overcome a revenue shortfall, like the ones he is poised to do soon after this special session. The governor would be able to suspend and cut state funding, and therefore need to meet with the JBC, if the reserve needs to be tapped by up to 2% of the General Fund budget, or if that reserve is projected to dip below $1 billion.
Senate Bill 25B-2: This would allow the state to pay for Medicaid services from organizations that provide reproductive health care, namely Planned Parenthood, that the federal government has withheld Medicaid money from.
Senate Bill 25B-3: This changes a referred ballot measure in November to ask voters if the state can use extra money collected for universal school meals to also cover costs related to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
Senate Bill 25B-5: This bill would reallocate about $260,000 from the wolf reintroduction program to the state health insurance fund. It was amended in committee to still allow the capture and release of wolves this winter.

The Senate still needs to take up Senate Bill 25B-4, the artificial intelligence bill focused on transparency and disclosure. That bill, backed by progressive lawmakers and consumer advocates, would require notification when people interact with AI and allow people to request information about how AI influences important decisions related to things like employment or school admissions. It awaits a hearing in the Appropriations Committee.
Over in the House, committees gave approval to the series of Democrat-backed tax policies. The chamber will start debate on them tomorrow. Those were:

House Bill 25B-1001: This would permanently extend a requirement that high-income taxpayers add back their qualified business income federal tax deductions when calculating their Colorado taxable income.
House Bill 25B-1002: This bill would expand the list of countries that the state considers to be tax havens.
House Bill 25B-1003: This would repeal a tax incentive for insurance companies that have at least 2.5% of their domestic employees in Colorado.
House Bill 25B-1004: This would allow qualifying companies to pay certain state taxes early at a discount.
House Bill 25B-1005: This bill would repeal a provision in state law that allows retailers to keep 4% of their sales tax collections, as a way for the businesses to cover the cost of collecting the taxes.

A House committee also signed off on House Bill 25B-1006, which would loan $100 million from the Unclaimed Property Trust Fund to prevent major health insurance premium increases.
House Bill 25B-1008, the dueling AI bill, also cleared its committee even with some Democrats voting against it. That bill would require companies to tell consumers when they are interacting with AI and fold the technology into the state’s existing anti-discrimination and consumer-protection laws. Bill sponsors removed a provisions that would have only allowed the attorney general, not consumers, from suing developers and deployers that violate consumer-protection laws.
Both HB25-1008 and HB25B-1006 need to pass the Appropriations Committee.
Democrats, who make up a majority in both chambers, also killed Republican-backed bills in committee on Thursday. The entire House State, Civic, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee agenda, for example, was made of Republican bills that died.

Lawmakers back off plan to pause Colorado’s wolf reintroduction program


By: Chase Woodruff -  5:16 pm





Colorado lawmakers gave initial approval Thursday to a bill to redirect a small amount of state money from gray wolf restoration efforts to a health insurance affordability fund, but stopped short of requiring Colorado Parks and Wildlife to pause the capture and release of new wolves this winter.
With the Legislature convened for a special session to cope with a billion-dollar revenue shortfall triggered by changes to the federal tax code, Senate Bill 25B-5 would withhold $264,268 from the state’s general fund previously appropriated for wolf reintroduction. The money would instead be directed to the state’s Health Insurance Affordability Enterprise, which helps subsidize health coverage costs and faces an estimated shortfall of around $100 million after Congress failed to extend federal tax credits for insurance premiums.

Republican-backed artificial intelligence bills killed in committee


By: Sara Wilson -  4:13 pm





Both Republican-backed bills on artificial intelligence died on the first day of the special legislative session, as Senate Bill 25B-8 and House Bill 25B-1009 did not make it through their respective committees.
“Because of the pace of the special session, I did not have the time I needed to refine the language for the standard our small businesses deserve,” Rep. Ron Weinberg, a Loveland Republican, told the House Business Affairs and Labor Committee before he asked members to vote against his bill.
His bill would have narrowed the definition of “consequential decision” in the state’s forthcoming artificial intelligence law to include decisions related to employment or public safety. The Senate bill, backed by Republican Sen. Mark Baisley of Woodland Park, would have broadly prohibited discrimination using any technology.
Lawmakers are considering changes to the state’s artificial intelligence law, which was passed in 2024 and is set to go into effect next February, at the behest of Gov. Jared Polis. The technology business community worry about implementation of the law, which sets rules for companies that use AI in their decision making, while consumer rights advocates say the law it gives necessary guardrails for technology that can inform life-changing decisions.
The Legislature will likely debate and vote on two competing AI-related bills backed by Democrats. Legislation from the sponsors of the 2024, Senate Bill 25B-4, law would strip the law to become essentially a disclosure policy. The other bill, House Bill 25B-1008, would extend existing civil rights laws and consumer protections to AI and require notice if a consumer is interacting with AI in some circumstances.
The Senate bill passed its committee earlier this afternoon. The House bill’s committee hearing was ongoing as of 4:15 p.m. on Thursday.









Colorado Senate committee approves bill to fund Medicaid reimbursements for abortion providers

The Colorado Senate Health and Human Services committee on Thursday approved a bill to use state money to fund Medicaid reimbursements for reproductive health care providers that have recently faced federal funding cuts.
Senate Bill 25B-2  passed the committee on a party-line vote, with Democrats in favor. The bill was introduced because of the “enormously negative impact” of the federal Republican domestic policy law on Coloradans seeking abortion services and other reproductive health care, bill sponsor Sen. Jeff Bridges, a Greenwood Village Democrat, said. The law, which President Donald Trump signed in July, blocks certain abortion providers from receiving Medicaid funding.
The bill would require the Department of Health Care Policy and Financing to use state funds to reimburse health care providers that are prohibited from receiving federal Medicaid reimbursements. The non-partisan Legislative Council Staff estimates the bill would cost the state a maximum of $4.4 million during the current fiscal year, which began on July 1.
Jack Teter, the vice president of government affairs for Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, said 991 appointments had to be canceled in the days after the federal law went into effect. Planned Parenthood’s operations are now in limbo, Teter said, while challenges to the law’s provision affecting abortion providers move through federal courts.
“We can’t keep canceling people’s appointments and then trying to bring them back again,” Teter said. “It’s not sustainable and it’s not fair to our patients. This bill allows the state to cover the difference for the Medicaid reimbursements and ensures we don’t have to close our doors to those patients.”
During the committee hearing, dozens of Planned Parenthood volunteers and reproductive rights advocates sat in the audience, wearing pink clothing and showing their support for the bill. Teter said PPRM expects more than 150 supporters of the bill to come to the Capitol throughout the special session as the bill moves through the Legislature.
“We sent out a call to action to our incredible activists across the state, and people are showing up,” Teter said. “It’s awesome.”

Special session on Colorado budget woes gets underway

The Colorado House and Senate gaveled in for the special session shortly after 10 a.m. After some procedural business, the chambers recessed to start committee work for the first introduced bills.
Earlier this morning, the caucuses laid out their priorities in separate press conferences.
“We’ve got our work cut out for us. We’re back to address a $1 billion budget shortfall thanks to Trump and Republicans in Congress — $1 billion that should be invested in Colorado, for Colorado, but instead is for tax breaks for corporations and the ultra wealthy,” Senate President James Coleman, a Denver Democrat, said.
The Republicans were less optimistic.
“When we walk away from this session, the Democrats will have increased taxes. The Democrats will have done nothing to cut General Fund spending — that’s the $700 million we’re in the red — and the Democrats will not have rebalanced the state’s budget,” Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, a Brighton Republican, said.
In addition to finding solutions to that revenue shortfall, Gov. Jared Polis tasked lawmakers with addressing health insurance premium costs, tweaking the state’s artificial intelligence law and shoring up food assistance program funding.
Committee work will begin around 11:30 a.m.

The bill was sponsored by Senate President James Coleman, a Denver Democrat, and Sen. Judy Amabile, a Boulder Democrat, who introduced an amendment prior to the vote. The amendment changed the reserve threshold in the bill from the originally proposed 2%, to the current version of 3%.

The sponsors pushed for the bill as a way for the JBC and the governor to partner on mid-year spending cuts during revenue shortfalls, like the cuts Gov. Jared Polis is poised to make after the special session. 
All Senate Republicans, as well as four Democratic senators, voted against the bill.
Senate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez, a Denver Democrat, was one of the no votes, and said he had “a lot of concerns with this bill.”
“The unintended consequences, that I feel that we’re seceding a lot of power to the governor, accountability and responsibility,” he said. 
Senate Bill 25B-2, which would allow the state to pay for Medicaid services from reproductive health care organizations, including Planned Parenthood, that the federal government has withheld Medicaid money from, made it through the Senate in a 23-12 party-line vote, with Democrats in favor. 
Democrats also passed Senate Bill 25B-3 on another party-line vote. The bill would change a referred ballot measure in November to ask voters if the state can use extra money collected for universal school meals to also cover costs related to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. 
The bill was proposed after President Donald Trump signed the federal Republican tax break and spending cut law in July, which shifted some of the cost burden of SNAP onto states. 
“While our congressional delegation has failed, where they’ve decided to let families and vulnerable people go hungry, Coloradans, in their impeccable wisdom, are stepping up,” said Democratic Sen. Katie Wallace, one of the bill’s sponsors. 
Senate Bill 25B-5 received bipartisan support in the Senate with a vote of 32-3. The bill would reallocate about $260,000 from the wolf reintroduction program to a state health insurance fund. It was amended in committee on Thursday to still allow the capture and release of wolves this winter.
Democratic Senators Lisa Cutter, Tom Sullivan and Katie Wallace were the three no votes. Sullivan cited concerns over the process by which the bill was amended as to why he voted against it.

Dan Innis and progressive organizer Karishma Manzur have announced campaigns.
Manzur, an Exeter biomedical scientist, announced her candidacy in the Democratic primary Wednesday. As a researcher, Manzur studied Alzheimer’s disease and epilepsy. Politically, she’s perhaps most known for op-eds she’s written in outlets like the New Hampshire Union-Leader, the Concord Monitor, and the Bulletin about topics like the war in Gaza and the rise of hate groups in the U.S. She has no previous experience in elected office, but has volunteered with New Hampshire Peace Action, Open Democracy, and the state Democratic Party Rules Committee. 
Manzur has been a staunch defender of Palestinian human rights and opponent of Israel’s actions in the war in Gaza. However, her campaign launch video focused on the struggles of low-income Americans and her own childhood growing up as an immigrant in a working-class family. 
“In the richest country in the world, we have to ask: Why are millions of Americans still struggling just to survive?” she said in her launch video.
In the Democratic primary, Manzur will face U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas, who became the first candidate in the race in April. Her campaign thus far has not made any direct attacks on her opponent.
Innis, who represents District 7 in central New Hampshire, jumped into the Republican primary in July. He serves on the national board of the Log Cabin Republicans, an organization for gay conservatives, and previously unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District in 2014. Outside of politics, Innis is a farmer and a business professor.
Innis is one of two Republicans in the primary so far. Scott Brown, who represented Massachusetts in the U.S. Senate from 2010 to 2013 before moving to New Hampshire, announced his candidacy for the seat in June.
Innis has tried to frame himself as a strong ally of President Donald Trump and attacked his opponent Brown as not being sufficiently conservative or pro-Trump. However, he’s spent much more time attacking Pappas by trying to characterize him as a “radical liberal” and linking him to national Democratic figures, such as former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. He’s spoken at length about keeping transgender girls out of female sports and has called on New Hampshire to redistrict mid-decade — like Texas and other states — to create a map more advantageous to Republicans.
“President Trump needs another fighter in the U.S. Senate, and Chris Pappas will only be a fighter for the radical left,” Innis wrote in a recent post. “Pappas votes 94% with AOC and Nancy Pelosi, backing policies that put our adversaries first and make New Hampshire weaker.”

In a 261-page opinion in a lawsuit brought against the state by the Alabama State Conference of the NAACP, U.S. District Judge Anna Manasco, appointed by President […]","The Alabama Senate chamber on Tuesday, June 6, 2023. A federal judge Friday ruled that Alabama's Senate map violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and said a remedy should include a majority or near-majority Black Senate district in Montgomery. ((Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector))A federal court ruled Friday that Alabama’s current state Senate district map violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, banning voting laws that discriminate based on race.
In a 261-page opinion in a lawsuit brought against the state by the Alabama State Conference of the NAACP, U.S. District Judge Anna Manasco, appointed by President Donald Trump, said to remedy the situation, the Alabama Legislature must draw a new Senate district in the Montgomery area.
“As the Legislature considers such plans, it should be mindful of the practical reality, based on the ample evidence of intensely racially polarized voting adduced during the trial, that any remedial plan will need to include an additional district in the Montgomery area in which Black voters either comprise a voting-age majority or something quite close to it,” she wrote.
Manasco said the plaintiffs had shown that another majority-Black district could be drawn in Montgomery. She rejected a claim from plaintiffs that state Senate districts drawn in the Huntsville area violate Section 2, writing that the plaintiffs had not shown that they could draw a “reasonably configured district” in the Huntsville area where Black voters would constitute a majority.
Should the court’s decision be upheld, it would be the second time in four years a federal court found Alabama’s 2021 congressional and state legislative maps to be racially discriminatory. A three-judge panel that included Manasco ruled in 2022 that the state’s 2021 congressional map did not give Black voters a proper opportunity to choose their preferred leaders, leading to an odyssey that in 2023 resulted in a new congressional map with a majority Black district in west Alabama and a near-majority Black district in the southern Black Belt.
It was not immediately clear Friday if the state would appeal the ruling, though it twice took the congressional case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Messages seeking comment were left Friday for Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall; Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen and Senate Pro Tempore Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman.  Messages were also left with Sen. Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery, and Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, both of whom represent Montgomery in the Alabama Senate.
Alabama NAACP President Banard Simelton said in a phone interview Friday that he expects the state to appeal the ruling, but is grateful the court is looking at the state’s district maps.
“I think in the bigger picture, it reflects the overall redistricting plan for the state of Alabama was discriminatory. We’re glad that the courts are seeing it for what it is, a discriminatory redistricting plan,” Simelton said. “We will continue to fight for redistricting on the state level, as well as in  municipalities and places like that.”
It was also not immediately clear when maps might be redrawn, should Manasco’s ruling be upheld. A federal court in 2017 ruled that 12 of Alabama’s 105 House districts violated the Voting Rights Act and had to be redrawn. The Legislature did so during that year’s regular session. The Legislature in 2023 drew a new map in a special session; the court rejected the map as unresponsive and ordered its own. Manasco, who ordered new maps be put in place for the 2026 elections, scheduled a status conference for next Thursday.
The plaintiffs claim that the districts in Montgomery and Huntsville dilute Black voting power in the state in violation of the VRA by unconstitutionally packing Black voters into particular districts.
The Alabama chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said the fight is not over.
“We are pleased that the court recognized the injustice in Montgomery and is requiring Alabama to fix its unlawful redistricting. While we are disappointed that Black voters in Huntsville will continue to be denied fair representation, the fight is far from over,” said Davin Rosborough, ACLU’s voting rights project deputy director.
The ruling said the court will draw the new districts if the Legislature does not do so in time for use in coming elections.
In both the congressional and Alabama Senate lawsuits, federal judges have noted that voting in Alabama is racially polarized, with white Alabamians tending to support Republicans and Black Alabamians tending to support Democrats. Courts have found that earlier maps allowed Black Alabamians, who make up 27% of the population, to have little practical ability to elect their preferred leaders.
The U.S. Supreme Court earlier this month asked plaintiffs in a Louisiana redistricting case to brief them on whether majority-minority congressional districts, the most common method of ensuring minority representation in the U.S. House of Representatives, are constitutional. Ruling them unconstitutional could affect recent decisions about Alabama’s districts.

Medicaid is the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. For families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford private insurance, CHIP is a public program that provides low-cost health coverage for their children.
The feds will begin sending states monthly enrollment reports that identify people with Medicaid or CHIP whose immigration or citizenship status can’t be confirmed through federal databases. States are then responsible for verifying the citizenship or immigration status of individuals in those reports. States are expected to take “appropriate actions when necessary, including adjusting coverage or enforcing non-citizen eligibility rules,” according to a CMS press release.
“We are tightening oversight of enrollment to safeguard taxpayer dollars and guarantee that these vital programs serve only those who are truly eligible under the law,” Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who oversees CMS as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said in a press release announcing the new program.
As of April, roughly 71 million adults and children nationwide have Medicaid coverage, while another 7 million children have insurance through CHIP. Immigrants under age 65 are less likely to be covered by Medicaid than U.S.-born citizens, according to an analysis from health research organization KFF.
Immigrants who are in the country illegally aren’t eligible for federally funded Medicaid and CHIP. Only citizens and certain lawfully present immigrants — green card holders and refugees, for example — can qualify.
But some states have chosen to expand Medicaid coverage for immigrants with their own funds. Twenty-three states offer pregnancy-related care regardless of citizenship or immigration status, according to KFF. Fourteen states provide coverage for children in low-income families regardless of immigration status, while seven states offer coverage to some adults regardless of status.
The tax and spending package President Donald Trump last month cuts federal spending on Medicaid by more than $1 trillion, leaving states to either make up the difference with their own funds or reduce coverage. But the new law also includes restrictions on coverage for certain immigrants, including stripping eligibility from refugees and asylum-seekers.

A federal judge Friday ruled that Alabama's Senate map violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and said a remedy should include a majority or near-majority Black Senate district in Montgomery. ((Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector))A federal judge ruled Friday that Alabama’s current state Senate district map violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, banning voting laws that discriminate based on race.
In a 261-page opinion in a lawsuit brought against the state by the Alabama State Conference of the NAACP, U.S. District Judge Anna Manasco, appointed by President Donald Trump, said to remedy the situation, the Alabama Legislature must draw a new Senate district in the Montgomery area.
“As the Legislature considers such plans, it should be mindful of the practical reality, based on the ample evidence of intensely racially polarized voting adduced during the trial, that any remedial plan will need to include an additional district in the Montgomery area in which Black voters either comprise a voting-age majority or something quite close to it,” she wrote.

Manasco said the plaintiffs had shown that another majority-Black district could be drawn in Montgomery. She rejected a claim from plaintiffs that state Senate districts drawn in the Huntsville area violate Section 2, writing that the plaintiffs had not shown that they could draw a “reasonably configured district” in the Huntsville area where Black voters would constitute a majority.
Should the court’s decision be upheld, it would be the second time in four years a federal court found Alabama’s 2021 congressional and state legislative maps to be racially discriminatory. A three-judge panel that included Manasco ruled in 2022 that the state’s 2021 congressional map did not give Black voters a proper opportunity to choose their preferred leaders, leading to an odyssey that in 2023 resulted in a new congressional map with a majority Black district in west Alabama and a near-majority Black district in the southern Black Belt.
It was not immediately clear Friday if the state would appeal the ruling, though it twice took the congressional case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Messages seeking comment were left Friday for Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall; Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen and Senate Pro Tempore Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman.  Messages were also left with Sen. Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery, and Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, both of whom represent Montgomery in the Alabama Senate.

Alabama NAACP President Banard Simelton said in a phone interview Friday that he expects the state to appeal the ruling, but is grateful the court is looking at the state’s district maps.
“I think in the bigger picture, it reflects, the overall redistricting plan for the state of Alabama was discriminatory. We’re glad that the courts are seeing it for what it is, a discriminatory redistricting plan,” Simelton said. “We will continue to fight for redistricting on the state level, as well as in  municipalities and places like that.”
It was also not immediately clear when maps might be redrawn, should Manasco’s ruling be upheld. A federal court in 2017 ruled that 12 of Alabama’s 105 House districts violated the Voting Rights Act and had to be redrawn. The Legislature did so during that year’s regular session. The Legislature in 2023 drew a new map in a special session; the court rejected the map as unresponsive and ordered its own. Manasco, who ordered new maps be put in place for the 2026 elections, scheduled a status conference for next Thursday.
The plaintiffs claim that the districts in Montgomery and Huntsville dilute Black voting power in the state in violation of the VRA by unconstitutionally packing Black voters into particular districts.
The Alabama chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said the fight is not over.
“We are pleased that the court recognized the injustice in Montgomery and is requiring Alabama to fix its unlawful redistricting. While we are disappointed that Black voters in Huntsville will continue to be denied fair representation, the fight is far from over,” said Davin Rosborough, ACLU’s voting rights project deputy director.
The ruling said the court will draw the new districts if the Legislature does not do so in time for use in upcoming elections.
In both the congressional and Alabama Senate lawsuits, federal judges have noted that voting in Alabama is racially polarized, with white Alabamians tending to support Republicans and Black Alabamians tending to support Democrats. Courts have found that prior maps allowed Black Alabamians, who make up 27% of the population, to have little practical ability to elect their preferred leaders.
The U.S. Supreme Court earlier this month asked plaintiffs in a Louisiana redistricting case to brief them on whether majority-minority congressional districts, the most common method of ensuring minority representation in the U.S. House of Representatives, are constitutional. Ruling them unconstitutional could affect recent decisions about Alabama’s districts.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Leg-7173-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-22 14:57:15.638999

Ron DeSantis and state law enforcement officials Friday touted a recent immigration crackdown in the Panhandle. 
Hours after U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ordered “Alligator Alcatraz” shutdown within 60 days, DeSantis appeared in Panama City, flanked by federally deputized Florida Highway Patrol troopers who participated in a concentrated crackdown on unauthorized immigration.

According to the governor, the operation featured FHP and federal agencies “targeting illegal aliens with criminal records, fugitives, and repeat immigration violators.”
Across three days, 45 troopers and 20 federal personnel in Escambia, Santa Rosa, Walton, Okaloosa, Holmes, Bay, Washington, and Jackson counties apprehended nearly 200 people, DeSantis said. 
The operation, still in process during the news conference, included 37 who’ve previously received final removal orders but had not appeared in court and eight who had been deported before and re-entered the United States, DeSantis said. 
“This operation sends a clear and uncompromising message: We will not tolerate lawlessness in the state of Florida,” DeSantis said. 
People the officers encountered “have fled, resisted arrests, and even physically assaulted officers,” DeSantis said. 
Dave Kerner, director of the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, said local law enforcement’s willingness to house federal inmates has made troopers’ jobs easier. 
“Before we would have to drive hours and hours to a federal facility. That effort alone has allowed us to apprehend hundreds upon hundreds of more illegal immigrants in just a couple days,” Kerner said. 
DeSantis called the task the Panhandle Immigration Enforcement Operation. 
“Moving forward, we don’t have a fancy title or operation title. We had Operation Tidal Wave. We don’t have those anymore because the reality, governor, is, at your direction, this is the way that it’s going to be,” Kerner said. 
Also at the news conference was Lt. Gov. Jay Collins, State Board of Immigration Enforcement Director Larry Keefe, and Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles Col. Gary Howze.

Court ruling
In addition to shutting down the immigration detention facility within 60 days, Williams ordered no new detainees sent there. 
Williams mentioned extensive harm to the Everglades and that the state did not conduct an environmental assessment or issue an environmental impact statement, citing the National Environmental Policy Act. 
“We got news last night that we had a judge try to upset the apple cart with respect to our deportation and detainee processing center down in South Florida at Alligator Alcatraz,” DeSantis said. 
The state has already filed an appeal to Williams’ ruling. 
“This was not something that was unexpected. This is a judge was not going to give us a fair shake. This was preordained. Very much an activist judge that is trying to do policy from the bench. This is not going to deter us,” DeSantis said. 
Williams was appointed by former President Barack Obama. 
“We knew the minute this judge got the case, we knew exactly what she was going to do,” DeSantis said.

A graduate of Jenkins High School and the University of Kentucky, she was active in the UK Alumni Association and her Letcher County community. Quintissa Sherri Peake, who turned a life-altering diagnosis into a lifelong mission, died Aug. 15, at the age of 44. 
Known across Kentucky as an advocate for blood donation and for others fighting sickle cell disease, Peake leaves a legacy of strength and perseverance both in her health advocacy, community contributions and devotion to her faith and family. 
“Quintissa’s impact on this community is a consistent reminder to learn more, advocate for yourself and others, and to defy the odds,” said her friend and executive director of Appalshop, Tiffany Sturdivant. “She was a champion for this community and region.”
The anatomy of Kentucky’s blood supply, and why more need to donate

Peake led a life rich in faith, family and friendship. Born in Neon in Letcher County, to Steve and Rosa Osley Peake, Peake is remembered as a devoted daughter, sister, cousin and aunt; as an invested community member; and as a dear, supportive friend. She is survived by her parents, as well as her two sisters, Latesha Osley and Kaitlyn Peake, and nieces and nephews: Sienna, Kynedi, Alyvia, and Stephen. 
Peake was born into a large extended family of aunts, uncles and cousins. She was intentional about staying in touch with relatives and connecting through family stories and history, said her cousin, Ayanna Peake. She lived out her faith in service to others, Ayanna Peake said, and that always included her family. 
“Family was the essence of who she was. She loved fiercely and was fiercely loved by others and by God, and her life was testimony to what that looked like.” 
 ‘A sickle cell warrior’

Diagnosed with sickle cell disease at 11 months old, Peake’s experience with the disease compelled her to become an advocate for blood donation and sickle cell awareness. Sickle cell disease — also called sickle cell anemia — is a group of inherited disorders that affects the movement of red blood cells throughout the body, and can cause serious medical issues. 
She shared stories of the childhood ambulance rides from the mountains of Southeastern Kentucky to hospitals in Lexington and Louisville, of the family, friends, doctors and health care providers who supported her along the way, and of the blood transfusions that saved her life. In her lifetime, she received more than 500 blood donations. In interviews, she called herself a “sickle cell warrior.”

Peake was employed at Kentucky Blood Center as a donor support specialist from 2009-2013 and remained a devoted volunteer, said Eric Lindsey, director of media and branding for the Kentucky Blood Center. 
“She was one of our finest champions,” Lindsey said.
He recalled a video shoot scheduled in Louisville in the days following the July 2022 flood that devastated East Kentucky and damaged the Peakes’ home. Despite the disaster, Peake showed up in Louisville, three hours away, to appear in the commercial. 
“That’s who she was,” Lindsey said. “She was someone who wanted to help other Kentuckians.” 
Her faith allowed her to show up even when she wasn’t feeling well, said her cousin Ayanna Peake. “She did things even when she was not 100% but she still persisted and did what she needed to and what was in her heart to do,” Ayanna Peake said. 
After graduating from Jenkins High School, Peake earned a bachelor’s degree from the University of Kentucky. She was a longtime volunteer with the UK Alumni Association, serving as a member of the association’s Leadership Advisory Council, a past member of its Board of Directors, as well as a former Fayette County Alumni Club and Lyman T. Johnson Constituent Group volunteer. In 2012, she was awarded the UK’s Joseph T. Burch Young Alumni Award. 
“She loved the University of Kentucky and wanted to leave it better than she found it,” said Jill Smith, executive director of the UK Alumni Association. “Our volunteers loved working with her and respected her. She was a little bit quiet, but people listened when she spoke. She had no enemies.”

After returning to live in Letcher County, Peake became involved in her local community. She served on the Appalshop board of directors and the Cowan Creek Community Action Group board, as well as the Hemphill Community Center. With Cowan, she led the annual Martin Luther King Jr. Breakfast. “Quintissa was moving this work forward in all the right ways,” Cowan leaders posted online this week. “In her honor, with her spirit, we will continue this important work.” 
Earlier this year, Peake was awarded the East Kentucky Leadership Foundation’s Carolyn Sundy Award for her community leadership. The award recognizes an East Kentuckian who has made an extraordinary contribution to understanding, inclusion and social justice in the region.
Recently, she worked at the Center for Rural Strategies as a Rural Assembly Fellow, focusing on health advocacy. Teresa Collins, who worked with Peake at Rural Strategies, said Peake had a welcoming nature that made everyone feel at ease. 
“She was genuinely interested in people and how she could help make everyone’s life better. She loved her family beyond measure,” Collins said. “I will miss her terribly. The world is a bit dimmer without her light.”
Yet that light lives in those she inspired. Her legacy, says friend and colleague Sturdivant, is raising awareness for sickle cell anemia, driving effective conversations around social and economic development for better opportunities and livelihood for local community members, and being an amazing daughter, sister, auntie, and friend.
“Never letting anyone or anything hold her back,” Sturdivant said. “Strength and perseverance rooted in love. That is the legacy she leaves to all of us.”

In Sublette County, a felony animal cruelty charge has stirred feelings of gratitude, but also trepidation that another dark, hate-filled period is on the horizon.
The post A divided Wyoming community, reeling from a tormented wolf and deluge of threats, braces for Cody Roberts’ prosecution appeared first on WyoFile .","PINEDALE—Kari DeWitt knew she was signing herself up for unpleasant times by talking with a journalist. But the 14-year Sublette County resident, office worker and mother of three, did just that, sharing words in support of Cody Roberts. 
“By saying this to you, I will get death threats,” Dewitt said Thursday from a shaded picnic table outside of the public library. “I’m going to have to live with the repercussions of this through Christmas.” 
Next came the words she worries will spur the harassment. 
“Cody is not a psychopath,” DeWitt said. Roberts, she said, is a “good dad.” 
“He did something incredibly stupid while drunk. It’s so bad. I get how bad it is,” Dewitt added. “But I almost feel like the response is as bad. Threatening to rape his daughter is as bad to me as what he did to that poor wolf.” 
Roberts, a 40-something owner of a local trucking company, tormented a gravely injured wolf — an animal he allegedly struck with a snowmobile until “barely conscious” — in a way that attracted global ire.

In February 2024, he posed for photos while holding a beer alongside the wounded animal, its jaw bound with tape. Later, he brought the animal to the Green River Bar in nearby Daniel, where the tape was replaced with a muzzle and the wolf was strapped with an electronic shock collar, images from the night show. In one widely circulated image, he even leans over and kisses the wolf. Officials haven’t commented on how the wolf died, but WyoFile was told the animal was shot behind the bar. Roberts has never commented publicly on the incident.
The scorn was further inflamed by what critics see as the leniency of his punishment, a $250 discretionary fine issued by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department for possessing wildlife. 
But that wave of anger and outrage didn’t just slam into Roberts. It’s tough to overstate the scope of the threats and harassment that subsequently rained down on the 9,000-resident county, which is dotted by historic ranchland and economically driven by gas-drilling and tourism. It occupies a mountainous, sagebrush-strewn swath of Wyoming that’s objectively stunning.

“Our emergency management person, Jim Mitchell, went on special duty just to deal with the backlash,” DeWitt said. “Our sheriff’s office had to assign a whole person to deal with it. And then our schools went on enhanced precautions.” 
“It had died down,” she added, “and that’s the hard part of this.” 
DeWitt, and many others in Pinedale, worry the fury and disruption to normal life is soon to return due to a grand jury’s indictment of Roberts. The charge, of felony animal cruelty, could potentially culminate in a trial that casts another intense spotlight over the community.

Albert Sommers, a cattle rancher and former Wyoming speaker of the House, understands DeWitt’s concerns. After Roberts’ actions with the wolf became public in early 2024, he defended Roberts’ character, calling him a “decent guy,” in a WyoFile interview. 
“I had calls all hours of the day and night,” Sommers recalled Thursday. “Nasty, nasty things.”
Still today, he said, “people are afraid to talk.” 
But not everyone. On a Thursday walkabout along Pinedale’s main drag, Pine Street, a WyoFile reporter and photographer approached a dozen or so locals to gauge the community’s views on the advancing prosecution of Roberts. Most agreed to talk, and even put their names to their reactions, expressing a wide spectrum of feelings. Some shared a desire that the incident, which gave Sublette County a black eye, would just go away. Others were grateful for the indictment, seeing it as a step toward justice. Yet others felt conflicted. 
Longtime Sublette County resident Ricky John Chamberlin took a break from a midday beer and cigarette at the Corral Bar to weigh in. Roberts, who he knew as long ago as middle school, has a history of making a public mockery of captured animals, he said. 
“He’s done this before, with a coyote,” Chamberlain said. “I know this isn’t the first time that he’s done something with wildlife.”

Taking injured animals into establishments as a “novelty” to take photos of and impress friends is behavior that the Pinedale carpenter called “a bunch of shit” and “fucked up.”   
“Torture an animal after you ran it over with a snow machine?” he said. “I believe in animal cruelty. I have a dog.” 
Chamberlin’s also of the mind that the Wyoming Game and Fish and Sublette County “dropped the ball” in their initial response to the incident. In the aftermath of Roberts’ wolf stunt, he was reportedly “going around town telling people it was worth” the $250 fine. Wardens had the option of issuing steeper penalties, requiring a court appearance that could have culminated in jail time, but declined to do so. 
Early on, Sublette County Sheriff K.C. Lehr contended he didn’t even know about the episode until a month later when it blew up in the media. 
But Chamberlin also wasn’t convinced that Roberts deserves jail time. And he chalked up Sublette County Prosecuting Attorney Clayton Melinkovich’s successful effort to charge the Daniel man with a felony as being politically motivated. 
“I think he’s doing a little bit more for reelection,” Chamberlin said.

Incidentally, Melinkovich had answered a question about the same allegation minutes earlier outside the Sublette County Circuit Court building. Grand juries, by nature, can deflect the blowback that can come with charging controversial crimes, because it’s 12 jurists — not the prosecutor — ultimately making the decision. 
Melinkovich maintains that politics — and the vociferous outcry from advocacy groups — had nothing to do with it. 
“I raised my hand to do this job, and part of that job is to prosecute all crimes that occur in Sublette County,” he said. “I’ll tell you this, it wasn’t to take a target off my back. The reality of the situation is that the investigation stalled because of a lack of willingness for people to speak.”

Before the grand jury, just one eyewitness from the bar, out of 30-plus people who stopped by the Green River Bar on Feb. 29, 2024, cooperated with the investigation. Melinkovich guessed it wasn’t because they all condoned Roberts’ behavior. Rather, he speculated it was related to the avalanche of harassment and “people not wanting to be publicly doxxed,” harassed and threatened.
Nevertheless, no one would talk save for the whistleblower who reported the incident. 
“That law enforcement investigation stalled,” Melinkovich said, “and the only way to keep it going was to convene the grand jury.” 
Melinkovich couldn’t discuss the proceedings or evidence presented — it’s sealed and confidential under state statute — but he said publicly at the case’s one-year mark that the delays were because of forces out of his control. A third-party lab took many months to process an undisclosed piece of evidence, and just as the results came in, a heinous murder occurred within his jurisdiction: Big Piney resident Dakota Farley was shot and killed with a compound bow. 
“My attention was drawn to that homicide case, understandably,” the county attorney said.

After Roberts was indicted this week, the news spread widely, with headlines even in the New York Times. In the first 24 hours, Melinkovich didn’t experience any personal blowback to his prosecution’s advancement. Just the opposite. 
“I’ve heard support locally from individuals that I know and don’t know,” Melinkovich said. Emails have come in expressing gratitude from overseas, he said, and over the course of a 12-minute interview, the attorney received three supportive text messages “from around the state.”
Plenty of Pinedale residents are glad Roberts has been charged, and they aren’t afraid to say it. 
“He needs to be prosecuted to the fullest extent,” Bob Swanson, a local builder, said outside the Sublette County administration building. “I’m not a big animal activist, by any means. I’m just a normal guy. There’s obviously a lot of people in Daniel that thought that was OK and acceptable, and I disagree.” 
The Pinedale Roundup editor Cali O’Hare, who’s faced a notably tumultuous month — her newspaper abruptly closed, then was purchased and  reopened — said that she thinks the indictment is a step in the right direction for Sublette County, which has been cast in a “real negative light.” 
“I think it was meaningful to a lot of Sublette County residents that this go through the proper channels, and the proper process, to confirm either his innocence or guilt,” O’Hare said from her office Thursday. “A lot of people that I’ve heard from and talked to, they really felt like all of Sublette County has had to pay the price for his actions — and then lack of accountability, and lack of remorse. They were sort of caught in the crosshairs just by virtue of also living here.”

Harassment and threats haven’t flooded Sublette County only because of out-of-state activist types. O’Hare’s dealt with it too, and been open about it. Out to lunch with fellow journalists in the wolf fiasco’s wake, she noticed a man who wouldn’t stop staring. 
“Finally, he got his check,” O’Hare recalled. “He came over and he looked at me and said, ‘Eat shit, you fucking libtard.’” 
The newspaper editor tracked down the man’s name. “I found that, in fact, he’s been very vocally in support of Cody,” she said. 
Covering the legal proceedings in the months to come will be “super hard” for O’Hare, who isn’t looking forward to it. 
“But I will say that, in light of the last two weeks … it’s a privilege for me to get to be here and continue to tell that story,” she said, noting the community’s brush with becoming a news desert.

Some residents are ready for that story to be done. Heather Bixler, a 14-year resident, bemoaned how the Sublette County Sheriff’s Office can’t post on Facebook a year-plus later — even for an innocuous event like Mother’s Day — without attracting bitter comments about Cody Roberts. 
“We don’t support what he did,” Bixler said. “It’s also the time where we need to move on.” 
The same heavily trolled Facebook page includes a comment, posted below a public safety message about Pine Creek flows, suggesting that Sublette County will never move on. 
“Cody Roberts’ name will forever taint this county,” a faceless Facebook user posted. 
Pinedale retiree Fran Korfanta, a 45-year resident, welcomed the grand jury’s indictment of Cody Roberts, and agrees that her community may never recover.
“The decision was a long time coming, but too late — there should have been more done initially,” Korfanta said along a Pine Street sidewalk. “I don’t think the blemish will ever go away for this area. It will always be there.”

The state’s prison and parole workers are currently represented by the Vermont State Employees’ Association, which handily overcame a challenge from a different out-of-state union in 2021.

An out-of-state union is vying to represent Vermont Department of Corrections staff.
The National Correctional Employees Union filed a petition with the Vermont Labor Relations Board on Thursday requesting an election. In its filing, the union reported more than 30% of unionized Vermont correctional staff had shown a desire to be represented by the new union.
The labor relations board will need to verify that claim and would then schedule an election. To change unions, a majority of the corrections unit would need to vote to make the switch.
This isn’t the first time an out-of-state union has attempted to usurp the Vermont State Employees’ Association by seeking to represent Vermont’s prison and parole workers. In 2021, the New England Police Benevolent Association filed a similar petition. Corrections staff later voted by a nearly two-to-one margin to remain in the state employees’ union.
The Department of Corrections declined to comment.
The National Correctional Employees Union petition was filed by Giovanna Peruzzi, who works as an organizer for the union in Vermont. She previously worked as a Vermont corrections caseworker and for the Vermont State Employees’ Association.
In an interview Friday, Peruzzi said the organizing campaign began in earnest early this year. The appeal of the out-of-state union, which represents over 50 local branches across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, is its focus specifically on corrections, she said. Its staff all have experience working in the industry.
“Corrections is a field unlike any other,” Peruzzi said. “It affects your home life, your family, unlike any other work that is out there. Correctional officers are forgotten about. They do a lot of the same functions as other first responders without any of the recognition.”
Leading up to the union election, Peruzzi said the National Correctional Employees Union team will continue visiting Vermont correctional staff.
“I’m not sure this campaign will be successful,” she said. “I’m hopeful. I feel there’s good energy on the ground and people are looking for new representation.”
The Vermont State Employees’ Association is not perfect, its Executive Director Steve Howard acknowledged in an interview. But the union has a strong track record of representing prison and parole staff and working with Vermont’s state administration, he said. He pointed to $30 million in additional compensation over three years the union secured for corrections staff, as well as a new retirement plan that allows employees to retire earlier.
“We’re going to keep making our case that we are the powerful Vermont union that has a record of success,” Howard said. “(The National Correctional Employees Union) wants to build a massive empire. As soon as they have our members’ dues, they will be on to the next state. We’re not going to do that.”
The current contract for corrections unit staff expires next summer, and bargaining for a new contract began last week, according to Howard.
The primary issue for corrections workers is addressing the department’s staffing crisis, Howard said, a challenging problem for any union to address. But the difference he drew between the two unions is that VSEA has the experience and power to negotiate with the Vermont state government.
“We’re not afraid to speak truth to power, and we’re not afraid to take on the administration,” Howard said. “So I think our members will make the right decision.”

While South Dakota farmers in parts of the state can expect bumper yields due to good weather this season, he said, “commodity prices are in the tank.”
“Input costs are at an all-time high, and the margin for farmers across South Dakota is upside down,” added Thune, a Republican.
Increasing demand for agricultural products through opening markets and trade is a component to improving profitability for farmers, Thune said. South Dakota exports about 60% of its soybeans.

But export markets to some countries like China and in southeast Asia have slowed in recent months as President Donald Trump’s trade and tariff policies play out. The American Soybean Association sent a letter to Trump this week saying that soybean farmers can’t survive a “prolonged trade dispute” with China – the country’s largest soybean customer.
South Dakota Soybean Processors CEO Tom Kersting boasted about another option for South Dakota soybean farmers in the wake of tariffs: the High Plains Processing plant expected to open in mid-October near Mitchell.
Kersting participated in a panel discussion on Wednesday about the new plant before South Dakota’s congressional delegation took the stage. The $500 million plant is expected to process up to 37 million bushels a year – roughly 16% of the state’s 2024 soybean production, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.

The processing plant will include a refining operation and offer byproducts such as soybean meal and hulls as well as lecithin, which has uses ranging from food to lubricants.
The plant aims to fill growing demand in the U.S. for biofuels, Kersting said. The processing plant will offer “more stability in an uncertain future,” Kersting told South Dakota Searchlight after the presentation.
“This will kind of take the place of that export problem and uncertainty out of the marketplace that farmers are facing right now,” Kersting added. “We’re there every day. These export customers come and go.”
South Dakota Soybean Association President Kevin Deinert told South Dakota Searchlight after the panel discussion the operation will allow producers to become less dependent on whole soybean exports to China. Local processing will encourage more use locally, Deinert said, and open markets to other countries.
Kersting added that the processing plant is the first of its kind in South Dakota, with equipment to process seeds from other plants like camalina, canola and sunflowers. Canola and camelina seeds have up to 40-45% oil content, versus the 18-22% present in soybeans.
“Whatever the market demands or takes, we’ll make the most of our money,” Kersting told attendees. “This flexibility was driven off of the increasing demand, not just in the U.S. but globally, for vegetable oils.”
That demand is for biofuels that have “transformed oil markets.” A decade ago, most soybean oil went into food, but about 46% of soybean oil in 2022 and 2023 went toward biofuel production.

Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds said during the policy panel that “the jury is out” on whether tariffs will help or hurt agriculture. If trading partners who normally buy farm and ranch products impose retaliatory tariffs, then that’s a concern.
On the other hand, the tariffs or trade deals arising from tariff threats could force countries to increase their imports of U.S. goods. Some countries in the Pacific Rim are interested in purchasing U.S. ethanol because of the tariffs, Rounds said. That means “at least part of the ethanol that we’ve got right now is going to benefit from those tariffs being imposed,” Rounds said.
“We’ve absolutely got to be adding value to every single product we’ve got here in South Dakota,” Rounds said. “That means running it through as many times as we can. The ethanol plants have got to be able to maximize as much as they possibly can.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_5179-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-22 13:57:29.049289

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said groups challenging a 2013 law banning assault weapons and a second gun control law enacted a decade later could not show that the guns they are still able to possess, including several semi-automatic handguns, are not sufficient for self-defense purposes.
The 2nd Circuit also said public interest favors allowing the ban.
The appeals court said the Second Amendment lets legislators implement targeted regulations designed to protect residents and their children from experiencing tragedies like the Dec. 14, 2012, shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, that claimed 26 lives.
The ruling came at an early stage for two lawsuits brought by individuals and gun rights groups. It upheld a Connecticut judge’s ruling that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a sufficient likelihood that they would win their challenge to block enforcement of the laws while the lawsuits proceed.
Several lawyers who represented plaintiffs in the litigation said in a statement that the ruling “ignores the U.S. Supreme Court’s clear and specific directives, and elevates ideology over constitutional rights. The Supreme Court must put a stop to our courts treating the Second Amendment as if it were not part the Bill of Rights.”
Hannah Hill, vice president for the National Association for Gun Rights’ legal wing, a plaintiff in the lawsuits, said the 2nd Circuit judges displayed an “utter disregard for multiple Supreme Court precedents.”
She said the decision “almost reads like a bingo card for how many ways they can trample on all of those precedents.”
“This is not the end. We’re going to keep fighting,” she said, adding that the Connecticut litigation is one of several efforts in multiple states that gun advocates hope to eventually get the Supreme Court to address.
Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a release that he has “no illusion that today’s clear decision will stop the gun lobby’s relentless campaign to flood our communities with ever more deadly weapons.
“We will not back down, and we are going to fight with everything we’ve got to keep these weapons of war off our streets, out of our schools, and away from our families,” he said.
Joshua Perry, an attorney who is now in private practice but worked on the case when he was Connecticut’s solicitor general, said the ruling was “a comprehensive, important win for the people of Connecticut.”
He added: “We showed that the Constitution doesn’t leave us defenseless against the menace of gun violence.”
In a decision written by Circuit Judge John M. Walker Jr., the appeals court said the proliferation of unusually dangerous weapons has “led to a frequent, growing, and extremely lethal threat to public safety, actual and widely perceived” that the authors of the Constitution could not have imagined.
“And such incidents remain distressingly frequent,” it said. “The Founders faced no problem comparable to a single gunman carrying out a mass murder in seconds.”
The 2nd Circuit, based in Manhattan, said it joined all five other federal appeals courts that have addressed the issue by upholding the ban.
In doing so, it said it recognized “a historical tradition of regulating unusually dangerous weapons after their use in terror or to perpetuate mass casualties.”
It noted that the development of the Thompson submachine gun in 1918 and its subsequent use by gangsters in mass shootings, led to the National Firearms Act of 1934. That law prohibited ownership of machine guns, submachine guns, and short-barreled shotguns.
“Historical legislators regulated these unusually dangerous arms, like here, after observing the regulated weapons’ unprecedented lethality. They did so, like here, to prevent the use of these especially dangerous variants of otherwise lawful types of weapons in further acts of mass homicide and terror,” the judges wrote.

Restoration of Lynn’s waterfront has developers closing in on city’s South Harbor,Hallie Claflin,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/housing/the-new-seaport-district-restoration-of-lynns-waterfront-has-developers-closing-in-on-citys-south-harbor/,"
The waterfront is one of Lynn’s major attractions and has been a key part of the city’s ongoing growth and economic revitalization plans. But affordable housing advocates have raised concerns about the kind of development that Harbor Park has attracted - comparing the South Harbor to Boston's wealthy Seaport District.
The post The new Seaport District? Rest[...]","DESPITE BEING a waterfront city of over 100,000 people, much of Lynn’s coastline has been inaccessible to residents for decades due to environmental hazards. But thanks to a new park, residents can now enjoy a view of Lynn Harbor that had been obstructed by garbage for decades.  
The Lynn Harbor Park finally opened to the public in July after a years-long environmental remediation effort. Spanning 22 acres, the park sits on a failed municipal land-fill – once a plant that used coal to produce gas for lighting, heating, and cooking – that was close to collapsing and releasing waste into the sea. The lot had been vacant for 40 years.  
The project – led by Charter Development in collaboration with the city and the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs – created long-desired green space along the scenic waterfront in an area of Lynn once considered untouchable.  
“Our hypothesis was that if we resolve the environmental liabilities at the core, that that would create confidence, and it would create action that would then attract follow-on investment,” Charter’s founder and president Robert Delhome said in an interview.  
The waterfront is one of Lynn’s major attractions and its development has been a key part of the North Shore city’s ongoing growth and economic revitalization plans. As the Harbor Park project neared completion, investors came flocking to the South Harbor. But affordable housing advocates in Lynn have raised concerns about the kind of development the park has attracted.  
Since the project’s start, two major waterfront housing developments have been established on abutting parcels of land – one of which is the largest private investment in the city’s history.  
Samuels & Associates is planning to build 850 units of much-needed housing and 26,000 square feet of commercial space for restaurant and retail use on the South Harbor site at 830 Lynnway. It will also include an eight-acre public park and promenade. Crews are expected to break ground next summer, according to Mayor Jared Nicholson’s office.  
The Lynn City Council approved a $45 million, 20-year tax break for the Boston-based developers at the end of 2023. Samuels & Associates agreed to designate 10 percent of the units affordable for residents making 60% or less of the area median income (AMI). But local advocacy groups like Neighbor to Neighbor and Lynn United for Change raised concerns about the 900,000-square-foot project’s level of affordability.   
As of 2025, the 60% AMI limit – a measure set by the federal government and used by housing programs to determine eligibility for deed-restricted affordable housing – for a family of four in the Boston-Cambridge-Quincy Metropolitan area, which includes Lynn, is just over $99,000. Lynn’s median homeowner household income of $85,892 is more than double the median renter household income of $34,096. 
But Gabe Cohen-Glinick, an organizer from the Lynn chapter of Neighbor to Neighbor Massachusetts, a social and economic justice group, said 85 out of 850 units isn’t nearly enough to address the need for affordable housing. 
In addition to the 850-unit development, new construction at the former Lynnway Mart Indoor Mall and Flea Market property began in 2022, where 550 “luxury” apartment units have been built on the South Harbor waterfront by Connecticut developer Post Road Residential. “The Shipwright” began leasing this year, and one-bedroom units start at $2,525 per month.  
Local housing activists have compared the development of South Harbor to the technology-driven redevelopment of Boston’s wealthy Seaport District, which has resulted in a mostly high-income, white neighborhood on a previously underutilized waterfront.  
“The vision for the South Harbor feels to us somewhat similar to the nature of Seaport, which is pretty exclusively for mostly young, single adults who are making a high amount of income to live there,” Cohen-Glinick said. “Sort of to create this more trendy, hip, younger, sleek, chic area of development.”  
There is less than one deed-restricted affordable housing unit for every four eligible households in Lynn, according to a 2021 Metropolitan Area Planning Council housing report titled “Housing Lynn: A Plan for Inclusive Growth.” At that time, the city needed 15,405 more affordable housing units just to meet the needs of current residents.  
The report also established that nearly half of Lynn’s residents were at risk of being priced out of the city, with 42% of households qualifying as housing cost burdened, meaning that they spend over 30% of their income on housing.  
But the MassINC Policy Center’s 2024 Gateway Cities Housing Monitor report found little evidence to support fears that extensive gentrification is taking place in Gateway Cities from newcomers driven out of high-cost Boston. Apart from Everett, Malden, and Revere, the report found that those moving into Gateway Cities – largely driven by immigration – have lower incomes than those already there.

The city is expected to receive approximately $120 million in taxes over the next 30 years from the 850-unit development. The property currently generates $60,000 in property tax revenue per year.  
“There’s an urgency around meeting the housing crisis that doesn’t feel as much of a priority as bringing in development money,” Cohen-Glinick said. “The city needs more money. It’s great to have a park. At the same time, the most pressing thing, if you talk to 99% of Lynn renters, is not enough affordable housing.” 
Mayor Nicholson said making the growth on the waterfront inclusive has been a top priority for the city, and that the 10 percent affordability is consistent with the city’s expectations for the contribution of private projects to affordable housing inventory. Private projects can only bear so much affordability until the project is no longer financially feasible.  
“This project will provide much-needed housing, including affordable housing, good jobs targeted to Lynn residents,” Nicholson said in a statement. “The affordable units will have a preference for Lynn residents, and the public park and retail space will make this site into a destination for any Lynn resident, which is critical to making sure growth on the waterfront benefits our community.” 
He added that there are several other 100 percent affordable, publicly funded projects in the works. In 2022, the city of Lynn created an Affordable Housing Trust Fund that has helped to create and preserve affordable developments. Cohen-Glinick argues that while helpful, these projects are slow and limited. 
Charter Development has completed over 50 landfill remediation projects over the last 30 years, according to Delhome. Their brownfield redevelopment expertise helped them tackle the problems at the site, which had seen development stalled for decades. Coal tar contaminants – remnants of the gas plant – were among the hardest to remediate, and capping and covering the failed landfill required a large volume of regulated soils and sediments to be imported.  
“The Harbor Park helped to catalyze almost a billion dollars’ worth of investment on the waterfront, while still creating green space for the residents that are already there,” Delhome said.

Authorities in the West African nation threw him in prison because of his sexual orientation, he said. After his release, he feared that if he stayed in the country, he would be killed.
B., who is now 39 and who asked that he be identified only by his initial because he still has family in Cameroon, arrived in the United States with practically nothing. Since he was granted asylum last year, he has been able to use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, to help him get by.
But now most refugees and asylees, who entered the country legally, including B., are no longer eligible for food stamps. The change is part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the giant federal domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4.
“I think it’s unfair. I understand that there are some people who abuse the system,” B. told Stateline. “There are also people who are in need. And cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.”
SNAP, which is funded by the federal government but administered by the states, helps families and individuals with lower incomes supplement their grocery budgets. The program serves an average of 42 million people a month.

Supporters of the change note that refugees and asylees can get permits to work, and that they have other sources of support.
“It’s not like they have been dropped off in this country with no support system,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that backs stricter immigration rules.
“They have sponsoring organizations that are helping them get settled and they have work authorization. So they really should be moving forward towards self-sufficiency with support right out of the starting gate. And they should be moving ahead to obtain green cards,” she added, referring to the cards that signify permanent residency.
Vaughan cited a federal grant program that reimburses states and nonprofit organizations for financial aid and health care coverage they provide to refugees.
But critics argue that asylees and refugees, who are extensively vetted and have a legitimate path to citizenship, can wait years for a green card, which entitles them to a wider array of benefits.
They also say community organizations that provide aid to asylees and refugees are stretched thin. Without food stamps, they say, many refugees and their families would not have enough to eat.










Cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.


– B., a Cameroonian asylee


“SNAP is an incredibly fundamental program for this population that comes to the United States, really, with very little, if anything,” said Nicolas Palazzo, a policy counsel at the global humanitarian and refugee advocacy organization HIAS. “These are people who literally had to flee — many times overnight — with nothing, but, you know, a pair of clothes in a backpack.”
Palazzo also said SNAP is not a “handout” to refugees or asylees. Rather, he said, it’s a “smart and moral investment” that protects all communities and strengthens the economy, offering people a foundation for self-sufficiency.
“Stripping critical food assistance forces refugees and asylees into the shadows of informal work, labor exploitation and hunger that weakens our workforce and denigrates our moral obligations,” Palazzo said.
‘Nowhere else to go’
B. said he applied immediately for asylum when he arrived in the U.S. in 2016, but that he had to wait months for a work permit. He survived by doing odd jobs, such as cleaning homes and delivering food, and got by on very little. It wasn’t until late 2024, when he finally won his asylum case, that he was eligible to get any public benefits, including food stamps.
Eligibility for food stamps came at a critical time for B., as a car accident had prevented him from making food deliveries.
“While not having income, it was very helpful,” B. said. “I’m somebody who if I can work, I will work. The only reason I went over there to ask is because I had nowhere else to go.”
According to a November 2024 report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, a total of 60,050 people were newly admitted to the United States as refugees in 2023, many from unstable countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Syria and Afghanistan.
In 2023, the nation received at least 747,000 applications for people seeking asylum from countries including Venezuela, Cuba and Colombia, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration research group. It’s a tremendous increase from the 68,000 applications received in 2013.
The new domestic policy law specifies that food stamps are still available to Cubans and Haitians who might be refugees and asylees.

As of July 2025, more than 2.2 million immigrants in the U.S. are awaiting asylum hearings or decisions after formally applying for asylum, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, an organization at Syracuse University that tracks immigration cases.
“Getting through the system was difficult,” B. said. “I had to find money. I had to find an attorney who would help me apply for my asylum case. The asylum case itself took a long time.
“I still know people who have been here for more than 10 years and never had an interview.”
‘Already stretched’
According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, half of all admitted refugees in 2023 were resettled across just 10 states: Texas, New York, California, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan and Washington.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 41,000 people in the state are getting SNAP benefits while not being lawful permanent residents. She says that group includes refugees and asylees.
“The concerning part there is that these are individuals who were … lawfully admitted to the country, have previously been eligible for SNAP when they need it, and now, simply because of their status, will no longer be able to receive SNAP benefits,” Guinn told Stateline. “There’s nothing we’re going to be able to do to make them eligible.”
Another change under the new law is that for the first time, states will have to pay for a portion of their food stamp programs. States will have to cover between 5% and 15% of their SNAP costs beginning in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they dole out benefits to people eligible for the program.
Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, pointed out that states that want to continue to provide SNAP benefits to refugees and asylees are free to do so — as long as they pay for it.
“If New York state doesn’t want to cut these people off, they can continue to give them something like food stamps. They just have to do it with New York state money right now,” Rector said.

But Guinn said that will be difficult. New York does offer asylum-seekers cash assistance of $180 a month through its Safety Net Assistance Program, but typically recipients must be working.
In Texas, officials at the state’s health and human services agency said that as of last month, roughly 24,600 of the state’s 3.5 million SNAP recipients were refugees or asylees. A spokesperson for Maryland’s human services agency wrote in an email that the state’s SNAP program last year supported more than 10,000 refugees and asylees.
The California Department of Social Services could not provide the number of refugees and asylees receiving food stamps, but projected that a total of 74,000 noncitizens — including lawfully permanent residents, refugees and asylees — would lose eligibility under the new law.
Sherri Laigle, the director of social services at HIAS, said food banks will not be able to make up for refugees’ and asylees’ loss of SNAP benefits.
“They’re already stretched, and now we’re going to see tens of thousands of people also needing to continue to rely on these programs. Of course, there’s limited access to them. You have to have transportation. You have to be able to get there.”
B. said he would apply for food stamps again if he could, because he’s earning too little income to get by.
“There are people who are in need. I think ignoring that — it’s not human.”

The nonprofit’s filing Thursday marks the latest in a seven-year-old case stemming from Gov. Henry McMaster’s 2018 executive order that sought to ban all Medicaid reimbursements to Planned Parenthood’s two clinics in the state.
The order never took effect. Planned Parenthood immediately sued, and the lawsuit blocked the directive as the case bounced back and forth in the courts. A ruling in June by the U.S. Supreme Court seemed to settle it and, on Thursday morning, South Carolina was officially given permission to carry out the order.
Within hours, Planned Parenthood filed a new challenge. It wants the courts to consider a different argument and is seeking to again block the order while the amended complaint plays out.
McMaster’s spokesman called it “nothing more than a desperate, last-gasp attempt to relitigate an issue that has already been decided.”
“The U.S. Supreme Court has made clear that South Carolina has the right to exclude abortion providers from our Medicaid program,” said Brandon Charochak.
But Planned Parenthood contends the nation’s high court didn’t directly address the state’s ability to exclude the provider. The ruling involved who sued. Justices ruled Medicaid patients don’t have the right to sue to see their doctor of choice.
The new filing removes the patient from the complaint.
Rather than sue on someone’s behalf, Planned Parenthood’s new filing argues the state is violating the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause by unfairly targeting the nonprofit.
The case is not about abortion — not directly, anyway — but whether South Carolinians can use their Medicaid health coverage at Planned Parenthood for services such as breast and cervical cancer screenings, birth control, and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections.
“What started as a crusade against abortion has devolved into an even greater assault on essential, preventive care,” Paige Johnson, President and CEO of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, said in a statement. “The cost of this political attack will be the health and well-being of hardworking South Carolinians — cancers will go undetected, STIs will go untreated, and people won’t have the birth control they need to plan their futures.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img_3704-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-22 13:57:29.049289

Phil Murphy Friday direct regulators to expand community solar generation and offer incentives for large-scale battery storage plants.,"The new laws signed by Gov. Phil Murphy Friday direct regulators to expand community solar generation and offer incentives for large-scale battery storage plants. (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)Gov. Phil Murphy signed two bills meant to boost renewable energy generation in New Jersey on Friday, as tightening supply and surging demand push electricity prices to record levels with even more hikes on the horizon.
The first bill allows state energy regulators to register an additional 3,000 megawatts of community solar capacity, while the other would create an incentive program to stand up 1,000 megawatts of battery storage by 2030.
“Today, there are roughly 650,000 homes throughout the Garden State that are powered by solar energy. With these bills, we’re going to increase that number to 1 million homes by 2028,” Murphy said during a bill signing at a union hall in Lawrenceville. “That’s an increase of over 50% in just three years. That means cheaper, cleaner energy for tens of thousands of New Jerseyans at a faster pace than ever before.”
Democratic and labor officials praised the expansion of community solar, which allows homeowners and businesses to invest in nearby small-scale solar farms to receive credits on their power bills.
Community solar is meant to provide solar access to individuals and firms that are unable to access rooftop and other solar systems because they rent, occupy a multi-unit building, or lack roofs that can host a solar system.
New Jersey’s solar capacity has more than doubled under Murphy’s two terms as governor, rising from 2.4 gigawatts to 5.2 gigawatts, and its boosters said community solar delivers guaranteed savings for those enrolled.
“Over 28,000 New Jersey residents are subscribed and are saving money through the community solar program due to the guaranteed bill savings of at least 15%,” said Christine Guhl-Sadovy, president of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities.
The state’s foray into battery storage would be its first, and New Jersey officials are hoping to make the state a leader in the field. Though battery storage plants do not generate electricity themselves, they can store power generated at points of low demand and release it when demand is high, easing price peaks.
To apply for the incentives, storage projects must have a completed interconnection agreement, or developers must have conducted certain interconnection studies with PJM, the states’ grid operator, and be expected to be operational by Dec. 31, 2030.
Eligible plants could receive up to $10 million in incentives, at a rate of $100,000 per megawatt. Those awards would be paid over 15 years, with the first payment due only after a project becomes operational.
Some experts have urged the state to pursue storage projects because they come online faster than other types of generation. Nuclear plants, for example, can take a decade to build. Some storage projects have been stood up in less than two years.
Incentives would initially be funded by $60 million in revenue from the state’s societal benefits charge, a roughly 3% surcharge on energy bills used to fund energy assistance, clean energy, and social programs, among other things.

“This money is not money that’s being added to the rates of ratepayers. You don’t want the solution to be part of the aggravation to our citizens,” said Sen. Bob Smith (D-Middlesex), the storage bill’s prime Senate sponsor.
The push for new generation comes as New Jersey and the 12 other states on PJM’s grid, along with others throughout the country, see surges in electricity prices driven mostly by artificial intelligence data centers’ mammoth electricity demands. Officials have approved bill credits and deferred a portion of some electricity bills to ease the impact of rate hikes.
Democratic officials have blamed PJM for being too slow to connect renewable projects to its grid, while Republicans have charged Murphy’s wind-heavy energy agenda is to blame.
Among other things, PJM’s rules prioritize projects with higher effective load-carrying capacity, a generation type’s ability to produce electricity at times of peak demand. Because they cannot operate at night and in adverse weather conditions, solar projects have by far the lowest rating on that scale — 8% for fixed-tilt and 11% for tracking solar, compared to 50% to 70% for storage projects and 60% to 78% for various gas types of plants.
The state’s offshore wind projects are stalled or abandoned after adverse economic conditions and a hostile regulatory posture at the federal level that has seen offshore wind leases and permits paused or withdrawn.
The federal government’s resistance to renewables could stall the investments officials hope the bills signed Friday would spur.
Provisions in the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act require renewable projects to begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be in service by Dec. 31, 2027, to be eligible for two types of tax credits, one that pays a fixed amount for electricity generated and another that offsets capital investments for some projects.
The federal bill also made changes to program rules that will make it more difficult for projects that meet the time bar to qualify for credits.

A Florida resident already sits in the White House, surrounded by many top aides and federal officials who hail from the Sunshine State. 
On Friday, the Republican National Committee unanimously voted to elevate state Sen. Joe Gruters, a long-time supporter of President Donald Trump who has a strained relationship with Gov. Ron DeSantis, to the post of RNC chair.
In a brief acceptance speech, Gruters thanked Trump for his support and focused on party unity, stressing that the future “isn’t about one person.”
“The midterms are ahead, where we must expand our majority in the House the Senate and continue electing Republicans nationwide, and then we march towards the presidential election where the stakes cannot be higher,” he said. 
“The Democrats want open borders, socialist policies, and weak leadership. We want strong families, secure communities, and American greatness. That’s why we must unite, innovate, and work harder than before.”
Gruters, a former chair of the Republican Party of Florida who has served as RNC treasurer, was hand-picked by Trump after RNC chair Michael Whatley announced he was stepping down to run for a U.S. Senate seat in North Carolina.
Whatley, who introduced Gruters to the gathering, credited him for turning Florida from a purple to a red state. Gruters led the state party from 2019 to 2023 as the number of Republican voters surpassed that of Democrats.
In an interview with the Florida Phoenix Thursday, Gruters said his main focus is to help Trump maintain majorities in both the House and Senate during the mid-term elections.
“I’m 100% completely focused on supporting the president, his mission, his vision, and making sure that we’re successful in midterms,” Gruters said.

Gruters takes the reins as Trump pushes for the elimination of mail-in voting and while rival states controlled by Republicans and Democrats engage in tit-for-tat redistricting, especially Texas and California. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has been pushing the state Legislature to look at drawing a new congressional map. His party already controls 20 of Florida’s 28 congressional seats.
“We don’t need redistricting to hold on to the majorities in the House and Senate,” Gruters said. “We’re going to win because the president is committed to winning. I think that we have the right messaging. I think we have the right coalitions.”
Gruters plans to remain in the Florida Senate while heading the RNC and said he was therefore barred against discussing any redistricting effort in Florida. The Florida Constitution includes “Fair Districts” amendments that say legislators cannot redraw maps for partisan gain. Some Florida Republicans have maintained that they could gain several seats if they make changes to existing districts.
 ‘Gold standard,’ ‘golden ticket’

On mail-in voting, Gruters called Florida’s system, which allows it, the “gold standard.” It’s a position DeSantis also takes.
But Gruters did not question Trump’s push to get rid of it. He also said the RNC would be “aggressive” with litigation to preserve “election integrity.”
“We’re here to make the president successful,” Gruters said. “And I think what the president’s looking for is to make sure that we protect the vote.”
While Gruters and DeSantis share the same position on Florida’s mail-in voting, the men routinely have been at odds.
Gruters was one of a minority of Republicans in the Legislature who endorsed Donald Trump over DeSantis early in the GOP presidential primary in 2023. Gruters in the 2024 election supported Amendment 3 to legalize recreational marijuana, while DeSantis aggressively and successfully lobbied for its defeat. Gruters sponsored legislation quashing governors’ oversight of immigration policy that the Legislature passed in January but DeSantis vetoed.
Gruters’ elevation to national leadership will have ripple effects in Florida’s elections. He says he’s got Trump’s endorsement, a coveted “golden ticket” that he could have cashed in had he continued his planned run for state chief financial officer. DeSantis recently appointed another state senator, Blaise Ingoglia, to that Florida Cabinet post.
In appointing Ingoglia, DeSantis criticized Gruters as insufficiently conservative for GOP voters. He told reporters in July, “If George Washington rose from the dead and came back and tapped me on the shoulder and said, ‘Will you appoint Joe Gruters CFO?’ my response would be ‘No.’ “
Gruters insisted during the interview that he would have prevailed in a primary against Ingoglia had he pushed ahead.
“At the end of the day, I had the president,” Gruters said. “People don’t like this comment, but I had the golden ticket. And I’m sure George Washington appreciates the fact that I’m going to be chairman. If he was alive, he’d be cheering for me as chairman of the party, because we’re  going to win and we’re going to win big.”

The president first called for Cook’s resignation earlier this week, after Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte made a criminal referral to the Department of Justice on Wednesday, accusing Cook of falsifying bank documents and property records “to acquire more favorable loan terms,” for properties in Ann Arbor, Michigan and Atlanta, Georgia.
Now, both Trump and Pulte are bolstering their attack on Cook, with Pulte posting documents to social media on Friday accusing Cook of misrepresenting her Atlanta property as her primary residence while listing the same property for rent. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Alongside Cook, Pulte has made referrals against New York Attorney General Letitia James, who secured judgment against Trump for misrepresenting his assets in financial statements, and Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who served as the lead prosecutor in Trump’s first impeachment, accusing all three of mortgage fraud. In another post on Friday, Pulte said he would be making referrals against two additional individuals.

A spokesperson for the Board of Governors had no additional comment to share, referring the Michigan Advance to Cook’s previous remarks on the allegations. 
“I learned from the media that FHFA Director William Pulte posted on social media that he was making a criminal referral based on a mortgage application from four years ago, before I joined the Federal Reserve. I have no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet,” Cook said in a statement Wednesday evening. “I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.”
Trump’s call for Cook’s resignation comes amidst his ongoing fight with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, with the president demanding Powell cut federal interest rates.
Under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, members can only be removed by the president “for cause.” 
Cook was nominated to fill an empty seat on the Board of Governors in 2022 by Democratic former President Joe Biden. She was confirmed for an additional, full term in 2023, which will expire on Jan. 31, 2038.
Cook is the first Black Woman to serve on the board, previously serving as a professor of economics and international relations at Michigan State University and a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research. 
Cook has also served as a senior economist on the Council of Economic Advisers under Democratic former President Barack Obama from 2011 to 2012 and as a senior adviser on finance and development in the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of International Affairs from 2000 to 2001.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/trumpjohnsonmay202025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-22 13:57:29.049289

The $2.5-billion Steel Dynamics aluminum mill is visible from one window and the airport from another. Just down the road are the Airbus factory that has built 1,700 helicopters, the 400-acre PACCAR site that churns out engines and Stark Aerospace, which was awarded a $61-million defense contract last year. These are companies that Joe Max Higgins and his team have helped bring to the area. 
“It’s in the middle of the kingdom,” said Higgins, the CEO of Golden Triangle Development LINK. “I mean, you can just look. It’s all here. You can just walk around and see everything.”

The headquarters was previously located on Main Street in Columbus. But Higgins said that the agency has wanted to move to a more central location for a while. The new headquarters sits on land owned by the Golden Triangle Regional Airport, which is run by all three counties. 
LINK  is the regional economic development organization for the three-county area known as the Golden Triangle. It is funded by the three county governments and private backers. This melding of public and private interests was represented at Tuesday’s opening event by the attendance of public officials and business leaders.
The event honored Bobby Harper, a former member of the board of directors, who was instrumental in acquiring private funders to support the organization. 
“We could not be here today without Bobby’s work,” said Higgins at the opening ceremony.
The three counties now work together on economic development but it wasn’t that way when Higgins started. At first he was just working for Lowndes County.

“I was real slow to embrace the regionalism stuff. I just always believed that the only way you win is to tear everybody’s face off,” said Higgins. “That’s still true, but I will tell you that once we put the three counties together, I found out that I had more bullets for a gun, more resources, more places for people to live, more opportunities, and more money.”
Higgins is legendary for his economic development efforts, even outside of Mississippi. He’s been negotiating deals for the Golden Triangle since he was recruited from Arkansas in 2003. Since then his team has brought in over $10 billion in capital investment and over 10,000 jobs.

In the process, Higgins has developed a national profile for bringing in manufacturing jobs to the region. This has included profiles on 60 Minutes and in The Atlantic. 
Even as more manufacturing moved out of the U.S., the Golden Triangle has continued to invest in manufacturing. And it’s not slowing down.
The group is working on finding a company for its fifth “megasite,” a 1,400-acre piece of land that can accommodate a large scale industrial operation. The organization recently announced a $90-million aluminum processing facility is in the works close to their new headquarters. 
“The guy that grabs a hold on a tiger. The Tiger starts running. What do you do?” Higgins responded when asked what the next 20 years of development in the Golden Triangle would look like. “Do you let go and the tiger eats you up, or hang on and you don’t know where you’re gonna end up? I think you hang on, and so I think that’s what we’re gonna do.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/22095555/MG_8131.jpg,,,2025-08-22 13:57:29.049289

Jason Crow of Centennial, both Democrats, held a town hall on Aug. 21, 2025 at Smoky Hill High School in Aurora. (Photo by Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline) Two of Colorado’s Democratic members of Congress held a town hall at an Aurora high school Thursday, speaking to a crowd of about 500 people as the Colorado Legislature convened for special session to cope with a billion-dollar state budget gap.
U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet and U.S. Rep. Jason Crow of Centennial answered constituent questions about concerns with artificial intelligence, environmental protection, bipartisanship and preserving democracy, among others at a town hall at Smoky Hill High School in Aurora in Crow’s district. 
Crow said the Republican tax and spending cut bill Trump signed into law in July poses a “tremendous threat to the lives and the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of people that we represent.” He called the measure — known as H.R. 1, or the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — “the worst piece of legislation that we have ever voted on.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The Colorado Legislature is currently in a special session to address a $1.2 billion hole in the state budget the federal legislation created, because Colorado’s income tax code automatically mirrors changes at the federal level.
All four Republican members of Colorado’s congressional delegation voted in favor of the bill. All four Democrats in the House and both of Colorado’s Democratic U.S. Senators voted against it.
Concern with actions from the Trump administration was a common theme among town hall attendees. Paul Stedman, a 72-year-old Aurora resident wearing a shirt with the American flag that read “pro-America, anti-Trump,” asked what can be done to “preserve this democracy that I’ve enjoyed and felt like it was safe for all these years, and now I don’t feel that it is.”
Crow said citizen oversight will help elected officials remain aware of ways the federal government is overstepping, as they can let their members of Congress know when they have problems with their federal benefits or agencies they interact. 
“It’s getting harder to do oversight in the federal government because of the blockades, because of what this majority has allowed to have happen with this administration, so citizen oversight is becoming very important,” Crow said. “We must build a coalition of pro-democracy, patriotic Americans who are willing to stand up, even if we disagree on policy, and says, ‘No, not on my watch. We will defend this democracy, we will fight for the fundamentals of it.’”
Instead of asking a question for the Democrats to answer, one constituent asked both Crow and Bennet to do more to call out President Donald Trump’s lies, and said town halls are for communicating concerns to their elected officials, “not a rally for politicians.” She both should use their national platform to speak out more against the president’s actions and words. 
Call for AI regulations
After a constituent asked what is being done to increase federal research spending on AI and to encourage safe and responsible deployment, Crow said “we’re not remotely ready for it as a society.” 
Crow said AI can be an important tool, but the lack of regulation of AI is concerning. He also said it could lead to “one of the greatest workforce displacements in history,” estimating AI may replace up to 20% of the workforce. 
“We haven’t seen anything like that since the Industrial Revolution,” Crow said. “It could cause major upheaval, and we have to get ready for that retraining, that re-skilling, that transition for a lot of folks.”
Both Bennet and Crow agreed that AI also presents national security concerns and would like to see the U.S. lead a convention or treaty to establish guardrails against AI with other major world leaders.
“We are at the cusp of a technological revolution on the scale of software or the internet, and we don’t know on the front end how all that is going to go,” said Bennet, who is running for Colorado governor in 2026.
Colorado passed a first-in-the-nation sweeping AI regulation in 2024 to set anti-discrimination guardrails for businesses that use the technology in decisions on consequential matters such as loans, employment, insurance policies and school admissions. Colorado state legislators are considering four bills to modify that law during the special session currently underway.
‘He’s lost my support’
A group of people stood outside of the high school holding a Palestinian flag and handing out flyers with information on funding the federal government has sent to Israel and campaign contributions both Bennet and Crow have accepted from pro-Israel lobbying groups. During the event, staff for Crow and Bennet escorted out a small group of people who interrupted to ask about their support for Israel, a scene that has recurred at Democratic town halls in Colorado and across the country. 
Centennial resident Kimberly Roy and her son Adan, who is a senior at Smoky Hill, have campaigned on Crow’s behalf since he first ran for office, Kimberly said. But at the town hall Thursday, Kimberly came with a Jason Crow-branded t-shirt and Adan with a bunch of yard signs in hand that they wanted to return to him because “he’s lost my support.”
Bennet and Crow, she said, showed a “complete disregard to the people who brought up the genocide going on in Gaza, where babies are being shot and killed with our weapons.”
“They said, not only nothing, but they kicked them out and did not address the issue,” Kimberly said. “That is the moral litmus test of our time, and they failed.”
“I value these pieces of plastic far less than I value the lives of children,” Adan said while holding Crow’s campaign signs. “I’m hearing a lot of excuses or inaction against banal evil.”
Recent reports estimate about quarter of the population in Gaza is experiencing famine and more than 60,000 Palestinians — including almost 19,000 children — have been killed by Israeli military since Israel’s intense bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza began after Oct. 7, 2023, when a Hamas-led attack killed more than 1,200 people in Israel. Israeli leadership announced plans to completely seize Gaza and forcibly displace about a million residents in early August, which Bennet released a media statement condemning. 
“I’m heartbrokenly disappointed. I thought he had courage, and what he is showing right now is cowardice,” Kimberly said of Crow. “There are babies and children dying today that if he said something, he can make a difference, and he is not addressing it because it’s politically hard.”
Kimberly said she would have wanted to see Crow and Bennet speak less and listen more to the concerns constituents at the town hall wanted to share. She heard “a lot of self-congratulation” from the two Democrats touting their accomplishments in Congress, but that given the “perilous state” the country is in, “this is the time to be humble and listen to what they need to be doing better, not try to sell us on what they’ve done that’s good.”
Aurora resident Sandra Parker-Murray said she wished Crow and Bennet would have addressed the people who were escorted out after interrupting to ask why they continued to approve sending money to Israel. 
“I felt like they should have given those people the opportunity to ask those questions,” Parker-Murray said. “Why are we sending so much to Israel for genocide, and then our children here are hungry? I wanted them to address that because it happens all the time at these town halls, but they never address the issue.”

Gavin Newsom unveiled his plan to retaliate if Republican-led Texas redrew its congressional districts to favor the GOP, he affirmed his support for less partisan maps — and then promised to “meet fire with fire.”
“We’re doing it mindful that we want to model better behavior,” Newsom told reporters in Los Angeles earlier this month, nodding to the independent system his state currently uses to draw districts. “ … But we cannot unilaterally disarm. We can’t stand back and watch this democracy disappear.”
President Donald Trump’s call for Republicans to redraw U.S. House districts so the party can win more seats in the 2026 midterm elections — to gerrymander them — has triggered a redistricting frenzy this summer that also threatens to prompt moves by Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and New York, among others. Ohio was already set to redraw its lines, even before the current fracas.
The battle for partisan advantage is placing Democratic politicians, advocates of less partisan maps and others who support curbs on gerrymandering in an uncomfortable position, pitting their desire for change against fears that Trump will take advantage of their scruples to wring more GOP seats out of a handful of key states. Some say they accept that Democratic states need to respond, while others warn retaliation will only yield short-term gains.
The Texas House passed a new map on Wednesday, clearing the way for a final vote in the state Senate and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s signature. In California, lawmakers passed their own map on Thursday, setting up a statewide vote in November over the new districts.
Other states are now likely to follow, as Republicans and Democrats scramble for a political leg up.










I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard. 


– David Daley, senior fellow at FairVote


But gerrymandering opponents say the current moment has the potential to produce new energy for their movement. More people are paying attention to gerrymandering, they say, and new polls show the public opposes the practice. The rush to redraw maps demonstrates the need for Congress to set national limits, they say.
“I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard,” said David Daley, an author of books on gerrymandering and a senior fellow at FairVote, a Maryland-based nonpartisan group that supports ranked choice voting and multimember House districts to end the practice. “We will never have reform if a handful of states can act on their own.”
At the same time, some gerrymandering opponents fear states will unravel hard-fought victories. They wonder whether temporary measures, such as California potentially setting aside the independent commission it uses to redraw maps, could become permanent.
 ‘An unprecedented time’

State legislatures exercise primary control over congressional redistricting in 39 states, according to All About Redistricting, a compendium of information on map-drawing hosted by Loyola Law School in California. While some states use other methods, only nine states rely on independent commissions, which typically limit participation by elected officials and are favored by many gerrymandering opponents.
Most states draw maps once a decade after the census, making the mid-decade maneuvers and counter-maneuvers highly unusual (six states currently have only one representative, eliminating the need to draw district lines). But just a few seats could determine who controls the U.S. House. Republicans currently hold 219 seats to Democrats’ 212, with four vacancies.
“We affirm that gerrymandering, both racial and political, disenfranchises voters,” Virginia Kase Solomón, president and CEO of Common Cause, an organization that has long advocated for changes to the redistricting process, said during a press call the day before Newsom’s announcement.
“But this is an unprecedented time of political upheaval,” she said. People don’t want to see a situation develop where maps are redrawn every two years, she added.

The new Texas map could ease the path for Republicans to win an additional five seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Texas lawmakers rapidly advanced the redraw this week once Democratic state lawmakers returned to the state. They had traveled to other states to deny Texas House leaders the quorum required to approve the map, but returned after Newsom outlined California’s response.
Gerrymandering typically involves “packing” and “cracking.” “Packing” refers to the concentration of opposition party voters in a small number of districts to reduce competition elsewhere. “Cracking” means diluting the voting power of the opposing party’s supporters across many districts.
Texas Republicans have been frank that they are pursuing the redraw for partisan advantage. But they emphasize that no prohibition exists, in Texas or nationally, against mid-decade redistricting and that a 2019 U.S. Supreme Court decision cleared the way for states to draw maps for partisan purposes, removing the power of federal courts to police political gerrymandering.
The new maps give Republicans a chance of winning additional districts but doesn’t guarantee victories, they add.
“The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance,” Texas state Rep. Todd Hunter, a Republican who carried the bill in the Texas House, said during floor debate on Wednesday. He added a short time later: “According to the U.S. Supreme Court, you can use political performance, and that is what we’ve done.”
 Tricky terrain

As Texas moves forward and California prepares to respond, Common Cause illustrates the tricky terrain anti-gerrymandering advocates are now navigating.
The group, headquartered in Washington, D.C., fought to enact the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2008. But earlier this month, Common Cause declined to condemn California’s retaliation, saying it will judge the effort by whether the maps are a proportional response to gerrymanders in other states, whether the process includes meaningful public participation, and whether the maps expire and are replaced after the 2030 census through the state’s regular redistricting process, among other criteria.
Newsom’s proposal, the Election Rigging Response Act, will ask California voters in November to temporarily set aside the state’s redistricting commission and approve the new map drawn by the legislature. The commission would resume drawing maps following the census.

Recent polling shows widespread public opposition to gerrymandering. A YouGov poll of 1,116 Americans conducted in early August found 69% believe it should be illegal to draw districts in a way that makes it harder for members of a particular political party to elect their preferred candidates. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The number of Americans who say gerrymandering is a big problem has jumped in recent years. In the YouGov poll, 75% of respondents said it is a major problem when districts are intentionally drawn to favor one party, up from 66% in a 2022 survey.
Some California Republicans have responded to Newsom’s proposal by defending the commission system. A group of Republicans sued in state court to block the plan, but the California Supreme Court on Wednesday denied a request to temporarily halt the effort.
 ‘Is this bad for reform?’

While members of the public might say they favor citizen-led commissions, they may not care deeply about the issue, said David Hopkins, a political science professor at Boston College who has written on polarization in American politics. He called gerrymandering a “classic process subject” that comes off as “inside baseball” to many people.
“The legislators in states that haven’t adopted commissions clearly don’t feel any particular political pressure to do so,” Hopkins said.
Some Republicans in states weighing a mid-decade gerrymander also discount the risk of a public backlash.
In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe may call a special session this fall to redraw the state’s map in hopes of gaining an additional GOP seat in the U.S. House. James Harris, a Missouri Republican consultant with close ties to GOP officials in the state, said he wasn’t concerned redistricting would create momentum to change the process.
Missouri voters in recent years have approved ballot measures favored by Democrats, including one in 2018 that empowered a nonpartisan demographer to draw state legislative districts, though not congressional districts. But Republicans led a successful campaign to convince voters to repeal the changes two years later.
Harris painted any new potential map as part of a national effort to help Trump — who received 58.5% of the vote in Missouri last November.
“I think the lens is wanting to make sure the president has a majority in Congress so he can actually govern for the last two years versus two years of investigations, gridlock,” Harris said.
Advocates of less partisan maps said lawmakers aren’t likely to surrender their own role in mapmaking. While some state courts may limit redistricting excesses, federal courts stopped policing partisan gerrymandering following the Supreme Court’s 2019 decision. And the high court may soon weaken the judiciary’s power to block race-based gerrymandering.
Samuel Wang, director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, which supports eliminating partisan gerrymandering, said the “one good thing” about the redistricting battle is that it’s prompted voters to pay attention to an arcane and technical issue. That could be a positive in the long run, he said, “if people can keep a cool head.”
Wang has written online that any response to Texas should remain measured and proportionate. California offers Democrats the only clean option to strike back, Wang wrote. Five Democratic seats could be added by redrawing the state.
“Is this bad for reform? I mean, I’m torn,” Wang told Stateline. “Because on the other hand, Democrats have been, over the last few decades, vocal in their advocacy for voting rights in various forms and now that advocacy is in question because they find a need to fight fire with fire.”
“So I guess the way I would characterize it is if they can hold it in check and not do it in every single state and just engage in whatever they’re doing where it will make a difference,” he said, “then we might not lose all the progress that’s been made.”

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — County treasurers must correctly calculate and distribute the payments made by public utilities in lieu of paying property taxes. They also must correct any mistakes they make, the Nebraska Supreme Court ruled on Friday.
Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr., who was the treasurer at the time in Douglas County, overpaid the Omaha Public Schools, the City of Omaha and Douglas County from payment in lieu of taxes (PILOT) funds in 2021. His name is on the case that sorted out the duties of local treasurers.

But Chief Justice Jeffrey Funke’s opinion makes plain that its aim is to clarify some confusion a lower court ruling left over whether county treasurers had the duty and ability to fix such funding mistakes they make as part of their ministerial duties.
At stake is sorting out potentially millions of dollars in annual payments county treasurers distribute to school districts from the utilities that provide electricity statewide. 
“The ministerial duty is one imposed on the treasurer to distribute the PILOT funds based on the exact formula adopted by the people and required by the Legislature,” Funke wrote. “In requiring that the treasurer distribute the PILOT funds in a specific manner, it must be … that the treasurer’s duty is only accomplished when he or she has facilitated that exact and particular distribution.”
The high court also clarified that Omaha’s Westside Community Schools was well within its rights to file a second legal bid to recoup the funds it was not paid from 2019 through 2021 after a lower court vacated the initial case on a technicality. 
A state audit that spurred much of the legal action found that in 2021 Westside was underpaid by $3.7 million and that schools in Elkhorn and Ralston were underpaid by more than $4 million. Omaha Public Schools, the audit found, received about $5.6 million too much. The City of Omaha received $4.4 million too much. And Douglas County received $2.7 million too much.

The court case avoided assigning specific amounts owed. 
Lawyers for the Omaha school district had argued that the law was murky on whether the treasurer could collect funds overpaid to districts, based on the previous formula calculations, an argument the state Supreme Court rejected.
“Westside has met its burden of proving that it is entitled to the PILOT funds it did not receive,” the ruling states.
Ewing has previously defended his office’s mistake, describing it as an inherited interpretation of state law that the Douglas County Treasurer’s Office had used for six decades. Ewing’s opponents in the mayor’s race made an issue of the payments during his successful bid to unseat incumbent Mayor Jean Stothert. 
Westside, OPS and Ewing had no immediate comment Friday.

(Photo by Alon Skuy/Getty Images)A federal judge has ordered that no more immigrant detainees be sent to the state’s immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades and known as “Alligator Alcatraz.” The judge also called upon the government to begin dismantling much of the facility.
U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams of the Southern District of Florida gave both the state and federal government 60 days to move out existing detainees and to begin removing temporary fencing, lightning features, and generators, gas, sewage and other waste and receptacles installed to support the project.
In her 82-page decision, Judge Williams cited extensive harm to the Everglades caused by operation of the facility, which was built in eight days.
The state of Florida filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeal for the Eleventh Circuit immediately after the order was released.
Two environmental groups — Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity — filed a lawsuit in late June, shortly after the state announced that the facility was about to open, claiming the plan had not gone through any environmental review as required under federal law. They were joined in the lawsuit by the Miccosukee Tribe.
In her ruling, Judge Williams agreed, saying that under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the government was required to issue an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) or conduct an Environmental Assessment (EA). “The Defendants chose not to do so,” she wrote.
“The Defendants’ decision to refrain from issuing an EIS or conducting an EA, and then building a detention camp, represents a determinative position on the matter and has adversely affected Plaintiffs’ recreational, conservational, and aesthetic interests,” she wrote in her order. “Accordingly, the Defendants’ decision not to issue an EIS or conduct an EA and then construct a detention camp qualifies as a final agency action.”
The Trump administration contended that a review under NEPA did not apply because, while the center houses federal immigration detainees, it is run by the state. State officials have said that their authority came from an agreement with the federal government.
Judge Williams strongly objected.
“Defendants essentially tell the Court that the project is purely state action because its employees (presumably) wear uniforms bearing state agency logos, and because the federal government seems to have held back on sending its reimbursement until some unidentified impediment (perhaps, this litigation) has abated,” she wrote.
“Meanwhile, the project was requested by the federal government; built with a promise of full federal funding; constructed in compliance with ICE standards; staffed by deputized ICE Task Force Officers acting under color of federal authority and at the direction and supervision of ICE officials; and exists for the sole purpose of detaining and deporting those subject to federal immigration enforcement. Detainees are brought onto the site by federal agents and deported from the site by federal agents on federally owned aircraft. In concluding the camp is a major federal action, the Court will ‘adhere to the test-tested adage: if it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and looks like a duck, then it’s a duck.’”
The judge quoted President Harry S. Truman’s address during the 1947 dedication of the Everglades National Park, and noted how a proposal in 1967 to create the world’s largest jetport at the site was abandoned and the Big Cypress National Preserve was created to protect the area.
“Since that time, every Florida governor, every Florida senator, and countless local and national political figures, including presidents, have publicly pledged their unequivocal support for the restoration, conservation, and protection of the Everglades,” she wrote. “This Order does nothing more than uphold the basic requirements of legislation designed to fulfill those promises.”
‘Clear message’
The two environmental groups that filed the initial lawsuit hailed the decision on Thursday night.
“This is a landmark victory for the Everglades and countless Americans who believe this imperiled wilderness should be protected, not exploited,” said Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades. “It sends a clear message that environmental laws must be respected by leaders at the highest levels of our government — and there are consequences for ignoring them.”
“This injunction is a huge relief for millions of people who love the Everglades,” added Elise Bennett, Florida and Caribbean director and attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “This brutal detention center was burning a hole in the fabric of life that supports our most iconic wetland and a whole host of endangered species, from majestic Florida panthers to wizened wood storks. The judge’s order came just in time to stop it all from unraveling.”
Central Florida Democratic U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost, who toured the facility for the second time on Wednesday, issued a blistering statement after Judge Williams’ order was released.
“The Everglades Immigrant Detention Center is nothing more than a state-sponsored, government-funded internment camp designed to keep Black and Brown immigrants in hellish conditions while Donald Trump pretends it makes our country safer,” he said in a written statement. “Thanks to the tireless work of Friends of the Everglades, the Center for Biological Diversity, and the Miccosukee Tribe, this inhumane facility has been ordered to halt operations. This is a major victory for justice, civil rights, and our environment.”
Judge Williams had placed a temporary restraining order pausing new construction at the detention center on Aug. 7 — including filling, paving, and installation of new infrastructure and lighting. That ruling may have already proved to DeSantis that Williams, a 2010 appointee to the federal court by President Obama, would ultimately rule the way she did.
“It’s pretty clear we’re in front of a judge who is not going to give us a fair shake on this,” he said earlier this week.

Two groups in the Inland Northwest are bringing together people of various faiths to find common ground and unite around social justice projects despite their different beliefs.
Providing housing for people facing homelessness, providing food and other basic necessities for residents and ensuring all people are afforded human rights are key priorities for Faith Leaders and Leaders of Conscience of Eastern Washington and North Idaho (FLLC) and Moscow’s Interfaith Council.

The groups comprise multiple faith traditions, including Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Baha’i and Unitarian Universalist congregations, and several Christian denominations.
“The variety of faiths in this area is really extraordinary,” said the Rev. Gen Heywood, pastor of Veradale United Church of Christ and convener of FLLC.
 Faith Leaders and Leaders of Conscience advocates for policy changes for people who are low income

FLLC organizes vigils to collectively overcome racism, poverty and ecological violence, Heywood said. The group is organized around the agenda of the Poor People’s Campaign, which advocates for policy changes to meet the needs of poor and low-income people. In addition to vigils, participants sign letters to the editor and letters of condolence to draw awareness to these issues.
Crucially, FLLC’s vigils are not protests, and the spiritual and non-spiritual leaders who attend are not there to yell or shame others. They are there to grieve. Recent vigils have centered around the golden rule, the ethical principle of treating others how you would want to be treated.
“I want people to see our shared common humanity,” Heywood said. “And it becomes a problem when some people don’t believe other people have the rights that come with being fully human.”
FLLC participants gathered at U.S. Rep. Michael Baumgartner’s Spokane office on July 8 to discuss his vote for the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was passed into law on July 4.
Heywood said FLLC will exist as long as it fills a need in the community.
 Moscow Interfaith Council connects people in need to community resources

Pastors and representatives from congregations in Moscow meet monthly to discuss issues related to faith and social justice, such as how religious institutions can house and support people in need who pass through town, said Annette Bay Pimentel, communications director for the Moscow, Idaho, Stake of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
The council connects people in need with one of the religious institutions or local nonprofits, such as Sojourners Alliance or the Latah County Human Rights Task Force, said Walter Hesford, an Interfaith Council member representing Emmanuel Lutheran Church.
The Interfaith Council also distributes information to its respective congregations about community programs like food drives, Pimentel said.
“As people of faith, we are concerned about the needy and people in crisis,” she said. “No single person or congregation or faith tradition has all of the answers. So it’s valuable for us to be part of community-wide solutions and remember the work we’re doing isn’t limited to our congregation.”
 Family Promise partnerships spur other projects

The Palouse River Ward of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints wanted to participate in Family Promise of the Palouse, a nonprofit organization that supports homeless families — but the congregation could not host families in their building.
The Unitarian Universalist Church of the Palouse had a building and some volunteers, but needed more hands for every week they hosted Family Promise, up to six times a year.
“It was like night and day when they started helping us,” said Nancy Nelson, a volunteer organizer and UUCP member. “They’ve made it so much easier, and they’ve been a delight to work with.”
Moscow churches collaborate to create book nook for North Idaho school children

Wards in the Moscow Stake have been paired with other congregations for Family Promise for around 10 years, Pimentel said. Many of those congregational partnerships have expanded to take on other community service projects, including building a new family library at the Russell School Community Hub.
The library will be a space for children to relax and read while their siblings shop for clothes at the Community Hub. Then, they can take books home with them for free.
The Palouse River Ward and UUCP both value education, reading and access to books for children in need, said Ken Faunce, chair of the UUCP social justice committee.
“Even though our faith is not exactly the same, we share an immense amount in common,” Faunce said. “That’s [a desire] to help people, help the community, make people’s lives better. We may disagree on details, but we have that as the core.”

 Year-round collaborations

UUCP also partners with St. Mark’s Episcopal Church for Weekend Food for Kids, a program that provides free meals every Friday during the summer, he said. In conjunction with Moscow School District’s free summer lunches served Monday through Friday, this ensures children have meals every day of the week.
The wards in the Moscow Stake join with other congregations for an interfaith choir that performs concerts around Christmas and Easter, said Ricki Martin, a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
“I just think there’s so much good in the world and so many negative things going on, I just love to be able to focus on the things that are good,” Martin said.

Free.,FBI raids Maryland home of Trump critic John Bolton,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fbi-raids-maryland-home-trump-critic-john-bolton,,"WASHINGTON — FBI agents raided the home and office of former Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, a one-time adviser to President Donald Trump who has become a frequent critic of the president, to investigate Bolton’s handling of classified documents, according to multiple media reports.The raid on a former Trump adviser’s house represents an escalation from the Justice Department in targeting critics of Trump, whom he vowed to go after should he return to the White House for a second term.Speaking to reporters Friday, Trump said he was not briefed on the raid of Bolton’s house in the wealthy suburb of Bethesda, Maryland, and office in Washington, D.C., according to White House pool reports.But the president noted his longstanding feud with his former adviser.“I'm not a fan of John Bolton,” Trump said. “He's a real sort of a low life. He could be a very unpatriotic guy. We're going to find out.”Earlier this year, the president revoked the security detail for Bolton, who served as Trump’s national security advisor from 2018 to 2019 and as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations during the George W. Bush administration in 2005 and 2006.Following his time in the Trump administration, Bolton, who was an important member of the Bush administration’s national security team that favored active military involvement in the Middle East, emerged as a chief Republican foreign policy critic of Trump, authoring a 2020 book that blasted the president and widened the public rift between the two men.Bolton has not been charged with a crime and is not in custody, according to The Associated Press, which cited a person familiar with the matter.The first Trump administration launched an investigation into Bolton to probe if he improperly used sensitive information in his book.

When California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled his plan to retaliate if Republican-led Texas redrew its congressional districts to favor the GOP, he affirmed his support for less partisan maps — and then promised to “meet fire with fire.”
“We’re doing it mindful that we want to model better behavior,” Newsom told reporters in Los Angeles earlier this month, nodding to the independent system his state currently uses to draw districts. “ … But we cannot unilaterally disarm. We can’t stand back and watch this democracy disappear.”
President Donald Trump’s call for Republicans to redraw U.S. House districts so the party can win more seats in the 2026 midterm elections — to gerrymander them — has triggered a redistricting frenzy this summer that also threatens to prompt moves by Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and New York, among others. Ohio was already set to redraw its lines, even before the current fracas.
The battle for partisan advantage is placing Democratic politicians, advocates of less partisan maps and others who support curbs on gerrymandering in an uncomfortable position, pitting their desire for change against fears that Trump will take advantage of their scruples to wring more GOP seats out of a handful of key states. Some say they accept that Democratic states need to respond, while others warn retaliation will only yield short-term gains.
The Texas House passed a new map on Wednesday, clearing the way for a final vote in the state Senate and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s signature. In California, lawmakers passed their own map on Thursday, setting up a statewide vote in November over the new districts.
Other states are now likely to follow, as Republicans and Democrats scramble for a political leg up.
But gerrymandering opponents say the current moment has the potential to produce new energy for their movement. More people are paying attention to gerrymandering, they say, and new polls show the public opposes the practice. The rush to redraw maps demonstrates the need for Congress to set national limits, they say.
“I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard,” said David Daley, an author of books on gerrymandering and a senior fellow at FairVote, a Maryland-based nonpartisan group that supports ranked choice voting and multimember House districts to end the practice. “We will never have reform if a handful of states can act on their own.”
At the same time, some gerrymandering opponents fear states will unravel hard-fought victories. They wonder whether temporary measures, such as California potentially setting aside the independent commission it uses to redraw maps, could become permanent.
 ‘An unprecedented time’

State legislatures exercise primary control over congressional redistricting in 39 states, according to All About Redistricting, a compendium of information on map-drawing hosted by Loyola Law School in California. While some states use other methods, only nine states rely on independent commissions, which typically limit participation by elected officials and are favored by many gerrymandering opponents.
Most states draw maps once a decade after the census, making the mid-decade maneuvers and counter-maneuvers highly unusual (six states currently have only one representative, eliminating the need to draw district lines). But just a few seats could determine who controls the U.S. House. Republicans currently hold 219 seats to Democrats’ 212, with four vacancies.
“We affirm that gerrymandering, both racial and political, disenfranchises voters,” Virginia Kase Solomón, president and CEO of Common Cause, an organization that has long advocated for changes to the redistricting process, said during a press call the day before Newsom’s announcement.
“But this is an unprecedented time of political upheaval,” she said. People don’t want to see a situation develop where maps are redrawn every two years, she added.
The new Texas map could ease the path for Republicans to win an additional five seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Texas lawmakers rapidly advanced the redraw this week once Democratic state lawmakers returned to the state. They had traveled to other states to deny Texas House leaders the quorum required to approve the map, but returned after Newsom outlined California’s response.
Gerrymandering typically involves “packing” and “cracking.” “Packing” refers to the concentration of opposition party voters in a small number of districts to reduce competition elsewhere. “Cracking” means diluting the voting power of the opposing party’s supporters across many districts.
Texas Republicans have been frank that they are pursuing the redraw for partisan advantage. But they emphasize that no prohibition exists, in Texas or nationally, against mid-decade redistricting and that a 2019 U.S. Supreme Court decision cleared the way for states to draw maps for partisan purposes, removing the power of federal courts to police political gerrymandering.
The new maps give Republicans a chance of winning additional districts but doesn’t guarantee victories, they add.
“The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance,” Texas state Rep. Todd Hunter, a Republican who carried the bill in the Texas House, said during floor debate on Wednesday. He added a short time later: “According to the U.S. Supreme Court, you can use political performance, and that is what we’ve done.”
 Tricky terrain

As Texas moves forward and California prepares to respond, Common Cause illustrates the tricky terrain anti-gerrymandering advocates are now navigating.
The group, headquartered in Washington, D.C., fought to enact the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2008. But earlier this month, Common Cause declined to condemn California’s retaliation, saying it will judge the effort by whether the maps are a proportional response to gerrymanders in other states, whether the process includes meaningful public participation, and whether the maps expire and are replaced after the 2030 census through the state’s regular redistricting process, among other criteria.
Newsom’s proposal, the Election Rigging Response Act, will ask California voters in November to temporarily set aside the state’s redistricting commission and approve the new map drawn by the legislature. The commission would resume drawing maps following the census.
Recent polling shows widespread public opposition to gerrymandering. A YouGov poll of 1,116 Americans conducted in early August found 69% believe it should be illegal to draw districts in a way that makes it harder for members of a particular political party to elect their preferred candidates. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The number of Americans who say gerrymandering is a big problem has jumped in recent years. In the YouGov poll, 75% of respondents said it is a major problem when districts are intentionally drawn to favor one party, up from 66% in a 2022 survey.
Some California Republicans have responded to Newsom’s proposal by defending the commission system. A group of Republicans sued in state court to block the plan, but the California Supreme Court on Wednesday denied a request to temporarily halt the effort.
 ‘Is this bad for reform?’

While members of the public might say they favor citizen-led commissions, they may not care deeply about the issue, said David Hopkins, a political science professor at Boston College who has written on polarization in American politics. He called gerrymandering a “classic process subject” that comes off as “inside baseball” to many people.
“The legislators in states that haven’t adopted commissions clearly don’t feel any particular political pressure to do so,” Hopkins said.
Some Republicans in states weighing a mid-decade gerrymander also discount the risk of a public backlash.
In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe may call a special session this fall to redraw the state’s map in hopes of gaining an additional GOP seat in the U.S. House. James Harris, a Missouri Republican consultant with close ties to GOP officials in the state, said he wasn’t concerned redistricting would create momentum to change the process.
Missouri voters in recent years have approved ballot measures favored by Democrats, including one in 2018 that empowered a nonpartisan demographer to draw state legislative districts, though not congressional districts. But Republicans led a successful campaign to convince voters to repeal the changes two years later.
Harris painted any new potential map as part of a national effort to help Trump — who received 58.5% of the vote in Missouri last November.
“I think the lens is wanting to make sure the president has a majority in Congress so he can actually govern for the last two years versus two years of investigations, gridlock,” Harris said.
Advocates of less partisan maps said lawmakers aren’t likely to surrender their own role in mapmaking. While some state courts may limit redistricting excesses, federal courts stopped policing partisan gerrymandering following the Supreme Court’s 2019 decision. And the high court may soon weaken the judiciary’s power to block race-based gerrymandering.
Samuel Wang, director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, which supports eliminating partisan gerrymandering, said the “one good thing” about the redistricting battle is that it’s prompted voters to pay attention to an arcane and technical issue. That could be a positive in the long run, he said, “if people can keep a cool head.”
Wang has written online that any response to Texas should remain measured and proportionate. California offers Democrats the only clean option to strike back, Wang wrote. Five Democratic seats could be added by redrawing the state.
“Is this bad for reform? I mean, I’m torn,” Wang told Stateline. “Because on the other hand, Democrats have been, over the last few decades, vocal in their advocacy for voting rights in various forms and now that advocacy is in question because they find a need to fight fire with fire.”
“So I guess the way I would characterize it is if they can hold it in check and not do it in every single state and just engage in whatever they’re doing where it will make a difference,” he said, “then we might not lose all the progress that’s been made.”

,California,2025-08-22 16:55:00+00:00,CalMatters,"For California high-speed rail to succeed, part of the Central Valley will have to wait",Yousef Baig,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/08/california-high-speed-rail-strategy/,"In a new report for the Legislature, the California High-Speed Rail Authority's top executive seems to be betting that a blunt conversation and different funding strategy could convince lawmakers to back a new direction for the project.","Since Gov. Gavin Newsom’s first State of the State address six years ago, California has stopped pursuing a high-speed rail system that actually connects the Bay Area to Southern California, as was promised to voters in 2008. And in that void, politicians, pundits and a mostly partisan minority of voters howled and cried boondoggle, discounting the new focus — building only the Central Valley segment — in the same breath.
In a project update for state lawmakers released Friday, the California High-Speed Rail Authority unveiled the latest ridership and revenue projections for the Central Valley line and several other potential routes. The new data — the project’s first in two years — paints a harsh picture of an unprofitable bullet train, beset by too few riders in the state’s agricultural heartland, and costs for upkeep that would dwarf the money it makes unless it expands.
Authority officials have previously acknowledged that the 171-mile Merced to Bakersfield line would require a subsidy to operate, a point often drowned out in the narrow debate that surrounds the project. Authority CEO Ian Choudri, now one year into the job, seems to be betting that a blunt conversation and new funding strategy — free of government aid — could convince lawmakers to endorse a new direction.
But there’s a potential catch: It only might be feasible if the project is allowed to put the northernmost extension to Merced on hold.
Salvation for high-speed rail apparently lies in Gilroy, the world’s garlic capital, and its potential to connect Silicon Valley to the Central Valley — or even as far south as Palmdale — by 2038. As the southern terminus for the Caltrain system, the agrarian city has long been considered high-speed rail’s best chance of reaching San Francisco.
It’s a bold vision worth supporting, despite the significant technical, legal, regulatory and political hurdles. Choudri, who has previously worked on high-speed rail in France and Spain, appears dead set on ending the project’s reliance on fluky government grants and attracting private investors, as many foreign bullet trains have done. 
“I was not coming here to just say, ‘What is authorized to build?’” Choudri said in an interview. “I was here to give a scheme that works for the entire high-speed rail network — that we committed to do since the inception of this program. So I had to look at other opportunities as well.”
Those opportunities could hollow out some of the promises made to the Central Valley, where local officials are planning and designing train stations, revitalizing senescent corridors and hoping a new artery to Silicon Valley can reel in lucrative new industries. High-speed rail has captured the imagination of historically neglected neighborhoods, such as southwest Fresno, inspiring support in the unlikeliest corners of California’s conservative farm belt.
But retooled analyses show the Merced-Bakersfield line would generate as much as 2.2 million annual rides — just one-third of the yearly trips estimated in the last update for lawmakers two years ago. Passenger revenue similarly plummeted in the newest calculations, generating $55.6 million each year, a far cry from the $156 million presented in 2023. 
Over a 40-year period, authority officials estimate running the Merced-Bakersfield line would result in a $3.8 billion loss. The initial segment currently faces an $8.6 billion funding gap to reach Merced, with costs for the Central Valley phase growing roughly $1.8 billion from the last estimate, now totaling $36.8 billion. 
On a more promising note, the new report estimates high-speed rail could eventually be profitable for California, earning as much as $98.1 billion over four decades. But that would require reaching existing train lines in Santa Clara and Los Angeles counties. 
The most ambitious and rewarding route would cost $87.1 billion. As for the dream of a 500-mile bullet train that marries downtown San Francisco to L.A., that appears to be off the table, at least for now.
Latest projections put Merced at risk
Statewide, a wide majority of Californians still support high-speed rail, especially among registered Democrats and independent voters. That doesn’t mean construction hasn’t been painful, as residents and businesses along the project’s path, from Madera to Fresno to Bakersfield, will tell you.
But it’s Merced that may be cast aside in the pursuit of the project’s larger ambitions. As the home to the newest campus in the University of California system and the “gateway to Yosemite,” Merced has been a seminal player in the high-speed rail discussion. But the authority has also lacked the funding to complete the design work, acquire the land and extend the construction beyond the 119-mile segment well underway.
The report published this week makes it clear that the only viable path is west to Gilroy and south to Palmdale, where the system can connect with Caltrain in the Bay Area and Metrolink and the High Desert Corridor in Southern California. There, the authority could try to piggyback on the enthusiasm for Brightline West, the privately funded high-speed train linking L.A. to Las Vegas later this decade.
In every scenario the authority put forward, the value of extending north to Merced was outweighed by insufficient ridership and expensive maintenance. 
Of course, the California Legislature and governor would first have to authorize the change, including lifting a $500 million spending cap on work outside the Central Valley. But the latest forecasts make it unmistakably clear what direction the project needs to go.
For Merced Mayor Matthew Serratto, to have the city pushed out of the initial segment would squander the time and effort local officials and many others have invested. Businesses in the project’s path, including a grocery store, homeless shelter and more, have been forced to relocate. 
“I think the majority of people are probably gonna say ‘good riddance,’” Serratto said, noting the community’s animus for the project. “But I think a lot of people, too, are gonna say one — especially those in government — we’ve been planning for this for a long time. And two, we recognize that this is potentially a major benefit to our area. So yeah, there’s going to be disappointment.”
The need for contagious urgency
As determined as Choudri is, he will need a lot of things to go his way.

The most urgent is convincing the Legislature to back Newsom’s 15-year cap and trade extension, a long-running program that allows major polluters to pay for their emissions through a market system of auctioned credits. The market operates independent of the state’s general fund, and has provided about $1 billion each year for the project.
The governor’s proposal would help high-speed rail sustain that amount until 2045, solidifying the only funding stream the project has had apart from the $10 billion bond voters backed in 2008, and federal grants, which have been completely upended under President Trump. Unlike most transportation projects, the state has covered the vast majority of funding, accounting for almost three-quarters of the budget.
Cap and trade is key to attracting private investment, Choudri said, and represents the primary funding source for closing the Central Valley budget gap. Without it, the project is at risk of collapse. 
That’s not to mention the $4 billion grant the White House clawed back this year. California has sued to force Trump to return the funds. The Republican president did the same thing over a $1 billion grant in 2019, before the Biden administration returned the money two years later.
And that’s just the funding part. In the report, the authority spells out a wishlist of regulatory exemptions, streamlined permitting and help getting outside players, such as courts, railroads, utility providers and local agencies, to move with some sense of urgency.
This is a lot to ask of a state that moves as fast as a horse and buggy when it comes to the things it needs. High-speed rail has always been a token of the self-styled ambition California boasted for generations — even as the state enacted laws and regulations that make aspirations of this scale seemingly impossible.
Choudri is not Californian, which gives him a fresh view of things. He clearly believes in the transformational power of a project that can reshape the state’s economy and unlock a higher living standard for countless households. 
That makes him the ideal candidate to overcome what his predecessors couldn’t, or be the scapegoat if the wheels fall off.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/102023-High-Speed-Rail-LV_CM_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-22 12:58:01.148980

DemasAs the state budget process stretches on, members of the Michigan Public Transit Association are calling on Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and legislative leaders to ensure any deal they may reach on road funding includes support for public transportation services. 
Alongside federal and public funding, Michigan’s public transit systems receive funding from the state based on their eligible operating expenses. In a report released earlier this week, the association warned Whitmer’s proposal of $226 million for local bus operations would result in the lowest reimbursement levels for transportation agencies in the state’s history, continuing a trend of underfunding. 
“Public transit is no longer a luxury; it’s an essential service that Michigan voters strongly support,” John Dulmes, the association’s executive director, said in a statement. “Without necessary funding, local transportation systems across Michigan will be forced to cut routes, reduce service hours and eliminate jobs. This will be disastrous for Michiganders, limiting their ability to get to work, attend school, or travel to necessary medical appointments.”

According to a survey of 31 transit agencies – roughly a third of the number of providers in the state – demand for public transit has increased, with 75% of agencies surveyed reporting an increase in ridership. 
Providers are also seeing an increase in costs, including employee wages and insurance costs, with expenses increasing between 25 and 50% over the past four years. 
While the report noted the largest increases in demand were for medical trips, employment-related trips and school, providers were also considering cuts amid rising costs. 
According to the survey, 69% of agencies had either considered or moved to reduce driver and mechanic hiring. Another 69% of agencies had either considered, or taken efforts to reduce their days or hours of operation. 
Additionally, 92% of providers said they were concerned about depleting their funds or reserves, with the report noting several agencies were relying on a few years of remaining savings to maintain current services.
Should they receive additional funding, 84% of transit providers surveyed reported that they would prioritize expanded services, including longer hours of service, reduced wait times for senior and workforce rides and better use of technology to deliver rides more efficiently.

(Photo courtesy of Evan Cantwell/George Mason University)George Mason University has been found in violation of federal civil rights laws, the U.S. Department of Education announced Friday, citing unlawful hiring and promotion practices. 
Over the past two months, President Gregory Washington and GMU have faced mounting questions after the Department of Education and Department of Justice launched four federal investigations. Two of those involve alleged racial discrimination in employment, while another examines the school’s diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) practices. 
The Education Department said Washington was notified of a violation of Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin, in institutions receiving federal funds. The university has 10 days to resolve the violations, which the agency said stem from “illegally using race and other immutable characteristics in university practices and policies, including hiring and promotion.”
Craig Trainor, acting assistant secretary for civil rights, said Washington’s effort to expunge “the so-called ‘racist vestiges’” from GMU’s campus led to a university-wide campaign that imposed unlawful DEI policies. 
“You can’t make this up,” Trainor said. 
“Despite this unfortunate chapter in Mason’s history, the university now has the opportunity to come into compliance with federal civil rights laws by entering into a Resolution Agreement with the Office for Civil Rights,” he added. 
“In the last seven months, this much is clear: The Trump-McMahon Department of Education will not allow racially exclusionary practices — which violate the Civil Rights Act, the Equal Protection Clause, and Supreme Court precedent — to continue corrupting our nation’s educational institutions.” 
Washington will be required to issue a statement affirming that GMU will conduct all recruitment, hiring, promotion, and tenure decisions in compliance with Title VI. He must also ensure the university disseminates information to the campus community explaining how to file a discrimination complaint, according to the announcement.
The resolution further requires the university to review and revise its policies and documents on hiring and promotion to comply with Title VI. GMU must also maintain records demonstrating compliance and make them available to the federal government upon request. 
Some in the GMU community feared Washington would lose his job amid the ongoing investigations. Instead, after a three-hour closed session, the Board of Visitors unanimously approved a 1.5% state-approved salary bonus for him.
In a statement, the Board of Visitors said it is reviewing the proposed resolution steps and takes the matter seriously.
“We will continue to respond fully and cooperatively to all inquiries from the Department of Education, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. House of Representatives and evaluate the evidence that comes to light,” the board said. “Our sole focus is our fiduciary duty to serve the best interests of the university and the people of the commonwealth of Virginia.”
The next board meeting is scheduled for Sept. 25.

A federal judge has ordered that no more immigrant detainees be sent to the state’s immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades and known as “Alligator Alcatraz.” The judge also called upon the government to begin dismantling much of the facility.
U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams of the Southern District of Florida gave both the state and federal government 60 days to move out existing detainees and to begin removing temporary fencing, lightning features, and generators, gas, sewage and other waste and receptacles installed to support the project.
In her 82-page decision, Judge Williams cited extensive harm to the Everglades caused by operation of the facility, which was built in eight days.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The state of Florida filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeal for the Eleventh Circuit immediately after the order was released.
Two environmental groups — Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity — filed a lawsuit in late June, shortly after the state announced that the facility was about to open, claiming the plan had not gone through any environmental review as required under federal law. They were joined in the lawsuit by the Miccosukee Tribe.
In her ruling, Judge Williams agreed, saying that under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the government was required to issue an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) or conduct an Environmental Assessment (EA). “The Defendants chose not to do so,” she wrote.
“The Defendants’ decision to refrain from issuing an EIS or conducting an EA, and then building a detention camp, represents a determinative position on the matter and has adversely affected Plaintiffs’ recreational, conservational, and aesthetic interests,” she wrote in her order. “Accordingly, the Defendants’ decision not to issue an EIS or conduct an EA and then construct a detention camp qualifies as a final agency action.”
The Trump administration contended that a review under NEPA did not apply because, while the center houses federal immigration detainees, it is run by the state. State officials have said that their authority came from an agreement with the federal government.
Judge Williams strongly objected.
“Defendants essentially tell the Court that the project is purely state action because its employees (presumably) wear uniforms bearing state agency logos, and because the federal government seems to have held back on sending its reimbursement until some unidentified impediment (perhaps, this litigation) has abated,” she wrote.
“Meanwhile, the project was requested by the federal government; built with a promise of full federal funding; constructed in compliance with ICE standards; staffed by deputized ICE Task Force Officers acting under color of federal authority and at the direction and supervision of ICE officials; and exists for the sole purpose of detaining and deporting those subject to federal immigration enforcement. Detainees are brought onto the site by federal agents and deported from the site by federal agents on federally owned aircraft. In concluding the camp is a major federal action, the Court will ‘adhere to the test-tested adage: if it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and looks like a duck, then it’s a duck.’”
The judge quoted President Harry S. Truman’s address during the 1947 dedication of the Everglades National Park, and noted how a proposal in 1967 to create the world’s largest jetport at the site was abandoned and the Big Cypress National Preserve was created to protect the area.
“Since that time, every Florida governor, every Florida senator, and countless local and national political figures, including presidents, have publicly pledged their unequivocal support for the restoration, conservation, and protection of the Everglades,” she wrote. “This Order does nothing more than uphold the basic requirements of legislation designed to fulfill those promises.”

‘Clear message’

The two environmental groups that filed the initial lawsuit hailed the decision on Thursday night.
“This is a landmark victory for the Everglades and countless Americans who believe this imperiled wilderness should be protected, not exploited,” said Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades. “It sends a clear message that environmental laws must be respected by leaders at the highest levels of our government — and there are consequences for ignoring them.”
“This injunction is a huge relief for millions of people who love the Everglades,” added Elise Bennett, Florida and Caribbean director and attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “This brutal detention center was burning a hole in the fabric of life that supports our most iconic wetland and a whole host of endangered species, from majestic Florida panthers to wizened wood storks. The judge’s order came just in time to stop it all from unraveling.”
Central Florida Democratic U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost, who toured the facility for the second time on Wednesday, issued a blistering statement after Judge Williams’ order was released.
“The Everglades Immigrant Detention Center is nothing more than a state-sponsored, government-funded internment camp designed to keep Black and Brown immigrants in hellish conditions while Donald Trump pretends it makes our country safer,” he said in a written statement. “Thanks to the tireless work of Friends of the Everglades, the Center for Biological Diversity, and the Miccosukee Tribe, this inhumane facility has been ordered to halt operations. This is a major victory for justice, civil rights, and our environment.”
Judge Williams had placed a temporary restraining order pausing new construction at the detention center on Aug. 7 — including filling, paving, and installation of new infrastructure and lighting. That ruling may have already proved to DeSantis that Williams, a 2010 appointee to the federal court by President Obama, would ultimately rule the way she did.
“It’s pretty clear we’re in front of a judge who is not going to give us a fair shake on this,” he said earlier this week.

Ebenezer D. Bassett represents integrity. He represents New Britain at its best.,"There’s a street in New Britain that runs alongside Central Connecticut State University, a university defined by education, ambition and pride. But the street, commonly known as Paul Manafort Drive, tells a different story — a story of scandal, federal crime and political shame. Its name doesn’t represent the spirit of this city anymore. 
It’s time to change it. 
The Manafort name is a stain on New Britain’s landscape. Although the street was originally named after Paul Manafort Sr., a former mayor, the public’s perception of the name has been dominated by his son, Paul Manafort Jr., the former Trump campaign chairman who was convicted of fraud. In 2018, Mayor Erin Stewart added “Sr.” to the sign to clarify the namesake. But as Councilman Carlo Carlozzi Jr. rightly pointed out at the time, “adding ‘Sr.’ does not take away the scandal of the Paul Manafort name.” 


Paul Manafort Jr. has admitted to fraud and illegal foreign lobbying. He has been convicted of witness tampering. He spent nearly two years in prison before being released to home confinement in 2020. He was pardoned by President Trump that year, but that doesn’t necessarily restore public trust in him. Manafort had agreed to cooperate with the Mueller investigation on Russian interference in the 2016 election, but he lied to federal prosecutors. His record is not one of public service; it’s one of deception and legal disgrace. So why keep the Paul Manafort name, even with the “Sr.” attached, on a public street?   

Shaniyah President
Instead, the city has a powerful, inspiring alternative: Ebenezer D. Bassett. A graduate in 1853 of what is now Central Connecticut State University, Bassett was the first African American diplomat in U.S. history, appointed by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1869. He was also the first Black student to attend and graduate from CCSU — in just one year.  
Ebenezer D. Bassett represents integrity. He represents history. He represents New Britain at its best. Nine members of the city’s Common Council voted in 2018 to rename the street Ebenezer D.C Bassett Way. But Mayor Erin Stewart vetoed it.  
The city council has stopped pursuing the name change. I think that it’s worth revisiting. This isn’t about partisanship. It’s about character. And it’s about whom and what we choose to celebrate. 
Paul Manafort Jr. may be back working with some people in President Trump’s circle, but that doesn’t mean the Manafort name belongs in our circle. Let’s make room on our street signs for leaders who earned their honor, not those who were pardoned for dodging it.

Then-Gov. Haley Barbour, understanding the necessity of a well-organized, coordinated effort to clean up and plan to rebuild the coastal counties for the long-term future, tapped one of the state’s most successful business leaders Jim Barksdale to chair a special commission.

James L. Barksdale
Barksdale, then 62 years old, had recently sold his company Netscape to AOL. He accepted the appointment to lead the entity tasked with deciding how hundreds of millions in federal and state recovery funds would be spent. Just a few days after the storm hit, he and his wife Donna flew from Jackson to the Coast, where they spent the first few months of their marriage living on the top floor of a casino resort in Biloxi while Jim led the commission.
Notably, leaders across the country have praised him for his service and modeled it in other post-disaster recovery efforts.
To commemorate the 20th anniversary of the storm, Barksdale sat down with Mississippi Today to recount his time leading the Governor’s Commission on Recovery, Rebuilding and Renewal in the fall of 2005.
Note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Mississippi Today: Where were you when the storm hit 20 years ago, and what were you doing both professionally and personally? What did your life look like when the storm hit?
Jim Barksdale: It’s interesting because I was in a strange place. Donna and I had just gotten back from our honeymoon. We got back here around the first of August, and the storm hit the end of August. So the storm hit about three weeks after we got back. We later continued our honeymoon a couple years later, but the storm definitely delayed all that. I was here in Jackson. I’d retired here after I sold Netscape to AOL. I was on probably five or six different corporate boards and commissions around the country, but other than that, I was able to take on the job.
MT: How long was it after the storm that you got to the Coast?
JB: Maybe a couple days after the storm hit, Haley Barbour and Leland Speed, who was his economic development director, called me and asked me if I’d come meet them. I met with them, they asked if I’d lead the effort, and less than a week later, we were on helicopters flying down there. One thing I remember from flying over the damage down there, which was extensive and just so incredible to see, was the smell of the beach down near Gulfport. They had these refrigeration warehouses for chicken poultry products waiting to be exported. They were all still there rotting and had not been cleaned out. Even from a few hundred yards above it, it smelled like we were on the ground. It was awful. 
Up and down the Coast, it really looked like an atomic bomb had gone off. People say that all the time, but there’s no other way to describe it. There was really no way to get around. The National Guard had roads blocked off except for first responders and residents. Getting around the debris and the roadblocks was just about impossible unless you had some level of clearance.
We got down there, and the place we lodged ourselves was in a hotel called the Isle of Capri. The front of the building was all busted open from the storm surge and wind with all the slot machines showing. They were working hard to get the slot machines emptied out before they got robbed. The first two or three floors of the high rise building were obliterated by the storm, but somehow the elevator worked to take us up to the room they gave us, which was on the top floor. The room was nice. It wasn’t touched. We had power and water. Up there, unless you looked down at all the mess and debris and the collapsed bridge over the bay, you wouldn’t have known anything had happened.
MT: How long were you and Donna there?
JB: Oh, three or four months on and off. We came back here (to Jackson) a few times and would head back down, but it was about three or four months we lived down there — until right around the first of the year (January 2006).
MT: Was it a surprise or was it unexpected to get the call from Gov. Barbour to head up this commission?
JB: It was a total shock. I didn’t really know Haley. I’d met him before, but we were not close at all. Haley had asked me to be his finance chairman when he first ran for governor (in 2003). Not too long before then, he had said some things publicly about me and the Microsoft hearings that really irritated me, and I turned him down. I hadn’t really talked to him again until he called me about Katrina recovery.
When I went to meet with him and Leland Speed, they asked if I’d lead the commission. I said, “Now look, is this because you’re being a statesman or is it for revenge over turning you down as finance chairman?” He laughed and didn’t really answer the question, but he told me that he thought I was highly qualified to lead a comprehensive effort like that, so I accepted. I was happy to serve the state in that way. Donna and I had just been married, and she calls it our “Category Five Honeymoon.”
Later, Haley and I got to be good friends. He’s still a good friend of mine.
MT: It’s hard to believe it’s been 20 years since the storm, but looking back on the work of the commission, what are some of your proudest accomplishments during your time as chairman and what y’all were able to do in those first few months?
JB: The thing I’m most proud of that we were able to accomplish is that we brought so many people of the Coast together to help them build plans for the future, and we gave them hope for their communities. Really, the most important thing we did was give them hope in such a difficult moment in time.
You know, as a group, we came in with this idea that the best way to get started was just get everybody involved, to get everyone busy. There was so much to consider. It may sound simple, but just getting started as quickly as we did was something to be very proud of.
We started these charrettes, or small working groups, as a way to get a lot of people involved in one project. We got the mayors involved as the leaders and some others involved, and let me tell you, it worked. They worked their cans off. The mayors were there every day, night and day. It was literally 24 hours for them. You’d go in at 2 o’clock in the morning, and there would be all the mayors in there working with their teams. We had architects and engineers flying in from literally all over the world helping us. There were architects from Italy that came, people from England that were part of the royal planners, Prince Charles’ team. It was amazing how many people from all over the world came and would just drop a team of people. We had renowned experts who were there to meet with the leaders of every Gulf Coast town and have them lay out their dreams.
We had a wonderful group of people, smart and hardworking who were there to transform these cities across the coastline. There wasn’t really anything for them to do except work — they obviously couldn’t go out and eat, couldn’t go out and have fun or anything, so they just worked. We fed them all there at that hotel, used their big ballroom to be the meeting places, and they broke off in the subcommittees in smaller rooms.
We divided the volunteers up in groups for each different community. If I remember correctly, there were 11 communities on the beach at that time. And we came up with some marvelous ideas for how to pull this place, to put it back together and take it into the future. Not all of them were implemented. Some of them were visions and dreams and so forth. Some worked, most didn’t. But they got some version of them working just about everywhere. That would be another thing I was proud of.
I’m also proud of the dozens of town halls we had during that time. I went to every one of them along with the local people. We would just sit there and answer questions from the citizens. And a lot of them were hard questions that we, quite frankly, didn’t have all the answers to. I think by the end of the meetings, people for the most part liked and appreciated the fact that we were there and being transparent and trying to answer all the questions. They were all scared and worried about the future, and we tried hard to make them feel heard and let them know we cared and were working very hard on their behalf.
I think we formed 11 committees run by some of Mississippi’s finest people — people who were mostly from the southern part of the state. We learned a lot from those meetings, and I remember there were a couple where people got up and cussed us, but it was really helpful for us to listen and apply what we heard to our planning.
MT: You’ve focused so much of your life and personal philanthropy on public education. I know that a big focus for you during your time leading the commission was getting schools back open. Can you talk about that?
JB: We knew we had to get the kids back in school. It was so important because if schools weren’t open, parents would move away. The storm hit right at the start of the school year, and many of these buildings were just totally washed or blown away. So we came up with the idea to have two schools running in one school building, for example. We’d have a morning school and an afternoon school. If there was a school building standing, we’d get kids from other schools to meet there for half a day just to get them back in the classroom somewhere. For the buildings that got destroyed in some cases, we brought down a bunch of house trailers to serve as temporary schools.
We reopened the last public school on Nov. 12, 2005. That was the day that New Orleans reopened their first public school. In New Orleans’ defense, they had decided that they’d use the storm as an opportunity to change everything over to charter schools. So they had to get the legislation done and do all that work, but the problem was that delayed getting kids back into classrooms. The children didn’t get into school nearly as quickly, most of them probably until after the first of the year (2006). Also, the Mississippi Coast didn’t lose as many people as New Orleans did. But we were very proud of how quickly we got classrooms and schools reopened.
MT: And I know there was a huge focus on housing for the thousands of people who were displaced and had nowhere to go.
JB: If I remember correctly, we lost about 4,000 housing units during the storm. Of course that’s counting homes, apartments, anywhere else a family could live, but we lost 4,000 housing units. We lost a whole group of Section 8 houses. We lost several big apartment buildings, and then we lost a lot of single family houses. The houses, in most cases, were just moved totally off of their foundations. They just floated away. You’d drive up on them and they looked like they were perfectly fine, but you’d look a little closer and see that they were sitting on dirt 50 yards from the foundation.
We spent a lot of time getting temporary housing built up and set up all over the place, just to get people somewhere they could live and survive. I could never get my head around exactly how we were going to build 4,000 units. But amazingly, within a few months, we had 4,000 units available at least temporarily. And after five years, we had 8,000 permanent new or rebuilt units available. I don’t think all of them were brand new, but they were good units. They were, in most cases, better and stronger than the 4,000 on average that we had lost. I would not have believed that.
MT: You’ve done a lot of really important things over the course of your life and career. With this experience, in particular, how did it stack up for you? What are some of the things that have stuck with you personally over these 20 years?
JB: I was proud to play a more individual role in some things, and I learned a lot from working with so many smart people. One of the best examples of that is after we’d gotten a big pot of money to rebuild the bridge over Biloxi Bay between Biloxi and Ocean Springs.
We got a design, a big curving design so you could take the ships under it with their masts to go to Trinity Yards and build yachts up there. But we wanted to do it at as little cost to people as possible. We had the money, and all we needed was the approval of the two mayors. So we had a meeting down at the Biloxi City Hall. There were a lot of people in there from representing the towns and architects and the builders and so forth, and it quickly became obvious during that meeting that we just weren’t going to get the mayor of Ocean Springs (Connie Moran) to sign off on a bridge design that didn’t have a walkway going alongside the bridge. The plan we’d drawn up for lower budget reasons didn’t have any architectural features on the bridge, it didn’t have any landscaping. That was the way we kept the price down. It was going to cost $9 million more or something like that to do those three things.
The mayor of Biloxi (A.J. Holloway) kept saying, “Look, we don’t want to go back and ask for more money. We got this all federal money, we’ve got it now, we don’t want them to pull any back, let’s just rebuild the bridge at a base level and get it back open.” He also kept arguing that nobody would use a walking trail over the bridge anyways, that it’d be too steep to climb, the climate was too hot, that we didn’t need it. Mayor Moran was strong, I give her credit. She was adamant that the walkway was necessary.
People started leaving because they didn’t think we’d find a resolution, and I asked the mayors, “Why don’t we go in another room here?” We got the mayors and the highway commissioner in a side room together. I forget who else was in there, maybe a couple more people. I looked at them and said, “We can make this decision right here. Now, Connie, your point is you are not going to accept this design unless it has these features, and A.J., you’re not going to accept the design if they modify it unless they come up with more money to pay for it.” I said, “Look, here’s the deal. I’ll either get or give the $9 million myself. You have my personal commitment to that.” We all shook hands and went back out and announced that we’d agreed to the design with the walkway.
The funny thing was the next morning, Butch Brown (the executive director of the Mississippi Department of Transportation) called me and he said, “Yeah, Jim, we’re not going to make you give that $9 million. We found the money in the budget somehow.” You know, in business, sometimes it’s just a matter of getting everyone in a room and coming up with creative solutions. That was an example of that.
A very funny part of this story is that I was down in Biloxi for the 10th anniversary of the storm. A.J. Holloway was there. He came over to me and he said, “Jim, I’ve got a terrible cold, but I had to come down here just to see you. He says, “You realize this, but that bridge right now, that’s the most popular thing going on in this side of town. There are hundreds of people who walk over that bridge every day, they ride bicycles and everything.” He said he had even walked over it some. He said, “I just want you to know that I was wrong and I’m willing to eat crow.”
That was just one story of many, but it just shows you how important it was during that time to just find ways to bring everyone together and get buy-in from a lot of people with varying interests.

According to the Environmental Protection Agency, at least 45% of the nation’s tap drinking water is estimated to have one or more types of PFAS. State data show that at least 171 public water systems in 96 cities in Massachusetts have contaminated water that exceeds the state’s limit.
The post “They’re in everything:” Massachusetts lawmakers explore soluti[...]","As the risk of toxic forever chemicals grows, a handful of Massachusetts legislators and advocates are looking for solutions to the complex problem.
Last week, a group of Massachusetts lawmakers, agency officials, and advocates visited Maine to speak with well owners and farmers who have been impacted by the contamination of forever chemicals and learn more from Maine about how to deal with the problems they create.
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS or forever chemicals, are widely used, do not break down over time, and can end up in the air, soil, and drinking water. Found in food packaging, household cleaning products, cooking products, cosmetics, firefighting foam and biosolids – human-waste-turned-fertilizer that comes from wastewater treatment plants – PFAS can cause medical problems like decreased fertility, developmental delays and effects in children, and increased risk of some cancers and obesity.
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, at least 45% of the nation’s tap drinking water is estimated to have one or more types of PFAS. State data show that at least 171 public water systems in 96 cities in Massachusetts have contaminated water that exceeds the state’s limit.
“Something that we’re really grappling with is the knowledge that these chemicals, they’re in everything, they’re industrial, they’re in municipal wastewater,” said Representative Steve Owens of Watertown, who was a part of the delegation’s trip to Maine.
Maine is one of the leaders in PFAS regulation in the country.
In 2021, Maine was the first state to pass a law banning the sale of products intentionally containing PFAS. Last year, the state lowered the rate of the PFAS allowed from 20 parts per trillion in drinking water to the federal standard of four parts per trillion starting in 2027. The Massachusetts standard is 20 parts per trillion.
Massachusetts leaders hope to understand Maine’s “learned lessons” in handling their PFAS problem, said Senator Jo Comerford of Northampton. She said one of her biggest takeaways from the trip was that Maine farmers asked for PFAS regulation and that their input was crucial in crafting legislation.
“It was important to find out how [Maine] navigated the balance between protecting farmers, protecting the food supply, and protecting public safety,” Owens said.
Forever chemicals are commonly found in everyday products, making it difficult to stop their usage. Maine made exemptions last year to its landmark PFAS legislation to allow certain products to contain the chemicals when their use can’t be avoided, such as lab equipment, medical devices, human and animal medications, and vehicle equipment.
In a statement, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection said that addressing PFAS is a “top priority” for the Healey administration. Last week, Gov. Healey signed a law phasing out the use of forever chemicals in firefighting foam.
In February, Comerford proposed a law that would make farmers immune from lawsuits and civil liability for any damages caused by PFAS found on their farms and establish a fund for farmers who suffered PFAS-related losses. The proposed Agricultural PFAS Relief Fund would allocate money to farmers to test their soil, water, and agricultural products for chemicals and help them with the costs of adopting new standards.
“I believe farmers are not liable at all for this, and we have to be maximally supportive to farmers as one piece of this larger PFAS puzzle,” she said.
Owens also proposed a law earlier this year prohibiting the use and sale of biosolids, a step Maine has taken. Banning biosolids from being used as agricultural fertilizer, Owen notes, would prevent PFAS from being put back into the food chain and from polluting the environment.
While it is a renewable source, Owens claims biosolids can be taken out of the farming process because it is “not as nutrient-rich a source” as organic fertilizer and contribute to PFAS contamination. 
Owens’ bill is only one part of the puzzle when it comes to biosolids. If biosolids are not being used as fertilizer, they could end up in landfills, which also adds them back into the environment. Currently, there is no solution for completely eliminating them.
“We want to do our part to reduce how much of this gets into our food supply, and we want to do it in a way that doesn’t punish our farmers for testing it in the first place,” Owens said.
While these bills make their way slowly through the legislative process, forever chemicals continue to contaminate the environment. Legislators say it is an urgent problem, but working quickly to enact new policy may cause its own set of problems.
“Everything has to be planned for, and that was one of the big lessons of Maine,” Comerford said. “Because it’s so important that we get it right.”

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — State health officials have declared the measles outbreak over in southwest Kansas, where dozens of cases affected mostly unvaccinated children.
The Kansas Department of Health and Environment announced Thursday that no new cases have been reported or confirmed in the past 42 days after cases peaked at 87. Health officials announced in March the first case of measles in Kansas since 2008.
“The end of the recent outbreak does not mean the threat of measles is over,” officials said in a Thursday press release. “Since there are many ongoing outbreaks of measles in North America and around the world, it is possible that there will be additional cases of measles introduced into Kansas this year.”
Eight people were hospitalized as a result of the outbreak. Children made up more than 80% of cases, and more than 90% of cases involved people who were not vaccinated against measles. Officials urged Kansans to ensure their families’ vaccinations are up to date, especially as the school year begins.
The outbreak most affected Gray, Haskell and Stevens counties. Gray County residents had the highest number of cases with 29 infections. Vaccination rates among kindergarteners have been decreasing overall in each of those counties, with marked decreases in measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, vaccinations.
In Gray County, MMR vaccination rates decreased by 10 percentage points between the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 school years, according to data from KDHE. In Haskell, there was a 14 percentage point decrease, and in Stevens County, a 15 percentage point decrease. The MMR vaccine is the most effective defense against measles, health officials said.
KDHE officials said state and local health departments will continue to monitor for cases. Janet Stanek, KDHE secretary, said she was grateful to the public health, health care and laboratory professionals who played a part in dealing with the measles outbreak.
“Your compassion, skill and unwavering commitment to keeping our communities safe did not go unnoticed and are appreciated beyond measure,” she said.

(Photo by Alon Skuy/Getty Images)A federal judge has ordered that no more immigrant detainees be sent to the state’s immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades and known as “Alligator Alcatraz.” The judge also called upon the government to begin dismantling much of the facility.
U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams of the Southern District of Florida gave both the state and federal government 60 days to move out existing detainees and to begin removing temporary fencing, lightning features, and generators, gas, sewage and other waste and receptacles installed to support the project.
In her 82-page decision, Judge Williams cited extensive harm to the Everglades caused by operation of the facility, which was built in eight days.
The state of Florida filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeal for the Eleventh Circuit immediately after the order was released.
Two environmental groups — Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity — filed a lawsuit in late June, shortly after the state announced that the facility was about to open, claiming the plan had not gone through any environmental review as required under federal law. They were joined in the lawsuit by the Miccosukee Tribe.
In her ruling, Judge Williams agreed, saying that under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the government was required to issue an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) or conduct an Environmental Assessment (EA). “The Defendants chose not to do so,” she wrote.
“The Defendants’ decision to refrain from issuing an EIS or conducting an EA, and then building a detention camp, represents a determinative position on the matter and has adversely affected Plaintiffs’ recreational, conservational, and aesthetic interests,” she wrote in her order. “Accordingly, the Defendants’ decision not to issue an EIS or conduct an EA and then construct a detention camp qualifies as a final agency action.”
The Trump administration contended that a review under NEPA did not apply because, while the center houses federal immigration detainees, it is run by the state. State officials have said that their authority came from an agreement with the federal government.
Judge Williams strongly objected.
“Defendants essentially tell the Court that the project is purely state action because its employees (presumably) wear uniforms bearing state agency logos, and because the federal government seems to have held back on sending its reimbursement until some unidentified impediment (perhaps, this litigation) has abated,” she wrote.
“Meanwhile, the project was requested by the federal government; built with a promise of full federal funding; constructed in compliance with ICE standards; staffed by deputized ICE Task Force Officers acting under color of federal authority and at the direction and supervision of ICE officials; and exists for the sole purpose of detaining and deporting those subject to federal immigration enforcement. Detainees are brought onto the site by federal agents and deported from the site by federal agents on federally owned aircraft. In concluding the camp is a major federal action, the Court will ‘adhere to the test-tested adage: if it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and looks like a duck, then it’s a duck.’”
The judge quoted President Harry S. Truman’s address during the 1947 dedication of the Everglades National Park, and noted how a proposal in 1967 to create the world’s largest jetport at the site was abandoned and the Big Cypress National Preserve was created to protect the area.
“Since that time, every Florida governor, every Florida senator, and countless local and national political figures, including presidents, have publicly pledged their unequivocal support for the restoration, conservation, and protection of the Everglades,” she wrote. “This Order does nothing more than uphold the basic requirements of legislation designed to fulfill those promises.”
‘Clear message’
The two environmental groups that filed the initial lawsuit hailed the decision on Thursday night.
“This is a landmark victory for the Everglades and countless Americans who believe this imperiled wilderness should be protected, not exploited,” said Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades. “It sends a clear message that environmental laws must be respected by leaders at the highest levels of our government — and there are consequences for ignoring them.”
“This injunction is a huge relief for millions of people who love the Everglades,” added Elise Bennett, Florida and Caribbean director and attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “This brutal detention center was burning a hole in the fabric of life that supports our most iconic wetland and a whole host of endangered species, from majestic Florida panthers to wizened wood storks. The judge’s order came just in time to stop it all from unraveling.”
Central Florida Democratic U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost, who toured the facility for the second time on Wednesday, issued a blistering statement after Judge Williams’ order was released.
“The Everglades Immigrant Detention Center is nothing more than a state-sponsored, government-funded internment camp designed to keep Black and Brown immigrants in hellish conditions while Donald Trump pretends it makes our country safer,” he said in a written statement. “Thanks to the tireless work of Friends of the Everglades, the Center for Biological Diversity, and the Miccosukee Tribe, this inhumane facility has been ordered to halt operations. This is a major victory for justice, civil rights, and our environment.”
Judge Williams had placed a temporary restraining order pausing new construction at the detention center on Aug. 7 — including filling, paving, and installation of new infrastructure and lighting. That ruling may have already proved to DeSantis that Williams, a 2010 appointee to the federal court by President Obama, would ultimately rule the way she did.
“It’s pretty clear we’re in front of a judge who is not going to give us a fair shake on this,” he said earlier this week.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s state lawyer picked a fight this week with the Department of Social Services over the agency’s handling of a $79 million pool of opioid settlement money.
Attorney General Marty Jackley wants the bulk of the dollars to land in Sioux Falls and Rapid City for addiction treatment, and says he’ll ask lawmakers to disband the state’s opioid settlement oversight committee if its members disagree.
But the Department of Social Services — the agency designated as the settlement money manager by the Legislature — says neither city has applied for opioid grant money, and the current pool of available funding isn’t as large as Jackley asserts. 
The department also said Jackley did not reach out about his concerns before holding a press conference on the topic Wednesday in Sioux Falls.
Jackley spoke to reporters that day from a lectern at Sioux Falls City Hall, flanked by Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken and Rapid City Mayor Jason Salamun.
SD uses portion of opioid settlement funds to distribute overdose prevention kits

The opioid money, split 70% for the state and 30% for local governments, will arrive in chunks over the next 18 years. It comes from a series of nationwide settlements with the makers and sellers of the opioid painkillers that contributed to a spike in drug addiction and overdoses. 
The state has collected $31.5 million of its share of the settlement dollars since 2022, Jackley said Wednesday, and he asserted that state government has spent almost none of its share.
That’s not accurate, according to Department of Social Services Secretary Matt Althoff. The $31.5 million figure is the total amount received since 2022. What’s left right now is about $17 million, because $14 million has been spent or obligated.
The Sioux Falls and Rapid City areas have both gotten a significant chunk of the money, the statement said. That’s because 30% of the dollars are distributed directly to local governments, which are then required to tell the DSS, on an annual basis, how the money is spent.
Last year alone, the statement read, the cities of Sioux Falls and Rapid City and the counties of Minnehaha, Lincoln and Pennington got a combined $3.9 million in opioid settlement money.
“As of Dec. 31, 2024, over $3 million of those funds were reported to the state as unspent,” Althoff’s statement said.
Cities and counties will need to report how they’ve used their local shares for 2025 by Jan. 31, 2026.
Local governments can also ask for additional money by requesting grants, paid for from the state’s 70% share, Althoff said. Sioux Falls and Rapid haven’t asked for extra.
Jackley: Spend the money now
Jackley argued Wednesday, however, that the two major cities would be best suited to decide where the money goes.
Using the money to bolster existing addiction treatment options, Jackley said, “presents that opportunity for us to be able to get ahead of the problem, to address the crisis” of drug addiction.

The settlement money is received and managed by the Department of Social Services, but its uses are overseen by the state’s Opioid Advisory Committee. 
The advisory committee’s public plan for settlement dollars puts a large portion of the money into an interest-bearing account for distribution as grants. That’s the wrong approach, Jackley told reporters this week. 
It could also cause the state to lose 15% of the settlement dollars, he told reporters in Sioux Falls, because the settlement agreement dings states that place money in an endowment.
“Why would we want to lose 15% of $79 million?” said Jackley, who later told Sioux Falls Live’s Patrick Lalley that he’d be concerned that lawmakers would raid the fund for purposes beyond opioid programming, such as property tax relief.
The national settlement specifies that no more than 15% of any states’ dollars can be spent on administration of the funds, and that 85% must go to opioid-related programs. 
The Department of Social Services, in its statement, maintains that the state has not used the dollars for an endowment that would pay for things outside of opioid crisis mitigation.
The law that created South Dakota’s fund for opioid dollars says the money can “only be used for purposes relating to opioid abuse treatment, prevention, and recovery programs.”
On Thursday, Jackley said he’d spoken with DSS officials about the fund, who allayed his concerns.
“I commend DSS’s commitment to not place the funds into an endowment, which is a disfavored use under the settlements,” Jackley said. 
Even so, his Thursday statement doubled down on criticisms of the speed of disbursements from the state’s share of settlement money.
“In the three years since DSS has administered the fund, it has reported expending only $634,000 of state funds on opioid remediation, and we must act now to address the addiction crises of today,” Jackley said in a follow-up statement Thursday, citing the 2024 annual report on the fund.
The DSS did not offer a detailed breakdown of its own opioid fund spending, but spokeswoman Emily Richardt said Thursday that the department has distributed around $1.6 million so far, all in grants to local organizations. The $634,000 figure Jackley cited from the last annual report is short 15 months of spending. The next annual report is expected to be released within the next few months.
A statewide needs assessment, set to be completed by next spring, is meant to guide state-level spending beyond the local grant awards.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Mayors: Needs are great
Avera’s juvenile treatment center is one example of the kind of treatment infrastructure that needs help in Sioux Falls, Mayor Paul TenHaken said at the press conference. It has eight beds and “they’ve been full since they opened,” he said, citing a conversation he had with health system representatives on Tuesday.
“The need there is great,” said TenHaken.
He also pointed to the city’s mental health and addiction triage partnership with the county and health systems known as The Link.
“It takes several million dollars every year from the city and the county and our health care systems to run, and so dollars are needed,” TenHaken said.
State committee plans needs assessment for remainder of $54 million in opioid settlement funds

The Department of Social Services, in a statement sent Thursday, noted that a total of $825,569 in the Sioux Falls area’s local share of opioid money had been reported as dedicated to the Link through 2024.
In a statement sent Thursday, TenHaken said the city intends to spend its remaining local allocation of opioid funds for The Link.
“Based on guideline interpretations on how funding can be spent, the city plans to have all anticipated balances spent by 2036, which is intended to support The Link’s Opioid Response Program,” the statement said. 
The statement did not address the question of a lack of grant requests from Sioux Falls for portions of the state-managed share of opioid dollars.
TenHaken’s Rapid City counterpart referenced similar operations in that city at Wednesday’s press conference. Salamun said addiction often fuels crime, and that it tears up families and communities even when it doesn’t.
“So many of us know people who battle with addiction to whatever it may be, and we know it destroys lives,” Salamun said, pointing to his own family’s experiences. “It is the true enemy.”
Salamun, in a Thursday statement, did not address his city’s unspent funds. 
“The question is not whether some of the opioid settlement dollars have been distributed, but how we can use them more effectively,” the statement read. “We commend the state’s efforts so far and believe that allocating these funds more strategically toward effective treatment and rehabilitation could have a greater impact.”
Jackley said he wants to offer treatment “before people are convicted of a drug felony,” and said that allowing the mayors to make connections can make that happen quickly.
He also said he’s willing to work with the opioid committee on the plan, but that he’s ready to ask lawmakers to dissolve it if the group continues to bank settlement dollars instead of spend them.
Jackley: Committee framework unfortunate
South Dakota first signed on to the opioid litigation during Jackley’s first term in office, which began in 2009. He left the post in 2019, after a loss to Kristi Noem in the 2018 GOP gubernatorial primary. By the time he’d returned to the Attorney General’s Office, in 2023, lawmakers had designated the Department of Social Services as the opioid money administrator and passed legislation creating the advisory committee.
On Wednesday, Jackley said he’d have fought to maintain control of the money, had he been in charge at the time. The office of former Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg supported the 2022 bill that put the dollars in the care of the department and committee.
Even as Jackley said the money should’ve been managed by the attorney general, he said he understood why lawmakers created an oversight committee.
“When you’re talking north of $79 million, perhaps it makes sense that there’s additional oversight over the attorney general,” he said. “ I’m respectful of that, but I’m passionate that these dollars need to get to use now.”
DSS: Press conference misleading, inaccurate
Althoff’s statements, sent on Wednesday evening and Thursday afternoon, contradicted Jackley. Beyond saying that money had been allocated to local governments, it said the attorney general had misstated the amount of money the state has received so far.
The proposal from Jackley for a Sioux Falls and Rapid City opioid money disbursement “appears to be for $31 million from a fund that has $17 million,” Althoff’s statement said.
He said the money already spent using the funds, for efforts like a $350,000 investment in 20,000 overdose-reversal kits and overdose follow-up programming, is making a difference.
“South Dakota continues its trend of low rates of opioid prescriptions and the lowest rate of deaths by opioid overdose due, in part, to this comprehensive work,” the statement said.
Althoff said his department “stands ready” to work with any local government that needs help battling opioid addiction.
“If these particular elected officials are interested in working with DSS on this issue, it would be more effective to reach out to us, rather than calling a press conference without ever having done so,” it says.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The U.S. Department of Agriculture has announced it would restrict the use of federal subsidies for solar energy projects in favor of protecting farmland, but clean energy advocates say solar gives farmers a higher production value per acre than any traditional crop. 
A press release from USDA notes specific funding programs can no longer be used for wind and solar projects. The action, the release said, furthers the department’s goal to end taxpayer support of  “unaffordable and unreliable ‘green’ energy sources and ensure the supply chain consists of American products and manufacturing.” 
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said in the release the changes will also stop the loss of prime farmland to solar fields. According to the release, the number of solar panels on U.S. farmland has increased by more than 50% since 2012. 
Rollins said beginning farmers have a more difficult time entering the agricultural market when they also have to compete with solar projects for land. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Our prime farmland should not be wasted and replaced with green new deal subsidized solar panels,” Rollins said. “It has been disheartening to see our beautiful farmland displaced by solar projects, especially in rural areas that have strong agricultural heritage.”
Scale in Iowa 
USDA defines prime farmland as land with the “best combination” of characteristics for producing food, feed, forage, fiber and oilseed crops. This land must also be available for these uses, per the definition. 
According to the Clean Grid Alliance, about 17.5 million acres of Iowa’s 30 million acres of farmland are considered prime agricultural ground. 
The Clean Grid Alliance analyzed data from USDA and the power grid for the central U.S. and found that if all of the proposed solar projects in Iowa were built on only prime farmland, it would occupy 0.2% – or about 35,000 acres – of prime farmland in the state. 
The alliance report shows in 2025, Iowa had 677 megawatts of solar online, and on about 5,755 acres of land. A view of active, utility scale solar projects in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, power grid shows Iowa has fewer solar projects than surrounding states in the MISO power grid. 
Rollins’ announcement also noted solar panels manufactured by “foreign adversaries” could not be used in USDA projects. Rollins said again in a press release Thursday that foreign-made solar panels would not be allowed in USDA projects. This separate release directed agencies to prioritize land use efficiency in power generation projects on National Forest System lands.
According to a 2022 report from the International Energy Agency, China “dominates” solar manufacturing and accounts for more than 80% of the share in all manufacturing stages for solar panels. 
The USDA initiative would target the Business and Industry program and the Rural Energy for America Program, or REAP, both of which are under USDA Rural Development. 
Per the press release, wind and solar projects are no longer eligible under the Business and Industry program. 
Recipients of REAP must ensure any wind or solar installations are “right-sized for their facilities.” The release specifies that ground mount solar photovoltaic systems must be smaller than 50 kilowatts and be able to record historical energy use to remain eligible under the REAP program. 
USDA did not detail how it would judge location or solar panel origin as it relates to these programs.
Clean energy advocates say the action restricts farmers’ choices
Andy Olsen, the senior policy advocate for Environmental Law & Policy Center, said in a statement that USDA’s claim to protect farmland was “dubious.” 
Olsen said commercial development and data centers are “legitimate threats” to American farmland, while wind and solar projects can “coexist successfully with crops or grazing.” 
Olsen argued the REAP program gave farmers and rural businesses “greater freedom” to care for their operations. The program has been used for things like rooftop solar on small businesses or on top of hog barns. Other grants have helped with energy efficiency upgrades at farms and rural businesses.

“Any conversation around protecting farmland should come from thoughtful, balanced input, not blanket restrictions that strip choices from the very people REAP was designed to serve,” Olsen said in a statement.
REAP was established in the 2008 Farm Bill, and funding for the program increased substantially under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. 
Olsen also said solar and wind projects give farmers the ability to generate energy on their own and to create additional revenue streams. 
According to Clean Grid Alliance, Iowa farmers and landowners receive $4.3 million, annually in land-lease payments for solar projects. 
The fact sheet from the alliance also notes solar pays significantly more per acre than traditional row crops. According to its data, solar can generate a production value of $11,068 per acre, annually, for farmers. Corn, by contrast, has a per acre production value of about $930. These figures are dependent on the price of electricity and on corn. 
Some larger-scale solar projects in Iowa are managed and run by utility companies, including the 150 megawatt Wever Solar Project, operated by Alliant Energy in Lee County. 
A spokesperson for Alliant said the company did not seek federal grants from USDA for any of its solar projects and is not impacted by this latest decision from USDA.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-22 15:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,New Haven-area ER visitors more likely to report suicidal thoughts,Angela Eichhorst,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/22/suicide-connecticut/,Residents from South Central Connecticut told emergency room personnel they'd had thoughts of suicide at 1 1/2 times the state average.,"Residents in one part of Connecticut are more likely to report having suicidal ideation, but experts say that might be due to a willingness to talk about it.
Emergency departments in South Central Connecticut recorded more frequent mentions of suicidal ideation than facilities in other parts of the state, according to the state Department of Public Health. 
In data collected between April 2024 and April 2025, residents of the towns that make up the South Central Regional Council of Governments told ER personnel they’d had thoughts of suicide at one-and-a-half times the state average. 
But the numbers might point to more of an opportunity than a problem.
“I do wonder if, in the region of South Central Connecticut, stigma has gotten to the point where we are more open to know about suicidal ideation, more than in other regions,” said Dr. Pamela Hoffman, a clinician at Yale Medicine’s pediatric emergency department.
“It’s really wonderful that we’re seeing these numbers, because it means that we can intervene,” she said. “There are suicidal people that are out there that we don’t know about, and this is actually us finding out about it.”
When patients arrive at the ER, suicidal ideation may be assessed by a medical professional, who asks the patient directly if they are thinking of ending their life. The data includes people who may have been treated for other conditions, but they were asked, as per hospital protocol, if they wished to harm themselves, according to a statement by the Department of Public Health.    
“There are hospitals around the nation for which there is not the standard of care to ask about suicidality for all patients,” said Hoffman. “I’ll give credit to our Hartford colleagues” at Connecticut Children’s Medical Center, she said, who started universally screening all ER patients for suicidal thoughts five years ago.
Residents of the Capitol Region Council of Governments, which includes Hartford, told ERs they had suicidal thoughts at the second-highest rate in Connecticut.
Suicidal ideation rates at ER visits have remained relatively steady in the last five years, apart from a big drop between Q1 and Q2 2020, which, according to the Department of Public Health, “is the impact of COVID 19 and people being fearful of going to the [emergency department] for routine and non-life-threatening conditions during this time.”
Thoughts of suicide had been on the rise long before COVID, according to Hoffman. In her almost two decades of emergency room practice, she has seen an increase in suicidal thoughts, attempts, and fatalities, while the age of people attempting suicide has gone down. “Younger kids are trying things, more than they ever have,” she said. 
The belief that talking about suicide increases the chances a person will act on it has been widely debunked. 
“We had a mental health crisis for children even before COVID,” said Hoffman. “Now we’re talking about it, thankfully. Now we’re describing it. Now we’re trying to change it.”
Dr. Christine Cha, a youth suicide researcher at the Yale Child Study Center, said, “There’s no need to wait until a person has already tried to hurt themselves and gone to the [emergency department] to then broach the topic of suicide. The science shows us that asking youth and adults about suicide is not directly harmful or suggestive. It’s OK to ask. And by not asking, we may be giving up countless opportunities to start an important conversation.”
Connecticut ERs saw over 38,000 visits in which suicidal ideation was present last year, according to data from the Department of Public Health.      
Young people aged 10 to 17 had the highest rate of suicidal ideation — 501 per 10,000 visits. In Connecticut, the rate of suicidal ideation per ER visit decreased with age.
Residents of the city of New Haven differed from the typical age pattern. Their rate of suicidal ideation in ER visits increased with age up to the 45-54 range, before decreasing. Researchers could not speak to the reason behind the older ages in New Haven.
Nationwide, men ages 85 and older are the most likely cohort to die by suicide. Fatality is linked to access to lethal means, particularly firearms. 
“The folks that die from suicide don’t necessarily have a pattern of hospitalizations or emergency room treatments,” said Brendan Burke, Assistant Child Advocate at the state Office of the Child Advocate. “Some folks have zero contact with helping systems before they die by suicide. Others have years and years of treatment, and they still die by suicide.”
Many who struggle with suicidal thoughts and self harm do not get access to the treatment they need, said Burke. And just because a person is seen at an ER doesn’t mean treatment resources are established or those thoughts are resolved.
“Once they come into my ER, we’ve already failed them,” said Hoffman.
Both Cha and Hoffman are positive about telehealth treatment, which has become more prominent since COVID and is legal in Connecticut. Hoffman said she hopes to see more conversations about suicide at schools and workplaces.
Anyone can experience thoughts of suicide, Burke said. “It’s your neighbor, it’s your school teacher, it’s anybody around us that could get to that point.”
Hoffman suggests that kids save the 988 and 211 hotline numbers in their phone’s contacts before they think they need them. 
“I actually encourage them not to name it like ‘crisis’ or ‘suicide hotline.’ I want them to name it something that if their friends started going through their phone, they wouldn’t freak out about it,” Hoffman said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-29-at-1.48.27 PM-1024x827.png,,,2025-08-22 11:58:15.122431

(Photo courtesy of American Prairie)American Prairie has added just more than 1,400 acres of land, which includes scenic habitat situated both near and along the Missouri River, improving public access for boaters, floaters, anglers, and other river recreationalists.
The first land acquisition grows American Prairie’s existing PN unit by 1,365 acres, which is made up of 630 deeded acres and 735 leased acres. The property is located in Chouteau County, across the Missouri River from the historic Lewis and Clark campsite at Slaughter River, also known today as “Arrow Creek.” It was one of the few locations utilized by the expedition on both their outbound and return journeys. Sitting at the confluence of the Missouri and Arrow Creek, this area is also culturally and historically significant for the region’s Indigenous Peoples who lived, traveled, camped, and hunted buffalo and other game along the resource-rich river corridors.
Being adjacent to the PN, this property is rich with wildlife and provides habitat for elk, deer, pronghorn, coyotes, beavers, bears, prairie dogs, curlew, burrowing owls, and upland birds. Bighorn sheep are also present in the area, and it serves as an important migration corridor for carnivores.
“This property is an incredible area for hiking, biking, and wildlife viewing, and a great jumping off point to explore this part of the Missouri River Breaks,” said Alison Fox, CEO of American Prairie. “As Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks continues to develop plans for Judith Landing State Park, we’re excited to continue to grow public access along the Missouri River.”
Last year, American Prairie donated 109 acres of deeded land on the PN to the Montana State Parks Foundation. The donated land is part of the Judith Landing Historic District, and a treasure trove of historical and cultural significance. Recognizing the unique value of Judith Landing to the people and the State of Montana, American Prairie took the initiative to gift stewardship of these acres for the creation of Montana’s newest state park. Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks is currently developing plans for the park, which will include interpretive signage, day-use parking, bathrooms, and a small campground so visitors can enjoy the river corridor overnight.
American Prairie also announced it has acquired an additional 84 deeded acres in Phillips County along the Missouri River, just west of its popular Antelope Creek Campground. It includes more than a half-mile of river frontage within the National Wild and Scenic stretch of the river.
“Every acquisition is meaningful, and these additional 84 acres will provide terrific river access and another scenic camping spot,” said Fox.
Visitors at Antelope Creek Campground on American Prairie’s Mars Vista unit, will now be a short hike from their RV spot, tent site, or cabin to this new access point on the Missouri River. Every year, thousands of visitors choose to get off the beaten path and stay overnight at American Prairie’s lodging facilities, which include Antelope Creek campground, Buffalo Camp, and the Myers Family Huts.
These two land purchases bring American Prairie’s total habitat base to 528,408 acres, which is comprised of 141,157 deeded acres and 387,251 leased public acres.
Providing public access is a cornerstone of the nonprofit’s mission and the majority of its private lands are open to the public for recreation. American Prairie intends to share public access details in the future to spell out recreational uses on these new deeded acres. As it has done in the past, the organization needs to first take time to familiarize itself with the property.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Image-8-21-25-at-11.26-AM-1024x677.jpeg,,,2025-08-22 10:56:33.443257

Article Summary
Article Summary

The Citizen Participation Act now explicitly protects news reporting from “strategic lawsuits against public participation.”
The Illinois Supreme Court had previously ruled that news reporting itself wasn’t covered if it was not investigative in nature or eliciting participation in government.
Lawmakers filed the bill in response to that court ruling, and Gov. JB Pritzker said the measure was designed to “protect and empower Illinois journalists.”

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on the story. 

A state law designed to prevent lawsuits that curtail public participation in government now explicitly protects the news media.
Gov. JB Pritzker signed a measure into law on Thursday that was spurred by a former government official’s lawsuit against the Chicago Sun-Times. Senate Bill 1181 explicitly protects non-investigative news reporting against “strategic lawsuits against public participation,” otherwise known as SLAPP lawsuits.
The Illinois Supreme Court allowed a lawsuit by a former Property Tax Appeals Board director to continue against the Sun-Times last year despite the paper’s claims that it was a SLAPP suit under the 2007 Citizen Participation Act.

Sun-Times reporting
The paper published multiple articles about government watchdog investigations into the former executive director of the PTAB, Mauro Glorioso, stemming from the board’s treatment of a property tax appeal at Trump Tower in Chicago.
The complaint, which has since been ruled unfounded by the Office of the Executive Inspector General, claimed that Glorioso, a Republican, told staff “he wanted a large reduction in the assessment of Trump Tower because the owner of the property was the president of the United States.”
Glorioso sued the newspaper in 2021, claiming the paper defamed him by mischaracterizing the OEIG investigation, misstating his motivation and overstating his involvement in the decision.
Supreme Court ruling
The court ruled in November that the Sun-Times’ articles weren’t investigations, which would have been protected under the law. Instead, the court wrote, the articles were news reports about something a government agency was doing and lacked any intent to elicit action from the government — which was needed for SLAPP protections to be applicable.
The court allowed the suit to continue at the lower level.
“This is not to minimize or understate the importance of the press and other news media in our democracy,” Justice David K. Overstreet wrote in the opinion. “Our jurisprudence is replete with privileges and other protections designed to protect these concerns, many of which remain at issue in this lawsuit. We are simply holding that the (Citizen Participation) Act specifically protects government participation and does not encompass all media reports on matters of public concern.”
That’s no longer the case after the signing of SB 1181, which reads: “The press opining, reporting, or investigating matters of public concern is participating and communicating with the government,” meaning organizations doing so are protected under the law.
‘Ensures the media can do their job freely’
The measure was sponsored in the Senate by former news anchor Steve Stadelman, D-Rockford.
“As a former news anchor, I know it’s essential for the media to use their First Amendment right to free speech and press,” Stadelman said in a statement. “This law ensures the media can do their job freely, without fear of legal harassment or intimidation.”
Gov. JB Pritzker shared similar sentiments.
“As Trump and his friends continue their frivolous and targeted attacks on members of the free press, we are working to protect and empower Illinois journalists as they keep the general public informed,” Pritzker said in a news release. “This law will strengthen our anti-SLAPP legislation in Illinois — ensuring press don’t have to fear retaliation for reporting the truth and reminding all Illinoisans that their free speech is safe, valued, and protected.”
The measure also provides that all legal proceedings in a case, including discovery, would be stayed while a party’s Citizen Participation Act lawsuit motion progresses in court.
Rep. Dan Ugaste, R-Geneva, was among the Republicans who voiced concerns on the House floor.
“I believe we’re going to have an unintended impact of actually harming individuals who are just trying to protect themselves from what could be very irresponsible journalism, all under the guise of protecting the constitutional right of the freedom of the press,” Ugaste said before voting “no.”
Rep. Daniel Didech, D-Buffalo Grove, explained the reasoning behind the change during floor debate.
“We are amending the statute so there still has to be a nexus to that exercise of constitutional rights, but the conduct does not have to be solely related to that exercise,” Didech said.
The bill cleared the House 75-38 and the Senate 47-10.

(Photo by Kyle Stokes/Axios)What had been a polarizing election for Minneapolis mayor has exploded into a full-blown political crisis for the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.
U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar and a group of prominent Minneapolis Democrats Thursday released a statement condemning the state party for revoking the DFL convention endorsement of mayoral candidate Sen. Omar Fateh, who would be the city’s first Somali-American mayor if elected in November.
“A small group of DFL board members, a majority living outside Minneapolis, met privately to overturn the will of Minneapolis delegates who volunteered, organized, and participated in a months-long DFL process. It is inexcusable to overturn the results weeks after the convention because board members did not like the outcome,” wrote the group, which also comprised state Sens. Zaynab Mohamed and Doron Clark, state Reps. Aisha Gomez, Fue Lee, Mohamud Noor, Sydney Jordan and Esther Agbaje and several members of the City Council and Hennepin County Board.
The statement notes a majority of the DFL committee that revoked the endorsement Thursday don’t live in Minneapolis, while also drawing an ideological contrast between “progressive democrats who are challenging the status quo and moderate democrats.”  It also alleges “blatant corruption” via “the influence of big money in our politics.”
Though his name goes unmentioned, the statement is a pointed rebuke of state DFL Chair Richard Carlbom, who was hand-picked by Gov. Tim Walz to succeed current DNC Chair Ken Martin.
The ruling and report, released on Thursday from the state party following a formal complaint by the Frey campaign, paints a portrait of a convention so dysfunctional that the Minneapolis DFL is on “probation” for two years. Carlbom reached for comity with an anodyne statement announcing the decision, telling Democrats to move on: “Now it’s time to turn our focus to unity and our common goal: electing DFL leaders focused on making life more affordable for Minnesotans and holding Republicans accountable for the chaos and confusion they’ve unleashed on Minnesotans.”
Not so, Omar and the progressives responded in a thunderous finale: “This decision will be a stain on our party for years to come and damage our ability to organize for Democratic wins this year, next year, and beyond.”
Unions backing Fateh — including SEIU and Unite HERE — called a Friday press conference, an ominous sign for a party where the “L” in DFL is still a major source of campaign foot soldiers and money. 
Carlbom’s ties to Mayor Jacob Frey, whose campaign launched the challenge, only fueled suspicions about a cozy relationship between the state party and the incumbent: The firm of which Carlbom was a partner until he was elected DFL chair last year — United Strategies — has received some $30,000 in consulting fees from the Frey campaign this year.
Carlbom seems to have been in a difficult spot, however. The report details an electronic voting system that the committee calls “substantially flawed.” The narrative describes an old version of the spreadsheet software Excel, powered by broken formulas, and a massive undercounting during the first round of voting. Hours of challenges and delay followed. The credentials sheet was left unsecured and apparently accessed by people who shouldn’t have had access, including the campaigns. Another candidate, DeWayne Davis, secured enough votes to move on to the next round but was wrongly excluded. The entire Ward 5 credentials book was lost. The final vote was a show of hands. 
For Fateh defenders, the convention problems — and the entire challenge — are all noise because they insist Frey had no chance to win, while Fateh merely needed to consolidate the anti-Frey delegates for the victory they say has now been unjustly revoked.
Now, Carlbom and other prominent Democrats must deal with the potential fallout, which could anger progressives across the river and into the newly blue suburbs. Even if the rage were to remain local, however, the consequences could be substantial. The 5th Congressional District, which encompasses Minneapolis, delivered 293,00 votes to Vice President Kamala Harris last year, some 40,000 more than the DFL-rich 3rd and 4th Districts.
If progressives stay home next year or even feel less inclined to volunteer, that could help Republicans achieve their first statewide win in 20 years.
Jeff Blodgett, a longtime DFL consultant who managed the campaigns of the late Sen. Paul Wellstone, said he’s confident Democrats will find unity out of purpose next year: “The stakes in these election are so high that I don’t think people are going to boycott them due to frustrations with intraparty DFL controversies.” He called Carlbom a “dynamic chair” who is leading a state DFL that is well funded and doing off-year organizing and messaging that will pay off next year. 
Still, the divisive mayoral race is just the latest challenge to beset Democrats, the list of mistakes and misfortunes growing seemingly by the day. From the farcical — a state senator’s second drunk driving arrest while in office; the felony conviction of a different state senator — to the tragic, in the form of the assassination of House DFL leader Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark.
The party also has real, substantial differences it must either resolve or — more likely — learn to live with. Israel’s war on Gaza, for instance, has riven the party, often along demographic lines, with young progressives supporting the boycott, divest and sanctions movement and accusing older Democrats like Sen. Amy Klobuchar — who has also endorsed Frey — of complicity in genocide.
The DFL’s struggles, after a long run of governance, evoke some similarities to national Democrats of the late 1960s: A party dominant since FDR’s New Deal but then exhausted and fractured by the Vietnam War, civil unrest and urban disorder, changing demographics, racial struggle, countercultural anthesis — and the murder of beloved leaders.
The climactic scene of 1968 also took place at a political convention, this one in Chicago, where the emerging New Left were embittered at the defeat of their insurgent antiwar candidate Sen. Eugene McCarthy.
What followed was a period of Republican dominance that has helped shape the country we live in today.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/dfl-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-22 10:56:33.443257

Authorities in the West African nation threw him in prison because of his sexual orientation, he said. After his release, he feared that if he stayed in the country, he would be killed.
B., who is now 39 and who asked that he be identified only by his initial because he still has family in Cameroon, arrived in the United States with practically nothing. Since he was granted asylum last year, he has been able to use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, to help him get by.
But now most refugees and asylees, who entered the country legally, including B., are no longer eligible for food stamps. The change is part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the giant federal domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4.
“I think it’s unfair. I understand that there are some people who abuse the system,” B. told Stateline. “There are also people who are in need. And cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.”
SNAP, which is funded by the federal government but administered by the states, helps families and individuals with lower incomes supplement their grocery budgets. The program serves an average of 42 million people a month.
Supporters of the change note that refugees and asylees can get permits to work, and that they have other sources of support.
“It’s not like they have been dropped off in this country with no support system,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that backs stricter immigration rules.
“They have sponsoring organizations that are helping them get settled and they have work authorization. So they really should be moving forward towards self-sufficiency with support right out of the starting gate. And they should be moving ahead to obtain green cards,” she added, referring to the cards that signify permanent residency.
Vaughan cited a federal grant program that reimburses states and nonprofit organizations for financial aid and health care coverage they provide to refugees.
But critics argue that asylees and refugees, who are extensively vetted and have a legitimate path to citizenship, can wait years for a green card, which entitles them to a wider array of benefits.
They also say community organizations that provide aid to asylees and refugees are stretched thin. Without food stamps, they say, many refugees and their families would not have enough to eat.













Cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.


– B., a Cameroonian asylee





“SNAP is an incredibly fundamental program for this population that comes to the United States, really, with very little, if anything,” said Nicolas Palazzo, a policy counsel at the global humanitarian and refugee advocacy organization HIAS. “These are people who literally had to flee — many times overnight — with nothing, but, you know, a pair of clothes in a backpack.”
Palazzo also said SNAP is not a “handout” to refugees or asylees. Rather, he said, it’s a “smart and moral investment” that protects all communities and strengthens the economy, offering people a foundation for self-sufficiency.
“Stripping critical food assistance forces refugees and asylees into the shadows of informal work, labor exploitation and hunger that weakens our workforce and denigrates our moral obligations,” Palazzo said.
 ‘Nowhere else to go’

B. said he applied immediately for asylum when he arrived in the U.S. in 2016, but that he had to wait months for a work permit. He survived by doing odd jobs, such as cleaning homes and delivering food, and got by on very little. It wasn’t until late 2024, when he finally won his asylum case, that he was eligible to get any public benefits, including food stamps.
Eligibility for food stamps came at a critical time for B., as a car accident had prevented him from making food deliveries.
“While not having income, it was very helpful,” B. said. “I’m somebody who if I can work, I will work. The only reason I went over there to ask is because I had nowhere else to go.”
According to a November 2024 report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, a total of 60,050 people were newly admitted to the United States as refugees in 2023, many from unstable countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Syria and Afghanistan.
In 2023, the nation received at least 747,000 applications for people seeking asylum from countries including Venezuela, Cuba and Colombia, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration research group. It’s a tremendous increase from the 68,000 applications received in 2013.
The new domestic policy law specifies that food stamps are still available to Cubans and Haitians who might be refugees and asylees.
As of July 2025, more than 2.2 million immigrants in the U.S. are awaiting asylum hearings or decisions after formally applying for asylum, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, an organization at Syracuse University that tracks immigration cases.
“Getting through the system was difficult,” B. said. “I had to find money. I had to find an attorney who would help me apply for my asylum case. The asylum case itself took a long time.
“I still know people who have been here for more than 10 years and never had an interview.”
 ‘Already stretched’

According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, half of all admitted refugees in 2023 were resettled across just 10 states: Texas, New York, California, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan and Washington.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 41,000 people in the state are getting SNAP benefits while not being lawful permanent residents. She says that group includes refugees and asylees.
“The concerning part there is that these are individuals who were … lawfully admitted to the country, have previously been eligible for SNAP when they need it, and now, simply because of their status, will no longer be able to receive SNAP benefits,” Guinn told Stateline. “There’s nothing we’re going to be able to do to make them eligible.”
Another change under the new law is that for the first time, states will have to pay for a portion of their food stamp programs. States will have to cover between 5% and 15% of their SNAP costs beginning in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they dole out benefits to people eligible for the program.
Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, pointed out that states that want to continue to provide SNAP benefits to refugees and asylees are free to do so — as long as they pay for it.
“If New York state doesn’t want to cut these people off, they can continue to give them something like food stamps. They just have to do it with New York state money right now,” Rector said.
But Guinn said that will be difficult. New York does offer asylum-seekers cash assistance of $180 a month through its Safety Net Assistance Program, but typically recipients must be working.
In Texas, officials at the state’s health and human services agency said that as of last month, roughly 24,600 of the state’s 3.5 million SNAP recipients were refugees or asylees. A spokesperson for Maryland’s human services agency wrote in an email that the state’s SNAP program last year supported more than 10,000 refugees and asylees.
The California Department of Social Services could not provide the number of refugees and asylees receiving food stamps, but projected that a total of 74,000 noncitizens — including lawfully permanent residents, refugees and asylees — would lose eligibility under the new law.
Sherri Laigle, the director of social services at HIAS, said food banks will not be able to make up for refugees’ and asylees’ loss of SNAP benefits.
“They’re already stretched, and now we’re going to see tens of thousands of people also needing to continue to rely on these programs. Of course, there’s limited access to them. You have to have transportation. You have to be able to get there.”
B. said he would apply for food stamps again if he could, because he’s earning too little income to get by.
“There are people who are in need. I think ignoring that — it’s not human.”

Last year in Missouri, a pound of wholesale marijuana sold for about $2,000 on average, according to the nation’s leading wholesale cannabis platform LeafLink. That put Missouri in the company’s top five highest prices.
It’s still profitable to sell a marijuana facility license in Missouri, said Ben Burstein, corporate development manager at LeafLink —  a dynamic that is not true in many other states. 
“You have tons of licensed operators that put millions of dollars into their businesses over time,” Burstein said of the experience in many other states. “And not only are they not making money, they have to pay to get rid of those licenses and all the closing costs associated with it.” 
 This guide used data from orders placed on the LeafLink marketplace between Jan. 1 and Dec. 31, 2024.
Experts agree the success is due, at least in part, to Missouri’s limited number of facility licenses. 
Capping the number of businesses that can partake in the cannabis industry has drawn pointed criticism that it has encouraged a monopoly in the program and created the appearance of corruption. But the cap also keeps supply and demand in balance, experts say, protecting Missouri from the pitfalls others states are facing. 
Oregon-based cannabis economist Beau Whitney says in other states there’s a “massive amount of oversupply” that has made it difficult for marijuana businesses to stay afloat. 
A survey Whitney Economics released last year found that only 27% of cannabis companies nationwide on average were profitable in the cannabis space. And 73% were either breaking even or losing money.
Last week, President Donald Trump told reporters he plans to revisit a proposal to reschedule marijuana that started under President Joe Biden, which has been on pause since January. The plan would place marijuana in the same federal classification as codeine, instead of where it currently is alongside heroin.
“We’re looking at it,” said Trump last Monday, noting that he expects to determine whether cannabis will be reclassified in the next few weeks.
So would a push by the president to restart the plan disrupt Missouri’s ecosystem?
The short answer is yes, Whitney said, but it wouldn’t be immediate. 
The process to reschedule a drug requires going through multiple drafts of administrative rules, hearings and public comment periods that could take years to accomplish. 
“It’s a long process,” Whitney said. “It’s not a snap of the finger.”
It’s currently a federal crime for marijuana to cross over state lines. Would rescheduling open up the borders and allow states to sell to each other, also allowing the oversupply to bottom out Missouri’s prices?
That depends on the details in the federal rules, said St. Louis attorney Eric Walter, who represents a number of cannabis operators and the Missouri Cannabis Trade Association.
But a provision in the Missouri constitutional amendment that voters approved in 2022 legalizing marijuana was designed to control that scenario, Walter said. It states that if federal law is amended to allow interstate commerce, then only licensed cultivators could import marijuana from other states.  
“They couldn’t just sell directly to dispensaries or sell directly to consumers,” Walter said. “It would still need to run through the regulated licensees, and the product would be subject to all of our specific requirements, including our testing panel.”
While it could upset Missouri’s economic impact, Walter said the financial impact nationwide would be “massive.” 
Rescheduling marijuana means that the substance would be moved from Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substance Act to Schedule 3. 
“Marijuana has been on 1 since the [act] was created in the early 70s,” he said, “and it never belonged.”
Medical benefits and susceptibility of addiction are taken into account when scheduling, Walter said, and Schedule 1 is for the most addictive substances with no known medical benefits, such as heroin. Cocaine is Schedule 2 because it has some medical benefits, such as numbing properties. 
“It would further erode some of the anti-marijuana bias and perceptions, and open the door to banks and financial institutions interacting with industry operators more sensibly,” Walter said.
Rescheduling would also provide tax relief to businesses, he said.

Whitney calculated that this year cannabis businesses will pay about $2.7 billion more in taxes than a normal business would have paid because they can’t write off deductions on their federal taxes. 
“They’re paying huge taxes to the federal government, even though it’s federally illegal,” Whitney said. 
In Missouri, Burstein estimates the annual impact of rescheduling in terms of taxes to be more than $150 million in additional cash flows to operators, based on current market sales.
While rescheduling would give tax breaks, it may also increase the burden on operators to get certain certifications and occur other expenses in compliance, Whitney said. With so few operators profitable as it is, “not everybody is going to be able to survive,” he said.
The rules will have different impacts in each state. In Oregon, Whitney said all Schedule 3 drugs must be sold at pharmacies, meaning dispensaries could be out of business. 
“That tax break doesn’t really help if you’re out of business,” Whitney said. “Rescheduling is maybe not the greatest thing from an economic perspective and for the industry. Even though reform is always welcome, the question then becomes, well, is the reform going to do more harm than good? I just don’t know because the reform is still in concept. It’s not even on paper.”
While President Trump said he’d take a look at it, the timing is unclear. Many Republicans, including the DEA chief Terrance Cole, are opposed to marijuana, he said.
“Operators need to remain disciplined and realize that there’s not going to be change overnight,” he said, “but be flexible enough in their processes to be able to pivot quickly once those changes happen.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_5879-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-22 10:56:33.443257

Wes Moore (D). Grady will leave her position in October after three years with the administration. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore’s Cabinet will have another vacancy this fall, when state Budget Secretary Helene Grady will leave to start her own consulting business.
Grady is the second senior administration official to announce her departure this week, after Monday’s announcement that Chief of Staff Fagan Harris is leaving, and the seventh so far this year. Her decision to leave, which will be announced by the administration Friday, was not unexpected, as it was widely circulated in and around Annapolis.
But it was still “incredibly difficult,” Grady said in an interview with Maryland Matters.
“It’s just monumental pride that I feel in the work and the team, and this leads me to feel very confident that this is the appropriate time to pass the baton for the next leg of this work,” Grady said.
Grady said she expects to start her own consulting firm “to work with public and private organizations to help them tackle messy challenges through analysis and collaboration, aligning strategic vision with detailed planning and management execution, and communicating the important work they’re doing internally and externally.”
Moore called Grady “a true public servant in every beautiful sense of that phrase.”
“When the story of Maryland’s Decade is written, her fingerprints will be all over the page,” Moore said in a statement. “During Secretary Grady’s distinguished tenure, we turned an inherited structural deficit into a surplus, delivered a tax cut to middle-class families, and secured historic investments in education, health care, public safety, transportation, and countless other priorities that Marylanders deserve.”
Grady has had to help craft budgets in a new era in which the legislature gained broad budgetary power: A constitutional amendment approved by voters before Moore was elected ended an era where Maryland’s governor controlled the budget with arguably more power than any other state executive.

Additionally, all three budget years have come with their own challenges including a post-COVID economy and the ongoing expense of the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reforms. This year alone, Moore and the legislature crafted a compromise budget that includes tax increases (and some modest targeted decreases) and fees.
She was also responsible for implementing a transition of 50,000 retired employees to Medicare. The move, mandated before Moore came into office, saved the state $200 million annually and $10 billion in post-employment liabilities. But it left retirees angry and sparked court challenges.
“I wouldn’t say that these particular efforts weighed heavily in any way on my decision,” Grady said. “This is part of the portfolio of work that I’m just incredibly proud of the DBM team in terms of what we’ve accomplished together and with our colleagues across state government in just three short years.”
Harris, Moore’s chief of staff, credited Grady with guiding the administration through a 2025 legislative session that included erasing a $3.3 billion structural budget deficit.
“We knew this was going to be one of our most challenging sessions in the first term,” Harris said. “There are a lot of issues needed to be resolved in the budget and for the state’s kind of fiscal footing going forward.”
Harris said Grady was the “architect of the governor’s tax plan.” Moore boasted that 94% of Marylanders would see no change in their taxes or would get a reduction, albeit a modest one. That plan was ultimately altered by legislators as they crated a compromise budget.
“I think she understood that the General Assembly has an important role in this,” Harris said. “I think what she set out at the outset was so sturdy and the framework for the budget was so clear and compelling, that while the budget and the ultimate plan that was passed evolved somewhat, the tent poles remain the same.”
A transition and an October departure
Grady said the job is “incredibly fulfilling and invigorating, but also very consuming, and I think it’s the right time for someone fresh to come in and lead the next leg of the work.”
She plans to stay until October, expecting the extended notice will allow Moore to find a new secretary and ensure a smooth transition.
“My understanding is that the governor’s office is focused on a search with an eye toward potentially having a successor named in that time frame,” Grady said.

October is a key month for the executive branch as it plans its budget for the coming legislative session and fiscal year.
“The team is very strong and really well positioned to keep everything running through this transition,” Grady said. “That’s also part of the reason we’re announcing at this point, so that we can ensure a smooth transition between now and when I separate in October.
“Everything is underway as we would normally be doing at this point in the year, and I anticipate a really smooth handoff with whoever comes in to succeed me,” she said. “October is a pretty natural time for that transition.”
Grady was one of five early hires made by Moore in November 2022 following his historic election. Prior to joining the administration, she was chief financial officer and treasurer at Johns Hopkins University.
She is married to Matthew Gallagher, president and CEO of the Goldseker Foundation in Baltimore and chief of staff to former Gov. Martin O’Malley (D). Gallagher is also chair of the board for Baltimore Corps, a Baltimore nonprofit once headed by Harris, Moore’s outgoing chief of staff.
Talk of Grady’s departure grew in recent weeks, as did talk of  potential replacements, including Sen. Guy Guzzone (D-Howard), chair of the Senate Budget and Taxation CommitteeChair Sen. Guy Guzzone (D-Howard), and Richard Madaleno, the former Montgomery County senator and vice chair of Budget and Tax, who currently is county administrative officer under term-limited Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich.
Challenges on the horizon
The “next leg” of the work, as Grady described it, will be rife with challenges.
“As you know, one key, key part of the next leg of the work for the next DBM leader is certainly going to be helping Maryland navigate the changes and the impacts of changes from the federal government,” Grady said.
Included in those are “the impacts on Maryland’s economy from federal job losses, which obviously impact our revenue base, potentially, as well as the impact from federal budget changes, particularly within Medicaid and SNAP at the top of the list,” she said.
Grady is the seventh senior official to leave the Moore administration as it prepares to enter its last session before Moore will be up for reelection in 2026.
Harris announced Monday that he will leave on Jan. 5 to become the next president and CEO of the Baltimore-based Abell Foundation, a prominent philanthropic organization.
In July, Transportation Secretary Paul Wiedefeld announced his retirement.
Embattled Department of Juvenile Services Secretary Vincent Schiraldi left the administration. Schiraldi, a lightning rod for criticism, especially from Republicans, said he left of his own accord, but Moore later said he asked the secretary to resign.
Anthony C. “Tony” Woods announced in May that he was leaving his job as secretary of Veterans and Military Families for a private-sector tech startup.
In January, Moore announced Kevin Anderson would leave his role as Commerce secretary and become an economic development adviser. Two weeks later, state Health Secretary Laura Herrera Scott announced she would step down amid a budget storm that included a proposed $200 million cut in funding to the Developmental Disabilities Administration.

Newsom spoke about a possible California referendum on redistricting to counter the legislative effort to add five Republican House seats in the state of Texas. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)When California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled his plan to retaliate if Republican-led Texas redrew its congressional districts to favor the GOP, he affirmed his support for less partisan maps — and then promised to “meet fire with fire.”
“We’re doing it mindful that we want to model better behavior,” Newsom told reporters in Los Angeles earlier this month, nodding to the independent system his state currently uses to draw districts. “ … But we cannot unilaterally disarm. We can’t stand back and watch this democracy disappear.”
President Donald Trump’s call for Republicans to redraw U.S. House districts so the party can win more seats in the 2026 midterm elections — to gerrymander them — has triggered a redistricting frenzy this summer that also threatens to prompt moves by Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and New York, among others. Ohio was already set to redraw its lines, even before the current fracas.
The battle for partisan advantage is placing Democratic politicians, advocates of less partisan maps and others who support curbs on gerrymandering in an uncomfortable position, pitting their desire for change against fears that Trump will take advantage of their scruples to wring more GOP seats out of a handful of key states. Some say they accept that Democratic states need to respond, while others warn retaliation will only yield short-term gains.
The Texas House passed a new map on Wednesday, clearing the way for a final vote in the state Senate and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s signature. In California, lawmakers passed their own map on Thursday, setting up a statewide vote in November over the new districts.
Other states are now likely to follow, as Republicans and Democrats scramble for a political leg up.










I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard.


– David Daley, senior fellow at FairVote


But gerrymandering opponents say the current moment has the potential to produce new energy for their movement. More people are paying attention to gerrymandering, they say, and new polls show the public opposes the practice. The rush to redraw maps demonstrates the need for Congress to set national limits, they say.
“I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard,” said David Daley, an author of books on gerrymandering and a senior fellow at FairVote, a Maryland-based nonpartisan group that supports ranked choice voting and multimember House districts to end the practice. “We will never have reform if a handful of states can act on their own.”
At the same time, some gerrymandering opponents fear states will unravel hard-fought victories. They wonder whether temporary measures, such as California potentially setting aside the independent commission it uses to redraw maps, could become permanent.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
 ‘An unprecedented time’

State legislatures exercise primary control over congressional redistricting in 39 states, according to All About Redistricting, a compendium of information on map-drawing hosted by Loyola Law School in California. While some states use other methods, only nine states rely on independent commissions, which typically limit participation by elected officials and are favored by many gerrymandering opponents.
Most states draw maps once a decade after the census, making the mid-decade maneuvers and counter-maneuvers highly unusual (six states currently have only one representative, eliminating the need to draw district lines). But just a few seats could determine who controls the U.S. House. Republicans currently hold 219 seats to Democrats’ 212, with four vacancies.
“We affirm that gerrymandering, both racial and political, disenfranchises voters,” Virginia Kase Solomón, president and CEO of Common Cause, an organization that has long advocated for changes to the redistricting process, said during a press call the day before Newsom’s announcement.
“But this is an unprecedented time of political upheaval,” she said. People don’t want to see a situation develop where maps are redrawn every two years, she added.
Pennsylvania rebuffs U.S. request for voter rolls containing personal data

The new Texas map could ease the path for Republicans to win an additional five seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Texas lawmakers rapidly advanced the redraw this week once Democratic state lawmakers returned to the state. They had traveled to other states to deny Texas House leaders the quorum required to approve the map, but returned after Newsom outlined California’s response.
Gerrymandering typically involves “packing” and “cracking.” “Packing” refers to the concentration of opposition party voters in a small number of districts to reduce competition elsewhere. “Cracking” means diluting the voting power of the opposing party’s supporters across many districts.
Texas Republicans have been frank that they are pursuing the redraw for partisan advantage. But they emphasize that no prohibition exists, in Texas or nationally, against mid-decade redistricting and that a 2019 U.S. Supreme Court decision cleared the way for states to draw maps for partisan purposes, removing the power of federal courts to police political gerrymandering.
The new maps give Republicans a chance of winning additional districts but doesn’t guarantee victories, they add.
“The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance,” Texas state Rep. Todd Hunter, a Republican who carried the bill in the Texas House, said during floor debate on Wednesday. He added a short time later: “According to the U.S. Supreme Court, you can use political performance, and that is what we’ve done.”
 Tricky terrain

As Texas moves forward and California prepares to respond, Common Cause illustrates the tricky terrain anti-gerrymandering advocates are now navigating.
The group, headquartered in Washington, D.C., fought to enact the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2008. But earlier this month, Common Cause declined to condemn California’s retaliation, saying it will judge the effort by whether the maps are a proportional response to gerrymanders in other states, whether the process includes meaningful public participation, and whether the maps expire and are replaced after the 2030 census through the state’s regular redistricting process, among other criteria.
Newsom’s proposal, the Election Rigging Response Act, will ask California voters in November to temporarily set aside the state’s redistricting commission and approve the new map drawn by the legislature. The commission would resume drawing maps following the census.
Why congressional redistricting is blowing up across the US this summer

Recent polling shows widespread public opposition to gerrymandering. A YouGov poll of 1,116 Americans conducted in early August found 69% believe it should be illegal to draw districts in a way that makes it harder for members of a particular political party to elect their preferred candidates. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The number of Americans who say gerrymandering is a big problem has jumped in recent years. In the YouGov poll, 75% of respondents said it is a major problem when districts are intentionally drawn to favor one party, up from 66% in a 2022 survey.
Some California Republicans have responded to Newsom’s proposal by defending the commission system. A group of Republicans sued in state court to block the plan, but the California Supreme Court on Wednesday denied a request to temporarily halt the effort.

 ‘Is this bad for reform?’

While members of the public might say they favor citizen-led commissions, they may not care deeply about the issue, said David Hopkins, a political science professor at Boston College who has written on polarization in American politics. He called gerrymandering a “classic process subject” that comes off as “inside baseball” to many people.
“The legislators in states that haven’t adopted commissions clearly don’t feel any particular political pressure to do so,” Hopkins said.
Some Republicans in states weighing a mid-decade gerrymander also discount the risk of a public backlash.
In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe may call a special session this fall to redraw the state’s map in hopes of gaining an additional GOP seat in the U.S. House. James Harris, a Missouri Republican consultant with close ties to GOP officials in the state, said he wasn’t concerned redistricting would create momentum to change the process.
Missouri voters in recent years have approved ballot measures favored by Democrats, including one in 2018 that empowered a nonpartisan demographer to draw state legislative districts, though not congressional districts. But Republicans led a successful campaign to convince voters to repeal the changes two years later.
Harris painted any new potential map as part of a national effort to help Trump — who received 58.5% of the vote in Missouri last November.
“I think the lens is wanting to make sure the president has a majority in Congress so he can actually govern for the last two years versus two years of investigations, gridlock,” Harris said.
Advocates of less partisan maps said lawmakers aren’t likely to surrender their own role in mapmaking. While some state courts may limit redistricting excesses, federal courts stopped policing partisan gerrymandering following the Supreme Court’s 2019 decision. And the high court may soon weaken the judiciary’s power to block race-based gerrymandering.
Samuel Wang, director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, which supports eliminating partisan gerrymandering, said the “one good thing” about the redistricting battle is that it’s prompted voters to pay attention to an arcane and technical issue. That could be a positive in the long run, he said, “if people can keep a cool head.”
Wang has written online that any response to Texas should remain measured and proportionate. California offers Democrats the only clean option to strike back, Wang wrote. Five Democratic seats could be added by redrawing the state.
“Is this bad for reform? I mean, I’m torn,” Wang told Stateline. “Because on the other hand, Democrats have been, over the last few decades, vocal in their advocacy for voting rights in various forms and now that advocacy is in question because they find a need to fight fire with fire.”
“So I guess the way I would characterize it is if they can hold it in check and not do it in every single state and just engage in whatever they’re doing where it will make a difference,” he said, “then we might not lose all the progress that’s been made.”

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — An open letter from Kansas Catholic bishops urges people to approach immigration with compassion, and condemns portrayals of all immigrants as criminals — rhetoric President Donald Trump frequently uses.
“Treating all migrants and refugees as if they were violent criminals is simply unjust. They are human beings made in God’s image,” wrote Archbishop Shawn McKnight, Bishop Carl Kemme, and Bishop Gerald Vincke in the letter.
Both Pope Francis, who died in April, and Pope Leo XIV, the first American pope, have been critical of Trump’s mass deportations and descriptions of immigrants as criminals.
The Kansas Legislature passed a resolution in April to encourage Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly — who has condemned Trump’s immigration enforcement efforts, like his deployment of the National Guard on U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement protests in Los Angeles —  to “fully cooperate with the policies of the Trump administration in enforcing federal immigration laws.”
The resolution encourages compassion for immigrants — who are less likely to commit crimes than U.S.-born Americans — but includes a paragraph that asserts “illegal immigration leads to severe repercussions for our entire state, including threats to public safety and public health via human trafficking, the deadly fentanyl crisis and strains on public resources.”
Some of the legislators who voted yes on the resolution are Catholic, including Republican Rep. David Buehler from Lansing.
Buehler said he found the bishops’ letter, which acknowledges criminals are taking advantage of the country’s broken immigration system, to be incomplete.
“We don’t have anything in the way of policy in the state of Kansas that I think is not kind. I think we all stand for law and order and humane treatment of all people,” Buehler said. “But I think we have to consider all aspects of this issue, and we can’t turn a blind eye to the impact on our schools, to the impact on our health care. There are so many pieces and parts.”
Buehler said he is worried about what he sees as the unintended consequences of immigration, which he believes were exacerbated when President Joe Biden was in office.
“We should have humane treatment for immigration and those who may be here illegally, but we also at the same time should enforce the laws of this country,” Buehler said. “We can do both.”
Throughout their letter, the bishops encouraged Kansans to see immigrants as humans rather than criminals. 
“Amid political division and fear, we remind our communities that at the center of every immigration debate are real people: families in our pews, children in our schools, workers in our neighborhoods, and volunteers in our parishes,” the bishops wrote.
Shabina Kavimandan immigrated to Kansas from India in 1998. She said she started volunteering with Overland Park Democratic Sen. Cindy Holscher’s campaign for governor in part because of Holscher’s kindness toward immigrants.
“There are certain members of a party that always say they align with so many religious views, especially when it comes to ‘pro-life’ issues,” Kavimandan said. “I see that they believe in life, and the value of life. And then on the other hand there is such a dismissal of the reasons why people choose to come to this country.”
Kavimandan said she stayed in the United States in part because of her determination and also because of Kansans’ interest in knowing and helping her as a person.
“There were people who sat across from me and asked about Shabina the individual. I see that missing now,” Kavimandan said. “That’s another piece that lawmakers tend to overlook sometimes. Behind all the policies there really are just people and their stories. There’s a Shabina who came to this land with $200 in her pocket, but then there were people who were like ‘We have to make sure that she becomes something in this country.’ ”

(Photo by Melissa Sue Gerrits/Getty Images)At the end of July, North Carolina officials awarded Dynamic Group LLC a contract to demolish, repair and rebuild western North Carolina homes that were destroyed by Hurricane Helene.
Two years earlier, almost to the day, Dynamic — along with its founder and affiliated companies — was served federal court papers. In that suit, a Texas business partner is accusing CEO Joshua McCoy of running a racketeering scheme, allegedly using the partner’s company to qualify for million-dollar loans, pay off debts and enrich his “spiderweb” of LLCs.
A complaint filed in Texas federal court in 2023 alleges that Dynamic’s business partner was “just the latest in a series of victims of McCoy and his enterprise’s modus operandi of fiduciary breaches, falsification of financial[s] and embezzlement.”
The case has been on pause since December 2023, but remains open. Dynamic’s attorney calls it a “commercial dispute” in which Dynamic is “owed significant funds.”
Now, the Baton Rouge, Louisiana-based business is one of 20 that will be paid by the state to rebuild homes after the deadliest storm in North Carolina history. The companies will play a crucial role in a $1.4 billion federal grant program.
State officials are aiming to avoid the errors that plagued past recovery efforts. During North Carolina’s recovery from Hurricanes Matthew and Florence, errant communications and jumbled accounting led to countless construction delays. Survivors waited years to be able to go home, as the state agency charged with building housing racked up a deficit of hundreds of millions of dollars.
Gov. Josh Stein’s administration has pledged to chart a more efficient path as it rebuilds from Helene, frequently citing an unprecedented timeline for recovery thus far while it navigates uncertainty from Washington.
Dynamic is not the only contractor hired by the state that has landed in court. Other companies have previously settled lawsuits both in and out of court with customers, subcontractors and the federal government, court records reviewed by NC Newsline show.
At least five of the companies are still parties to open federal litigation as of mid-August. And two other companies do not currently hold general contractor’s licenses in the state.
The businesses are set to enter three-year contracts with North Carolina. State officials can choose to renew each contract for up to three additional years.
Companies that submitted bids were required to disclose their history of litigation, including any pending cases. Failure to comply “may disqualify” the company, according to the state. And officials can reject a bid if the legal history “demonstrates … unsatisfactory performance, adversarial or contentious demeanor or significant failure(s) to meet contractual obligations.”
Documents provided upon request to NC Newsline detail the state’s grading and recommendation process for all bidders.










While a vendor’s litigation history was not a specific criterion used by the division’s selection committee, that factor was indeed a part of the overall review process related to evaluating a given vendor’s ability to perform.


– David Rhoades, spokesperson, N.C. Department of Commerce


The state received 46 bids in total. Twenty were deemed not eligible, seven others were eliminated after a review of financial documents and one declined the state’s offer.
All 20 contracted companies were graded “recommended” or “highly recommended,” with department officials praising their records of past performance, capacity and proposed plans for western North Carolina.
Many of them are based in the South, and most are national in scope — frequently bidding for significant disaster rebuild contracts across multiple states battered by hurricanes. The businesses’ levels of experience were frequently cited by state officials as key factors in selecting them.
“While a vendor’s litigation history was not a specific criterion used by the division’s selection committee, that factor was indeed a part of the overall review process related to evaluating a given vendor’s ability to perform,” said David Rhoades, spokesperson for the N.C. Department of Commerce, which issued the contracts.



RICO suit, manufactured home complaints & federal fund claims
Multiple companies that won contracts with North Carolina are parties in open federal lawsuits.
Dynamic is accused of breaching contract, fraud and civil conspiracy, among other charges, in the Texas case.
Drew Zarallo, who founded a solar energy company called Cogent, has alleged in that lawsuit that McCoy, the CEO of Dynamic, used his majority stake in the company “to exploit Cogent for the benefit of other companies he owned and/or controlled.”
Among the specific allegations leveled against McCoy and his company in the action: moving to apply Zarallo’s company for a $2.5 million bank loan without his knowledge; embezzling that loan to pay down debt for a separate company; “impersonating” Zarallo’s wife in emails to contractors; and “emptying” Cogent’s main bank account before selling their stake in the company.
“Dynamic is an experienced contractor and is excited to be part of rebuilding homes for North Carolinians,” said Paul DeClouet, general counsel for Dynamic, in an email. “This years-old lawsuit arises from a commercial dispute in which we are owed significant funds and was fully disclosed in our proposal.”
Eli Ness, the attorney representing Zarallo, confirmed to NC Newsline that the suit remained open. In a filing last week, he requested a formal update from the court. The case has been effectively frozen for more than a year and a half, after Dynamic and McCoy filed a motion to dismiss it.
Dynamic will have “the capacity to do repairs, rebuilds and manufactured housing” in western North Carolina, DeClouet said. The company has previously won $88 million in contracts for hurricane levees in Louisiana, and in 2022 was tapped as a construction manager for the state’s federally-funded homebuilding program. State officials marked the company as “highly recommended” in a memo.
Other cases involving contracted companies appear to be nearing resolutions.
In one of those cases, two Louisiana residents who purchased a manufactured home from Regional Enterprises LLC allege that there were “instantly noticeable issues and defects.” They cited uneven and sinking floors, incomplete painting and sheetrock work, faulty electrical work and vegetation growing between the two halves of the home.
Attorneys for the Mississippi-based Regional pushed back on many of those complaints, and described them as “manufacturer issues” (a separate company, also part of the suit, assembled the home).
A judge ruled in March that the case should be settled in arbitration. Regional Enterprises LLC did not respond to NC Newsline’s requests for comment.
Two other businesses tapped for North Carolina homebuilding are named in a New York-based suit.
A pair of residents, on their own behalf and on behalf of the federal government, sued Baumgardner House Raising LLC and SLSCO, along with New York City agencies. They allege that the companies submitted “false claims” and received federal funds for home repairs after Hurricane Sandy.
Both companies have denied the allegations and previously moved to dismiss the case.










You’re going to have people that end up wanting to either complain about the work, or some people run out of money on a project. Then all of a sudden, every issue becomes the contractor’s issue, even though it may not be a valid complaint.


– State Republican Sen. Steve Jarvis of Davidson


In a statement to NC Newsline, Texas-based SLSCO called the matter a “nuisance value case that has been settled (pending approval from the court).” Bids from the company “always disclose any litigation as required.”
The president of Baumgardner House Raising, Christian Baumgardner, declined to comment on the lawsuit when reached by phone. But he said the New Jersey-based company was experienced working with federal grant programs, and was hiring western North Carolina-based subcontractors.
“You don’t often hear of hurricanes that cause this type of damage up in mountainous regions,” Baumgardner said. “So that’s going to be a challenge. But the best way that I can think to conquer that … is with local knowledge and a team from the area.”

Timberline Construction Group of Alabama is also moving toward arbitration in a 2023 suit in which they accused a contractor of unjustly firing them from a temporary housing site in Florida. Timberline did not respond to a request for comment.
State Sen. Steve Jarvis (R-Davidson), who is a general contractor by trade, said lawsuits were all but inevitable given the amount of projects some larger contractors take on. And bidders involved in active litigation, he said, should be judged on a case by case basis.
“You’re going to have people that end up wanting to either complain about the work, or some people run out of money on a project,” Jarvis said. “Then all of a sudden, every issue becomes the contractor’s issue, even though it may not be a valid complaint.”
A last-minute filing to operate in state
Two of the companies awarded contracts do not hold active general contracting licenses in North Carolina.
Searches for Nexlegacy LLC and Lamar Construction Co. of Louisiana LLC on the database do not return any matching results. A Department of Commerce spreadsheet tracking license info confirms that the two companies do not have active licenses.
An employee with Lamar Construction confirmed that the company was currently working to secure its license in North Carolina, and that the company was hiring licensed subcontractors local to the region.
Nexlegacy’s president, Kendrick Whittington, did not respond to a request for comment.
“While builders were not required to have a North Carolina (general contracting) license in place prior to signing the contract, no builder will be assigned any work nor be paid without having this license in place,” Rhoades said.
He added that the department has alerted all contractors about the requirement.
Nexlegacy was also lacking a certificate to do business in North Carolina until this week, state business records show.
The Texas-based company had its certificate of authority revoked in 2021 after failing to file an annual report, according to records kept by the North Carolina Secretary of State’s office. It submitted its first filing in four years on Wednesday, after NC Newsline inquired about the company on Tuesday.
Whittington did not respond to separate requests for comment about the certification status.
Contractors “were not required to have” an active certificate in order to submit a bid, said Rhoades, the Commerce spokesperson. But they are required to get one upon being rewarded a contract and “prior to receiving any projects from us.”
“It’s not uncommon for out-of-state contractors to not maintain their North Carolina certificates of authority if they are currently not doing business here,” Rhoades said. “We are reaching out to all the builders to be sure they have a (certificate) prior to signing any scope of work for a specific project.”
The company filed an application to be re-certified on Wednesday and is now listed as “active” as of Friday.
The secretary of state’s office has previously advised the state to cross-check vendors with its records while issuing contracts after natural disasters.
In a letter to former Gov. Pat McCrory during Hurricane Matthew recovery in 2016, Marshall told his office to “emphasize the importance of making sure (local and state governments) check the state’s business registration database, and work with reputable and appropriately registered contractors.”
Suits involving contractors lead to settlements, arbitration
Many lawsuits involving the awarded companies ended up being dismissed. Almost all of those that did reach a resolution were settled out of court between the two parties, or in arbitration with a neutral mediator.
Those complaints included disputes with homeowners, subcontractors and in some cases, state and federal governments that hired the contractors previously. Settlement agreements do not imply guilt or admission of wrongdoing.
One of the contractors, Thompson Construction Group of Sumter, S.C., settled with the federal government in March for $191,000. Prosecutors in West Virginia had alleged that the company submitted false claims for federal disaster grant dollars, and falsely certified that homes met required conditions.
Thompson was one of four companies named in a West Virginia legislative audit released in 2018, as the state’s recovery program and contractors came under scrutiny. Thompson later faced complaints from a subcontractor under that same program, but those complaints were disputed by state officials, the Parkersburg News & Sentinel reported in 2019.
Also named in that audit was Horne LLP, which is serving as prime contractor for North Carolina’s homebuilding program. Mississippi-based Horne is now facing a ban on government contracts in West Virginia, NC Newsline previously reported. Horne has denied any wrongdoing and said it will dispute the state’s decision.
Among the other previous cases and complaints brought against contractors hired for homebuilding in North Carolina:

Regional Enterprises LLC has settled or gone to arbitration in recent years with multiple customers who purchased manufactured homes. A North Carolina resident and Regional agreed to arbitration in a complaint in October 2024. An Alabama homeowner who had alleged plumbing issues and subsequent flooding settled with Regional in August 2024. And the company settled a Mississippi case that included allegations of a faulty septic tank and cracked floors in March.
The owner of DSW Homes LLC of Texas was accused of improper installation and fraud during a Florida county licensing board hearing in April, 10 Tampa Bay News reported. The owner was cited, but was not fined and did not have his license suspended or revoked.
Persons Services Corp. of Alabama settled a dispute last year with a subcontractor in North Carolina that stemmed from constructing a Family Dollar Tree.

A year post-Helene, NC inches closer to starting construction
The construction contracts mark another step toward getting shovels in the dirt for the Renew NC homebuilding program. Leaders in the governor’s office, as well as the Department of Commerce, have been under pressure from state lawmakers wary of past struggles and itching to see visible progress.
Those efforts are complicated by the slow trickle of aid from FEMA — including the billion-dollar grant that will be used to pay contractors and build homes.
“I would settle for a little reckless spending right now, just to get money in the hands of the people,” Sen. Tim Moffitt (R-Henderson) said last month.
Officials leading the recovery have frequently cited the state’s record speed at getting federal money secured. An agreement releasing the $1.4 billion housing grant has been signed, but other requirements remain for the money to become available.
Jarvis, the senator who also sits on the legislature’s committee overseeing hurricane recovery, said he was optimistic thus far of the state’s transparency and process. He’s glad to see specific timelines laid out for demolition and mobile home building, for example.
Errors in past recovery efforts, he hopes, have taught the state what to do — and what not to do.
“If what’s on paper actually translates into an effective on-the-ground result, I think that is critical,” Jarvis said.



Homebuilding and Helene recovery in western NC: A rundown
How many homes will the contractors have to build? That depends on how many applications the state receives. The Department of Commerce said the program had surpassed 1,500 applicants for the single-family housing sector. The state will open applications for multi-family and workforce housing later this year.
When will construction begin? State officials have set a goal to begin construction in earnest by the early fall. The program cannot begin working at full capacity until the federal government unlocks the $1.4 billion in grant money that will fund homebuilding and pay contractors.
How do I apply? Visit the Renew NC website or read our story detailing the eligibility requirements and application process.
How are contractors selected for rebuilds? The state and Renew NC’s prime contractor (Horne) will assign projects (or “scopes of work”) to construction companies depending on which are best-suited and available.

Kindred, appointed by President Donald Trump to serve as a federal judge here, resigned last year from the federal bench after investigators found that he had a “sexualized relationship” with a clerk who became a prosecutor and lied about it to a senior judge and investigators, and maintained a hostile workplace for law clerks.
Since that investigation, additional improprieties connected to the U.S. attorney’s office have come to light.
On Thursday, the bar association’s board of governors voted without dissent to recommend that Kindred be disbarred, forbidden from practicing law in the state. The bar association regulates attorneys across Alaska.
The board’s recommendation will go to the Alaska Supreme Court, which must make the final determination. No date has been set for when the court will consider the issue.
Kindred, whose law license is “inactive” according to the bar association’s database, did not participate in the investigation that preceded Thursday’s hearing, said Rebecca Patterson, president of the bar association’s board.
Louise Driscoll, assistant counsel for the bar association, said the association received “lots of calls” when the investigation into Kindred was revealed to the public.
Typically, she said, the association prefers to act when a grievance is filed by someone other than the association’s own counsel, but in this case, the association’s counsel filed the grievance itself in November.
The subsequent investigation, she said, was slowed by the fact that Kindred didn’t respond to requests for a response to the grievance. He no longer lived at his address on file. He had left the federal court. Former acquaintances didn’t know where he was.
Eventually, Driscoll said, a process server found Kindred sitting on the couch at his mother’s house. 
“It was Mr. Kindred’s mother who answered the door and accepted service, but you could see Mr. Kindred on the sofa, so he was on notice,” she said.
Even then, Kindred didn’t respond, and in June, a committee recommended that Kindred be disbarred.
Driscoll said the committee considered it “very serious” that Kindred had lied to federal investigators about his activities.
“Lawyers are expected to be honest, and the members of the public have a reason to consider that they will be dealing with honest counsel,” she said.
Kindred’s actions, she added, have caused real harm — there are dozens of cases whose outcomes are now in doubt because Kindred failed to disclose conflicts of interest.
In addition, Kindred’s resignation has left only one active judge on Alaska’s district court bench.
“There’s been grievous harm,” Driscoll said of Kindred’s actions.
In a footnote to the disbarment recommendation, the committee said, “We enter our decision not with any joy. It is our collective hope Mr. Kindred can recover emotionally, financially and physically notwithstanding the hardships Mr. Kindred confronts.”
On Thursday, after Driscoll’s suggestion, the board of governors deleted that footnote.
Kindred, they concluded, should receive no more special courtesy than any other attorney facing the same accusations.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps/Utah News Dispatch)Election officials turned over at the highest rate in at least a quarter century during the last presidential election, according to new research from the Bipartisan Policy Center.
An analysis of shifts in election officials published Tuesday found nearly 41% of election officials administering the 2024 election were different than those in 2020. Turnover has accelerated over the past two decades, rising from about 28% in 2004 to 40.9% last year.
The growing percentage of departing election officials comes after years of challenges. They navigated the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as well as harassment and false conspiracy theories surrounding stolen elections that persist today.
The analysis released by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based group that seeks to foster policy cooperation across party lines, represents an updated version of a report that previously examined turnover from 2004 to 2022. The new research, which extends the data through 2024, shows the turnover rate continued to climb.
The change means that, over time, election officials have less experience. The research found that the share of chief local election officials with six or more years in their role has dropped from 60% in 2006 to 47% in 2024.
But last year, 60% of election officials had previously overseen the administration of a presidential election in their jurisdiction.
“Despite increasing turnover and loss of experience, the majority of chief election officials still have experience running at least one presidential election cycle,” the analysis said. “This is important because presidential elections typically see the highest turnout and are the most visible elections administered.”
The analysis found that over the long term, election official turnover rates have been rising gradually in small jurisdictions, defined as areas with fewer than 100,000 voting-age residents. But large jurisdictions have experienced a more sudden jump in turnover.
Small jurisdictions had a 27% turnover rate in 2004 that had risen to 40% in 2024. But large jurisdictions enjoyed a turnover rate as low as 31% in 2018 before climbing rapidly to nearly 46% last year.

California will hold a special election on Nov. 4 after the Legislature and Gov. Gavin Newsom passed a legislation package Thursday greenlighting a mid-cycle redistricting effort ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, report CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller and Jeanne Kuang.
What started as a terse warning in July — Newsom floated the idea of retaliating against the Texas GOP’s plans to redistrict in a way that would help Republicans add seats in the U.S. House of Representatives — has culminated in a mad dash by Democrats to redraw California’s congressional map to do the same for their own party.
It’ll be up to California voters then to decide whether to suspend the state’s existing electoral boundaries, which were drawn by an independent redistricting commission, and replace them with maps that would benefit Democrats. If passed, the state would return to the commission’s authority after the 2030 census.

Throughout his redistricting campaign, Newsom has once again thrown himself in the national spotlight by positioning himself as a chief antagonist to President Donald Trump, writes CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff.
During his visit to South Carolina last month — a longtime early primary state — Newsom provided a blueprint of sorts for Democrats, according to the chairperson of the Democratic Party in South Carolina, who are concerned that Trump will also pressure their red state into gerrymandering, as his advisers did with Texas.
But Newsom’s gambit is no sure bet: California voters could end up rejecting the ballot measure, which would leave a lasting stain on his gubernatorial tenure. Republicans, who are already seizing the redistricting plan as an illegal power grab by Democrats, would also likely frame the potential failure of the measure as a referendum on Newsom himself.

What about Texas?: CalMatters’ Jeanne and Maya reached out to several California Republicans in Congress and the state Legislature to see what they had to say about Texas’ redistricting plan in the face of their opposition to California’s.
While some demurred when asked if they would call on Trump directly to backtrack on redistricting in Texas, some have expressed something similar to the adage of “two wrongs don’t make a right” — without openly disapproving of Trump.

Assemblymember Carl DeMaio of San Diego: “Gerrymandering is wrong no matter who’s doing it, whether it’s done by a red state or a blue state.”

Immigration numbers down for first time in decades

Months after Trump’s return to the White House, there are now 1.4 million fewer immigrants living in the U.S., writes CalMatters’ Wendy Fry.
For the first time since the 1960s, the number of immigrants living in the country is shrinking, according to a report published Thursday by the Pew Research Center. In January 2025 there were 53.5 million immigrants in the U.S., and as of June there were 51.9 million — a 2.6% drop.
With roughly 11.3 million immigrants in 2023, California is home to the largest share of immigrants in the nation — about 28.4% of the national total. 
There are several reasons that may be contributing to the decline, said the research center’s director of race and ethnicity. One is likely federal policy and enforcement changes between January and June. Between those months, Trump issued several executive actions that aimed to block the arrival of new migrants at the border; strip protections for those who entered legally; and deport unauthorized immigrants.

Home battery program could make a comeback

From CalMatters climate reporter Alejandro Lazo:
California defunded a program in June that paid households to send power from home battery storage units back to the grid. But lawmakers now may bring it back as part of a negotiation over cap and trade.
The Demand Side Grid Support Program aims to reduce the risk of blackouts during extreme events. Essentially, homes and businesses together serve as one virtual power plant. Investor-owned utilities — and clean energy companies like Sunrun and Tesla — argue the program’s just beginning to prove its value: It delivered more than 500 megawatts of energy over two hours on a July evening, enough to cover more than half of San Francisco’s peak demand.
The draft proposal, by Democratic Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin of Thousand Oaks, could offer the program a lifeline if it’s approved. The trouble: Many interests are competing for cap and trade cash as lawmakers wind down their work.



And lastly: Court blocks ammunition background checks

California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: The Legislature is considering a plan by Newsom to reroute money from the state’s cap-and-trade program to help pay for things including the high-speed rail project — a proposal fraught with issues.
Newsom’s push to fast-track the Delta tunnel project underscores a familiar but dangerous delusion that humans can control nature, when in reality the truth and the land will catch up to us, writes Devon Provo, an urban planner and senior policy manager at Accelerate Resilience L.A.

The 18-year-old is something of a collector for academic achievements. At his home in south Jackson, Anderson has a coffee table’s worth of awards: Trophies, badges, plaques, rainbow-colored cords. 
And a binder stuffed full of college acceptances. 
All told, Anderson applied to more than 600 colleges and was admitted to exactly 582, racking up more than $10 million in scholarship offers. 
The eyepopping feat, which went viral earlier this summer, was driven by curiosity, free time, a desire to go out-of-state for college and a competitive streak.

He also wanted to be an inspiration to other JPS students, who he said are often misunderstood and stereotyped, even by fellow Jacksonians. 
“I have to say that when most people think about JPS kids, they think about criminals, bad people,” he said, “but at the end of the day, the majority of the people at JPS, they are not that.” 
Who are they? 
“Brilliant, intelligent, inspiring,” he said. “They actually want to do better for themselves.” 
Don’t get Anderson wrong: There were challenges. During his junior year, afternoon gun violence at a nearby convenience store kept forcing Forest Hill to go on lockdown. He said he missed a lot of AP U.S. History instruction that year. 
At one point, Angella thought about putting Anderson in private school. She was frustrated he kept getting marked absent when she knew he wasn’t. The school told her it was an attendance record system issue. 
She had a high school picked out – a Christian school on Siwell Road that, like many in the metro area, originated as a segregation academy. But the day she told Anderson she was at her wit’s end, he asked her if he could stay at Forest Hill. 
Anderson didn’t want to start over at a school he didn’t know, with teachers who might not support him. The two agreed that despite hardships, he had blossomed in JPS. 
“I wanted to continue growing,” he said. “The teachers that I had, my counselors, they motivated me to keep on pushing myself.” 
Forest Hill was where, in 9th grade biology class, Anderson decided he wanted to be an oncologist after learning that cancer is caused “by the cells growing out of control.” It was where he joined band and learned to play the oboe, a challenging instrument that he chose in part because it made him more attractive to colleges. 
And it’s where he got an opportunity to take dual enrollment classes at Hinds Community College. 
“It actually taught me how to study better,” he said. 
Anderson’s first anatomy exam, he scored a 79. Then he buckled down and got an 85 on his second.

By his senior year, Anderson had racked up so many credit hours, he had a lighter classload and a lot of free time. With encouragement from his guidance counselor, Monica Dickerson, he used those hours to apply to as many colleges as he could. 
“He was sitting outside of our office, and my email just started dinging, dinging, dinging,” with requests to send his transcript to one college after another, Dickerson recalled. “So I walked out of my office and I said, ‘Jayme.’ I said, ‘Now listen, I know I told you to apply to schools, but I don’t want you just to go crazy.’”

He was undeterred. Every now and then, he’d ask Dickerson to print him off some more fee waivers, so he didn’t have to pay for the applications.
He applied to colleges in all 50 states, and even to a few he found on Indeed.com. 
“I think his motive was to get a lot of scholarships,” Angella said. “At one point when I talked to him, he was over $5 million, and he was like, ‘Momma, I’m gonna get the most in scholarships.’” 
Anderson had initially planned to attend Stanford University, but earlier this month, he had a change of plans. He enrolled in Pennsylvania State University — in part, his mom said, because it snows there, and he wanted to get out of the southern heat. 
“That was it, point blank,” his mom said. “It was the cold. It was the air.” 
They made the trip to State College earlier this week, taking two cars packed full of the usual necessities — laundry detergent, a mini fridge, boxes of bedding, clothes and lots of pens. 
Anderson also brought the award that meant the most to him: His associate’s degree from Hinds.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-22 13:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT Jewish leaders denounce new rules for federal security grants,Laura Tillman and Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/22/ct-jewish-leaders-federal-nonprofit-security-grants-dhs/,"Recipients of the nonprofit security grant will be prohibited from DEI programming, staging some boycotts or helping undocumented immigrants.","Several Connecticut Jewish leaders and synagogues have signed on to a national letter denouncing new prohibitions on recipients of a federal security grant, which would ban nonprofits — including faith-based organizations — from conducting equity or “DEI” programming, staging some boycotts or helping undocumented immigrants. The new language would also require such institutions to cooperate with immigration enforcement. 
The letter was signed by Temple Beth El in Stamford, the Mending Minyan Synagogue in New Haven and the Hartford Jewish Organizing Collective, in addition to dozens of other religious groups and leaders across the country. 
The Nonprofit Security Grant Program is run by the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. It helps nonprofits considered in high risk of a terrorist or extremist attack to pay for physical and cybersecurity. That funding can go toward security cameras, warning and alert systems, hired security services, perimeter security like gates and barriers, and screening systems like metal detectors.
Rabbi Debra Cantor, of the B’nai Tikvoh-Sholom synagogue in Bloomfield, also signed  her name to the letter. She said that her congregation had benefitted from the grants in the past. “We were able to strengthen some of the areas that were vulnerable to someone coming in,” changes in infrastructure the congregation couldn’t have otherwise afforded to pay for. The congregation also did safety trainings that would prepare them in the event of a violent attack.
“It made us feel less vulnerable. Anything that puts that in jeopardy is quite upsetting. But here’s the thing, the new revised conditions completely go against our beliefs and our ethical values, so it’s a really terrible tradeoff.” 
Alli Warshaw, co-leader of the Mending Minyan Synagogue in New Haven, said that the new contract is “traif,” or not kosher. 
“This does not fit into our Jewish values,” Warshaw said. “It’s also fiscally unsafe — you could be sued or have your money taken away, even for something like having someone in the community do a sermon and talk about the rights of immigrants.” 
While Jewish institutions are not the only religious groups eligible for the funds, Jewish institutions around the U.S. have pressed for access to the funding in recent months to protect against rising concerns about antisemitic attacks.
The new terms and conditions for all DHS financial assistance for fiscal year 2025 require that recipients won’t “operate any programs that advance or promote DEI, DEIA, or discriminatory equity ideology,” participate in “discriminatory prohibited boycott,” and run any program that “benefits illegal immigrants or incentivizes illegal immigration.” Those provisions are new and weren’t included in the standard terms and conditions for the previous year.
Recipients of DHS funding, like the security grants, would also be required to cooperate with agency and immigration officials, including requests for information sharing and participation in joint operations, access to detainees if an immigration officer wants to interview someone subject to removal and a restriction on publicly sharing details of an immigration enforcement operation.
A spokesperson with the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that the agency won’t fund grant projects “that have alleged affiliations with terrorist activities,” though it did not elaborate on how they’d classify that or to which groups it may apply.
“Under the leadership of Secretary [Kristi] Noem, DHS and FEMA are conducting a comprehensive assessment of all grants to root out waste, fraud, and abuse,” a DHS spokesperson said in a statement. “Unlike the previous administration, grants will no longer be used to empower radical organizations with questionable ties that don’t serve the interest of the American People.”
According to Fox News, DHS has also been cancelling NSGP funding for Muslim groups with alleged terrorist ties.
Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, who has joined numerous lawsuits against the Trump administration in recent months, said that his office was “evaluating all legal options to keep Connecticut safe and protect access to our funding.
“The security of our religious institutions should not depend on their adherence to MAGA politics. Period. These arbitrary and unlawful conditions make us all less safe,” Tong told The Connecticut Mirror in a statement. 
Zohar Berman, a social justice and cultural organizer for the Boston Workers Circle, which signed onto the letter, said DEI programming was not optional for the group. 
“It’s always been a part of our history, and now we have this great term, ‘DEI,’ to describe a multicultural community, but DEI isn’t new,” Berman said.
The letter of protest was organized by the Community Safety Campaign, a Jewish organization that launched in 2022 in response to an attack on a Texas synagogue, “to build more coordinated and strategic approach to Jewish community safety practices.” That organization already encourages synagogues and other Jewish institutions to seek out safety practices that do not include the kind of surveillance technology paid for by the federal grant funds.
The Council on American Islamic Relations, or CAIR, first sent out a press release on Aug. 7, urging mosques, synagogues, schools and nonprofits to pause or withdraw applications to all grants administered by DHS and FEMA until the agency removes “two dangerous and unconstitutional conditions” for fiscal year 2025.
“CAIR is encouraging every nonprofit and house of worship to abstain from applying to the nonprofit security grant program and any other DHS grant that would essentially force you to silence your political speech or become a deputized enforcer of the department’s discriminatory immigration enforcement programs,” said Robert McCaw, the director of CAIR’s Government Affairs Department.
CAIR is among the organizations that have received NSGP funding in the past to “harden its facility and protect employees,” though for safety reasons McCaw did not go into the details of what it was used for.
McCaw said that grant has been an important resource.
“It protects people, it protects institutions and it creates safer spaces for nonprofits and houses of worship to serve our communities,” McCaw said. “But it seems this administration is dead set on limiting the amount of time to apply to this program and who can actually receive funding, and its purported review of Muslim applicants makes CAIR question whether there’s a discriminatory bias in the management of this program.”
Jewish and Christian communities have been the largest recipients of the grants in the past, according to McCaw.  “And we applaud any organization that’s been able to enhance its community’s security. That said, we have always strived for Muslims to receive a more equal share.”
Amid some delays, the NSGP grant notice of funding opportunities for fiscal year 2025 was posted on July 28 with a deadline to submit applications of Aug. 11. The estimated total funding is around $274 million. The agency expects to make funding selections in the coming days with the award date scheduled for the end of September, according to a FEMA fact sheet.
The available funds are similar to previous years, though the funding for the previous fiscal year had a significant bump because of a $210 million boost provided through a national security supplemental approved by Congress last year. The first tranche of that supplemental funding was delivered in June to more than 500 Jewish faith-based organizations.
The remainder was doled out this week. DHS announced Tuesday it awarded $110 million across 600 faith-based organizations and nonprofits. The agency said the money will go to Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh and Jewish-affiliated institutions. 
The funding and application process for the NSGP security grants faced various delays over the course of the year.
Earlier this year, grantees were unable to draw down their funding to get reimbursements for their security enhancements. But the freeze on the funding was lifted in May after pressure from lawmakers in both parties and some Jewish organizations, according to Jewish Insider.
There was also a monthslong delay in opening the application for grants this year.
After Congress passed a bill to fund the government in March, eligible groups expected to be able to start applying for the new funds two months later, which was a requirement of the law. A group of organizations wrote a letter urging DHS to roll out the application process as soon as possible before the end of the federal fiscal year, fearing they would become unavailable by Sept. 30.
The Jewish Federations of North America played a major role in advocating for these security grants over the past few months.
After the deadly shooting in May at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C, the group called for a significant bump to the federal security grant by asking Congress to approve $1 billion, noting the demand with 43% of applicants for NSGP receiving funding last year. The Jewish Federations of North America also estimated that the cost of security for those in the Jewish community is around $765 million a year.
But by July, FEMA publicized the notice of the grant funding for fiscal year 2025, alleviating concerns of the groups pushing for its immediate release.
“Jewish Federations of North America strongly encourage institutions in our communities to apply for critical, life-saving Nonprofit Security Grant Program funds,” Eric D. Fingerhut, president and CEO of Jewish Federations of North America, said. “We are working closely with DHS and stand ready to provide guidance to any institution seeking support around this process and raise any issues that come up along the way.”
But Rabbi Cantor of Bloomfield said that the new terms were setting up a terrible set of choices, especially at a time when security is needed. 
“People feel safe when they come into a house of worship. If we are pressured to share information about people, that goes against our beliefs. That goes against our deeply shared values,” Cantor said. “Jews do not do well in autocracies, they do not do well in places that lean toward fascist hatred and beliefs. Jewish people, like others, do well in a free democracy. So anything that threatens that, that limits our basic rights under a democratic set of laws is bad. It’s bad for Jews — it’s bad for all of us.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP24344277337531-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-22 09:58:18.853531

Shell said April 25 that it would start using its “elevated flare this afternoon” and expected the work to continue through the weekend. (Courtesy of Hilary Starcher-O’Toole)
This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. 
In 2020, the Department of Energy predicted that Appalachia was “on the cusp of an energy and petrochemical renaissance” fueled by abundant shale gas. The agency saw the ethane cracker plant Shell was building outside Pittsburgh as “the first of what could be multiple facilities” in Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania.
Five years later, Shell stands alone, the only one of a fleet of proposed projects that was actually built. Now, the company would like to sell it.
“The issue is it’s our only one, our only major facility” that makes this kind of plastic, Shell CEO Wael Sawan told analysts in a recent earnings call. “And that’s why we’ve said we’re not the natural owner of that asset.” He acknowledged that a deal may not happen quickly but said the company is having “discussions” about a sale or partnership.
For people in Beaver County who have watched the planning, construction and opening of the plant drag out over the past 13 years, that possibility—first suggested in a Wall Street Journal story in March about Shell “exploring a potential sale” of its American chemical facilities—was surprising. Marcellus Drilling News, a fracking industry trade publication, called the news a “shocker.” Residents wondered if this meant the facility, which began operating in Monaca just three years ago, could be shut down or its workforce laid off.
In a statement to Inside Climate News, Shell spokesperson Krista Edwards said the company “has not announced any sale of its Monaca facility.” Shell is “exploring strategic and partnership opportunities” for its chemical facilities in the U.S., including Monaca, she said.

Shell’s CEO said that the company wants to go “back to what we call the brilliant basics”: oil and gas, not petrochemicals. The Monaca plant—which ended up costing $14 billion to build, $8 billion more than initial estimates—is a small part of its global portfolio. Shell was enticed to build in Pennsylvania when the state government granted the company a record-breaking $1.65 billion tax break that could last 25 years.
Financial experts said Shell Monaca’s location is one reason that a sale makes sense. “Shell is about as isolated in Pennsylvania as you can get,” said Rob Stier, a global petrochemicals expert at S&P Global Commodity Insights.
“Anything that goes wrong in Pennsylvania, the Shell Pennsylvania facility has to shut down,” he said. “If it’s running, it makes money. But if it’s not running, they’re in trouble.”
What he means is that Shell loses out whenever the plant falters because it has no other way to fulfill orders. In contrast, on the Gulf Coast, the home of a massive, interconnected petrochemical hub, companies can make up for losses by producing more at another facility. “Shell doesn’t have that luxury because they have Pennsylvania as their only polyethylene manufacturing site in the world,” Stier said. Polyethylene is the type of single-use plastic produced in Monaca. Shell uses ethane, a byproduct of natural gas, to make the plastic.
As of July 2025, Shell had submitted 80 malfunction reports to the state Department of Environmental Protection, according to the nonprofit FracTracker Alliance. It paid $10 million in civil penalties for air quality violations in 2023. Residents living nearby have complained about light, noise and air pollution and say the plant is disruptive to their daily lives, with some people choosing to move away to escape it. The Shell plant has an anticipated lifespan of least 25 years.
Stier said the market for polyethylene changed in 2022, the same year the Pennsylvania facility came online. Responding to increased demand for plastics domestically, China built more petrochemical plants. But in the last few years, demand there hasn’t kept up with all the new production, and the country is over capacity. That means fewer opportunities for American companies to sell in China, and it creates more competition for Shell in the U.S. market.
Shell Monaca still enjoys a competitive advantage because its feedstock costs less than the oil-based feedstock used in China.
“This is a valuable asset,” said Stier. The site is also likely to retain the huge tax subsidies it received from the state, even with a new owner, according to financial experts.
Shell’s tax “windfall” in Pennsylvania 
Shell’s tax breaks from the state are behind its decision to push forward with the project even as other companies walked away from the “renaissance” for economic reasons, said Anne Keller, managing director at Midstream Energy Group, an energy consultancy. Keller has worked in the energy and petrochemical industry for more than 30 years. Compared to Ohio and West Virginia, Pennsylvania “far and away shelled out more money,” she said.
In 2016, then-vice president of Shell’s Appalachia Petrochemicals Division, Ate Visser, acknowledged the role the subsidies played in its decision-making. “I can tell you, hand to my heart, that without the fiscal incentives, we would not have taken this investment decision,” he said.
Those incentives help to explain how Shell ended up stranded in a region that turned out not to make sense for petrochemical buildout in the current market.
Keller said Pennsylvania’s gift to Shell is unprecedented in the industry. “I’ve literally never heard of anything like that. It was just stunning,” she said. “The state got dealt.”
While there was some greater economic advantage to the region during construction, when more than 9,000 workers were needed, once the plant became operational and the workforce shrank to 500, “the state might as well have just put people in an office and written them a check,” Keller said. Essentially, she said, the financial benefit to the company is so large that the state is effectively off-setting the cost of all full-time employees at Monaca with the tax break.
Edwards, the company spokesperson, said Shell currently employs about 500 people in Monaca and “regularly averages” approximately 400 contractors at the site. Four hundred is the minimum number of permanent jobs required by the state’s tax agreement with Shell.
In 2012, the year the state legislature passed the $1.65 billion tax credit, Republican Gov. Tom Corbett’s industry and labor secretary, Julia Hearthway, said she was convinced that the Shell plant would “kickstart a chemical manufacturing boom.”
“And with it comes jobs. Not a few hun­dred jobs. Not one com­pany hir­ing 300 or 400 jobs. But thou­sands and thou­sands of jobs to Pennsylvania,” she told StateImpact Pennsylvania.










“There was a lot of happy talk about how, once you build petrochemical facilities in Appalachia, then all these other businesses will relocate next to them, which is not a thing that happens and hasn’t happened.”


– Eric de Place, energy policy consultant


At one point, the Corbett administration claimed the Shell plant would spawn 20,000 permanent jobs directly and indirectly, because it would draw so many people to move to Beaver County. The administration said Shell would build its plant in another state if Pennsylvania didn’t offer enough incentives.
That same year, the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center called the tax breaks “a windfall” for Shell and said the deal was expensive for taxpayers while creating few permanent jobs. That warning now appears prescient.
The economic boom and thousands of new jobs that were supposed to follow in Shell’s wake have failed to materialize, according to research conducted by the Ohio River Valley Institute. 
“There was a lot of happy talk about how, once you build petrochemical facilities in Appalachia, then all these other businesses will relocate next to them, which is not a thing that happens and hasn’t happened,” said Eric de Place, an energy policy consultant who has researched Shell Monaca for ORVI. De Place’s analysis found that Beaver County’s population has declined since 2012, and it has not seen growth in jobs, GDP or businesses.
“There’s simply no way to look at economic performance and say, ‘Beaver County got this petrochemical plant and it flourished.’ In fact, it is declining relative to the U.S. and Pennsylvania, and it has not outperformed the counties around it,” he said. “I think you look at the scoreboard and you say, this was a terrible investment of taxpayer money.”
Stier said of Shell’s change of course, “The real driver of this is corporate strategy. Fifteen years ago, Shell was going in a different direction.
“It just goes to show you how big global companies can change their strategies pretty quickly. Companies can make some big, multibillion-dollar mistakes at times, and market conditions change,” Stier said. For Shell, “this asset no longer fits.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Inside-Climate-News-Cracker-plant-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-22 08:56:09.894951

(Photo by Alon Skuy/Getty Images)A federal judge has ordered that no more immigrant detainees be sent to the state’s immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades and known as “Alligator Alcatraz.” The judge also called upon the government to begin dismantling much of the facility.
U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams of the Southern District of Florida gave both the state and federal government 60 days to move out existing detainees and to begin removing temporary fencing, lightning features, and generators, gas, sewage and other waste and receptacles installed to support the project.
In her 82-page decision, Judge Williams cited extensive harm to the Everglades caused by operation of the facility, which was built in eight days.
The state of Florida filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeal for the Eleventh Circuit immediately after the order was released.
Two environmental groups — Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity — filed a lawsuit in late June, shortly after the state announced that the facility was about to open, claiming the plan had not gone through any environmental review as required under federal law. They were joined in the lawsuit by the Miccosukee Tribe.
In her ruling, Judge Williams agreed, saying that under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the government was required to issue an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) or conduct an Environmental Assessment (EA). “The Defendants chose not to do so,” she wrote.
“The Defendants’ decision to refrain from issuing an EIS or conducting an EA, and then building a detention camp, represents a determinative position on the matter and has adversely affected Plaintiffs’ recreational, conservational, and aesthetic interests,” she wrote in her order. “Accordingly, the Defendants’ decision not to issue an EIS or conduct an EA and then construct a detention camp qualifies as a final agency action.”
The Trump administration contended that a review under NEPA did not apply because, while the center houses federal immigration detainees, it is run by the state. State officials have said that their authority came from an agreement with the federal government.
Judge Williams strongly objected.
“Defendants essentially tell the Court that the project is purely state action because its employees (presumably) wear uniforms bearing state agency logos, and because the federal government seems to have held back on sending its reimbursement until some unidentified impediment (perhaps, this litigation) has abated,” she wrote.
“Meanwhile, the project was requested by the federal government; built with a promise of full federal funding; constructed in compliance with ICE standards; staffed by deputized ICE Task Force Officers acting under color of federal authority and at the direction and supervision of ICE officials; and exists for the sole purpose of detaining and deporting those subject to federal immigration enforcement. Detainees are brought onto the site by federal agents and deported from the site by federal agents on federally owned aircraft. In concluding the camp is a major federal action, the Court will ‘adhere to the test-tested adage: if it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and looks like a duck, then it’s a duck.’”
The judge quoted President Harry S. Truman’s address during the 1947 dedication of the Everglades National Park, and noted how a proposal in 1967 to create the world’s largest jetport at the site was abandoned and the Big Cypress National Preserve was created to protect the area.
“Since that time, every Florida governor, every Florida senator, and countless local and national political figures, including presidents, have publicly pledged their unequivocal support for the restoration, conservation, and protection of the Everglades,” she wrote. “This Order does nothing more than uphold the basic requirements of legislation designed to fulfill those promises.”
‘Clear message’
The two environmental groups that filed the initial lawsuit hailed the decision on Thursday night.
“This is a landmark victory for the Everglades and countless Americans who believe this imperiled wilderness should be protected, not exploited,” said Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades. “It sends a clear message that environmental laws must be respected by leaders at the highest levels of our government — and there are consequences for ignoring them.”
“This injunction is a huge relief for millions of people who love the Everglades,” added Elise Bennett, Florida and Caribbean director and attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “This brutal detention center was burning a hole in the fabric of life that supports our most iconic wetland and a whole host of endangered species, from majestic Florida panthers to wizened wood storks. The judge’s order came just in time to stop it all from unraveling.”
Central Florida Democratic U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost, who toured the facility for the second time on Wednesday, issued a blistering statement after Judge Williams’ order was released.
“The Everglades Immigrant Detention Center is nothing more than a state-sponsored, government-funded internment camp designed to keep Black and Brown immigrants in hellish conditions while Donald Trump pretends it makes our country safer,” he said in a written statement. “Thanks to the tireless work of Friends of the Everglades, the Center for Biological Diversity, and the Miccosukee Tribe, this inhumane facility has been ordered to halt operations. This is a major victory for justice, civil rights, and our environment.”
Judge Williams had placed a temporary restraining order pausing new construction at the detention center on Aug. 7 — including filling, paving, and installation of new infrastructure and lighting. That ruling may have already proved to DeSantis that Williams, a 2010 appointee to the federal court by President Obama, would ultimately rule the way she did.
“It’s pretty clear we’re in front of a judge who is not going to give us a fair shake on this,” he said earlier this week.

Read this story in English.
En una entrevista reciente con MSNBC, centrada en la preparación del estado para la temporada de huracanes, el Gobernador Ned Lamont hizo referencia a las inundaciones mortales ocurridas en el valle de Naugatuck en agosto pasado. 
Afirmó que Connecticut se está preparando para emergencias climáticas severas y de seguridad pública mediante la adopción de diversas medidas, como la reserva de fondos en caso de daños importantes por tormentas.
“Simplemente no sé si puedo contar con FEMA en este momento”, dijo Lamont, refiriéndose a la Agencia Federal para el Manejo de Emergencias (FEMA), una de las agencias federales que el presidente Donald J. Trump ha estado trabajando para desmantelar.
También instó a los residentes a inscribirse en el “sistema de alerta temprana” del estado.
En Connecticut, varios sistemas de notificación de emergencias operan bajo la supervisión de las autoridades estatales y regionales para comunicar a los residentes con información importante en tiempos de emergencias de seguridad pública y salud. Un sistema estatal relativamente moderno es “CT Alert”. 
Impulsado por la empresa de software Everbridge, CT Alert permite a los centros de llamadas del 911 de los municipios participantes, contactar a los residentes registrados con información relacionada con evacuaciones, medidas de seguridad o alertas generales por teléfono celular, correo electrónico o mensaje de texto.
En situaciones de emergencia crítica, el sistema, operado por el Departamento de Servicios de Emergencia y Protección Pública (DESSP) del estado, puede intentar múltiples métodos para contactar a un residente si lo solicita, pero no recibe confirmación de que recibió la notificación.
¿A cuántas personas llega CT Alert?
Menos del 10% de los residentes de Connecticut se han registrado en CT Alert, pero el DESSP de Connecticut cuenta con más de 4.8 millones de contactos estatales en el sistema, lo que le permite ampliar el alcance en caso de emergencia.
En promedio, entre 3,000 y 5,000 personas se registran para recibir alertas a través del sistema cada año. En lo que va de este año, se han registrado aproximadamente 9,000 personas.
Cada alerta es personalizada: los operadores del 911 pueden elegir la localización de la notificación y a cuántas personas contactar. El año pasado, CT Alert se usó 97 veces. Este año, se ha usado 25 veces. El sistema registra picos de registro después de eventos como inundaciones, incendios y otras emergencias.
¿Cómo me registro?
Los residentes pueden registrarse en el sitio web de CT Alert proporcionando su nombre, correo electrónico, número de teléfono y dirección de trabajo o particular. Los residentes y negocios que tienen números de teléfono registrados ya están anotados en el sistema.
Aunque el sistema está disponible para todos los municipios, su uso depende de los centros de 911 de su municipio o región. Algunos municipios pueden usar sistemas de notificación más avanzados o específicos, como Reverse 911.
Cuando un municipio decide usar CT Alert, significa que su centro de despacho de emergencias utilizará el sistema para enviar alertas de emergencia a los residentes. Sin embargo, una persona registrada seguirá recibiendo alertas estatales y regionales de Connecticut, incluso si su municipio no usa el sistema activamente. Aunque DESPP tiene acceso a los datos de Whitepages para números de teléfono fijo y datos de teléfonos celulares adquiridos a través de Everbridge, registrarse para recibir alertas es la forma más efectiva de mantenerse actualizado por el sistema, según las autoridades.
Los datos registrados pueden divulgarse a terceros para fines de notificación de emergencia o según lo exija la ley, según la página de preguntas frecuentes de CT Alert.
¿En qué se diferencia CT Alert de otros sistemas de notificación de emergencias?
La idea principal de CT Alert es advertir a los residentes de forma preventiva antes de que el peligro sea inminente. Algunas notificaciones estatales se envían para advertir sobre peligros inminentes, no siempre esperados.
El “911 inverso” es otro sistema de notificación de emergencias de uso común en Connecticut, que permite a las autoridades locales llegar a vecindarios, zonas o pueblos específicos contactando a teléfonos fijos y celulares registrados para detectar amenazas localizadas. Los sistemas de notificación a nivel nacional, adaptados regionalmente por las fuerzas de seguridad locales, como el Sistema Integrado de Alerta y Advertencia Pública de FEMA o las alertas AMBER, notifican al público en general sobre emergencias más específicas, como solo desastres naturales o solo niños desaparecidos, respectivamente, a menudo mediante transmisiones por radio y televisión, además de teléfonos celulares.

Gavin Newsom tries to fast-track the Delta Conveyance Project, we must learn from history's hard lessons.","Guest Commentary written by

Devon Provo
Devon Provo is an urban planner and senior policy manager at Accelerate Resilience L.A. She lives in Altadena.


Most mornings, I walk my dog at Hahamongna Watershed Park in Pasadena, pausing by the reservoir to watch grebes and ducks glide across the water. It’s a quiet routine, but since the fire tore through Eaton Canyon in January, the silence feels louder, like this place has something to say. 
As an urban planner, I’ve spent years working on land use and water policy. When I walk through my Altadena neighborhood, I don’t see a freak disaster. I see a moment of reckoning, in a much older story about the quest to control nature and consequences that echo across generations. 
As Californians struggle to recover from compounding climate disasters, Gov. Gavin Newsom is moving to fast-track the Delta Conveyance Project, presenting lawmakers with a familiar choice. But before committing billions to yet another major water project, we must confront some hard lessons from our past.
Eaton Canyon is named after Judge Benjamin Eaton, an Anglo-American settler who built Pasadena’s first water infrastructure in the 1860s. Eaton engineered irrigation ditches to support settler agriculture and real estate development by diverting water away from Hahamongna, a place named “Flowing Waters, Fruitful Valley” by the original Tongva inhabitants. His intervention added to a harmful pattern that began with the Spanish mission system, when the violent colonization of Hahamongna Village disrupted sacred community relationships with land and water. 
Eaton’s son, Frederick, later expanded his father’s ambitions on a larger scale. As mayor of Los Angeles in the early 1900s, Frederick Eaton partnered with William Mulholland to develop the L.A. Aqueduct, a massive conveyance system that redirects water from Mono Lake and Owens Valley — called Payahuunadü by the Native residents — to fuel Los Angeles’ growth 220 miles south. 
It was one of the most significant and destructive water transfers in U.S. history, devastating the ecosystems and homelands of the Nüümü, Newe, and Kootzaduka’a people. Owens Lake, which is also called Patsiata, was once full of life. After it dried out, it became the largest source of dust pollution in the country, exposing nearby residents to toxins that increased cancer risk. 
The consequences were not limited to the Eastern Sierra. Angelenos suffered, too. 
The aqueduct committed Los Angeles to a model of extraction that has persisted for more than a century. Today we’re often told L.A. is a desert, obscuring the truth that the rivers, wetlands and groundwater that shaped this region didn’t disappear — they were buried, paved and drained.
Instead of investing in local solutions like stormwater capture, recycled water and fire stewardship, Los Angeles prioritized importing water, urban sprawl, and fire suppression practices throughout the 20th century, leaving it increasingly vulnerable to disaster.
The result: L.A.’s stormwater rushes to the ocean through concrete channels, bypassing the thirsty soil beneath our feet. Fire-adapted chaparral, once tended through Indigenous cultural burns, goes misunderstood and mismanaged. Fire always finds its fuel. 
This legacy didn’t spark the Eaton Fire, but it seeded conditions that allowed it to spread and devastate. Eventually the truth catches up to us. The land remembers what we try to forget. 
Meanwhile, policymakers rely on public amnesia. The governor’s latest push to secure legislative approval for the Delta Conveyance before the session ends in September risks repeating history. The success of this water diversion megaproject hinges on the same myth of control, the illusion that humans stand apart from the very ecosystems that sustain us, that futile attempts at domination can shield us from the fragile, uncomfortable reality of our interdependence with nature.
A tragedy like the Eaton Fire reminds us that true leadership begins with humility, with the courage to take a hard look at ourselves and admit that we’re in a relationship with living systems, not in charge.
If destruction can be built one choice at a time, so can repair. 
In Payahuunadü, the Owens Valley Indian Water Commission continues to fight for water justice and the right to care for Owens Lake once again. Here in Los Angeles, tribal governments and Indigenous-led groups, such as the Tataviam Land Conservancy and Sacred Places Institute, work to restore ancestral lands, revitalize native plants and uplift traditional ecological knowledge. 
Across the region, grassroots groups are repairing relationships to water and soil, planting native trees, removing asphalt and transforming concrete schoolyards into living landscapes. Local agencies are getting serious about solutions we’ve long ignored: stormwater capture, recycled water, groundwater recharge and conservation. 
The Eaton Fire is the latest chapter in the long Eaton story. A name once celebrated for taming water now symbolizes a fire that reveals the limits of our control. 
The irony invites a deeper question: what does accountability look like when harm is inherited but the consequences are still unfolding? The control we seek may already reside within us — in our ability to exercise restraint, respect limits and stay in relationship with things we don’t fully understand. 
Like those before us, we face complex trade-offs. But unlike them, we have the benefit of hindsight and the opportunity, if we’re willing, to choose another way. Will we take it?",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/052024_Delta_LE_CM_24.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-22 08:56:09.894951

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The discovery recently of more than 150 unmarked graves at a juvenile detention center in Cheltenham has exposed uncomfortable truths not only about the state’s history of mistreating poor Black children in the justice system, but also about its ongoing, racially disproportionate practice of automatically charging young people accused of crime in the state’s adult criminal courts.
The children and youths buried more than a century ago in newly discovered unmarked graves beside the Cheltenham Youth Detention center may have broken the law.  Some, however, may have been the equivalent of today’s status offenders — kids who do things that are illegal only because they are not yet adults, like skipping school or running away from home. Others may have been sent to the House of Reformation and Instruction for Colored Children — as the original facility was called — simply because their families were poor.
Regardless of how they got there, these children were wards of the state, and the state failed in its duty to protect them.
It’s unclear how these children died. Only a deep investigation will give us those answers. But what is clear from these forgotten graves — in the woods, unmarked, half-buried beneath more than a century of fallen sticks and leaves — is that these children’s bodies were disposed of, thrown away, without an acknowledgement of who they were.

The contrast with how we treat other people is heartbreakingly evident when you compare these Black children’s graves to the veterans cemetery that lies immediately adjacent to it. The veterans’ graves have headstones with names and dates. The grounds are meticulously maintained. The brush and leaves are cleared away. The grass is cut regularly.
The ongoing attention and maintenance tells us that the veterans laid to rest are cared for and were loved. The children buried at Cheltenham, not so much.
And Maryland isn’t the only place with this hideous legacy.
More than a dozen years ago, archeologists at the University of South Florida made a similar shocking discovery at Florida’s youth prison, the Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys, of dozens of unknown graves of children who died there — nearly 100 children in the prison’s 100-year history.
We may be tempted to believe that these unmarked graves are just an echo from the soil of a time that has passed. But as the great Southern writer William Faulkner reminds us, “The past is never dead. It’s not even past.”
The unmarked graves beside today’s Cheltenham Youth Detention Center expose an uncomfortable truth about how Black children’s lives are being thrown away by the state even now.
Maryland automatically prosecutes more children in adult criminal court than every other state but Alabama. The state’s Black children are five times more likely to be prosecuted in adult court than white youth, even when charged with similar offenses. More than 90% of youths tried as adults in Maryland are children of color; more than 80% are Black.
And yet, if the goal is to make communities safer, research tells us that trying kids in adult courts doesn’t work. In fact, just the opposite is true:  Young people tried in adult courts and placed in adult facilities are more likely to commit another offense — and a more serious one — compared to similar kids who stay in the youth system.
Does the state really want future generations to look at Maryland’s current failings on Black children with the same disgust and judgment of its actions as I imagine many people do now at the site of the unmarked graves at Cheltenham?
Maryland should apologize for the dreadful sins of the past by cleaning up the cemetery, identifying who these children are, finding and notifying their families and placing headstones with the children’ s names.  But the state must also change how it treats children today by ending the automatic transfer of youth to adult criminal court.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Cheltenham-Youth-Detention-Center-1-13-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-22 08:56:09.894951

(McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)Under a cloud of grief following the deaths of two police officers who were shot and killed responding to a domestic violence call, Utah public safety leaders, lawmakers and service providers announced the rollout of a public dashboard sharing data collected by law enforcement answering reports of intimate partner violence statewide.
The online dashboard displays the number of times officers in the state have used the “lethality assessment protocol” — a series of questions meant to identify the potential for deadly violence in a domestic violence situation, prompting an immediate referral for victim services — and what the answers yielded.


 Domestic violence resources

Help for people in abusive relationships is available in Utah:

Utah Domestic Violence Coalition: A confidential statewide, 24-hour domestic violence hotline can be reached at 1-800-897-LINK (5465)
YWCA Women in Jeopardy program: 801-537-8600
Utah child abuse and neglect hotline: 1-855-323-DCFS (3237)
National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-7233



In the more than 23,000 assessments conducted by Utah law enforcement since the protocol became statewide law in July 2023, 63% revealed the potential for lethal violence, according to the dashboard data.
The law came out of a tragedy in the family of Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, whose cousin, Amanda “Mandy” Mayne, was murdered three years ago by her ex-husband, who then turned the gun on himself. Her death pushed Henderson to question what more could have been done to help Mayne, and how law enforcement agencies were — or weren’t — communicating with each other about cases of intimate partner violence. 
A painting of Mayne was on display during the news conference, and her mother, Shauna Mayne, was in attendance.
“Data is important. The faces and the names, the families behind the data, are even more important,” Henderson said at a news conference at Veterans Memorial Park in West Jordan on Thursday. “And what we do with this data, what we do with this information, is critical, because information is only good if we use it.”
One way that data could be used, Henderson said, is developing a “second track” when responding to intimate partner violence — what to do with the offender.
“We’ve got the victim track, and we need to get that offender track put in place, because we care about them too, and we want everyone in our state to be successful and happy. And sometimes that requires law enforcement intervention, sometimes that requires better training, sometimes it requires therapy,” Henderson said.
Introducing the dashboard, newly confirmed Department of Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason said the group had considered rescheduling the event as the state mourns the deaths of Tremonton-Garland Police Sgt. Lee Sorensen and officer Eric Estrada, who were killed Sunday night as they responded to 911 hang-up calls from a Tremonton home. 
“But with that incident, it also brings urgency to how important this cause is and why we are here today, why we gather to talk about such an important topic, and how we can make a difference in domestic violence and intimate partner violence,” Mason said.
Charges filed Wednesday allege Ryan Michael Bate, 32, headbutted his wife and slammed her head with a door before grabbing her throat and pushing her against a wall. One officer was shot running to help the woman after Bate shot at his police vehicle, prosecutors said, and the second was killed as he attempted to render aid to his fallen colleague. Prosecutors announced they intend to pursue the death penalty for Bate.

It wasn’t the first time Bate had been involved in a domestic violence report, said Rep. Ryan Wilcox, R-Ogden, who co-sponsored SB117 in the Utah House in 2023, expanding the lethality assessment protocol statewide. In a previous case, he said, the lethality assessment had been utilized to identify potential risk Bate posed and gave an opportunity to offer domestic violence services.
Now, following the deaths of Sorensen and Estrada, Wilcox said the question of what to do with offenders to prevent future violence has weighed heavy on him.
“We had him,” Wilcox said of Bate. “We issued the protocol. It gave us the information we were looking for, and he didn’t murder her at that time, and in the back of my mind all week, ever since I read the report, has been ‘what should we have done differently then that would have prevented the loss of life of these officers?’” Wilcox said.
After SB117 became law and the lethality assessment went into use around Utah, Wilcox said, he was surprised, though he shouldn’t have been, at just how much it was being used and the resources that were needed in response.
“We hoped that it would save some lives. We hoped that it would work. We didn’t realize the depth of … how many would need to be added, that we would find,” Wilcox said. “That’s what I expect will happen as we hone these tools and we will uncover more things. We’ll understand better how to help. We’ll understand better how to prevent and understand how to get ahead of it, so that we don’t have to be here having these conversations again.”

(Photos courtesy of candidates. Graphic Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)Voters in Cullman and Blount counties will go to the polls Tuesday to elect a new representative in the House District 11 special election.
Voters in the district, which covers part of Cullman and Blount counties, will choose between GOP nominee Heath Allbright and Democratic nominee Alex Braswell. The seat was left open when former Rep. Randall Shedd, R-Fairview, resigned in February to work for Senate President Pro Tempore Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman. 
The district is solidly Republican. Shedd, who won the seat in a special election in 2013, never faced opposition in any subsequent general election.

The candidates

Allbright, 39, has campaigned on conservative Christian values, supporting local education and tax cuts for small businesses. Multiple messages seeking comment from Allbright were left this week.
Dalton Dismukes, Allbright’s campaign manager, wrote in an email Thursday that Allbright is meeting with as many community members as possible.
“Heath’s priorities remain the same as they were when he started: cutting taxes and wasteful spending, protecting and fighting for family values, and ensuring students, families, teachers, and everyone in House District 11 benefit from a strong, quality education,” Dismukes wrote.
 Allbright defeated 60-year-old Don Fallin in the May primary with 54.3% of votes. Allbright has been endorsed by the former seat holder.
Braswell, 31, has campaigned on protecting the rights of disabled Alabamians, access to CBD and road safety. She said in an interview on Monday that her campaign has gone well, and feels it has made a difference in her community.
“Still, by all means, advocating for the rights to the disabled CBD access … Really, I would love to legalize marijuana and get it over with, but we need to start with the small goals here,” the American Sign Language interpreter said. “So CBD access and road safety, just ensuring our roads are safe.”
Braswell, the first Democrat to run in a general election in the district since 2006, secured an endorsement from former U.S. Sen. Doug Jones, D-Alabama, who also held a town hall campaign event for Braswell. 
“We’ve had some great people alongside us, and our town hall was a great success,” she said. “I really couldn’t be more proud of our campaign.”

Campaign finances

Allbright has raised $128,501.57 in monetary contributions and more than $12,000 in in-kind contributions, according to campaign finance records. About half of his monetary contributions come from political action committees (PACs), with the Alabama Forestry PAC donating more than other PACs at $7,531.57. 
The Alabama House Majority PAC also donated $5,000 during the primary campaign.
Braswell has raised $14,686.47 in monetary donations and about $800 in in-kind services, according to campaign finance records, with no PACs contributing. Braswell said that most of her campaign materials like yard signs and car magnets were possible because of in-kind donations.
“It’s been just overwhelming because I never thought for a special, and granted I still don’t have a 10th of what Albright has, but most of the baseline supplies that I’ve needed for a campaign were all kindly donated,” Braswell said.

How to vote

District 11 voters can choose between Allbright and Braswell on Aug. 26. Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Polling locations can be found here. The winner will represent the district in the Alabama House of Representatives.

The Nevada Employee Savings Trust, or NEST, launched on July 1. Through the program, Nevadans who do not have access to retirement plans through their private-sector employers will be automatically enrolled in an Individual Retirement Account and can contribute to it a certain amount (or percentage) of each paycheck.
Employees have the ability to opt out of the program, but according to the Nevada State Treasurer’s Office, which administers NEST, approximately 20,500 people have already been enrolled.
That number is expected to rise. By Sept. 1, businesses with six or more employees will be required to either offer their own retirement plan or enroll their employees into NEST.
“I think this is going to help tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, of Nevadans be in a better place,” said Nevada State Treasurer Zach Conine.
An estimated 593,000 Nevadans lack easy access to a retirement account, according to AARP. Nationally, 1 in 4 adults have no retirement savings at all, according to the American Retirement Association.
It’s estimated more than 40% of small businesses nationwide do not offer retirement benefits to their employees. Employers often cite cost as the barrier stopping them from offering a retirement plan, according to Pew.
States are increasingly deciding to step in, boosted by research showing people are far more likely to save for retirement when contributions are automatically deducted from their paycheck.
Twelve states now have auto-IRA programs, and according to Pew, more than a million people have saved $2 billion through them since the launch of the first program in Oregon in 2017.
The Nevada State Legislature established NEST through legislation passed in 2023. That bill, Senate Bill 305, was sponsored by three Democrats and a Republican. All Democrats supported the measure, while Republicans were divided in their support. Gov. Joe Lombardo signed the bill into law.
Conine acknowledges that access to, and even initial enrollment in, NEST “doesn’t mean every Nevadan is going to save.”
He added, “Not everyone will choose to use it, but those that do all of a sudden have a way to save for retirement really easily — like, really, really easily.”
In advance of the new retirement plan requirement, the Vegas Chamber launched its own pooled 401k program, something Conine sees as a benefit to the community.
“If (people) are saving,I do not care if they are saving with us,” he said. “I care if they’re saving.”
The NEST model could be particularly beneficial for people who work multiple jobs or switch jobs often.
“If you’ve got an account and you’ve got two jobs and you want to put in some money from both paychecks, you can,” said Conine. “You want to put in more money from one and less money from another, you can. If you go get a third job and don’t have either of those two original jobs anymore, you still have the account.”
Gig workers can also set up NEST accounts and deposit money.
The program is designed with retirement in mind, but contributions are easily accessible for emergencies.
“We have a lot of Nevadans, unfortunately, who live paycheck to paycheck,” he said. “When they have some unexpected expense, an emergency, a lot of times they have to go to a payday lender, a title lender, or some other very, very expensive source of credit.”
The principal balance on NEST accounts can be pulled out by the account holder without penalty. As a Roth IRA, contributions are post-tax.
“It can serve as an emergency account,” said Conine.
If someone moves out of Nevada, their account can stay open and contributions can even still be deposited directly into the account. If they have moved to one of the five states in the same interstate consortium as Nevada — Colorado, Maine, Delaware, Vermont and Minnesota — they may be able to connect their account to their new employer in that state.
NEST comes with no costs to employers, other than the minimal time it takes to facilitate enrollment in the program.
Ongoing costs of running the program will be covered through minimal fees, which Conine said are lower than at similar funds not run by states. He put the cost at around $26 annually, plus one-fifth of one percent, or a $2 fee on $1,000.
The upfront $1.2 million cost of launching NEST was covered through a loan from the state general fund.

,California,2025-08-22 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,Renewal of California cap and trade program to cut emissions is fraught with issues,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/08/cap-and-trade-renewal-fraught/,"There are several issues to resolve in the remaining weeks of California's legislative session. Many are fraught with political conflict, but the cap and trade program is particularly complex.","While the Capitol is fixated on Gov. Gavin Newsom’s drive to rearrange California’s congressional districts in order to counter a pro-Republican gerrymander in Texas, there are several other pithy issues to resolve and just three weeks remaining in the legislative session.
They include a new effort to jumpstart housing construction, whether California should merge its electrical power grid with those of other Western states, regulation of artificial intelligence and renewal of the state’s cap and trade program for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.
All are fraught with political conflict, but those of cap and trade are particularly complex.
Each quarter, the state Air Resources Board auctions emission permits with proceeds being used, at least in theory, to reduce greenhouse gases. The program is due to end in 2030 and Newsom wants to renew it for an additional 15 years, albeit with some tweaks.
The issue’s macro-politics are that while gas-emitting industries and business groups favor its renewal as a predictable way of meeting emission reduction goals, environmental groups see it as business buying exemptions from pollution. They would prefer direct company-by-company regulation.
Within that conflict are other issues, such as steadily dropping proceeds from the emission auctions, which emitters with vital products should be given permits without cost, and how auction revenues should be spent.
Newsom wants the program to be renamed “cap and invest.” In the state budget he signed in June, it declared the establishment of “a stable and predictable price on carbon pollution to drive deeper investments in carbon reduction and clean technologies.”
However, the more than $30 billion generated by the auctions to date are not always being spent on effective emission reduction programs. Some are being used instead to finance programs that are strapped for money.
For instance, Newsom wants to keep setting aside at least $1 billion a year in auction funds to keep the state’s much-troubled bullet train project alive. In theory, electric-powered trains would reduce carbon emissions by replacing auto and airline travel, but the data behind that rationale are shaky.
By the state’s own projections several years ago, a fully constructed north-south system would reduce auto travel by 16.3 million vehicle-miles each day. That sounds impressive but is just shy of 2% of the nearly one billion miles Californians drive each day. Meanwhile, bullet train construction itself is emitting carbon.
Newsom also wants auction funds to pay for fighting the state’s many wildfires, which are major sources of pollution. It would relieve the general fund budget of that burden, but would do little or nothing to prevent those fires.
One of the biggest issues, at least politically, is the impact on Californians’ living costs. It’s well-established that emitters pass on their costs as higher prices — 23 cents per gallon of gasoline, the Legislative Analyst’s Office has calculated.
Chevron executive Andy Walz told a Public Policy Institute of California forum on the issue Thursday that refiners consider cap-and-trade costs as a major factor in deciding whether to continue operating in the state. California once had dozens of refineries but only nine remain and two of them have announced closure plans. Newsom and legislators, who only months ago were denouncing refiners as price-gougers, now are pleading with them to remain in business to avoid big price increases during the conversion to a zero-emission economy.
Meanwhile, a recent poll by the PPIC found that while a majority of Californians want the state to reduce carbon emissions, they also don’t want to pay higher energy costs from that effort.
That bifurcated attitude colors whether cap and trade will be renewed and how its costs will be borne.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/022124-Chevron-Richmond-LE-CM-07.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-22 08:56:09.894951

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)The interim CEO for the Southern Poverty Law Center said he does not plan to seek the job permanently and will step aside once a candidate is found.
SPLC Board members appointed Fair interim CEO in July soon after Margaret Huang resigned, citing family reasons. In an interview earlier this month, Fair said he will not be a candidate as the civil rights group conducts a nationwide search for a permanent leader.
“I am in a transition, we are in a transition,” Fair said in an interview following his remarks at an event commemorating the 60th anniversary of the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. “I am the interim president, and I am not a candidate to be the permanent president.”
Huang said in a statement in July that she considered herself “fortunate” that she has had the opportunities to communities of color in places throughout the South, but that the work can be demanding.
“And while I am deeply committed to this work, the reality is that the demands of my job have created serious challenges for me and my family as I have tried to support and care for aging parents at the same time,” Huang said. “Recently, I realized that if I want to live my values, I need to make significant changes at home.”
Huang said that those in the baby boom generation are increasingly demanding medical care, and that Millennials and Gen Xers, like Huang, are struggling to find the resources to care for their aging parents.
“As a daughter, I am so grateful that my parents — both former teachers — saved for this situation,” Huang said in her statement. “So many families can’t afford to access the support of professional caregivers. But like so many others, I worry about the long-term costs of these arrangements and what will happen as Medicaid and Medicare budgets are reduced over the next five years.”
Huang was the executive director of Amnesty International before getting hired to lead SPLC in 2020 after a tumultuous period for the organization that saw the ouster of co-founder Morris Dees and the resignation of several executives amid questions of racial gender equity at SPLC.
Huang attempted to move SPLC toward community organizing during her time on the job while trying to maintain the organization’s traditional litigation approach. But she faced challenges. SPLC announced that it was laying off part of its workforce in June 2024 and the SPLC Union, representing the employees in the organization, approved a motion of no confidence in Huang in September of the same year.
“SPLC’s new CEO should be someone who values the experience and expertise of our staff,” the SPLC Union said in a statement on Thursday. “We know SPLC can thrive and rebuild its reputation under a leader who meaningfully seeks staff input on the strategic direction of our work and who is committed to increasing job security, resilience, dignity, and morale in our workplace.
He also said he leaves the responsibility to members of the board and staff to select SPLC’s next leader.
“I have complete confidence in the board and the staff at SPLC to make an excellent choice for its next leader,” Fair said.
For its tax year that ended on Oct. 31, SPLC reported $129 million in revenues, down from $169.9 million the year before. It reported spending nearly $129 million, up from $122.1 million in 2023.

The forecast comes as the Trump administration has set up roadblocks to clean energy development, including funding cuts and an order that directs Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to personally approve all solar and wind energy projects on public lands.
Developers are on track to add 33 gigawatts of solar power in the U.S. in 2025, accounting for about half of the total new electricity generating capacity planned for the country, the agency said on Wednesday.
In the first half of the year, 12 gigawatts of solar capacity was added to the grid with the remaining 21 gigawatts planned in the second half. 
If energy developers’ plans are fully realized, large-scale solar power additions in the U.S. would reach a record single-year high, said the EIA.
Battery storage, wind, and natural gas power plants account for virtually all of the rest of the 64 gigawatts of capacity additions planned for 2025.
Solar energy does not produce global warming emissions. That makes it central to plans by U.S. states to decarbonize, while also meeting record-high electricity demand brought on by energy-intensive industries like data centers. 
Many of the federal government financial incentives that propelled the development of solar power over the last several years, however, will disappear under the administration of President Donald Trump, adding uncertainty to future developments.
On Aug. 1, Interior Secretary Burgum signed an order seeking to rein in “environmentally damaging” solar and wind power projects on federal lands. Burgum said the clean energy technologies were an inefficient use of “federal lands when compared to other energy sources with much smaller footprints, like nuclear, gas and coal.”
A week later, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it was ending a $7 billion program that offered solar energy grants to help states develop solar for low-income households. Nevada lost a $156 million grant from the cancellation. 
Last month, Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” rolled back most federal support for renewable energy, including tax credits that fueled solar development. 
But a July 15 memo mandating that all solar and wind energy projects on public lands be personally approved by Burgum could be especially significant for Nevada – where more than 80% of land is federally managed. 
Trump policy prompts NV Energy to seek escape hatch for would-be clean energy transmitters  

In an Aug. 4 letter to Burgum, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo wrote that in Nevada “solar projects deep in the project pipeline have been frozen” by the administration’s July announcement. 
One of the projects listed by Lombardo – 174 Power Global’s Boulder Solar III project – is listed by the EIA as one of the solar projects planned for installation in 2025, but it has yet to receive regulatory approval by the federal government.
“Solar energy development in Nevada is crucial to our state’s economic future and will contribute to the Nation’s energy dominance and independence,” Lombardo wrote. 
In 2024, Nevada ranked fourth in the nation in total electricity generation from utility- and small-scale solar resources combined. Solar provided 31% of the state’s total generation, according to the EIA. 
While Nevada’s solar capacity has grown substantially, most of the new solar capacity nationally in 2025 was attributed to Texas, California, and Arizona.
Texas accounted for more than a quarter of the solar power developed so far in 2025. For the second half of the year, Texas plans to add another 9.7 gigawatts of new solar capacity, or nearly half of all of U.S. solar planned for development over that time period.
Battery storage accounted for the second-largest share of capacity additions in the first half of the year, about half of which was in Arizona or California.
Relatively little generating capacity has been retired this year, according to the EIA. 
In the first half of the year, only 2 gigawatts of the 8.7 gigawatts scheduled to be retired from service this year were pulled back. More than 3.6 gigawatts of power planned for retirement have been delayed or canceled. 
If the other planned retirements stay on track, coal-fired power plants will account for 71% of the retired capacity this year, followed by natural gas at 19%.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Solar-Robin-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-22 07:56:39.044716

HARTFORD — Three people have been arrested in connection with a fatal shooting Thursday morning, and authorities also have identified the victims, police announced overnight.
David Labrecque, 65, of Canaan, was pronounced dead Thursday morning at the scene off VA Cutoff Road, Vermont State Police said in a news release issued at 2 a.m.
The injured victim was identified as Jessica Lemay, 36, also of Canaan, who police said was being treated for multiple gunshot wounds at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center in New Hampshire.
Police identified the suspects as Demetrius Drew, 30, of New Haven, Conn. , the alleged gunman, and Jeffrey Mullins, 46, and Michelle Mullins, 48, both of Rindge, N.H.
Drew is charged with first-degree murder, attempted second-degree murder, and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. The Mullinses are both charged with being an accessory before the fact.
The news release did not offer any details about the investigation, such as how, when and where the trio was apprehended. All three are are being held without bail and are scheduled to be arraigned at 12:30 p.m. Friday in the Criminal Division of Vermont Superior Court in White River Junction.
Thursday’s investigation began just before 4 a.m. when Hartford police received a 911 call reporting gunshots at a residence on Verna Court.

(Photo by Gage Skidmore)Alina Habba, who a federal judge on Thursday said has no lawful authority to be New Jersey’s acting U.S. attorney, hit back at judges who oppose her during an appearance on Fox News.
“We will not fall to rogue judges, we will not fall to people trying to be political when they should just be doing their job, respecting the president. And you can’t get rid of the president,” Habba said, adding,  “I am the pick of the president. I am the pick of Pam Bondi, our attorney general.”
Judge Matthew Brann of the Middle District of Pennsylvania, in a highly anticipated ruling over the legality of Habba’s appointment, said because federal law allows for 120-day terms for acting U.S. attorneys who do not receive confirmation by the U.S. Senate, Habba’s term ended on July 1 and she has been acting “without lawful authority” since then.
Brann’s ruling represents the second time federal judges have rejected Trump’s pick for chief federal prosecutor of New Jersey. When Habba’s term was set to expire in July and she had yet to receive Senate confirmation, New Jersey’s federal judges named her first assistant, Desiree Leigh Grace, as her replacement, angering the Trump administration so much it fired Grace and implemented a series of personnel changes intended to give Habba another 210 days on the job.
Brann called that maneuvering “novel” but unlawful. He stayed his decision for an expected appeal to the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals. Habba predicted the Trump administration would win on appeal.
“You might try and change my title, you might try and fight me, but just like today with New York, we will win, we always do. It just takes time,” Habba said on Fox News Thursday.
A New York state appeals court on Thursday overturned a nearly $500 million civil penalty against President Donald Trump, but left in place a finding of fraud based on records that inflated the value of Trump’s business holdings.

Regardless of where you fall on the political spectrum, the vast majority of us feel a deep connection with nature and outdoor public spaces and do not want to see them sold. Unfortunately, America’s public lands are now under attack and at-risk of being sold off to the highest bidder.
The Trump administration has fired rangers and defunded the parks department. On February 14, 5% of the National Parks Service was laid off. These people are stewards of our national treasures and their stories are harrowing. Yet these cuts are just the beginning. There are plans to further reduce the Parks’ budget, slashing it by as much as one-third.
Sen. Mike Lee, R-Ariz., introduced legislation to sell up to 3 million acres of our public land while making 250 million acres available for sale. While it failed, there is still a looming battle over our shared natural inheritance.
In Vermont, over 12,000 acres of forestland are converted to non-forest use annually. While this is more due to rural sprawl, our forests are being fragmented, threatening biodiversity and animal migration. A recently failed proposal to build an Amazon distribution facility in Saxon Hill shows how ardently Vermonters oppose this type of development. 
Privatization of public lands leads to mining, logging and other destructive activities. At an oil industry conference, Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum called our national parks the “largest balance sheet in the world.” The Trump administration has repeatedly advocated a “Drill Baby, Drill” approach to our public lands.
This is not how most Americans feel about our purple mountain majesties. Polls show that, regardless of political affiliation, preserving our natural wonders is wildly popular. Americans recognize our obligation to preserve the natural splendor for future generations. Unfortunately, the state is abdicating its duty. 
While America’s natural wonders are under threat, her financial assets are booming.
The stock market hit a record high on July 2 and has continued its upward trajectory. A strong jobs report caused U.S. Treasury yields to spike. That said, the link between Wall Street and Main Street is severed. Wages have failed to keep pace with productivity gains across Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. Almost 4 in 10 Americans don’t own any stocks or bonds. The trillions in stock market gains are enriching already-resourced individuals, creating an even bigger divide between the haves and have-nots. 
When the government steps back, non-governmental organizations step up. Many groups are filling the void left by the cuts to National Parks Services, and they need your help.
As a member of the board of The Nature Conservancy in Vermont, I own my bias, but there are many groups doing important conservation work in Vermont — from local land trusts to state-wide initiatives.
The Nature Conservancy is a politically non-partisan group, putting the work over the politics. We advocate for practical, science-based policies under both red and blue administrations. In Vermont, The Nature Conservancy is working to conserve critical habitats for biodiversity and climate resilience, store carbon by preserving our forests, and create a vast network of connected, conserved lands.
If you feel that our shared natural inheritance does not belong in the hands of Wall Street, please consider donating to the vital conservation work happening around our beautiful state. Once these lands are lost, we’ll never get them back.

Criticism of Israeli government actions and policies in and of itself is not antisemitic harassment, just as my criticisms of the Trump administration’s actions and policies are not anti-American.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Heather Wood: A response to Mark Treinkman regarding H.310.","This commentary is by Heather Wood, of Waterbury.


In his recent letter to the editor, “Clearing up misconceptions about H.310,” Mark Treinkman accuses Habib Meiloud — who had written an earlier commentary opposing H.310 — of failing to read H.310. Well, I suspect Habib Meiloud did, in fact, read the bill. And so did I. 
H.310 indeed does not mention Israel. It does, however, in Sec. 2. 16 V.S.A. § 11, define “antisemitic harassment” as including “negative references to Jewish customs or the right of self-determination in the Jewish people’s ancestral and indigenous homeland.”
In other words, if this bill was passed and implemented as written, it could reasonably be interpreted as prohibiting discussions of, say, the ramifications of Israel restricting humanitarian aid in Gaza or undermining the possibility of an eventual Palestinian state by moving ahead with controversial settlements in the West Bank.
In other words, contrary to Mark Treinkman’s assertion, the bill states clearly that “negative references” about “self-determination” in Israel would constitute “antisemitic harassment.” Israel is considered to be “the Jewish people’s ancestral and indigenous homeland.”

It is also the ancestral and indigenous homeland of the Palestinian people, hence our ongoing conflicts and endless debates. Those conflicts and debates are not going away, no matter how many bills targeting free speech like H.310 get passed and how many universities get their research funding cut because of accusations of antisemitism.
It is true that both antisemitic harassment and anti-Muslim harassment are on the rise; that is, indeed, a concern worthy of legislative intervention. But criticism of Israeli government actions and policies in and of itself is not antisemitic harassment, just as my criticisms of the Trump administration’s actions and policies are not anti-American. It might behoove the Jewish people to stop equating Israel’s politics and state actions with their ethnicity; otherwise, they might start seeing antisemitism absolutely everywhere and in everything.

Santiago/Getty Images)Dozens of Democratic lawmakers in the Washington Legislature have pushed in recent months to reassess how the state Department of Corrections shares information with federal immigration authorities.
But Washington’s governor and attorney general, both first-term Democrats, see no need to change current policy. 
The Keep Washington Working Act, passed in 2019, strictly limits local police from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. This month, the statute has spawned a war of words between Gov. Bob Ferguson and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi over whether it violates federal law.
The Department of Corrections remains an exception under the state law. And that doesn’t sit well with some Democrats.
“I don’t think that we have done everything in our ability to keep communities safe,” said state Rep. Sharlett Mena, D-Tacoma. “Certainly, I don’t think we’ve done enough with Department of Corrections information sharing.”
The state agency can ask for and collect information about inmates’ immigration status and country of origin to share with embassies, spokesperson Christopher Wright said. Prison staff don’t confirm this information. And incarcerated Washingtonians aren’t required to provide it.
The Department of Corrections sends a weekly report to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement listing the names of everyone newly admitted to the state’s prisons, regardless of immigration status. ICE compares those names to its list of people who they believe should be deported. 
Agents can then share detainer requests with the Department of Corrections, allowing the prison system to let immigration authorities know when people will be released and coordinate transferring custody to ICE. 
Corrections doesn’t hold people beyond their release date so that ICE can pick them up, Wright noted. And the agency doesn’t allow agents to interview incarcerated people on their immigration status while in prison, unless the person consents.
Despite the information sharing between the department and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the number of people federal immigration authorities detain after their release from Washington prisons has been dropping for years, state data shows. 
Of the 61 prisoners wanted by immigration authorities who have been released this year, ICE has picked up 51 of them, the highest rate in the past decade. In 2024, immigration agents detained 101 of 128 of those leaving prison. 
The number of prisoners exiting with ICE detainers has dropped over the past decade from more than 300 in 2015. This mirrors a declining prison population in general, Wright said.
The more than 500 prisoners still in custody with ICE detainers have mostly been convicted of violent offenses. More than one-third are serving time for murder convictions, and more than one-quarter are in prison on rape charges, according to state data. 
ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security didn’t provide comment.
‘Why do we do this?’
In a letter to Ferguson in June, around four dozen state lawmakers, as well as city and county council members from western Washington, called for a second look at the Department of Corrections’ role under the law. 
Mena, who spearheaded the letter, met with top aides from Ferguson’s office about the concerns. She said they were receptive to changing prison policy. She’s now figuring out ways the Department of Corrections is sharing information that isn’t required by federal law that Ferguson could address through executive action, instead of through new legislation. 
For example, she says prison staff don’t need to ask prisoners about citizenship status. She also wants Corrections to stop volunteering the lists of people newly admitted into prison.
“I want to have a deeper conversation about, why do we voluntarily share that list, as opposed to letting the Department of Homeland Security specifically request information about certain folks?” Mena said. “That is truly not required. That’s my biggest question mark is, why do we do this?”
Some worry changing the law could make it vulnerable to legal challenges.
In a February press conference, Ferguson noted advocates’ concerns about the state prisons’ continued cooperation with immigration authorities, but said he wouldn’t make changes. 
Ferguson’s position hasn’t changed. 
“We’re always happy to have a conversation about anything that the state’s doing,” he said in an interview Thursday. “But I think the Legislature in 2019, when they passed the bipartisan Keep Washington Working Act, struck a good balance. They carved out an exception for the Department of Corrections in a thoughtful way and the Department of Corrections is acting in a way that’s totally consistent with the Keep Washington Working Act.”
Similar to Ferguson, state Attorney General Nick Brown said he doesn’t “see any reason right now to change the law” on Corrections’ information sharing with ICE.
“We want to make sure that we’re continuing to protect people in Washington from people who have committed crimes or have a risk of danger moving forward,” he said in an interview this week.
Wright, from the Department of Corrections, also said the agency has “no intention” of changing its policy.
Meanwhile, Mena said President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda has created more urgency around the issue. 
She has been leading the charge on this in part because of one of her constituents, Ngoc Phan, whose husband had finished a 25-year sentence for murder and assault when ICE detained him. 
Tuan Thanh Phan was a lawful permanent resident from Vietnam before his conviction. He was in limbo for weeks in the African country of Djibouti as advocates fought in court the Trump administration’s move to deport immigrants to so-called third countries. These are places where the deportee has no ties. 
Ferguson denied a pardon request for Phan, to the disappointment of Mena, other lawmakers and advocates. The U.S. Supreme Court in early July cleared the way for the final deportation of Phan and seven others to South Sudan in the headline-grabbing case. 
This year, lawmakers approved an expedited pardon process for immigrants facing deportation.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/immigration-ICE-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-22 07:56:39.044716

(Getty Images)It feels like every day there is a new request to raise electric rates or a new report on how much utility costs are growing. It’s become crisis level, and I consider it even more important than the debate over property taxes.
A recent NPR article said across the country, electricity prices have jumped more than twice as fast as the overall cost of living in the last year.
So, who’s to blame? If only it were that easy. There is no one culprit — instead it’s a handful of factors all colliding to create the highest summer bills I have ever seen. And that’s with a vigilant husband who controls the thermostat.
First, I’ll talk about what I have seen firsthand: lawmakers giving utilities more freedom each year to recoup costs from ratepayers and protect shareholders over consumers. I understand some of the requests from utilities, but customers never seem to win in the discussion.
These so-called trackers allow utility companies to adjust rates for specific costs outside of a normal base rate case before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. For instance, Hoosier power companies can recover costs related to transmission, distribution and storage system improvements. But there are many others.
Hoosiers’ electric bills spike 17.5% in one year

That means that part of my bill is paying to upgrade an aging infrastructure. Think about it like you having to replace your roof after 30 years. But in personal finances you save for that — something utilities clearly haven’t done.
Hoosiers also haven’t fully embraced all forms of power. From coal and natural gas to solar and wind, all can add to the reliability and affordability of power in Indiana. But in some cases, legislators have limited or outright banned incentives or designations for renewable options. Instead, they are going all in for small modular nuclear reactors.
I fully support exploring nuclear, but the fact is it is likely decades away from coming to fruition and does nothing to help Hoosiers now. And yet that is where legislators focused much of their effort earlier this year.
Then there are those power-hungry data centers. They seem to be popping up everywhere. While only a few of them are partially active in Indiana, many others have been proposed. They create a very real threat to power in Indiana, and I can’t see what advantages they bring to Hoosiers. They usually create a small number of jobs and long tax abatements limit their impact on the tax base.
The last thing I will mention is the rate game. Utilities come in and propose purposely high rate hikes. The Office of Utility Consumer Counselor opposes, and the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission approves a lower rate, but one that still adds to the burden.
This is one area where Gov. Mike Braun could have an impact. He likes to talk tough, and I hope he brings that same approach to his role over appointments on both agencies.
The agencies will have new leadership soon and he needs to make clear it’s time to start putting the consumer first — not utility shareholders. That’s harder than it looks when you see how much utilities spend in the political arena.
Beyond millions each year in direct donations to campaigns, utilities are among the top spenders on lobbying activities. And some of the state’s largest utilities also help fund the Indiana Economic Development Foundation.
There is no silver bullet. But a starting point would be for legislative leadership to clearly acknowledge the problem and commit to finding solutions.

That’s a change from the The Indiana Department of Correction’s earlier consolidation plan laid out in 2023, which called for shuttering both Indiana State Prison and Westville Correctional Facility to save on staffing and operating costs.
Instead, DOC confirmed to the Indiana Capital Chronicle this week that Westville will close as originally planned, but the state prison will remain open indefinitely.
The Westville facility is just 14 miles south of Michigan City, where the Indiana State Prison is located.
The new correctional facility — which DOC calls the Northwest Indiana Correctional Facility — is still under construction on the site of the current Westville correctional campus.

“DOC still intends to close Westville Correctional Facility with the opening of the new Northwest Indiana Correctional Facility,” said DOC spokesperson Annie Goeller. “We have been collaborating with state and local officials on the future of the Indiana State Prison, which we intend to keep open for some time after the opening of the new facility. At this time, we have not yet determined how long that will be.”
It’s not clear, though, whether DOC’s cooperation with federal immigration authorities influenced the timeline. 
Earlier this month, Gov. Mike Braun’s administration announced it would lease up to 1,000 empty state prison beds to the federal government to house immigration detainees.
Goeller cited recent growth in the state’s incarcerated population as a factor but did not say  specifically if arrangements with federal officials factored into the decision to keep the state prison open longer.
“DOC’s population has been growing for the last several months and we are focused on utilizing our current space efficiently, which includes the space at Indiana State Prison,” she said.
Even so, the Indiana Public Defender Council expressed concern that federal contracts could stretch already thin staff even further.
“Our prisons are already understaffed, with correctional officers overworked and pulled away from their core mission of humanely housing and rehabilitating the people in their charge,” the group said. “Additional federal demands only hinder the state’s ability to maintain the standards of safety and rehabilitation it has worked hard to achieve.”
The council additionally pointed to a December 2024 agreement between then-Gov. Eric Holcomb and Michigan City that envisioned transferring the site to the city by 2029.
“IPDC has always recognized that the Indiana State Prison could not be decommissioned overnight, but Governor Holcomb’s letter of intent to transfer ownership to Michigan City by January 1, 2029, suggested its closure was on the horizon,” the council said. “We hope that remains the plan.”
A new prison in the works
Construction on the new Northwest Indiana Correctional Facility is proceeding on schedule, and is under budget. 
Goeller said a “majority of buildings” have their exterior completed and interior work is ongoing.
The new facility is set to open in 2027.
Elevatus Architecture was selected to lead the $1.2 billion effort, from planning through construction completion. The campus design consists of 28 buildings totaling about 1.4 million square feet. It’s the first new prison built in Indiana in more than 20 years.
According to the architecture firm, administrative spaces at the new prison site will be enhanced to provide amenities for staff “that they have not been afforded in the existing facilities.”
A medical area and dedicated mental health building for inmates are under construction, too. Recreational spaces, vocational programs and industrial manufacturing are also included in the campus design.
The maximum-security facility will have 4,200 beds, making it one of the largest in the state.
When the project was announced in 2023, DOC leaders emphasized cost savings as the driving motivation.

Then-Commissioner Christina Reagle told lawmakers the consolidation would save the state $45 million a year in operating costs, noting that it would not be “cost effective” to renovate the 163-year-old Indiana State Prison. 
The state’s budget leaders backed the plan, pointing to long-term efficiency gains by staffing and maintaining one modern complex instead of two outdated ones. Initially lawmakers set aside about $400 million in 2021 but inflation and supply chain challenges caused a boost in the 2023 budget.
Both existing facilities are now running near capacity — and the state’s prison population keeps ticking upward.
DOC’s latest figures for August show that the Indiana State Prison is housing 2,436 inmates in 2,486 available beds, putting it at nearly 98% of its capacity. Westville holds 2,858 inmates in 3,013 beds, at about 95% capacity.
Both prison facilities have additional bed space — around 463 beds in Westville and 52 beds in Michigan City — but DOC officials said staffing and maintenance constraints, among other issues, have kept those beds offline. 
The future of the Indiana State Prison site
The long-term fate of the sprawling Indiana State Prison property remains unclear. 
Holcomb signed a letter of intent with Michigan City in December 2024, laying the groundwork to transfer ownership of the prison site to the city by Jan. 1, 2029. That agreement was meant to give Michigan City time to plan while the new prison was under construction.
The deal was described as part of an Indiana State Prison “reimagination strategy,” aimed at spurring community-driven redevelopment of the site.
DOC plans to close Indiana State Prison as part of new Westville project — which now tops $1.2B

Local leaders in Michigan City have spent the past year gathering ideas for how the historic prison site might be reused once the state vacates it.
Residents have suggested everything from mixed-use housing and business space to parks and cultural attractions, noting the waterfront location and historic architecture as assets.
The effort has already drawn state backing. Michigan City was awarded READI 2.0 funds to support community planning around the site, which officials say will help with public engagement and long-term design work.
If Indiana State Prison remains open beyond 2029, however, DOC and the Indiana Department of Administration may have to revisit the agreement terms.
Because Holcomb’s letter of intent was not a final deed transfer, state officials have acknowledged that DOC, IDOA and Michigan City would might need to negotiate a new arrangement if the prison facility is still operational at the end of the decade.
That could mean pushing back the transfer date, entering into a phased transfer or striking a revised agreement that allows part of the site to be repurposed while the prison continues operating elsewhere on the grounds. IDOA did not reply to the Capital Chronicle’s request for comment about the deed transfer.
The public defender council said the delayed closing decision underscores state expectations that the prison population will continue to rise.
“[I]t is no secret that DOC is preparing for a larger prison population, with projections indicating the count could exceed 28,000 by 2028,” the group continued. “While many factors play a role, a central driver is the reduction in credit time enacted in the 2014 criminal justice reforms, compounded by new crimes and sentence enhancements. In other words, policy choices, not crime rates, are fueling this growth.”

(Photo Illustration by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Attorney General Keith Ellison announced Tuesday he’s suing TikTok for illegally exploiting young users. The lawsuit resembles a similar suit filed by more than a dozen bipartisan attorneys general last year. They allege that TikTok’s addictive algorithm, which delivers personalized content in a never-ending scroll of short videos, along with other features such as TikTok LIVE and “beauty filters,” are harming young users’ mental health in what amounts to a deceitful trade practice.
The lawsuit cites data on TikTok usage among Minnesotan youth specifically, though the numbers are redacted because TikTok says they are confidential, according to the attorney general’s office.
We know that TikTok usage is widespread among teens nationwide, suggesting similar trends in Minnesota. Apart from YouTube, TikTok is the most popular social media app among teens. A 2024 survey by Pew Research found that 63% of U.S. teenagers use TikTok, down from 67% in 2022, with 16% — one out of every six American teenagers — who say they use TikTok “almost constantly.”
And, TikTok’s own data show that teens check the app “an average of 17 times a day and spend an average of almost two hours a day on the app, more than any other age group,” according to the lawsuit.
Many teens say they use social media too much — 27%, according to a survey conducted in 2023 by Pew.
As kids say they are glued to their phones, their mental health appears to be worsening, both here and nationwide.
Minnesota’s statewide student survey reports that nearly one-third of 11th graders in 2022 said they had long-term mental health problems, compared to 27% in 2019. For ninth graders, the percentages were 28% in 2022, up from 23% in 2019.
Though many mental health questions in the survey change, students across time are asked about how often they build friendships. The results show an increasing percentage of kids without close friends. The percentage of 11th graders who say that they build friendships with other people “not at all or rarely” jumped from 3.8% in 2013 to 7% in 2022.
More teens think that smartphones make it more difficult to learn good social skills, according to the 2023 Pew survey.
It’s not just kids who are worried about their social media use. Of 1,400 mental health workers surveyed by Politico, over a quarter believe that social media is the biggest driver of mental health issues in kids, though clinicians cite a variety of other factors, such as political instability and social isolation.
What remains uncertain — at the moment — is a causal link between social media use and mental health problems.
For example, Candice L. Odgers, a University of California-Irvine psychologist, wrote in Nature last year that the “suggestion that digital technologies are rewiring our children’s brains and causing an epidemic of mental illness is not supported by science.”
Ellison explicitly compares TikTok to nicotine. The comparison unwittingly underscores just how much patience Minnesotans may need to hold the social media giants accountable if indeed they are selling a dangerous product.

Bishop died in 2024 but a lawsuit in her name will change how people with HIV are treated in Missouri prisons (photo submitted).For six years, Honesty Jade Bishop was held in solitary confinement in a Missouri prison after she was sexually assaulted by her cellmate.
The Department of Corrections deemed that Bishop, a transgender woman who was living with HIV, was sexually active and needed to be isolated. And from 2015 to 2021, she was in administrative segregation at the Jefferson City Correctional Center, a prison that houses men.
A federal lawsuit filed on Bishop’s behalf in 2023 after her parole says her prolonged time in solitary confinement caused “depression, hopelessness, severe anxiety and feeling as if she were going insane and reaching a mental breaking point.” It also, the lawsuit says, drove her to “physically self-harm including attempts to take her own life.”
On Wednesday, the department agreed to a settlement, setting new policies and training requirements. But Bishop died before the settlement could be reached, taking her own life in October 2024.
“My sister, Honesty, was a fighter who never gave up,” Latasha Monroe, Bishop’s sister, said in a news release from the MacArthur Justice Center Thursday. “She endured years of cruel treatment because of her HIV status, but she never stopped believing that things could change. This settlement honors her memory and ensures that others won’t have to suffer what Honesty went through. Her courage in speaking out has created lasting changes.”
Monroe continued the lawsuit on behalf of her sister’s estate. There was a monetary award in addition to the policy and training changes, but the amount has not been released.
Lambda Legal and law firm Shook, Hardy & Bacon also participated with MacArthur Justice Center in representing Bishop.
Shubra Ohri, senior counsel at the MacArthur Justice Center, said she first met Bishop soon after she was released from isolation and got to know well after her parole.
“She was a bright person who had to cope with a really torturous experience, basically,” Ohri said. “And you know, despite being bright and despite being hopeful and really productive, I could tell she was struggling with things.”
Bishop was in prison after being sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2014, according to a report on the settlement prepared by Midwest Newsroom and The Marshall Project. During a scuffle with police as they tried to arrest her in 2011 for a misdemeanor stealing charge, Bishop bit an officer and was charged with assaulting an officer and recklessly risking an HIV infection.
Bishop began transitioning after arriving at Jefferson City Correctional Center. During her time in isolation, Ohri said, “she was denied, like a lot of things, that would help affirm her identity as a transgender woman, which really had an amplified impact on her mental health.”
At the time of the assault, and until the settlement, the department policy was to place anyone with HIV into isolation if they were deemed sexually active, Ohri said in an interview Thursday with The Independent.
“It was very, very obviously an unconstitutional policy,” she said.
The Midwest Newsroom/Marshall Project report states that, as of January 2025, there were 218 people with HIV incarcerated in Missouri.
Karen Pojmann, spokeswoman for the state department of corrections, did not respond to a request for comment on the settlement. 
Going forward, any incarcerated person with a communicable disease will be evaluated individually to determine if they need to be in administrative segregation to prevent the infection from spreading, according to the settlement
“This settlement represents a critical victory in our ongoing fight against HIV criminalization and discrimination,” Jose Abrigo, Lambda Legal HIV Project director, said in the news release. “For too long, correctional systems across the country have subjected people living with HIV to punitive and medically unjustified isolation based on outdated stigma rather than modern science.”
HIV can be controlled with medication to the point that the virus is not transmissible. Part of the settlement mandates new training for corrections officers on HIV transmissibility, as well as the law on disability-based discrimination, Ohri said.
“The hope is that combined, the policy change and the training,” Ohri said, “would really drive home that what happened to Honesty, putting someone in segregation who may have HIV, but was on medication, that there’s no reason for it.”

(Getty Images)Consumers who purchase health insurance through the New Jersey marketplace may pay an average of 16% more for coverage next year, state officials said Thursday.
Health insurance carriers say the increases on the Get Covered New Jersey marketplace are a result of the rising cost of health care and the anticipated expiration of federal tax credits associated with the Affordable Care Act.
About 512,200 New Jerseyans purchased health insurance on the marketplace this year, according to New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance Commissioner Justin Zimmerman. Nearly 90 percent of them received the federal aid that is scheduled to lapse at the end of 2025, Zimmerman said.
“Particularly given the anticipated loss of enhanced financial help made available by the federal government that resulted in lower costs for so many in past years, it will be important for consumers to look closely at their options and choose the plan that best fits their needs and budget,” Zimmerman said.
Open enrollment begins Nov. 1. For 2026, five New Jersey insurance companies will offer plans through the exchange. The rate increases scheduled for 2026 are:

Ambetter from WellCare of New Jersey: 17.1%.
AmeriHealth: 15.5%.
Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey: 17%.
Oscar: 4.6%.
UnitedHealthcare: 18.4%.

The marketplace was created by the Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, as a place for people who could not get health insurance through work or through Medicaid expansion.
Aetna announced earlier this year that it is not providing plans on the marketplace in 2026.
Under the Biden administration, Congress passed bills that increased federal subsidies for marketplace plans through 2025. Health research group KFF says the number of marketplace enrollees receiving federal aid has nearly doubled since 2020.
The subsidies have reduced premium payments by $705 a year on average for enrollees receiving tax credits, according to KFF. 
State officials estimate New Jersey would lose more than half a billion dollars in federal support. The expiration of this aid would create a gap that either the state budget would need to fill or families would have to shoulder.
Lower-income households, particularly those earning too much to qualify for Medicaid but without employer-based coverage, would be hit hardest, according to Brittany Holom-Trundy, a senior policy analyst at the New Jersey Policy Perspective.
Holom-Trundy told the New Jersey Monitor that, for families already stretched thin, small increases can be detrimental. 
“If you’re barely able to pay your bills as it is, adding another 3% on top of that … can be the difference between having enough to, you know, buy food to pay the rent and having to find another home, maybe facing eviction,” Holom-Trundy said.
Health insurance carriers told the department that if Congress renews the enhanced credits this fall, they expect the average rate increase would drop from 15.9% to 12.8%.
The expected increases in New Jersey fall just below national trends. A recent KFF survey found a median 18% premium increase among Affordable Care Act-regulated plans across the country.

(Getty Images)Wisconsin policymakers approved more than $1.3 billion in tax cuts in the latest state budget but the exclusion of a “no tax on tips” proposal has lawmakers pushing ahead with a bill that would line up state law with a new federal law. 
Bill coauthor Rep. Ron Tusler (R-Harrison) said during a hearing in the Assembly Ways and Means committee that lawmakers should help working class people who are “trying to get themselves to that middle class” with Assembly Bill 38. A hearing on the bill was held in the Senate in May, though it has yet to come up for vote in either chamber. 
“When I was a younger man, I was a waiter at Perkins, and I received tips. I also received tips for a couple years as a valet, and folks that receive tips aren’t just waiters and valets, but also housekeepers, bartenders, delivery drivers, massage therapists, hairdressers, taxi drivers, tour guides,” Tusler said. “Those are the type of people we’re talking about, trying to help with this bill, trying to not tax and as representatives, these are great folks for us to target, and as Christians, we should always be trying to help the poor.”
President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” signed into law on July 4 includes a federal provision that will allow workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually from their taxable income. Those earning more than $150,000 aren’t eligible for the deduction. 
The Wisconsin bill and a recent amendment to it seeks to implement the same policy when it comes to the state income tax, which currently considers tips as taxable income. The deduction would apply to tips whether paid by cash or credit. Similar to the federal law, the provision will go into effect starting tax year 2025 and sunsets after tax year 2028 — around the end of Trump’s second term in office. 
“Any time that we can allow people to keep more of their hard-earned money — that’s going to be something that I’m supporting,” Sen. Andre Jacque (R-New Franken) told the committee.
Erin Vranas, co-owner of Parthenon Gyros located in downtown Madison and chair of the Wisconsin Restaurant Association’s Board, said many restaurant employees are struggling with semi-unpredictable income. 
“Every dollar matters, so this bill really could help provide meaningful relief,” Vranas said, adding that it would also help restaurants trying to recruit and retain employees. “Wisconsin restaurants face ongoing workforce shortages, and I understand this isn’t just a restaurant thing, but we definitely feel it in this industry. AB38 will help us recruit and retain staff, making restaurant jobs more competitive and sustainable. When employees keep more of their hard-earned tips, then they’re more likely to stay and grow and see hospitality as a sustainable career, which strengthens both our businesses and Wisconsin as a state.” 
The minimum wage for tipped employees in Wisconsin is currently $2.33 per hour. Employers are required to make up the difference if an employee’s combined wages and tips do not equal the regular minimum wage of $7.25 per hour.
Susan Quam, executive vice president of the Wisconsin Restaurant Association, said she only knows of two restaurants that  pay the minimum wage. Those restaurants have a $100 per person check average and employees typically make $20 per customer “every single time they work, so we’re talking about folks who are making $100 to $150 dollars an hour in tips.” WRA, a nonprofit trade association that represents thousands of food, beverage and hospitality businesses, supports the bill.
“The vast majority of our members tell us that they’re paying well above that $2.33 to their tipped employees, some of them higher than the $7.25 minimum wage,” Quam said. “The marketplace is dictating what that base wage is, not necessarily the fact that they are getting tips.”
Tusler explained that employees would still need to report tips, both because there is a limit on the tax deduction and because tipped employees need a record of their full income when applying for loans. 
“It would make it more difficult for those tip earners to borrow money for their houses or their cars,” Tusler said.
He told the committee the bill would also cut down on confusion between the federal and state policies when people are filing taxes. 
The tax break also wouldn’t cost the state much, Tusler said. The Department of Revenue estimates that the state brings in about $33.7 million a year from tips and would lose about that much in each year of the biennium under the proposal. 
“That’s it,” Tusler said. “We have a $111 billion budget.”
The recent bipartisan state budget cut taxes by about over $1 billion, but the tips proposal was not included in the budget passed by the Republican-led Legislature and signed by Gov. Tony Evers last month. Evers had included a similar proposal in his budget proposal, but Republican lawmakers threw it out when they started working on the budget. 
A bipartisan group of lawmakers, including Jacque, previously introduced the idea of exempting cash tips from taxes in 2019, though it never became law. 
The idea picked up steam nationally when President Donald Trump started campaigning on the idea, which led Republican lawmakers to reintroduce the proposal in Wisconsin this year.  
The coauthors of the bill expressed frustration that no Democrats have signed onto the bill yet, noting that Evers has supported something similar before. 
“This was something where Gov. Evers basically took that previous proposal… cut and pasted that into his budget proposal, so it’s not like there was ever any indication that this wasn’t something that shouldn’t have bipartisan support,” Jacque said. “And I certainly hope that it will going forward.”
Rep. Joan Fitzgerald (D-Fort Atkinson) said during the hearing that she and her husband, who is a bartender, have discussed the issue extensively since it started gaining popularity around the 2024 election and questioned whether a bigger conversation about helping lower-income workers needs to be had. 
“I would say encouraging employers to have better benefits, higher pay, better working conditions are also ways we get people to realize the American dream,” Fitzgerald said. “Cutting taxes might be one small part of that, but there’s a broader array of things that we can do, and if, and if that’s your goal, and it’s my goal, then I say we attack some of those other issues.” 
Jacque said he understands that tax relief needs to be multifaceted, but said that if the state starts “mandating things on employers that potentially raise costs…, you aren’t going to have customers and those jobs aren’t going to be supported.”

Deployments to Trump's inauguration and to immigration detention efforts in Wyoming is impacting the Wyoming National Guard's coffers, commander says.
The post Wyoming guard looks to Congress for money as Trump deployments hit accounts appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming National Guard’s coffers are feeling the pinch of President Donald Trump’s second administration after a deployment to Washington D.C. for the January inauguration, federal hiring freezes and a new mission supporting immigration enforcement, guard officials said this week.
The cost of the guard’s deployment to support U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in the accelerating drive to round up, detain and deport vast numbers of immigrants nationwide is still unknown, Maj. Gen. Greg Porter told state lawmakers on the Joint Transportation, Highways & Military Affairs Committee. 
The unprecedented new role for guard troops, who state officials have said will only work in Wyoming, is still taking shape. But whatever the tasks, and the costs that come with them, it is for now an expense borne by Porter’s department, not the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
“It’s free chicken right now to ICE,” Porter said. “So, we’ll see how long this lasts and where that goes, but it really has an impact on our readiness accounts.” Porter was referring to accounts that support guard training and operations, which are funded by the federal government, not Wyoming. 
National Guard units from around the country are now asking Congress for money to refill their coffers so that they afford their usual fall training deployments, Porter said. Wyoming has been able to steward its funds so that its fall training will occur, he said, but other states will find themselves in a tight spot if Congress doesn’t spend more money. 
“Some states could face significant financial liabilities that would directly impact readiness,” Porter told WyoFile in an emailed statement. “To keep the Guard trained, equipped, and ready to respond when our nation calls, federal funding must be provided accurately, fully, and on time.”
In his second administration, Trump has deployed both the national guard and the regular military to control American citizens in unprecedented ways. Citing one crisis after another — rationales that critics consider manufactured excuses to use emergency powers — Trump has now sent guard troops onto the streets of two American cities, Los Angeles and Washington D.C.

In Los Angeles, Trump claimed troops were necessary to maintain order after residents began to protest sweeping immigration enforcement actions in the city. He ordered the deployment over local and state leaders’ objections. 
In Washington D.C., again acting over the wishes of local officials, Trump has sent the district’s national guard troops, who have now been joined by guard units from six Republican-led states. Trump claims the troops, who are joined by federal law enforcement agents from ICE, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, are necessary to quell a wave of crime. 
Recent crime statistics do not bear that claim out, though federal officials have suggested those numbers were manipulated. 
Porter told committee members he did not think the Wyoming National Guard would join the D.C. deployment. 
Wyoming troops did travel to the capitol in January, however, to provide a security presence during Trump’s inauguration. The guard spent $250,000 out of its readiness accounts on that deployment, and the federal government has yet to reimburse that money, Porter said. 
Wyoming also sent troops to President Joe Biden’s inauguration in 2021. That inauguration came on the heels of the Jan. 6 violence at the U.S. Capitol, when Trump supporters stormed the seat of government to try and stop an electoral college count that secured Biden’s victory. Both inaugurations ultimately occurred peacefully. 
ICE deployment 
The Wyoming National Guard has asked for 15 volunteers to provide logistical, administrative and transport support to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents operating in the state. The guard and the federal government are in the process of selecting and vetting that group of troops, guard spokesperson Joseph Coslett told WyoFile. 
At the committee meeting, Porter told lawmakers the operation was still shaping up, but said Wyoming troops wouldn’t conduct any law enforcement activities in the state. They could be involved in transporting detained immigrants to ICE holding centers in other states, though, Porter said. 
Though in the field troops would take direction from ICE agents, Porter said they would remain under the ultimate discretion of Gov. Mark Gordon, and that funds to support the effort would be routed through the gubernatorial administration. 
Gordon’s decision to enlist Wyoming troops in immigration enforcement comes as he increasingly ties the state to Trump’s aggressive efforts to round up and deport undocumented immigrants. Trump is also increasingly removing protections for people from some countries who had legal status, growing the pool of deportable immigrants. 
ICE is increasingly detaining people who do not have criminal convictions, but whose presence in the country is illegal. Under federal law, unlawful presence in the country on its own is a civil offense, not a criminal one. (Entering the country improperly is a crime.) From January through the end of June, the majority of people ICE arrested in Wyoming did not have a criminal conviction, according to an analysis of ICE arrest data by WyoFile and The Colorado Sun. ICE arrests in the state, however, nearly tripled during that time period. 
“Gov. Gordon’s assertions that this authorization is in pursuit of public safety strains credulity and is at odds with what’s happening on the ground and what data shows,” American Civil Liberties Union of Wyoming spokesperson Janna Farley said in a statement issued to Wyoming Public Media and KHOL when those outlets reported on the guard deployment last week. 
Gordon was joining the Trump administration in stoking fear among immigrant communities, Farley said. Those communities are often composed of families of mixed legal status.
“The fear among immigrants and their loved ones across Wyoming is palpable,” Farley said. We’ve seen this fear lead to empty outdoor concerts, families going without groceries and valuable employees being too terrified to show up to work. Heightening this fear by mobilizing the National Guard will continue to drain resources and contribute to even more devastation in our communities.”
For his part, Gordon has said Wyoming must do its part to help secure the country, and has repeatedly invoked the immigration-hawk adage that “every state is a border state.”
Hiring freeze
As Trump places novel domestic demands on the guard, his administration has also blunted its hiring. A federal hiring freeze includes the agency, Porter said. The freeze has left the Wyoming National Guard “not in a great place,” Porter said. The guard currently has 70 full-time positions vacant and unfillable under the freeze, he said. 
Wyoming lost ten Army National Guard employees and five Air National Guard employees to the Trump administration’s efforts to encourage federal employees to retire, Porter told lawmakers. The freeze could have a long-term impact on the department, he suggested, if not reversed. 
“I can see us shrinking in the full-time force a little bit, which is not where I want to be and I think an unintended consequence of the administration’s path right now,” Porter said. “Because I don’t think they really mean to reduce the amount of lethality we can generate in the National Guard.”

As summer turns to fall, deer, elk and moose shed the velvet from their antlers. Photographer Mark Gocke documents the transition. 
The post An appreciation for antlers appeared first on WyoFile .","The nights are getting chilly, and it is a time of change in Wyoming. While each season has its special attributes, the transition from summer to fall may be the most thrilling for me. A favorite part of summer is seeing deer, elk and moose with their velvety antlers: so soft looking you want to touch them. And antlers are also fantastic photographically, especially when backlit, with their translucence creating amazing rim light.

Not only are antlers a great photo subject, they’re also pretty amazing biologically. Antlers are one of the fastest growing biological tissues, similar to fetal tissue and that of a wound healing. In just a few short months, animals can grow a full set of antlers, which can be massive for the mature males, weighing over 30 pounds each for elk and moose. New antlers start growing as soon as the old ones are shed, which is typically by late winter. All summer, the velvety antlers are loaded with blood vessels carrying lots of nutrients for the rapid growth, and are thus warm to the touch. 
By mid-August, these animals have grown their next full set of antlers. They start undergoing hormonal changes, triggered by shortening periods of daylight. We know this from researchers who have manipulated the amount of light available to animals indoors, actually causing them to grow two sets of antlers in one calendar year.

The hormonal changes primarily involve an increase in testosterone. Males that lack this normal spike in testosterone for any reason will remain in the velvet stage. This has been shown by castrating males in captivity. Otherwise, the blood vessels and velvet will begin to dry up, and the cartilaginous antlers further harden to become an external bone, primarily made up of calcium and phosphorus, just like other bones. 
When the velvet begins shedding, the antlers are pure white with some remaining blood stains. However, this period is short-lived, typically only 24 to 48 hours, as the animals will accelerate the process by rubbing the velvet off on tree saplings and such. Tannin from the trees, along with the blood stains, give the antlers their usual brown color.

Throughout summer, males will often hang together in bachelor herds, but the increase in testosterone also urges the males to disband and start seeking out females to breed with. Thus begins the fall rut. The competition for breeding rights will cause individuals that have hung out together for months to suddenly become rivals, sometimes engaging in fierce battles with each other. This is truly a fascinating time of change for Wyoming’s wild ungulates.

The consequences of severe staffing and budget cuts at federal agencies that manage America’s public lands are already apparent, writes Tracy Stone-Manning, the former director of the Bureau of Land Management.
The post The West is on fire as Washington fans the flames appeared first on WyoFile .","This commentary was originally published by Writers on the Range.
This summer, millions of Americans are hiking, camping, fishing and making lifelong memories in our national parks, forests and other public lands. But something troubling is taking place behind the beautiful views: The federal agencies that safeguard these places for us are being hollowed out.

Opinion

Staffing and budget cuts at the Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and U.S. Forest Service aren’t just numbers on a spreadsheet. They are empty ranger stations during peak season, trail crews that never arrive and wildfire teams stretched so thin that they can’t keep up.
During the four years when I led the BLM, from 2021 to 2025, I saw what it takes to care for hundreds of millions of acres of public lands. It takes committed, dedicated people — wildfire crews, wildlife biologists, planners, law enforcement rangers — and it takes funding. Today, both are being stripped away at historic rates.
We can already see the consequences. As I write, flames tear through the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, burning down the historic lodge and scarring over 100,000 acres. The fire has raged for weeks since a lightning strike ignited it on July 4, and it may continue for weeks more.
Fire is part of the West’s natural cycle, but climate change and decades of suppression have made today’s fires hotter and more destructive. It just doesn’t make sense that the Trump administration is gutting the agencies responsible for managing fire risk when we need these experienced and dedicated people most.
More than 1,600 wildfire-qualified staff have been driven out of the Forest Service in recent months, and as many as one in four firefighting jobs remain vacant. To make it worse, firefighters are being pulled from the fire lines to tend to logistics for some forests, even in one of the most dangerous wildfire seasons in memory.
The administration has even proposed removing firefighting from the Forest Service entirely, a dangerous move that separates the rangers who know the land best from those dousing the flames. People of all backgrounds celebrated when we collectively stopped Congress from selling off our public lands earlier this summer. But now, a clear and dangerous pattern is emerging: Shrink these agencies until they break, then claim that selling off or industrializing our public lands is the only fix.
This should alarm anyone who values the freedom these lands provide. Public lands are a great equalizer — places where all Americans have the same right to hike, hunt, fish or camp. And to unplug and touch nature. If we lose the people who manage these lands, our access will shrink under wildfire closures, roads will be gated and campgrounds will close. We’ll lose our freedom to wander.
It’s also a direct threat to conservation. Our public lands deliver clean water, clean air and wildlife habitat. Cutting conservation programs and abandoning fire-smart management will leave forests overgrown and ready to burn — with wildfires too big and too hot.
Worse still, future generations are going to inherit the choices made today. When the administration guts our parks and public lands to pay for tax cuts for billionaires, they saddle the future with parks and trails that are closed, crumbling roads and buildings, forests prone to even worse fire, smoky skies and “No Trespassing” signs. The cherished traditions we pass down — teaching a child to fish or hunt, camping under a night sky, chasing butterflies — will no longer be available to all.
Westerners know what’s at stake. Poll after poll shows that people across the political spectrum want to keep our public lands public, healthy and accessible. That consensus is powerful, but only if we use it now. Either we protect the agencies that protect our public lands, or we watch the slow-motion sell-off unfold.
We must demand full staffing and funding for the agencies that manage our lands, and we must all stand together — hunters and hikers, ranchers and rafters, anglers and climbers — in defense of the places that belong to us all and to future generations.

A paean is “a fervent expression of joy or praise.”  When it comes to the long and ongoing struggle to preserve the incredible legacy of Montana’s world-famous trout fishing rivers and streams, Bud Lilly, who was recently inducted into the National Fly Fishing Hall of Fame, deserves every bit of the praise — and the joy. 
For thousands of young anglers the beautiful flies pictured in Bud Lilly’s catalog brought dreams of fishing the Holy Waters of Montana’s legendary trout streams.  For those lucky enough to actually spend time in Bud’s West Yellowstone Trout Shop, the array of those concoctions of fur and feathers tied so artfully on tiny hooks was dizzying — although few of us had enough money to buy even a fraction of what we so fervently wanted to tie to our leaders.
But for Bud, it wasn’t all about commerce.  He’d gladly take the time to help young and/or inexperienced fly anglers pick “the right flies for the right places” with a humility and kindness that belayed his national and world-wide fame.  
His was not the false bravado so common these days, where anglers feel a need to hold their trout so they can post pictures online to brag of their catch.  Quite the opposite.  
He knew the rivers intimately — among them, the Gallatin, Madison, Jefferson, as well as the Firehole, Gibbon, and Madison headwaters in Yellowstone National Park.  The depth of his knowledge was no surprise since he grew up fishing those rivers.  Initially he did so to feed his family during the sparse days of the Great Depression when the primary goal was “catch and release in bacon grease” and the “end of the rainbow” was a black cast iron pan. 
That would change as he realized that, like so many things, the wild trout of Montana and the rivers and streams upon which they relied were not infinite.  He pioneered the ethic that catching these wild, leaping, beautiful fish was in itself the great pleasure — and that killing and eating every one would soon leave the rivers fished out and barren.
My personal friendship with Bud spanned nearly a half-century and went far beyond what flies to use in what rivers.  For decades we wrestled in the policy arena to pass legislation that actually protected the aquatic ecosystems essential for Montana’s wild trout.
Make no mistake, the challenges to keep the great rivers continue to be many, varied, and increasing.  Far too many irrigators still believe that water left instream to keep a river and its fish healthy is water wasted.  In part, that attitude is fostered by the strictures of western water law that keeping a valid water right means “use it or lose it” — despite the riverine consequences. 
Likewise, rivers that support healthy wild trout populations must have clean and cold water, which means minimizing sedimentation, nutrients, and the ever-increasing variety of pollutants from herbicides, pesticides, pharmaceuticals and fertilizers.  Bud knew all this — and was a stalwart advocate and fierce comrade-in-arms to his final days.

Marilyn Gooch was already skeptical about one of her newest neighbors, xAI’s supercomputing facility, when her cousin walked across the street in June with a blue mailer from the Greater Memphis Chamber of Commerce. 
Her cousin didn’t know what to make of the postcard featuring the logos of nine local, state and federal agencies and the chamber’s assurance that billionaire Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company operated “in full compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations and oversight.” The facility — part of Musk’s bid to dominate the AI market — opened at a breakneck pace almost a year before, brought to Memphis, Tennessee, largely due to the efforts of the local Chamber of Commerce.
Across the country, communities are grappling with the boom of data centers and supercomputing facilities, which consume voracious amounts of electricity and water and can emit smog-producing pollutants. In places from Maricopa County, Arizona, to Prince William County, Virginia, residents have used zoning restrictions as a means to keep supercomputers at bay — an option not available to Memphians because the xAI building was already zoned for industrial use. 
Since the opening of the xAI supercomputing facility, Gooch had joined residents and environmental justice advocates sounding off at meetings about potential health impacts of xAI. She learned about the area’s already high concentration of toxic emissions from nearby industrial plants, including an oil refinery, and the county’s high asthma rates. 
Of greatest concern: the emissions from the dozens of methane gas turbines — each roughly the size of a semitrailer — that were initially used to power xAI’s new facility located less than 2 miles from her home in southwest Memphis. Based on its analysis of county health ordinances and federal regulations, the Southern Environmental Law Center has asserted in multiple official and legal documents that these turbines violated the Clean Air Act and should never have been allowed; the Shelby County Health Department disagrees.
Gooch saw the mailer as an attempt to quiet their concerns.

In the face of intense public opposition, the chamber has gone to unusual lengths to promote xAI, whose $12 billion investment the chamber believes will transform the shrinking city into a global hub of technological innovation. The chamber wants Memphis to be known as part of the “Digital Delta,” expanding beyond its blue-collar identity as the distribution capital of the country and FedEx headquarters.
This all-out push includes a five-member special operations team to provide what it calls “round-the-clock concierge service” to ensure “seamless execution of the company’s rapid expansion plans.” The chamber also managed xAI’s PR efforts, and while it has not held open public meetings about xAI, it hosted at least 12 invitation-only meetings to tout the project’s benefits to Memphis. And the chamber sent its first mailer in recent memory, which spread incorrect information about the governmental oversight in place to monitor Musk’s new facility.
Former chamber president Beverly Robertson said she can’t recall another instance of the chamber doing such a full-court press for a company — but then again, she and others noted, Memphis has never attracted a company of xAI’s scale.
The public had no input into the opening of the facility in their community. As a private business, xAI had no obligation to seek community feedback, the chamber has said. And because xAI did not seek or receive tax incentives, it wasn’t subject to review from government bodies or elected officials, some of whom learned about xAI’s arrival from the news. 
The community’s lone chance to hear from xAI in person came in April during a heated health department hearing about residents’ concerns over the gas turbines. Brent Mayo, an xAI executive, read a statement about the company’s plans to meet the highest emissions standards. He left before the public comment period began. 
An xAI spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about the chamber’s mailer or to questions about the number of gas turbines powering the supercomputer.

In this reliably Democratic and majority-Black city, some residents were upset by Musk’s alignment with President Donald Trump, his brief tenure as the chainsaw-wielding head of the Department of Government Efficiency, and the antisemitic and racist posts from xAI’s chatbot Grok, which is powered by the supercomputer known as Colossus. In response to this criticism, the chamber says it defends projects, not people. 
But what dominated the civic discussion was potential damage to the region’s air from xAI’s temporary turbines, especially the nitrogen oxides and formaldehyde they can emit, which contribute to smog. Even with brief exposure, smog increases the risk of respiratory problems, asthma and heart diseases, according to the World Health Organization.
The mailers sent in mid-June to residents in at least two neighborhoods, including Gooch’s, appeared to be addressing those fears, asserting that the chamber “will continue to prioritize compliance with existing standards and policies.” 
For seven generations, Gooch’s family has lived in Boxtown, a Black neighborhood in southwest Memphis. Environmental justice activists say Boxtown has been plagued for decades by pollution from nearby industrial plants. In Gooch’s ZIP code, the median household income is just shy of $37,000 and the poverty rate is twice that of the city as a whole.

Gooch took the mailer from her cousin and scanned the alphabet soup of agency acronyms for the nine the chamber claims have “regulatory oversight and authority over xAI’s Supercomputing Facility.” Before retiring, she worked in human resources for 25 years and maintained workplace safety reports. “There’s no way they’re going to be monitoring and looking at all this,” she remembers thinking. “That’s so far beyond their reach.”
Only two agencies on that mailer have clear oversight over xAI’s impact on air quality and public health, the community’s primary concerns. The first is the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which under the Trump administration aims to make the United States the world’s AI capital. Local oversight falls to the Shelby County Health Department, which says it is installing a long-awaited air monitor in south Memphis. Both agencies help ensure compliance with the Clean Air Act, the enforcement of which the current administration is weakening as part of a pattern of broader environmental rollbacks. 
Two other agencies represented on the card — Memphis Light, Gas and Water Division and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation — told MLK50: Justice Through Journalism and ProPublica that they have no authority over xAI’s supercomputing facility. The other five agencies say they do oversee some aspects of the facility, such as fire safety, zoning or potential whistleblower complaints — none of which address the health concerns that most preoccupied the community.

The “Chamber’s mailer stating MLGW has regulatory oversight and authority over the xAI facility is in error. MLGW does not have regulatory authority or oversight of xAI or any business,” Ursula Madden, Memphis Light, Gas and Water’s spokesperson, said in an email. 
Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation spokesperson Jennifer Donnals said in an email that “TDEC does not have regulatory oversight over supercomputer facilities.” The agency issued a permit related to construction and stormwater management at the Colossus site, she said. 
Bobby White, the chamber’s chief government affairs officer, who said he wrote the text featured in the mailer, told MLK50 and ProPublica that he’d used the word regulatory “loosely.” He said the chamber sent the mailers to show residents that xAI didn’t set up shop in Memphis without consulting with anyone.
”It has been my intent to make sure people have understood that the company has essentially abided by rules and law as they currently exist,” White said in a written statement. “I have also in public and private ways tried to advise activists and leaders that changing this company’s or any company’s behavior comes down to changing the policy that allows for it.”
One of xAI’s staunchest critics is State Rep. Justin J. Pearson, who represents a majority-Black district that includes Boxtown. Memphis Community Against Pollution, co-founded by Justin Pearson and now run by his brother KeShaun Pearson, was at the forefront of the fight to get the Shelby County Health Department to deny xAI’s permit for 15 permanent turbines. It was joined by other local groups including Young, Gifted & Green, the Chickasaw Group of the Sierra Club and Tigers Against Pollution.

Justin Pearson said the chamber’s mailer misled residents by including agencies that have no authority or only indirect authority over xAI. 
“It’s the red handkerchief of the magician,” Pearson said. “The propaganda that they are putting out to try and convince people that there’s nothing to see here, there’s nothing to worry about, is only at the behest of a multibillion-dollar corporation.” 
White said xAI did not ask the chamber to send the mailer and accused environmental activists of misleading residents with claims that “the turbines were somehow operating counter to existing policy and regulations.” He said he got involved after seeing his former sixth grade teacher, church members and community leaders he’s worked with for years at a “raucous town hall meeting on the subject of gas turbines, where people were being whipped into a frenzy and still leaving without good information.”
The chamber emphasized White’s message in a more nuanced way in a July webinar held less than a month after the mailers arrived in Gooch’s neighborhood: “XAl’s presence in Memphis has occurred with the oversight of, input from, and/or strategic alignment with the following agencies/organizations,” read a slide, with the logos of the same agencies.
Chambers of commerce exist to promote businesses and lobby for a pro-business climate, said Darrin Wilson, an associate professor at Northern Kentucky University who studies local economic development. But he said pro-business organizations should still be expected to provide accurate information.
“You want to make sure that the residents of Memphis and Shelby County have 100% accurate and full information around something that is going to impact their day-to-day lives,” he said, “so that they can make decisions for themselves and advocate on their own behalf.”

The chamber maintains that xAI is an indisputable win for the city, expected to create an estimated 500 high-paying jobs and, in the first year alone, generate tens of millions of dollars in city and county property taxes, soaring to as much as $100 million next year. The city’s mayor plans to direct 25% of tax revenues from xAI’s first facility to the neighborhoods closest to the operation. xAI has recently committed to funding repairs and new athletic fields at four neighborhood public schools. 
According to press reports, xAI’s presence is continuing to expand in the Memphis area. Its second supercomputer facility, Colossus 2, is expected to come online soon. Musk has announced he’s moving a power plant from overseas to power Colossus 2. And just across the state line in Mississippi, an xAI-affiliated firm purchased the site of a former Duke Energy power plant less than 2 miles from Colossus 2.
After months of weighing whether to approve xAI’s permit request to operate 15 permanent, cleaner turbines, the county health department granted the permit in July. The Southern Environmental Law Center has appealed the permit decision to the Shelby County Air Pollution Control board, an appointed body that hears such protests. The health department did not publicly explain its decision to grant the permit.

The chamber says that xAI has taken a number of steps to address environmental concerns. It claims that emissions from the permanent turbines, which will be a backup power source, will be far less than the maximum the EPA allows. To protect the electrical grid in times of peak demand, xAI is also using Tesla Megapack batteries as another backup power source. 
In addition, the company is building an $80 million wastewater facility that will allow xAI, plus the Tennessee Valley Authority and a nearby steel manufacturer, to use recycled water to cool their plants instead of relying on the aquifer the region depends on. 
“What we’re really seeing is a company that, quite frankly, is doing as much as you could hope a company would do in terms of being environmentally conscious,” White said.
Still, people in Gooch’s neighborhood have reason to worry about air quality. Last year, the American Lung Association gave Shelby County an F grade for ozone, an air pollutant that contributes to smog. The county also has the state’s highest rate of ER visits for asthma, and the city has been named an asthma capital by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.

In southwest Memphis, the cumulative cancer risk associated with exposure to 13 carcinogens in the air was 4 times higher than the national average, according to a 2013 study by University of Memphis researchers. 
“Every family member that I’ve had that lived in the Boxtown area has died of some form of cancer,” Gooch said, acknowledging that some were smokers. 
Gooch, a member of the Boxtown Neighborhood Association, attended one of White’s xAI presentations at a nearby church this spring. She remembers White saying that Memphis needs more tax revenue and can’t afford to let xAI, or other companies, slide across the state line to Mississippi. 
She’d planned to ask questions, but after listening to White focus on the finances, she decided not to. 
“His whole spiel was about money, economics,” she recalled. “Not all money is good money.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Gordon-xai-3x2_preview-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-22 06:56:28.146544

Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, is urging supporters and business leaders to push back against “messaging” from “legacy media” regarding the major tax and spending law passed by Congress in July. 
Crapo spoke to a group of about 50 people Thursday morning in Boise at a breakfast held by Americans For Prosperity, or AFP, an advocacy organization founded by billionaires Charles and the late David Koch. The private event at a downtown hotel highlighted the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which is now a law and was supported by AFP through a $20 million campaign effort. 
HUD secretary, Crapo emphasize deregulation and tax incentives in housing roundtable 

“Undeniably, AFP was the biggest ally we had in getting the One Big Beautiful Bill across the finish line,” Crapo said Thursday. 
Crapo chairs the Senate Finance Committee, which, among its many areas of oversight, is charged with crafting tax policy. The Idaho senator played a key role in crafting the legislation. 
He lauded AFP for going to the districts of lawmakers reluctant to vote for the bill. 
“And it wasn’t because those House members and Senate members didn’t want to vote for the bill,” Crapo said, “it’s because their constituents were listening to the legacy media message about the bill and didn’t understand what it did, and AFP helped us there.” 
Attendees included Idaho Gov. Brad Little, Superintendent of Public Instruction Debbie Critchfield, state House Majority Leader Jason Monks, R-Meridian, and Boise City Councilmember Luci Willits.
 Protestors call on Idaho congressional delegation to hold open public meetings

Around 30 people protested the event outside, calling for public, free town halls instead. The protest was organized by the Idaho 50501 movement, which was also behind the No Kings Day protest in June, and Idaho Women in Action.

“Senator Crapo’s recent votes to restrict Medicaid and reduce funding for SNAP directly impact families across the state,” said in an Idaho 50501 press release. “Idaho 50501 and Idaho Women In Action believe these decisions should be discussed openly, with input from those most affected.” 
Crapo had no public town halls scheduled as of Thursday, and a page on his office’s website with a calendar and map of town halls listed an August 2022 event as the most recent one. 
Spokespeople for Idaho’s other members of Congress, Sen. Jim Risch and Rep. Mike Simpson, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on if they plan to hold town halls. 
“As our townhall events, including tele-townhalls are organized and scheduled, we will update via our official office platforms, constituent emails, press releases and such,” a spokesperson for Idaho U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher said.
 Crapo highlights laws deficit impact, tax cut extensions 

The Idaho senator said Thursday he was “defensive” of the narrative he’s heard that the tax and spending bill — which among many things made cuts to Medicaid and food assistance, extended tax cuts passed in 2017, added temporary cuts to taxes on overtime pay and tips, and increased spending for immigration enforcement and border security. 
An analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the total bill would raise the federal deficit by around $3 trillion in the next 10 years, FOX Business reported, and the law raised the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, which increases the legal limit on the amount the U.S. Treasury can borrow.

Crapo countered that analysis, arguing that the office should have used the baseline revenue with the tax cuts enacted in 2017 that were set to expire this year. His office requested that CBO score the bill, using the current tax policy as a baseline; that request shows a $1.2 trillion deficit decrease over the next decade.
“That’s where we needed help from AFP to get our colleagues to agree to take this hit because they were attacked as a gimmick,” he said.” I don’t think most Idahoans think it’s a gimmick to say that the refusal to raise taxes is not increasing the deficit.” 
He also said it wasn’t just wealthy Americans and businesses who benefited from the tax cuts, noting, “billionaires are paying the same taxes this year that they paid last year.” 
A larger percentage of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was made permanent in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act go to the wealthiest Americans, according to analyses by the Tax Policy Center, Economic Policy Institute, and the Bipartisan Policy Center. On average, all income groups receive a tax benefit from the extension — or would have seen a tax increase had the cuts not been made permanent. 
The bottom 20% of household incomes would likely see an average increase of .5% in after-tax income as a result of the extension of the child credit and larger standard deduction, according to the Tax Policy Center. The highest-income taxpayers would see net tax cuts of 2% of after-tax income for those in the top quintile. 
The Council on Economic Advisors, an office under the office of the president, estimated that the average Idaho resident would see a raise in wages by $3,400 to $6,400 in the next four years as a result of the legislation. 
 Crapo, echoing House Speaker Johnson, says another reconciliation bill may be coming 

Crapo underscored that while the massive law addressed many of President Donald Trump’s main priorities, it did not satisfy all of them. He said the ultra conservative Freedom Caucus also wanted to see larger spending reductions. 
Of Trump’s “eight or nine” priorities, Crapo said, the law accomplished “three or four” of them. 
As chairman of the Finance Committee, Crapo was present when Trump signed the bill into law in July. He said the president called him out as knowing “more about taxes than anybody,” but said he and Crapo didn’t always agree. 
“That’s because he didn’t get all eight of his things, and he only got them for a number of years,” Crapo said with a laugh. 
U.S. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, said he wanted another major bill to continue the work, Politico reported.   
To pass the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, lawmakers used what’s called the reconciliation process. Through this process, lawmakers avoid the filibuster in the Senate and only need a simple majority of votes rather than 60. Reconciliation can only address tax policy and certain types of spending. 
“So we are going to do another reconciliation bill,” Crapo said. “The politics of that one are going to be much, much more difficult because we don’t have the (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) engine driving it. And the pressure in that one will be spending reductions, and any kind of spending reform in Washington is an intense battle, so look for that and keep saying nice things about me when we start cutting more.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)With a year to go in Tennessee’s gubernatorial primary race, U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn appears to own the polling numbers over U.S. Rep. John Rose, holding a 52-point advantage in one survey.
Coffee shop talk says she’s a shoo-in.
(Wait a second, Rose’s campaign is claiming he beat Blackburn handily in a Lawrence County Reagan Day dinner straw poll.)
Regardless of whether these polls are worth their weight in Moon Pies, the bigger question is whether the state’s senior U.S. senator will consider Rose a realistic opponent and agree to go head-to-head on a debate stage?
Rose told the Lookout at a Future Farmers of America event in Lebanon this week he is “absolutely” ready to debate Blackburn. Asked if she agreed, he said, “Sounds like she doesn’t want to.”
Blackburn, who spoke at the event’s press conference headlined by U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, along with Rose and other Tennessee officials, declined to take questions afterward, choosing to wander away from this reporter and let a flack do the blocking. In making her gubernatorial announcement earlier this month, she also sent out a text message and an online statement but didn’t make herself available to the press.

Rose, in contrast, held his initial confab at the same Wilson County fairgrounds on a nippy March day and answered a few questions afterward, even if he wasn’t enthused about talking.
Granted, Rose is a heavy underdog, and he’s going to do whatever it takes to get an edge. 
No doubt, he was also grinning ear to ear and Blackburn was cringing when Secretary Rollins told the audience she agreed to speak at the FFA ham breakfast just so Rose would quit texting her constantly. 
Will Blackburn stand for such outrage?
She has $4.4 million in her federal campaign account, money that can’t be used for the state race. The Tennessee Journal reports a committee called Team Tennessee raised $676,000 this year to back Blackburn but that a joint federal fundraising account is nearly empty after she shelled out money to a fundraising consultant, transferred a chunk to her Senate campaign, a state political action committee and her strategic team. Another Blackburn PAC, Making a Responsible Stand for Households in America, received $905,000 from her Senate account and is doling out money across Tennessee.
Tennessee gubernatorial candidate touts $6.1M campaign war chest

Rose, whose net worth is much greater than Blackburn’s, reported he made a $5 million loan to his campaign and raised another $1.1 million from donors. He hasn’t started churning out TV ads and mailers, raising questions about whether he’s sitting on the money.
It might be time, though, for Blackburn to take him seriously, which could mean getting into a political debate. She fared well against former Gov. Phil Bredesen in their U.S. Senate race forum in 2018, and butting heads with Rose would give her the chance to ask him why he voted against certifying the Biden election, in addition to signing on to written documents of objection to the outcome. Blackburn voted to certify the election, a reluctant move in the wake of the Jan. 6 insurrection by Trump zealots. 
Oops, that might not be the right issue to raise, considering the president pardoned all of the rioters in spite of the subsequent deaths of multiple U.S. Capitol police officers, some of whom committed suicide. The vote also could come into play in a Trump decision to endorse, which would effectively end the race.
It’s a political crap shoot. Then again, most debates are a little risky.
Going for the gusto?
After six years of leading private prison operator CoreCivic, Damon Hininger is stepping down as president and chief executive officer, leading to the appointment of Patrick Swindle to head the company.
CoreCivic runs four of Tennessee’s 12 prisons and remains in good stead with Gov. Bill Lee and the Department of Correction in spite of a federal civil rights investigation into conditions at Trousdale Turner. 
Tennessee levied $44.78 million in penalties against private prison operator in three years

In addition to that probe, West Tennessee residents are raising questions about CoreCivic signing a contract with federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement to use a Tipton County facility for immigrant detention as part of Trump’s deportation effort.
Hininger, who spoke last year at Republicans’ Statesmen’s Dinner, was rumored to be considering a gubernatorial run at the time. That could be a little farfetched now, but questions remain about the potential for a U.S. Senate candidacy with Blackburn running for governor. 
Stepping down from the CoreCivic post would eliminate conflicts of interest for Hininger. He declined to answer Lookout questions this week about taking a shot at either political post.
So much for equality
Tennessee is spending more per student to send kids to private schools this year than for those going to public schools, according to a Chalkbeat report.
Under the state’s new private-school voucher program, some 20,000 students are receiving $7,295 each to attend private schools, compared to $7,023 for public school students. The numbers were revealed in a state school board meeting last week, Chalkbeat reported, drawing criticism from the Tennessee Education Association and Democrats.
Tennessee won’t know how many new vouchers go to existing private school students

It’s up to local governments to raise the ante and pour more into schools, as has been the case for decades.
During debate on the bill this year, the state’s projections showed 66% of those receiving the voucher money would be enrolled in private schools already. Education officials told legislators this week the law didn’t require the department to track that number through student applications.
Next year, though, the question will be on applications. Considering most of the seats are taken by private-school students already, will it tell us anything new? Highly unlikely.
Why not here?
This comes from the reader mailbag.
Following Gov. Lee’s decision to deploy Tennessee National Guard soldiers to Washington, D.C., at Trump’s request to cull crime in the capital city, at least one person wants to know why he’s sending troops there when Nashville and Memphis have higher rates of property crimes and violent incidents. Why is no one pressuring Lee to deploy troops to the streets of Tennessee’s two biggest and bluest cities?
It sounds like a sarcastic query. But the answer is: Considering the Tennessee Guard is already helping ICE with logistics and paperwork, don’t give them any bright ideas.

Oddly enough, the same logic has applied for months to the Michigan House Republicans’ approach to the state budget: until they actually present a plan, their budget both exists and doesn’t. 
For those who are not science nerds, the concept of Schrödinger’s cat is a thought experiment which demonstrates that in the super-micro quantum world, something (in this case, a cat) can simultaneously exist in multiple states until we observe it, at which point it is forced to become one or the other.
Obviously in the reality we experience, something can’t be two things at once (the exception may be Michigan weather, in which it can be both snowing and oddly humid), but Lansing politics often transcends reality. 
Earlier this week House Republicans said that box could open as soon as next week with the long-awaited release of their proposal, and the cat about to finally be observed. But House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) slammed shut the box lid by repudiating his own appropriations chair and saying the GOP budget plan might not see the light of day until Sept. 30. That would give negotiators just hours to finalize a budget and get it signed by Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer by the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1, staving off a shutdown.
This year’s process stands in stark contrast to the last two budget cycles when Democrats held the political trifecta of legislative majorities in the state House and Senate and the governor’s office, passing spending plans by the July 1 deadline.

But one need only go back to 2022 and see that even with a GOP-led House and Senate, Whitmer and fellow Democrats were able to get a budget approved on time.
But today Michiganders are stuck in political limbo, unable to scrutinize or debate what has only been promised, not delivered.
The state is barreling toward an Oct. 1 government shutdown, and every day without a spending plan leaves vital services in limbo and taxpayers on the hook.
There have only been two shutdowns in Michigan before, in 2007 and again in 2009, both lasting just hours until temporary spending plans were put in place. That could be the case this year also, although does anyone really believe we live in a less politically divided world than we did 15 years ago? 
In the meantime, that budget cat, the one we can’t see, is still theoretically inside the box. The cat we can see is the failure of Hall and his Republican caucus to produce a state budget proposal in a timely manner, leaving schools, local governments and countless Michigan families in the lurch. 
With a rapidly shrinking legislative calendar,  that failure has moved beyond mere political posturing. It’s legislative negligence. 
Instead of several months to negotiate a budget that will pass both chambers and be signed by the governor, we are now facing the possibility of mere hours.
But it doesn’t have to be this way. In fact, it shouldn’t be this way. 
Just six years ago, Hall joined every one of his House colleagues – Democrats and Republicans alike – in approving a statutory deadline of July 1 for the Legislature to pass a budget. 
Unfortunately that law provided no sanction for violating it, likely with the assumption that responsible leaders would abide by it out of a sense of their solemn oath.
Feel free to pause here so you can catch your breath after the good laugh that statement surely provided.
But seriously, the goal then seemed logical: provide schools and local governments with clarity and stability. Yet now, weeks after that deadline has come and gone, the very man who helped enshrine that timeline into law is presiding over a chamber that has yet to put a complete budget on paper.
So, what’s the holdup? 
Hall insists that House Republicans are focused on delivering a comprehensive plan that includes fixing Michigan’s crumbling roads, a priority he claims is shared by Whitmer. 
But the governor told Michigan Advance Senior Reporter Ben Solis that while she does want a long-term road funding solution, this year’s budget process “is going a little later than I think any of us want it to,” and a roads plan is just one piece of the overall picture. 
“It all goes together,” she said.

The fact remains that the governor put forth her statewide budget proposal in February, while the Democratic-led Michigan Senate followed suit in May.
The House GOP, by contrast, has offered press conferences, not pages.
With a proposal that had been promised “as soon as next week” but now again delayed, the path forward remains unclear. What’s in the plan? More importantly, will it be a serious spending blueprint that understands a true negotiation requires both giving and getting? 
None of that is certain. What is certain is that the longer House leaders wait to get serious, the greater the risk to essential services, and to the people who rely on them, all of which could have been avoided if the House GOP had treated this process with the urgency it demanded.
The Senate has acted. The governor has acted. The House GOP says it may act soon. 
But Michigan deserves more than promises. It deserves leadership.
There’s still time to avert disaster. But with every passing day, voters should be asking why the chamber that once demanded budget discipline now finds itself scrambling to meet the moment. 
Whenever a plan finally arrives, let’s hope it’s more than a political prop. Because while the theoretical cat inside Schrödinger’s theoretical box can theoretically wait, actual accountability won’t wait.

(Courtesy of Vargas for Nebraska)OMAHA — Tony Vargas, a former candidate for Congress and elected officeholder for more than a decade, has confirmed he is running for Douglas County treasurer in the 2026 election.
The former Nebraska state senator for South Omaha joins the county race with the support of Omaha Mayor John Ewing, who held the treasurer’s spot for 18 years before resigning in June to take on his latest role as mayor.
Prior to Vargas’ eight years in the Legislature — he termed out of the lawmaking role last year — he served on the Omaha Public Schools Board. Vargas, 40, began his career as a public school teacher and twice ran unsuccessfully for the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District seat, losing tight races to now-retiring U.S. Rep Don Bacon, R-Neb.

“From the classroom as a middle school science teacher to the school board, and from the Nebraska Legislature to my run for Congress, public service and giving back to my community has always been at the core of my life’s work,” said Vargas, currently executive director of Square One, a national leadership nonprofit founded by a group of Obama administration alumni and entrepreneurs. 
Vargas said his attraction to the treasurer’s post stems from work that fulfilled him while serving eight years on the Legislature’s budget-setting Appropriations Committee. 
“Being a steward of our state government resources, protecting taxpayer interests and making sure we are being fiscally sound has been something I really enjoyed doing,” he said, foreseeing such skills transferring to the treasurer job.
He said he “worked across party lines” to help deliver balanced budgets and strived to ensure that tax dollars provided efficient and quality services. 
Republicans regularly criticized Vargas during his congressional races for missing votes, which he explained as having to do with his committee work in the Legislature.
Vargas said he was proud of a fiscal planning law he championed in 2019 that allowed lawmakers to better forecast revenue. He said he backed legislation to strengthen public schools and to improve access to health care and consumer protections. 
As treasurer of the most populous county in the state, charged with overseeing the collection of taxes, Vargas said his goals would include following through on the office’s recent technology infrastructure updates.
Earlier this week, another Democrat, Christian Espinosa Torres, assistant director of the Omaha Human Rights and Relations Department, announced his candidacy for the treasurer’s job.
Vargas said he entered the race with more than $50,000 to start his campaign.
“Now more than ever, Nebraskans need leaders who are dedicated to listening to and serving them and who have a track record of getting things done that make their lives better,” Vargas said. 
Vargas earned his undergraduate degree at the University of Rochester and a master’s degree in education at Pace University. He serves as a board member of the Latino Economic Development Council, the Rose Children’s Theatre, Partnership for Kids and Opera Omaha.

(Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)This week, the Trump administration’s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced an effort to check the immigration status of people who get their health insurance through Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.
Medicaid is the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. For families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford private insurance, CHIP is a public program that provides low-cost health coverage for their children.
The feds will begin sending states monthly enrollment reports that identify people with Medicaid or CHIP whose immigration or citizenship status can’t be confirmed through federal databases. States are then responsible for verifying the citizenship or immigration status of individuals in those reports. States are expected to take “appropriate actions when necessary, including adjusting coverage or enforcing non-citizen eligibility rules,” according to a CMS press release.
“We are tightening oversight of enrollment to safeguard taxpayer dollars and guarantee that these vital programs serve only those who are truly eligible under the law,” Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who oversees CMS as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said in a press release announcing the new program.
As of April, roughly 71 million adults and children nationwide have Medicaid coverage, while another 7 million children have insurance through CHIP. Immigrants under age 65 are less likely to be covered by Medicaid than U.S.-born citizens, according to an analysis from health research organization KFF.
Immigrants who are in the country illegally aren’t eligible for federally funded Medicaid and CHIP. Only citizens and certain lawfully present immigrants — green card holders and refugees, for example — can qualify.
But some states have chosen to expand Medicaid coverage for immigrants with their own funds. Twenty-three states offer pregnancy-related care regardless of citizenship or immigration status, according to KFF. Fourteen states provide coverage for children in low-income families regardless of immigration status, while seven states offer coverage to some adults regardless of status.
The tax and spending package President Donald Trump last month cuts federal spending on Medicaid by more than $1 trillion, leaving states to either make up the difference with their own funds or reduce coverage. But the new law also includes restrictions on coverage for certain immigrants, including stripping eligibility from refugees and asylum-seekers.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson)The Federal Emergency Management Agency closed disaster assistance applications Tuesday for residents affected by severe storms and flooding in April.
The agency approved roughly $7.2 million in aid to 975 individuals between June 19 and Aug. 19, according to FEMA’s website. This includes $4.3 million in housing assistance and $2.9 million to assist with other needs.
Homeowners, renters, students, self-employed individuals, ranchers and farmers in Cheatham, Davidson, Dickson, Dyer, Hardeman, McNairy, Montgomery, Obion and Wilson counties were eligible to apply for disaster assistance, which is meant to help individuals pay for uninsured losses resulting from the disaster.
While the initial application period for the severe storms in Middle and West Tennessee is now closed, FEMA does accept late applications for an additional 60 days. Those who submit late applications must include an explanation for the delay, though FEMA does not require applicants to submit documents supporting the reason for the delay. Late applications are reviewed on a “case-by-case basis,” according to FEMA’s website.
Housing assistance helps individuals cover temporary housing costs and pay for structural home repairs that are not covered by insurance. These funds may also be used to replace wells, furnaces and septic systems. 
Funding for “other needs” can help homeowners and renters offset costs of other disaster-related out-of-pocket expenses not covered by insurance.
Affected individuals can apply for individual assistance through DisasterAssistance.gov, through FEMA’s mobile app or by calling 800-621-3362. Additional resources can be found at fema.gov/disaster/4878.
Private nonprofits that provide “non-critical services of a governmental nature” may also be eligible for low-interest physical and economic injury disaster loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration. More information is available at sba.gov/disaster or 800-659-2955.

(Natalie Fobes/Getty Images)Editor’s note: This is the fourth installment of a four-part series on salmon. Part One described the emergency effort to rescue Washington state’s last population of Snake River spring and summer Chinook salmon, in the Tucannon River. Part Two explored salmon and steelhead extinction threshold science, showing the Pacific Northwest is entering extinction momentum that will be very difficult to escape. Part Three explored the good work that has restored the Grande Ronde and Imnaha river areas, more so than any other salmon landscape in the Snake River Basin.
I conclude here this four-part reflection on salmon and steelhead extinction science, and extinction’s approach and effects for rivers and people in Washington and Oregon’s Snake River tributaries. The last words go to many I interviewed, after a few more from me.
Salmon extinction in motion in Washington’s and Oregon’s Snake River

I thank everyone who talked with me: Amy Jayne, Bobby Fossek, John Milbert, Kevin March, David Baum, Noel March, Rick George, Joe McCormack, John Appleton, Henry Roller, Kyle Bratcher, Tucker Jones, Ed Bowles, Emmit Taylor, Ryan Kinzer, and Jay Hesse. I thank Hesse, Kinzer, Jones and Kasey Bliesner for data, Kinzer and Pete Sandrock for map help, and a few anonymous reviewers. I thank Pam Conley and Mike Beaty for introductions that got me started, and ongoing advice. I am responsible for any errors.  
More should have been interviewed but were not. Many threads worth following – the 30-year relationship of area ranchers with river restoration, for example – were not.  Nor was I able to talk with the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation or the Grande Ronde Model Watershed. Since this story can’t be told without them, I have tried to fill in roles and some details from their websites. The Grande Ronde Model Watershed website is the best single place to get a feel for northeast Oregon’s river and water restoration story-in-progress.   
I believe the word “extinction” no longer penetrates, publicly or politically, as it did 40 or 20 years ago. Nor do salmon numbers – dam counts, for example – because there are too many numbers. 
Yet strong public and political awareness of the fishes’ dire condition is not optional if the lower Snake River is to be restored, so that Snake salmon and steelhead get their shot to restore themselves. Results on the Klamath, Elwha, White Salmon and other rivers strongly suggest that when salmon get that chance, they grab it.
(For the scientific case to restore the lower Snake, by removing its dams, I recommend a webinar by Russ Thurow. Thurow is a U.S. Forest Service emeritus fish biologist, and main architect of comprehensive research and data sets for salmon and steelhead in Idaho’s Middle Fork Salmon River. The link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhaXzrd6wk0&t=1058s) 
The extinction threshold science is good, timely and action-focused. I also see its potential to show extinction in motion to people and leaders – in mapped, named places whose human-salmon stories can be told, and perhaps more deeply heard by those in government who represent the people and places.
Salmon and steelhead extinction threshold science, and the ocean fish of northeast Oregon

When the Nez Perce Tribe releases its 2025 extinction threshold update, I hope salmon people studying it ask, can we show extinction risk in motion to Northwest people and leaders, year by year?
In 2022, U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, forthrightly said, “we cannot under any circumstances allow the extinction of salmon to come to pass.”  
But exactly that is underway. Can its pace and locations be shown to U.S. Sens. Murray, Maria Cantwell, Ron Wyden, Jeff Merkley, Jim Risch and Mike Crapo; to Northwest members of the U.S. House; to Govs. Tina Kotek, Bob Ferguson and Brad Little; and to Northwest people?  
As I researched this article, the federal administration and its agencies began a retreat from their responsibilities, to many tribes and the Northwest, to restore salmon and steelhead that federal actions are grinding to extinction. 
This retreat dishonors our nation, ignores what makes the Northwest a unique place on earth, and has 3 ½ years more to run. For at least that long, Northwest people, leaders and institutions must counter federal retreat with equally visible engagement and support for salmon.  
This includes continued pursuit of public and political settlements to make Columbia and Snake River salmon, tribes and salmon communities whole, while keeping other river users whole or better. It’s not an easy pursuit.  
But, when our nation shirks its responsibilities, who else but Northwest people, and our state, tribal and congressional leaders, must step in to fill the vacuum, with sustained action?
 What if salmon and steelhead in your rivers go extinct?

I asked some of those I spoke with a hard question: What if sea-going salmon and steelhead in the rivers you know go extinct? Others have one more point to make about the situation or remedies.    
The good work underway by Pacific Northwest salmon people in northeast Oregon

Retired attorney and fisherman Dave Baum: “I used to try a case in Enterprise, get done at 5 or 6, drive to the Imnaha, 30 miles down to Cow Creek, to fish for steelhead. In October, I’d start the hike about 9 p.m. I used a head lamp and wore high top leather boots for rattlesnakes. I’d get to Eureka Bar on the Snake at 11 p.m, throw my bag out, and start fishing at dawn. I’d fish the Snake an hour or two, then fish back up the Imnaha to Cow Creek. Walking that canyon, its vertical walls, is like being in fairyland. To me, extinction would mean no fishing for steelhead.”  
Ryan Kinzer is the Nez Perce Tribe research scientist coordinating development of the extinction threshold data: “We can see that in the 1980s, the Snake River populations showed significant variability. If one population was down, others were even or up. We started losing that around 2000. Now the populations are pretty synchronous in their decline.  That’s bad. It means the species is losing its ability to refresh its parts and repair gaps. The danger rises of losing them all at once in a catastrophic event or two. This has happened in California, and can happen here.”

Retired acupuncturist and fisherman Kevin March: “I notice the habitat changes without salmon. The Wallowa River used to host freshwater mussels. Now I never see the shells. It’s a real sign of decline. The dead steelhead and salmon aren’t in the river anymore. We still have much more habitat in the ag valleys to re-connect. And, when the Elwha and Condit dams went, the fish came back. Just let them have the chance.”

Fisherman and writer John Milbert, when he thinks about extinction, remembers Celilo Falls, the spectacular fishery drowned by The Dalles Dam in 1957. “We lived on the coast back then, but we drove back to eastern Oregon every year. I was always awake at night, so I saw Celilo Falls, and The Dalles Dam being built as we drove. I didn’t know what it meant, but it was interesting, all the lights and equipment. Then, on one trip, it was done. Where is Celilo? Where are the fish? What do the fishing people do now? I still think about it. If we lose salmon here, it’s the same thing.”
Ascension Center Director Amy Jayne: “Teaching the reality is part of our curriculum. I think we understand how devastating salmon disappearance would be. This is their land. Salmon are sacred to our Indigenous relatives, therefore to us too.  Extinction would be devastating. We want to have hope: a child finds a mussel, the water is cold, you can see the wonder. But we also have to face reality.”
Trout Unlimited river restorer Noel March: “Extirpation in northeast Oregon would be devastating.  To lose that wild connection, the living connection between the ocean and our inland rivers, would be profoundly sad. They’ve always been there for us, for the tribes and now for us all. Not returning the favor, and allowing them to slip away, would be a sad commentary on us.” 
Joe McCormack, of the Joseph Band of the Nez Perce: “It’s a terrible loss for us. Without salmon, you strip tribal people of a large part of who we are. Our sustainability as a tribe rests on the shoulders of those Nez Perce in 1855 who secured our right to fish, in our treaty. Taking salmon away is like losing an arm, a leg, a heart.”

Emmit Taylor, Nez Perce watershed program director: “Salmon is a first food. Water is first and salmon second in the long house. In our creation story, salmon came forward and offered their lives for the people. Salmon are the leader. The fishery is food and culture for tribal people.
“Think of the abundance there was in Wallowa Country: spring and summer Chinook, steelhead, coho, sockeye, lamprey, bull trout … They didn’t just feed us, they fed eagles, bears, trees. Today the watersheds and the people only have a small fraction of what was here 150 years ago.”
Ed Bowles, former Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife chief of fisheries and salmon adviser to Oregon governors: “Snake River salmon are facing extinction, population by population. But we also have evidence, from several sources including extinction threshold science, that intrinsic productivity is still there in these salmon and steelhead. It is NOT too late.  Oregon’s view, based on our best assessment of the science, is that we have two salmon generations, eight to 10 years, to restore the lower Snake. That one action isn’t all that’s needed, but it is the necessary cornerstone for recovery, and must happen soon. This urgency is heightened given the need to secure continuity of services that the lower Snake currently provides, prior to restoration.” 
Caretakers of the Land’s Bobby Fossek: “Our culture was brought upriver on the backs of the salmon. If salmon are healthy, people are healthy. Salmon stood up for human beings, and the health of the ecosystem, for thousands of years. Their decline and loss is apocalyptic to me. It has happened so fast. We are seeing the effects of living as if the health of fish and rivers are irrelevant.”
And Nez Perce elder Elmer Crow: “We are the circle. That’s what life is all about. We take care of one another. So when we have someone in trouble, that’s when the rest of us have to step in.”

(CWBeacon illustration)At a moment when public broadcasters are staggering from the loss of $1.1 billion in federal funds over the next two years, Boston’s two leading public media executives say that rebuilding trust and community are the keys to survival.
“I think the best way to build trust is from the local community up,” said Susan Goldberg, president and chief executive of GBH, which operates television, radio, and digital platforms. She touted the radio station’s studio at the Boston Public Library as a way for people to come in “and watch us create the content in front of them,” saying: “I think it’s that kind of transparency that can help build back trust.”
Margaret Low, chief executive of WBUR Radio, agreed, observing that her station reaches beyond its airwaves and digital presence through events at its CitySpace venue and through such initiatives as the WBUR Festival.
“There’s something very powerful about bringing people together in a place to talk about some of the most pressing issues of the day,” she said. “And it’s different than the one-to-many that broadcasting is, or even a newsletter is. It’s actually people feeling like they’re part of something bigger than themselves, that they’re part of a community.”
Goldberg and Low spoke Wednesday at a webinar sponsored by the New England chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists. The theme of the evening was survival. Earlier this summer the Republican-controlled Congress, acting at the behest of President Trump, eliminated the budget for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), a semi-independent agency that provided funding for PBS, NPR and local public television and radio stations.
Though public media outlets receive a majority of their funds from private grants, donations, and corporate underwriting, a number of stations — especially in rural areas and urban communities of color — were heavily dependent on CPB money and are now struggling to stay afloat. Earlier this week a consortium of foundations led by Knight, MacArthur, Ford and others announced an emergency grant of nearly $37 million to 115 stations that are at the highest risk of closure.
The irony is that even though national operations at PBS and NPR will suffer less than some of their member stations, studies such as a 2024 survey by the Pew Research Center show that local news outlets remain more trusted than national organizations, which have gotten hopelessly caught up in the partisanship that is tearing the country apart. Even as mainstream outlets attempt to reassure their audience that they are dedicated to fair, truth-telling journalism, critics rail that they are hopelessly biased.
These claims are especially loud on the right, as years of deriding sources such as The New York Times, The Washington Post and, yes, NPR and PBS as “fake news” have taken a toll. The latest survey from Pew, for instance, shows that 73% of Democrats and respondents who lean Democratic say that journalists’ role in society is “extremely” or “very” important, whereas only 45%  of Republicans and Republican leaners say the same.
Evidence suggests that robust community journalism can offset such polarization, with one study even showing that readers of a newspaper that eliminated national opinion content and replaced it with local commentary for just one month demonstrated a measurable decline in partisanship. Communities without reliable news and information suffer from lower voter turnout in local elections, fewer candidates running for office, and other civic ills. Yet local news is in crisis, with one recent study finding that there are 75% fewer journalists working in local news today than in 2007.
A thriving public media ecosystem could help solve the local news crisis and ease the partisan divide. Unfortunately, Trump and the MAGA movement want to move in the opposite direction.
Both GBH and WBUR produce a variety of national and local programming. Susan Goldberg noted Wednesday that GBH is the largest producer of national programming for PBS, and that the failure of local stations would harm GBH since they would no longer be able to pay for that programming.
“There are a lot of efforts under way to help stabilize the system,” she said, observing that PBS has cut member fees by 21 percent so that they are better able to pay for national programming. She added: “We’re going to have to make some hard decisions as well.”
Likewise, Margaret Low pointed out that WBUR produces two national programs, “On Point” and “Here & Now,” both of which are paid for by member stations. “We may have to make some tough decisions,” she said. “It’s serious. It’s not insurmountable…. It’s hard to know how serious that impact will be.”










A thriving public media ecosystem could help solve the local news crisis and ease the partisan divide. Unfortunately, Trump and the MAGA movement want to move in the opposite direction.


As Low and Goldberg said, though, it’s the connection with the local community that will determine whether public media rises or falls. Both outlets have robust news staffs and cover local and regional news as part of the national morning and afternoon newscasts.
Unfortunately, financial challenges that arose even before Trump’s second term have forced both outlets to make some painful cuts at the local level. ’BUR canceled its daily “Radio Boston” program last December. GBH-TV canceled all four of its public-affairs programs over the past several years (“Beat the Press with Emily Rooney,” “Great Boston,” “Talking Politics,” and “Basic Black”), though it has revived “Basic Black” as “GBH News Rooted” on digital and has plans to bring back “Greater Boston” in some form as well. GBH Radio also broadcasts four hours of local talk each day via “Boston Public Radio” and “The Culture Show” as well as an hour on Sundays with “Under the Radar with Callie Crossley.”
With no government funding to fall back on, such locally oriented programming, more than ever, is going to depend on viewers (and listeners) like us. Goldberg and Low said that their stations as well as public media throughout the system have experienced a heartening spike in giving since the CPB was defunded.
“We have a direct relationship to the audience. The fact that people give even though they don’t have to is astonishing,” Low said, adding: “As we anticipate the year ahead, if we could find 10,000 more donors and have everybody who gives give 10 percent more, that would cover it.”
Low told the story of a wealthy listener who had never given before and who donated $10,000. Some checking revealed “that he had capacity, as we gently like to say.” He was invited to visit WBUR, and he ended up giving $250,000. “Part of it is figuring out how to tell that different story so people feel motivated to support something that they actually love,” she said.
Goldberg, though, issued a caution.
“I don’t think that fundraising alone is going to solve what is going to be a structural problem,” she said. “Long term, it is pretty hard across the system to replace $1.1 billion, or $535 million each year, which is how much the CPB has given. So I do think that we need to think of other really creative ways, in addition to reaching out to audiences, to helping them understand our value. We’ve got to be better. We’ve got to be more clear about what our value proposition really is.”
Building community, encouraging civic engagement, and telling the stories of the people who live here need to be at the heart of that mission.

Credit: (Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)NEW ORLEANS – Corinne Green, a local trans activist and public policy analyst, went to a local Walgreens in June to pick up a refill of progesterone, a hormone she has been taking daily for several years. She was used to getting it for free since she enrolled in Medicaid in January 2024.
But when she got to the pharmacy, she learned that her medication was going to cost approximately $70.
But it wasn’t a surprise. Green had been expecting Medicaid — which is mostly federally funded but administered by the state — to stop covering her hormone replacement therapy, a common form of gender-affirming health care. For nearly a year, she and other trans advocates in Louisiana had heard about sudden, unexpected Medicaid denials from dozens of transgender people around the state.
Whatever happened, it wasn’t a change to Medicaid law. Earlier this year, Congress contemplated stripping gender-affirming care coverage as part of President Trump’s sweeping tax and spending bill, known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” But the provision didn’t make the final version passed by the Senate in early July.

State lawmakers over the past several years have passed a wave of anti-trans and anti-LGBTQIA+ legislation, including banning doctors from providing gender-affirming care to minors. So Green and other trans advocates had been watching the state legislature closely, anticipating movement to prohibit Medicaid from covering gender-affirming care for adults. That didn’t happen, either.
That likely meant that there had been an administrative change from the Louisiana Department of Health, which oversees Medicaid. But there had been no notice of any such change from the state department.
“The only way a lot of people are learning about this is that they’re going into the pharmacy to pick up their monthly or once every three months…regular prescriptions that they’ve been on for a long time, and just getting hit with a completely unexpected bill,” Green said. “Because there’s been no communication from the state about this.”
The Louisiana Department of Health did not respond to Verite News’ requests for comment on the denials of Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming care for adults and why the denials are happening. But LDH records reviewed by Verite show that the department has made changes to its Medicaid billing and diagnosis codes so that gender-affirming surgeries and hormone therapy are excluded from coverage. The changes appear to have started in August 2024.
As a result, people have been cancelling surgeries they’d been waiting years to get and trying to find other ways to afford their medications, Green told Verite News. Without coverage, these surgeries and medications can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars.
Nationally, between 20% and 25% of transgender adults are enrolled in Medicaid, according to recent estimates.
While there are no readily available data on how many transgender people in Louisiana are enrolled in the public insurance program, the state as a whole has the second highest share of Medicaid-enrolled residents, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation.
“Many trans people only have access to Medicaid coverage, I’m one of them. [It] definitely is very scary,” said Blu DiMarco, who works with the Queer and Trans Community Action Project. “It’s frightening to know that I could just, like, go to routinely pick up my medication, and they could be like, ‘Oh yeah, this is $200.’ I don’t have $200.”

Community care, collective rage
In response to the LDH policy change, the Trans Income Project, a New Orleans-based social services nonprofit, this month announced a partnership with CrescentCare, a clinic that primarily serves low-income residents. The Trans Income Project, on which Green serves as a board member, will cover the cost of medication used in hormone replacement therapy for Medicaid-eligible transgender adults. (Participants in the partnership have to get their medication from the Avita Pharmacy locations inside of CrescentCare’s Elysian Fields and Mid-City facilities.)
Natalie Rupp, executive director of the Trans Income Project, told Verite News that the organization “saw a serious need in the community” when they began hearing about people losing Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming care.
“We’re trying to make sure that those most vulnerable in our community aren’t going to be stuck with additional extra costs that they previously weren’t having to cover,” she said.
The program has been praised by other trans advocacy organizations in Louisiana as an example of people coming together to support those most in need and fight back against anti-transgender policies.
“It’s a really great show of community force and how community will take care of community, even when politicians aren’t taking care of community,” Peyton Rose Michelle, executive director of Louisiana Trans Advocates said.
Rupp said she hopes that healthcare providers and pharmacies in other parts of the state and country replicate the partnership at a time when governments are moving to limit access to gender-affirming care for trans and gender nonconforming people. Eleven other states already explicitly prohibit Medicaid from funding gender-affirming care for both adults and minors.
Although it’s located in New Orleans, Crescent Care serves transgender Louisianians throughout the state, so the hope is that people outside of the metropolitan area will be able to make use of the partnership as well. Michelle said that she knows people in Lafayette, where she lives, who use CrescentCare.
Still, it’s unlikely that the partnership will be able to cover everyone  who loses access to hormones as a result of the LDH coding changes, and there’s still the question of how people who need gender-affirming surgeries, which are not covered under the partnership, will afford that care.
“I think even the organizers of their beautiful plan to provide care via Avita,” Michelle said. “I think even those people understand this isn’t going to save everyone. It is just a band aid kind of solution that will only help a subset of people.”
In order to further raise awareness about the state’s decision to stop covering gender-affirming care through Medicaid and express anger about it, the Queer and Trans Community Action Project is holding a protest Saturday at New Orleans City Hall. The Louisiana Department of Health has an office about a block away on Poydras Street that protestors will march by. The march and rally starts at 5 p.m.
“I think that the issue is not very well-known, and I think that is a very important issue to note, even for people who aren’t queer or trans, because it’s kind of a larger indicator of Medicaid cuts,” DiMarco said. “If they can come for us, then how do you know that you’re not next?”

That means the $145 million Mississippi receives annually for special education is now at risk.","Mississippi isn’t ensuring special education students receive all the services they’re entitled to federally, according to the U.S. Department of Education. 
A recent report shows Mississippi failing to comply with federal special education requirements in 10 categories, including supervision of how well districts follow laws and by allowing people with suspect qualifications to conduct dispute resolution hearings. 
But nothing in the report was particularly surprising to longtime advocates and parents.
“People working with the system have been concerned Mississippi is not compliant,” said Danita Munday, a former Mississippi Department of Education employee turned advocate. “This is validation for what we have been saying for many years.”
The 47-page document outlines numerous areas of noncompliance with federal special education regulations in Mississippi. The overarching conclusion was that the state education agency has not been adequately overseeing districts and ensuring special education students are getting the education they’re entitled to by law. 
The violations cited include the state agency reporting invalid and unreliable data, poorly supervising how districts spend money on special education and inconsistently tracking disciplinary measures for students. The report said the agency lacks a system to ensure in a timely manner that districts are in compliance with federal standards. 
Without that system, Munday said the state education department is taking a Band-Aid approach to special education violations. 
“They’re stepping on bugs,” she said. “They’ve been finding out about noncompliance through complaints and writing corrective action plans to fix it for one child.” 
The report also notes a number of issues with Mississippi’s dispute resolution process. 
When parents feel their child’s rights have been violated, they have the right to complain. A structured process ensues, with timelines and corrective action plans. But the state’s model written complaint and due-process forms require more information than they’re required to ask for, including complainants’ home addresses and phone numbers. The forms also don’t note that people can file complaints against the state, not just their district. 
In the case of mediation, the report shows that Mississippi makes parents sign “confidentiality pledges” before any resolution has been reached. A spokesperson for the agency said that pledge has since been removed. 
Additionally, there’s little evidence to show that hearing officers, impartial people who help resolve disputes over special education services, are well-trained or qualified for their jobs in Mississippi, the federal investigation found. 
A spokesperson for the state education department said the agency “acknowledges advocates’ concerns and remains committed to better serving communities.”
Cassie Tolliver of Disability Rights Mississippi said the report should draw major concern. 
“Parents trust schools to do what’s right by their child, but that’s not always the case,” she said. “We need to ensure everyone knows how egregious this is. … They are failing them all around.”
The numerous violations have Mississippi out of compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the federal law guaranteeing disabled students the right to a free and appropriate public education.
In order to receive federal education funding, state agencies must hold districts accountable to the law. The violations mean the $145 million Mississippi receives annually for special education is now at risk.
That’s a reality that was acknowledged by top education officials at Thursday’s state board of education meeting, as well as the state’s longtime struggle to adequately serve its students with special needs. 
“We’ve been out of compliance for many years,” said Lance Evans, the state education superintendent. “We want to get this fixed. We’re addressing it and moving forward very aggressively.”
The report, released last month along with reviews of nine other states, calls for the Mississippi Department of Education to make corrective changes — some within a few months, and others within a year. According to the spokesperson, the agency has already begun rectifying the shortcomings identified in the report. 
Joy Hogge, executive director of Families as Allies, estimated that 95% of the calls her organization receives are from parents who need help getting their kids’ educational needs met. She said those problems are the very ones highlighted in the report. 
“Every one of those calls represents a very real child who has every right to learn,” she said. “It’s incredibly widespread and devastating when it’s not addressed.
“It’s validating to see this all written down, but the real proof is going to be if anything happens — what changes are made and what is the state held accountable for.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/29120532/No-faces-1.jpg,,,2025-08-22 06:56:28.146544

Santiago/Getty Images)The West Virginia Chamber of Commerce has garnered much media and lawmaker attention recently with a press release decrying the state’s jobs numbers. While they are right that the numbers are lackluster, West Virginia’s flagging economic landscape is not a recent phenomenon. 
West Virginia had the ninth worst job growth of any state coming out of the pandemic with 1.1% growth between February 2020 and July 2025 (the nation has seen a 4.8% increase over that period). West Virginia’s disappointing economic and jobs numbers over the last several years should be seen as a final nail in the coffin for corporate-first policies that fail to prioritize workers, small businesses, and infrastructure investments statewide. West Virginia needs to invest in a 55-county strategy to spur opportunity from Weirton to War.
In recent years, much of the state’s economic development strategy has focused on offering business tax incentives to big corporations to locate in West Virginia alongside enacting deep tax cuts to make the state more “appealing” to businesses. These efforts have yet to move the needle on economic and jobs’ growth while coming with great opportunity costs.
West Virginia has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on business tax incentives in recent years through tax abatements, tax credits and cash handouts. A leading researcher on tax incentives, Tim Bartik, has identified why they are a costly and ineffective approach, particularly in places like West Virginia with large parts of the state made up of economically distressed areas. 
First, the big corporations lured by business tax incentives are unlikely to locate in the places that need them most. Of the “top investments” touted by the West Virginia Development Office in their 2022 and 2023  annual reports, 71% located in a border county and 80% in a county with a higher median household income than the statewide average. 
Second, business tax incentives have the highest cost-per-job of any economic development strategy, coming in at a whopping $436,000 per job on average. And these high costs for taxpayers result in little benefit for West Virginia workers, as state officials have failed to include local hiring provisions and strong wage requirements in the agreements. 
To summarize, business tax incentives largely help big corporations subsidize out-of-state workers, cost much more than other economic development strategies and concentrate economic growth in places that are already doing well.
Since 2023, West Virginia has also enacted $1 billion in tax cuts, two-thirds of which benefited the top 20% of earners in the state. While the promised jobs boom and sales tax growth have failed to materialize, the state has significantly reduced its spending on Medicaid, child care assistance, education and PEIA. This has undoubtedly cost residents jobs, as it has resulted in fewer child care slots, the lowest teacher pay in the country and shuttered community schools with the impacts most concentrated in rural places. Moreover, the foregone revenue from those tax cuts could have helped the state invest in infrastructure and other necessities in struggling parts of our state.
Instead of continuing to give away our tax dollars to corporations and the state’s wealthiest households, West Virginia can invest in an economic strategy that strengthens supports for workers, invests in our communities, and spurs job opportunities even in economically distressed places. West Virginia policymakers can take a people-first approach that prioritizes more cost-effective business development strategies alongside a commitment to public investments and infrastructure improvements in all corners of the state.
Targeted job creation programs like those operated by the Coalfield Development Corporation and the Small Business Development Center can be scaled up along with investments in place-based customized job training, union apprenticeship programs, business incubators and site-ready infrastructure development whose cost-per-job is a fraction of that of business tax incentives and can be targeted to distressed areas.
And those targeted efforts on the business side must be paired with robust investments in the communities that need it most. Prioritizing taxpayer dollars into public transportation, affordable child care, high quality community schools and on-the-job training programs can help increase employment rates at a reasonable cost-per-job while making our residents more workforce ready.
Basic infrastructure needs must be met to ensure all West Virginians have safe roads and bridges, clean drinking water and resilient infrastructure. In 2025, it’s unconscionable for any community to lack these basics. Combined, these efforts can effectively target distressed places by creating jobs in addition to providing the supports people need to be successful in the workforce while remaining in the communities they love. If we continue to let corporations decide where our investments should go, too many West Virginians will be left behind and our jobs numbers in vast swaths of the state will remain disappointing.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by David Stephenson)In a matter of a few days, nearly $1,000 has been donated to the Shelby County Public Library to replace 16 LGBTQ+ books a local church had recommended to check out and never return.
“The response to the missing books has been overwhelming and mostly positive for the library,” said Pamela W. Federspiel, the library’s executive director, on Thursday. “We will use the donated money to replace the books and buy more like them.”
Theft or civil disobedience?

The Kentucky Lantern reported Aug. 18 that three leaders of the Reformation Church of Shelbyville urged its members to remove books from the Shelby County Public Library by checking them out and never returning them. The books portray gay characters and historical figures or explore LGBTQ+ themes.
The  church  leaders — pastors Jerry Dorris and Tanner Cartwright and Austin Keeler, an evangelist with the church mission, Reformation Frontline Missions — defended what they call an “act of civil disobedience.”
But librarian Federspiel said the action is tantamount to “stealing.” She contacted a collection agency to retrieve the books but so far it has not been successful.
The library has “lost” 16 books valued at $410.85 since a member of the church checked them out with due dates in late June 2024. Neither Federspiel nor the church leaders have identified the library patron.
“Since the story came out, people have made almost $1,000 in donations to replace the books,” Federspiel said.  “One anonymous donor gave $500, and we hear more may be coming.”
The Shelby County Democratic Party has encouraged its members to donate money to the library. In an email this week, the political party said the Reformation Church of Shelbyville “seems to believe it can remove books from the local library and not return them on purpose (at the direction of their pastor) because they have decided for all of Shelby County that some of the content should not be available for reading or even in our library.
“Is this ‘civil disobedience’ as claimed or is it theft?”
The party asks people to help the library replace the missing books by donating through shelbydemocrats.org and marking the contribution for “Books.”

Asked what the library would do if the new books are checked out again and not returned, Federspiel said she is talking to a lawyer about what precautions to take.
Asked if he would still urge removal of new books the library uses as replacements, Dorris said, “I am just an individual Christian.  I will keep on saying what I think should be done.”
Dorris posted on Facebook that the removal of the books “is not theft — it is civil disobedience rooted in God’s law, carried out in love for our neighbor and aimed at protecting children.”  He called the books in question “groomer material.”
He claims that under Kentucky law, failure to return a library book is not prosecuted as theft but handled as a civil matter, with fines, collection notices or suspension of borrowing privileges. 
“This is not grand larceny — it is treated like an unpaid bill. By man’s law, and more importantly by God’s, it does not belong in the category of theft,” he said.
A Kentucky law addressing failure to return a library record classifies it as a civil matter.
“The law deals with civil liability but not any criminal defense,” Dorris said.
Shelby County Attorney Carrie McIntyre was asked by the Kentucky Lantern if she is investigating the missing books and trying to determine whether any law was broken.
She said she looks forward to answering the questions when she has time to give them appropriate consideration. She said she now is covering court while her assistants attend a prosecutors’ conference in Lexington.
Dorris, who said he has received one death threat and many vitriolic emails and comments for his stance, noted that some of his critics are using the biblical commandment “Thou shalt not steal” to attack him. 
“Many who cheered riots and looting now clutch the Ten Commandments to condemn us for suggesting vile books be removed from libraries. Their sudden zeal for “Thou shalt not steal” is not love for God’s law — but hatred of it, wielded to defend perversion,” he said.
“When Christians check out such materials and refuse to return them, they are not stealing private possessions but resisting the misuse of common funds for wicked purposes,” he said.
The controversy has created a social media frenzy and has garnered national attention from various Christian, atheist and gay organizations and news outlets.

Facing growing pressure from advocacy groups, lawsuits and climate projections that show hotter days ahead, some state prison systems are moving to install air conditioning and expand cooling measures — though many facilities remain years away from significant upgrades.
But in other states, such efforts have stalled or failed. That may lead to more lawsuits in the future, experts say, even as judges may raise the bar for such cases.
An emphasis on being “tough on crime” and prioritizing other public safety measures may have contributed to less attention on prison conditions in some states. In others, slowing revenue growth and pressure to rein in corrections spending could be making new investments a harder sell.

 Climate control in Arkansas prisons
Arkansas prison have had air conditioning since the 1970s, according to a 2016 Time magazine article.
Rand Champion, a Department of Corrections spokesperson, confirmed Thursday that all state prisons have heat and air conditioning, though some units that house punitive-status inmates have forced-air circulation for cooling.
The air cooling system at the East Central Arkansas Community Correctional Center in West Memphis broke down last week and took several days to repair, according to news reports. Champion said Thursday that the facility’s climate control system has been repaired.

At least two states this year, Virginia and Texas, considered legislation addressing excessive heat in prisons but neither measure became law. The Texas bill would have required the state Department of Criminal Justice to purchase and install climate control systems in all of its facilities by the end of 2032. About two-thirds of the state’s correctional facilities have only partial or no air conditioning.
The measure passed the House but did not advance in the Senate before the legislature adjourned in June.
In Virginia, lawmakers approved a bill that would have required the state corrections department to install heat and air conditioning in its prisons and to ensure cell temperatures not exceed 80 degrees. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed it, citing the cost of installation and operational burdens. Youngkin also wrote that existing state corrections data “does not substantiate the claims of extreme temperatures or health risks.”
But in Delaware, the fiscal year 2026 capital budget approved last month includes $2 million in funding to install air conditioning at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center.
These changes mark the latest actions in a long-running debate over how correctional systems respond to rising summer temperatures — an issue that affects both incarcerated people and staff. Some of the policy debates and facility updates this year follow years of advocacy and litigation over the health, safety and operational challenges posed by heat in correctional settings.

The problem of excessive heat in prisons has persisted for decades and has unfolded alongside other challenges, including chronic understaffing and overcrowding. In some cases, these problems have led to extended facility lockdowns, even during the summer months.
“There are people working in prisons, and they have the right to work in climates that are comfortable,” said Nancy La Vigne, a criminal justice researcher and dean of the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University. “When they’re not, there’s retention issues, and it’s hard to replace staff. And when you don’t replace staff, then you have challenges in maintaining the safety and security of the facility.”
In New York, for example, correctional officers staged a three-week strike earlier this year and many didn’t return to work. Some facilities now are operating with 30%-60% fewer guards than needed, resulting in some incarcerated people getting only an hour or two outside of their cells each day.
A 2023 study published in the peer-reviewed PLOS One journal found that mortality in state and private prisons rose during periods of extreme heat, with deaths increasing 3.5% on extreme heat days and up to 7.4% during three-day heat waves. Between 2001 and 2019, nearly 13,000 people died in prison during the summer months, almost half of them in the South, though the study did not determine how many of those deaths were directly attributable to heat.
Climate change is fueling longer, more intense periods of extreme heat. Exposure to extreme heat can worsen conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and asthma, and has also been linked to worsening mental health and higher suicide rates among incarcerated people.
“Average temperatures are rising, and you’re going to have more and more states around the country where incarcerated people are held in conditions that are not livable because they’re too hot,” said Sharon Dolovich, a law professor and director of the Prison Law and Policy Program at the University of California, Los Angeles.
 Some upgrades

At least 44 states lack universal air conditioning within their prison facilities, even in regions known for sweltering summer temperatures, according to a 2022 USA Today analysis. A recent Reuters investigation also found that nearly half of state prisons across 29 states have partial or no air conditioning in housing units.
But some states are investing millions to update their prison facilities.
In North Carolina, corrections officials are working toward their goal of installing air conditioning in all 54 state prisons by 2026. To date, 33 facilities are fully air-conditioned, 17 are partially air-conditioned, and four have no air conditioning, according to its dashboard.
In California, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, which operates 31 adult prisons, has spent $246 million in the past five years on cooling improvements at five prisons, according to a department spokesperson.
Lawmakers this year also approved funding for the Air Cooling Pilot Program at three facilities, with $17.6 million allocated for fiscal years 2025-26 and $20 million for fiscal years 2026-27. It will evaluate the effectiveness of two alternatives prior to a statewide plan to address high indoor temperatures across the California prison system.

The Texas Department of Criminal Justice, as of Aug. 1, is building 12,827 “cool beds,” or prison cells in air-conditioned units, and is in the process of procuring an additional 7,162, according to its dashboard.
Texas is one of the states most closely associated with heat-related deaths in prison. A 2022 study estimated that, on average, 14 deaths per year in Texas prisons are associated with heat. And a Texas Tribune analysis found that at least 41 incarcerated people died during a record-breaking heat wave in 2023.
In March, a federal judge ruled the extreme heat in Texas prisons is “plainly unconstitutional,” but declined to order immediate air conditioning, saying the work could not be completed within the court order’s 90-day window and temporary systems might delay a permanent fix.
 ‘More miserable’

Sweltering summer heat can turn prisons into pressure cookers. People inside already may have health conditions, limited access to cooling, or take medications that make it harder for their bodies to handle the heat. And research suggests that high temperatures can heighten irritability and aggression, sometimes fueling more conflicts between incarcerated people or with staff.
“It makes you more miserable. … If you to the point of even thinking about suicide, that’s just going to add to it,” said Ronald McKeithen, who spent 37 years incarcerated in Alabama prisons and is now the director of second chances at the Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice. McKeithen recalls feeling “on edge” due to tension among other incarcerated people on hot days.
At the Oshkosh Correctional Institution in Wisconsin, Devin Skrzypchak said the heat worsens his bladder condition, and he often can’t get the incontinence briefs he needs. The heat forces him to drink more water, and on days when ice isn’t available, he’s left drenched in sweat.
“At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating,” Skrzypchak wrote in a message to Stateline through the facility’s messaging platform.










At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating.


– Devin Skrzypchak, who is incarcerated at Oshkosh Correctional Institution in Wisconsin


D’Angelo Lee Komanekin — who has spent about 25 years in and out of different Wisconsin corrections facilities — said prison architecture plays a major role in why temperatures inside climb so high.
“The planet is getting hotter and hotter,” said Komanekin, who relies on a small plastic fan to stay cool. Komanekin also is incarcerated at the Oshkosh Correctional Institution. “They’re doing nothing about the architecture. Some institutions’ windows open, some don’t, but most of the doors have steel doors with trap doors.”
Older prison designs that rely heavily on steel and concrete building materials often trap heat, making it difficult to keep temperatures down in the summer. Aging facilities also are less likely to be equipped for the installation of central air conditioning.
Some state prison systems, including Alabama’s and Wisconsin’s, are adding air-conditioning or air-tempering systems to new prison construction and major renovation projects.
 Future legal battles

Legal experts say the issue of excessive heat in prisons is likely to become more pressing as climate change drives longer and hotter summers.
Extreme heat in correctional facilities has already been the subject of litigation in dozens of states, with plaintiffs arguing that high temperatures constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Court rulings in these cases have varied, but some experts say even more lawsuits are likely if facilities do not adapt.
“The conditions are going to worsen. [Incarcerated people are] going to be looking for every possible avenue for assistance they can,” Dolovich, the UCLA law professor, told Stateline.

One of the latest cases comes from Missouri, where the nonprofit law firm MacArthur Justice Center filed a class-action lawsuit in May on behalf of six incarcerated people at Algoa Correctional Center.
The lawsuit alleges that the conditions violate their constitutional rights under the Eighth Amendment. It seeks to require the Missouri Department of Corrections to work with experts to develop a heat mitigation plan that keeps housing unit temperatures between 65 and 85 degrees. If the department cannot meet that standard, the plaintiffs are asking for the release of three of the incarcerated people who have less than a year remaining on their sentences.
Lawsuits such as the Missouri case often focus on claims that extreme heat worsens existing medical problems. To proceed, they must meet two legal requirements: proving the heat poses a serious health or safety risk, and showing prison officials knew about the danger but failed to address it, according to Dolovich, whose work has focused on the Eighth Amendment and prison conditions.
Courts may also raise the bar for proving such claims if judges echo decisions in cases with similar Eight Amendment arguments related to the death penalty and homelessness, Dolovich said. Judges have shifted, she said, toward a “superadding terror, pain and disgrace” standard under the Eighth Amendment — a higher threshold requiring proof that conditions were created with the intent to cause unnecessary suffering.
Dolovich added that some recent court decisions have provided only narrow remedies, such as ordering ice and fans instead of installing air conditioning.
“Prison officials have a moral and a constitutional responsibility to respond to changing conditions. In this case, it means air conditioning. … Anything less than that, to me, is indefensible.” she said.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Abbey Cutrer)If child care were more available and affordable in the state, around 16,000-28,000 people could join or rejoin the workforce and that could add around $600 million, conservatively, to the economy, the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce estimates.  
The estimate comes from a report released Thursday, which analyzed the economic impact of more affordable child care in Kentucky. 
“Even under conservative assumptions, the report’s upper-bound economic impact estimates range from $599.9 million to $1.097 billion annually in new wages, sales tax revenues and income tax revenues for Kentucky,” the report says. 
This report does not include potential savings in the form of people no longer needing Medicaid or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as SNAP. Charles Aull, the vice president of policy for the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, said those points were too full of variables to confidently estimate the impact. 
The goal with the report was to show a conservative estimate based on rigorous data of what a more robust child care landscape would mean for Kentucky, Aull said. 
  Charles Aull
“It’s been, I think, fairly intuitive for most people at this point, that there’s a connection between the ability of parents to participate in the workforce and child care,” he said. “What hadn’t really happened so far was an effort to try to fully quantify that in a really rigorous way. And so that’s essentially what we wanted to provide with this report, was to take a really rigorous methodology, be very conservative in our approaches, be very cautious in our approaches, and try to estimate: ‘okay, if we can make child care more accessible and make it reasonably more affordable, what are the actual labor market outcomes?’” 
The numbers the chamber came up with are based on survey data and academic research and point back to recommendations made by the chamber in May for how Kentucky can improve its child care landscape. 
In 2024, a survey of 1,357 parents from 88 Kentucky counties showed that some parents had already chosen to exit the workforce because of inaccessible child care. Many families put off having more children, delayed big purchases and sacrificed health care needs because of child care complications, the Lantern previously reported. 
Meanwhile, Kentucky’s workforce participation is among the lowest in the nation. Of its neighboring states, Kentucky is higher only than West Virginia, and tied with Tennessee at nearly 81%, among adults 25-54.

Gender and geography 
If child care costs were reduced by $200 per month, around 6,000 married mothers could enter the workforce, based on survey data in the report. Academic research is a bit more conservative, estimating the number of married mothers who could enter or re-enter the workforce is around 4,000. 
At that same cost reduction per month, the report shows:

Nearly 1,700 single mothers currently not in the workforce could be employed. 
Nearly 2,800 married fathers currently not in the workforce could be employed. 
Nearly 700 single fathers currently not in the workforce could be employed. 

Models in the report show a correlation between the decrease in cost of child care and the increase in the number of parents entering or reentering the workforce. If child care were reduced $350 per month, between 11,300 and 19,900 workers could enter the workforce. If it were $500 less expensive, that workforce range is around 16,000 to 28,000. 
Child care, at the county level, costs between $5,000 and $13,000 every year, Aull said, though it varies by location, the child’s age and the type of center.
The gap between mothers and fathers in these estimates “likely goes back to all sorts of historical, cultural issues that have just been a part of society for a long time.” 
In general, mothers are more likely to step away from the workforce to care for a child, he said. 
Still, Aull said, “this isn’t something that just exclusively affects mothers. There (are) a number of different fathers that are sitting outside the labor market that could also come into the workforce in the event that child care (becomes) more available, but it is certainly heavily skewed toward impact on mothers.” 
 Models in the report show a correlation between the decrease in cost of child care and the increase in the number of parents entering or reentering the workforce. (Screenshot)
The report also breaks the economic impact of more affordable and accessible child care down by region in Kentucky. 
“There may be an assumption that this is something that would primarily affect our urban areas,” Aull said. “What the study actually showed is that the impacts are generally the largest in some of our rural communities.” 
Eastern Kentucky is especially well-positioned to see more workforce participation in response to child care availability, according to the report. 
“That is actually where we have some of the largest impact estimates, and that is likely due to larger numbers of non-working, non-looking for work parents in those areas,” Aull said. “But I think the importance of this is that it illustrates that the real economic impacts and the workforce impacts of increasing access to affordable child care is something that’s really spread out all across the state, and not confined just to our urban areas, but is very much something that will positively impact our rural areas.” 
  The report breaks the economic impact of more affordable and accessible child care down by region in Kentucky. (Screenshot)
Eyes to Frankfort 
During the 2026 legislative session, the General Assembly will pass a new state budget. In order to have a successful child care landscape, the state needs both public dollars and private partnerships, Aull said. 
“Without a doubt … this is going to require public investment,” he said, though he didn’t yet have an estimate of how much the legislature would need to include in the budget for it in 2026.  
“Making sure that we have a really strong low-income subsidy system for those low- income working families, making sure that we have mechanisms to reduce cost for middle income families, making sure we have an appropriate regulatory landscape, making sure that there’s opportunities out there for child care providers to expand into sort of nontraditional areas (and) be able to expand into rural areas, making sure that communities are activated, making sure that employers are activated” will all be important, Aull said. “And of course, something that we think is extremely important in this conversation is good, high quality data, so that we know exactly where there’s a need for child care, where there’s a demand, where it’s lacking.” 
This kind of big impact can’t happen quickly, Aull said. 
“This is not something that’s going to get solved overnight. We’re not going to be able to pull in that many workers in one legislative session. But the sooner we can start laying the foundation for that, the sooner we can get to that point where we can start bringing more of these parents into the workforce — if they want to join the workforce, and if they want to go and do the types of things we talk about in this report.” 
The chamber will also be “pushing” lawmakers to “continue really important programs, such as free child care for child care workers,” Aull said. 
At the same time, he said, “we need to start laying the foundations for actions in the future.”

(Bryan Clifton for UAMS)A network of Arkansas maternal health experts and advocates is encouraging birthing hospitals throughout the state to participate in a postpartum health initiative.
The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences highlighted the Arkansas Perinatal Quality Collaborative’s “Postpartum Comprehensive Assessment, Resources and Education (CARE)” program in a Thursday news release. The collaborative’s cofounders are Dr. William “Sam” Greenfield, a UAMS obstetrics and gynecology professor, and Jennifer Callaghan-Koru, a UAMS public health professor.
The CARE project “will support birthing hospitals to improve education and screenings for women before they are discharged from the hospital after birth,” UAMS’ news release states.
Arkansas has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the nation and the third-highest infant mortality rate, according to the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement. Maternal mortality is measured by the rate at which women die during childbirth or within a year of giving birth.
“By proactively addressing the postpartum health needs of new moms, we can prevent deaths and hospital readmissions,” Greenfield said in the news release.
Participating hospitals will receive “free staff training, clinical tools and presentations from national experts” to improve their postnatal care capacity, the release states.
The CARE initiative will “strengthen follow-up care, better screen and support new moms’ physical and mental health, and build the community connections that make recovery safer and more sustainable for families,” Michelle Pimentel, director of nursing for women’s and infant’s health at Conway Regional Medical Center, said in the news release.

Conway Regional Health System was among 20 birthing hospitals throughout Arkansas that the Perinatal Quality Collaborative recognized for reducing rates of cesarean section births. Cesarean births can increase the risk of postpartum complications.
Besides Conway Regional, the other hospital systems awarded the collaborative’s platinum banner are:

Arkansas Methodist Medical Center in Paragould
Baptist Health in Arkadelphia

The systems awarded the collaborative’s silver banner are:

Baptist Health in North Little Rock
Baptist Health in Stuttgart
Great River Medical Center in Blytheville
Jefferson Regional Medical Center in Pine Bluff
National Park Medical Center in Hot Springs

The 20 awarded facilities represent a majority of Arkansas’ birthing hospitals. Only 33 hospitals in 22 of Arkansas’ 75 counties have labor and delivery units, and six maternity wards have closed since 2020.
Arkansas ranks sixth in terms of states with the highest percentage of maternity care deserts, according to the March of Dimes, which defines maternity care deserts as areas with no birthing facility or obstetric clinician. Nearly 51% of Arkansas is a maternity care desert, according to the organization’s 2024 report.

(Photo courtesy of Richmond International Airport)Virginia is set to receive more than $48 million in federal funding to upgrade infrastructure at 18 airports, part of a nationwide effort to modernize air travel hubs and boost local economies.
The money, awarded through the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Aviation Administration, will fund construction projects ranging from runway rehabilitation to new hangars and improved lighting. The funding is made possible in part by the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
“These investments will help ensure that our airports are a safe, reliable engine of connectivity and economic growth for travelers and communities around the commonwealth,” said U.S. Sens. Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine, D-Va., in a joint statement. 
“We’re going to keep doing all that we can to bring additional infrastructure investments to Virginia, and to reauthorize the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that makes many of them possible.”
The largest awards include $7.2 million for new lighting and a taxiway shift at Winchester Regional Airport, $6.8 million to reconstruct taxiways at Washington Dulles International Airport, and $5.2 million to rehabilitate the runway at Virginia Highlands Airport. 
Other major projects include $4.9 million for runway rehabilitation at Leesburg Executive Airport and $4.7 million to improve the general aviation apron at Newport News-Williamsburg Airport.
Additional funding will support taxiway shifts at Blue Ridge Airport, new hangar construction and runway extensions at Twin County Airport, and a runway extension at Richmond Executive/Chesterfield County Airport. Norfolk International Airport will see $1.6 million to reconstruct a terminal entrance road, while Accomack County Airport will receive $1.4 million for a new taxiway and lighting. 
Smaller projects include hangar development at Mountain Empire, Danville Regional, Emporia-Greensville, and Tazewell County airports; a fuel farm expansion at Hampton Roads Executive Airport; apron improvements at Richmond International Airport; a taxiway update at Suffolk Executive Airport; and rehabilitation work at Front Royal-Warren County Airport.
The announcement follows a string of federal awards directed to Virginia airports over the past year. 
Just last month, Warner and Kaine announced more than $21 million for improvements at 10 airports, including runway rehabilitation in Roanoke and updated lighting systems in Southwest Virginia. In October 2024, they rolled out nearly $57 million in federal funding for revitalization efforts. 
The pace of investment reflects a broader push to modernize Virginia’s aviation system, which includes more than 60 public-use airports ranging from major commercial hubs to small general aviation fields. Federal officials and state lawmakers alike have noted that many facilities — particularly in rural areas — require extensive upgrades to meet safety standards and accommodate future growth.
Airports are more than transit points; they are economic engines. A recent Virginia Department of Aviation study found that the state’s airport system supports more than 146,000 jobs and generates over $23 billion in economic activity annually. 
Improvements to infrastructure are expected to help sustain that impact, particularly as the state competes for tourism, business development, and federal contracts tied to military and defense sectors.
Politically, the investments highlight the dividends of the infrastructure law, a landmark $1.2 trillion piece of legislation passed with backing from Warner and Kaine. The law has funded not only airport upgrades, but also broadband expansion, highway projects, and public transit improvements across Virginia. The senators have made a point of underscoring those returns as Congress debates reauthorization.
Warner and Kaine, both members of key Senate committees, have also framed these airport investments as part of a broader commitment to ensuring rural regions don’t get left behind. While Dulles and Richmond International draw the most passenger traffic, small and regional airports often provide critical services for medevac flights, business travel, and military operations.
For Virginia travelers, most of the changes won’t be immediately visible, but the improvements are designed to set up airports for long-term growth. As Kaine and Warner put it, “These investments will help ensure that our airports are a safe, reliable engine of connectivity and economic growth.”

The report, released this month by the advocacy group Protect Our Care, estimates that more than 330 hospitals nationwide — including Aroostook Medical Center in Presque Isle and Maine Coast Memorial Hospital in Ellsworth — are at immediate risk of shutting down due to reductions in Medicaid funding included in congressional Republicans’ tax law signed by President Donald Trump on July 4. That will mean significant job cuts, longer wait times, and an overall increase in health care costs, including for people not on Medicaid, according to the report. Another 400 facilities are considered vulnerable.
Maine hospitals could lose more than $66 million annually in revenue as a result of the Medicaid cuts, according to previously released analyses from Families USA and think tank Third Way. In addition to the Ellsworth hospital, those other studies identified Northern Light A.R. Gould Hospital in Presque Isle, Cary Medical Center in Caribou, and Calais Community Hospital as especially vulnerable due to persistent operating losses and heavy reliance on Medicaid revenue.
In rural states with hospitals already closing, health care leaders have emphasized that the threat is particularly acute. Nearly half of Maine’s 24 rural hospitals are considered “at risk” of closing, according to a separate analysis by the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform. Such closures will impact the local community and economy, the report noted.
Nationally, hospitals employ roughly 10% of all workers in rural counties that report having any hospital employment, the Protect Our Care report said. When rural hospitals close, communities can lose a staggering number of jobs. One rural hospital closure can eliminate 220 jobs immediately, the report said.
The closures would further compound an already shrinking health care network. Since 2020, five hospitals in Maine have shut down their labor and delivery units, leaving expectant mothers in wide swaths of the state without local maternity care. Waldo Hospital in Belfast, Houlton Regional Hospital, Mount Desert Island Hospital in Bar Harbor, and Northern Light Inland Hospital in Waterville all ended maternity services in 2025 alone.
The report specifically called out congressional Republicans for “pulling the plug on entire communities’ access to care.” 
The new law included more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, which advocates say is the largest rollback of the program in its history. While the legislation provides $50 billion in rural health aid over six years, experts say that funding falls far short of offsetting the losses.
U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, who was one of just three Republican senators to vote against the package, cited its effect on rural hospitals when announcing her opposition. However, Maine Democratic leaders have criticized Collins for voting to advance the measure. Maine Democratic Party Executive Director Devon Murphy-Anderson said during a recent press event, “she has cost us our health care. She has cost us freedom. She has cost us the representation that we as Mainers and as Americans deserve.”
If closures accelerate, rural Mainers could face long drives to reach critical care. Advocates have warned that without intervention, Maine’s fragile hospital system may not be able to sustain the services communities depend on.

(Photo courtesy Virginia Natural Gas)The State Corporation Commission is taking extra time to sift through public feedback before deciding whether Virginia Natural Gas (VNG) can move forward with a $90 million compressor station planned near a historically Black neighborhood in Chesapeake.
The project is designed to prevent pressure drops in gas lines during periods of peak demand, typically on the coldest winter days. The proposed two-story, warehouse-style facility would use an electric motor to push additional gas into service areas farther from the pipelines. No new pipelines would be required, and the facility would sit on existing VNG property on Bainbridge Boulevard and South Military Highway.
“We continue to add 1000s of customers each year across our footprint. That means more demand, more gas being drawn off of the system. We have to make sure that we have the appropriate infrastructure in place to keep it reliable,” said Ken Yagelski, the company’s gas supply director. 
At a mid-August SCC hearing, residents and advocates raised concerns about expanding fossil fuel infrastructure, the risk of pipeline leaks, and the rezoning of nearby residential land for industrial use. That rezoning, which drew particular frustration, required two separate Chesapeake City Council votes to pass.
“They are trying to put this project next to homes of a Black community and a poor community, and this is a region that is already vulnerable to climate change,” said Zander Pellegrino, Virginia field manager for Chesapeake Climate Action Network. “Residents are concerned about what their future holds and locking us into more fossil fuel production cannot be the solution right now.”
The property has long been within Virginia Natural Gas’s fenceline, used for more than 60 years despite being zoned residential. Company officials argue that relocating the compressor could require building new pipelines, which neighbors also oppose.
“It was a property we were already utilizing. I think they’re concerned about the prospects of an industrial facility that’s in the region and again. A lot of that angst, I think, might be a little bit misplaced, because of their misunderstanding of what the facility is,” Yagelski said.
The Chesapeake Climate Action Network, which has been heavily involved in the community, argued the project would primarily benefit corporate customers seeking guaranteed supply. Smurfit Westrock, a paper manufacturer, is listed in the SCC filing as requesting higher volumes of gas. Pellegrino said it is unfair for residents to shoulder the cost of infrastructure built for large industrial users. 
VNG says the facility will have no emissions since the motor is electric and does not burn gas. The compressor is expected to operate only about 20 days a year. But residents noted at the hearing that the site’s existing propane plant and flare are slated for retirement in 2026 —  and they don’t want new industrial activity replacing it. 
“It’s not just about the total threshold that this project adds. It’s about the cumulative impact that this community is facing,” Pellegrino said.
The SCC will compile a report on the public comments. VNG will have two weeks to respond before regulators issue a final decision on whether the project can proceed.

The latest assault against compassion and acceptance comes by way of the U.S. Department of Education, which said last week it would pull federal funding from five Northern Virginia school divisions.
The alleged transgression? Officials said the K-12 leadership in the city of Alexandria city and Fairfax, Arlington, Prince William and Loudoun counties wouldn’t comply with a request to change policies that support transgender students. The contested policies are designed to allow transgender students to use restrooms, locker rooms and facilities that match their gender identity, The Washington Post reported.
Statements from the jurisdictions said their policies were consistent with state and federal laws. These divisions support students struggling for acceptance and trying to live their true selves. The administration doesn’t. It values cruelty above all (see: treatment of suspected illegal immigrants).
The Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law says 18,200 children ages 13 to 17 in Virginia identify as transgender. The attack against the Northern Virginia school divisions is typical of the punitive, spiteful Trump administration: Stoke fear. Target a minority group. Threaten funding. Rinse. Repeat.
Virginia legislators and nonprofits are grappling with the upcoming federal cuts to food stamps, Medicaid and other programs that poor people in society depend on. A bipartisan Virginia House of Delegates emergency panel heard reports last week from staffers about the financial impact to the commonwealth.
Neither the state nor charitable organizations can fully reverse the callousness that President Trump’s One Small-Minded, Ugly Bill has unleashed. The tax-and-spending measure that he signed into law also increases the debt by trillions of dollars – which GOP fiscal hawks in Congress conveniently overlooked.
Shame on the Republican congresspeople from Virginia who chose fealty to Trump – and their political future – over their constituents. And shame on me for thinking Rep. Rob Wittman, a Westmoreland Republican who ultimately voted for this monstrosity after expressing reservations, would put Virginians over party.
There’s great news for Diamond Johnson, the Norfolk State University graduate and basketball star. She’s caught on with a professional team in China, after the Minnesota Lynx of the WNBA released her before that season started.
Johnson signed a contract with Hefei of the Women’s Chinese Basketball Association, the top  pro league in the country. She’ll play in the league’s Group B division. Her season starts in November. Johnson graduated from NSU this spring, and I wrote about her bid to make the rare leap from a historically black university to the WNBA. She earned the Most Valuable Player award in a post-season all-star game.
Congrats to her.

More NSU sports: City of Norfolk and public transit officials are alerting football game day attendees about a useful option. Fans can park in a few city-owned lots for free and catch NSU buses or hop on The Tide light rail, also for free, to reach the 30,000-seat on-campus stadium. It can be a congested sojourn otherwise.
It’s the first time Hampton Roads Transit and the city have done this for NSU football games. Call it the Michael Vick effect. The former NFL star will make his coaching debut at home Aug. 28 against Towson University in a nationally televised game on ESPN.
You see it every week: People killing Virginians by gunfire, often for the most absurd or needless reasons. This includes the slaying of Kiersten Renee Moore, 32, in Portsmouth, on Aug. 8.
Her supposed “offense”? Police said she had gone outside around 1:20 a.m. to ask a neighbor to keep the music down. That man instead shot and killed her. Police said that as they headed to the scene, they noticed a car fitting a description of the suspect’s vehicle, which crashed into a parked vehicle. The 33-year-old man apparently shot and killed himself, Portsmouth police said.
Moore worked at LifeStance Health, a mental healthcare company. Her linkedin profile said she started there in September. “Kiersten was a beloved member of our Suffolk team and an exceptional therapist who was highly dedicated to her clients,” a LifeStance spokesperson told me by email Wednesday. “Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with Kiersten’s family and friends during this difficult time.”
The killing was senseless. I wish people wouldn’t use firearms to settle disputes, showing such disdain for others. Two lives were lost over nonsense. Two families are grieving.
What a waste.
Norfolk International Airport announced some eye-popping stats the other day. More than a half-million passengers used the airport in July, the first time it’s ever reached that monthly benchmark. The passenger total so far this year, at 2.81 million, is up slightly over the same period for 2024.
The airport, which opened in 1938 and is now features nine airlines, is completing several projects. Among those planned are an on-site hotel and a new customs facility.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)When California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled his plan to retaliate if Republican-led Texas redrew its congressional districts to favor the GOP, he affirmed his support for less partisan maps — and then promised to “meet fire with fire.”
“We’re doing it mindful that we want to model better behavior,” Newsom told reporters in Los Angeles earlier this month, nodding to the independent system his state currently uses to draw districts. “ … But we cannot unilaterally disarm. We can’t stand back and watch this democracy disappear.”
President Donald Trump’s call for Republicans to redraw U.S. House districts so the party can win more seats in the 2026 midterm elections — to gerrymander them — has triggered a redistricting frenzy this summer that also threatens to prompt moves by Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and New York, among others. Ohio was already set to redraw its lines, even before the current fracas.
The battle for partisan advantage is placing Democratic politicians, advocates of less partisan maps and others who support curbs on gerrymandering in an uncomfortable position, pitting their desire for change against fears that Trump will take advantage of their scruples to wring more GOP seats out of a handful of key states. Some say they accept that Democratic states need to respond, while others warn retaliation will only yield short-term gains.
The Texas House passed a new map on Wednesday, clearing the way for a final vote in the state Senate and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s signature. In California, lawmakers passed their own map on Thursday, setting up a statewide vote in November over the new districts.
Other states are now likely to follow, as Republicans and Democrats scramble for a political leg up.










I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard.


– David Daley, senior fellow at FairVote


But gerrymandering opponents say the current moment has the potential to produce new energy for their movement. More people are paying attention to gerrymandering, they say, and new polls show the public opposes the practice. The rush to redraw maps demonstrates the need for Congress to set national limits, they say.
“I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard,” said David Daley, an author of books on gerrymandering and a senior fellow at FairVote, a Maryland-based nonpartisan group that supports ranked choice voting and multimember House districts to end the practice. “We will never have reform if a handful of states can act on their own.”
At the same time, some gerrymandering opponents fear states will unravel hard-fought victories. They wonder whether temporary measures, such as California potentially setting aside the independent commission it uses to redraw maps, could become permanent.
‘An unprecedented time’
State legislatures exercise primary control over congressional redistricting in 39 states, according to All About Redistricting, a compendium of information on map-drawing hosted by Loyola Law School in California. While some states use other methods, only nine states rely on independent commissions, which typically limit participation by elected officials and are favored by many gerrymandering opponents.
Most states draw maps once a decade after the census, making the mid-decade maneuvers and counter-maneuvers highly unusual (six states currently have only one representative, eliminating the need to draw district lines). But just a few seats could determine who controls the U.S. House. Republicans currently hold 219 seats to Democrats’ 212, with four vacancies.
“We affirm that gerrymandering, both racial and political, disenfranchises voters,” Virginia Kase Solomón, president and CEO of Common Cause, an organization that has long advocated for changes to the redistricting process, said during a press call the day before Newsom’s announcement.
“But this is an unprecedented time of political upheaval,” she said. People don’t want to see a situation develop where maps are redrawn every two years, she added.
Texas House Republicans propose new congressional map to increase GOP seats

The new Texas map could ease the path for Republicans to win an additional five seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Texas lawmakers rapidly advanced the redraw this week once Democratic state lawmakers returned to the state. They had traveled to other states to deny Texas House leaders the quorum required to approve the map, but returned after Newsom outlined California’s response.
Gerrymandering typically involves “packing” and “cracking.” “Packing” refers to the concentration of opposition party voters in a small number of districts to reduce competition elsewhere. “Cracking” means diluting the voting power of the opposing party’s supporters across many districts.
Texas Republicans have been frank that they are pursuing the redraw for partisan advantage. But they emphasize that no prohibition exists, in Texas or nationally, against mid-decade redistricting and that a 2019 U.S. Supreme Court decision cleared the way for states to draw maps for partisan purposes, removing the power of federal courts to police political gerrymandering.
The new maps give Republicans a chance of winning additional districts but doesn’t guarantee victories, they add.
“The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance,” Texas state Rep. Todd Hunter, a Republican who carried the bill in the Texas House, said during floor debate on Wednesday. He added a short time later: “According to the U.S. Supreme Court, you can use political performance, and that is what we’ve done.”
Tricky terrain
As Texas moves forward and California prepares to respond, Common Cause illustrates the tricky terrain anti-gerrymandering advocates are now navigating.
The group, headquartered in Washington, D.C., fought to enact the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2008. But earlier this month, Common Cause declined to condemn California’s retaliation, saying it will judge the effort by whether the maps are a proportional response to gerrymanders in other states, whether the process includes meaningful public participation, and whether the maps expire and are replaced after the 2030 census through the state’s regular redistricting process, among other criteria.
Newsom’s proposal, the Election Rigging Response Act, will ask California voters in November to temporarily set aside the state’s redistricting commission and approve the new map drawn by the legislature. The commission would resume drawing maps following the census.
Why congressional redistricting is blowing up across the US this summer

Recent polling shows widespread public opposition to gerrymandering. A YouGov poll of 1,116 Americans conducted in early August found 69% believe it should be illegal to draw districts in a way that makes it harder for members of a particular political party to elect their preferred candidates. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The number of Americans who say gerrymandering is a big problem has jumped in recent years. In the YouGov poll, 75% of respondents said it is a major problem when districts are intentionally drawn to favor one party, up from 66% in a 2022 survey.
Some California Republicans have responded to Newsom’s proposal by defending the commission system. A group of Republicans sued in state court to block the plan, but the California Supreme Court on Wednesday denied a request to temporarily halt the effort.
‘Is this bad for reform?’
While members of the public might say they favor citizen-led commissions, they may not care deeply about the issue, said David Hopkins, a political science professor at Boston College who has written on polarization in American politics. He called gerrymandering a “classic process subject” that comes off as “inside baseball” to many people.
“The legislators in states that haven’t adopted commissions clearly don’t feel any particular political pressure to do so,” Hopkins said.
Some Republicans in states weighing a mid-decade gerrymander also discount the risk of a public backlash.
In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe may call a special session this fall to redraw the state’s map in hopes of gaining an additional GOP seat in the U.S. House. James Harris, a Missouri Republican consultant with close ties to GOP officials in the state, said he wasn’t concerned redistricting would create momentum to change the process.
Missouri voters in recent years have approved ballot measures favored by Democrats, including one in 2018 that empowered a nonpartisan demographer to draw state legislative districts, though not congressional districts. But Republicans led a successful campaign to convince voters to repeal the changes two years later.
Harris painted any new potential map as part of a national effort to help Trump — who received 58.5% of the vote in Missouri last November.
“I think the lens is wanting to make sure the president has a majority in Congress so he can actually govern for the last two years versus two years of investigations, gridlock,” Harris said.
Advocates of less partisan maps said lawmakers aren’t likely to surrender their own role in mapmaking. While some state courts may limit redistricting excesses, federal courts stopped policing partisan gerrymandering following the Supreme Court’s 2019 decision. And the high court may soon weaken the judiciary’s power to block race-based gerrymandering.
Samuel Wang, director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, which supports eliminating partisan gerrymandering, said the “one good thing” about the redistricting battle is that it’s prompted voters to pay attention to an arcane and technical issue. That could be a positive in the long run, he said, “if people can keep a cool head.”
Wang has written online that any response to Texas should remain measured and proportionate. California offers Democrats the only clean option to strike back, Wang wrote. Five Democratic seats could be added by redrawing the state.
“Is this bad for reform? I mean, I’m torn,” Wang told Stateline. “Because on the other hand, Democrats have been, over the last few decades, vocal in their advocacy for voting rights in various forms and now that advocacy is in question because they find a need to fight fire with fire.”
“So I guess the way I would characterize it is if they can hold it in check and not do it in every single state and just engage in whatever they’re doing where it will make a difference,” he said, “then we might not lose all the progress that’s been made.”

Authorities in the West African nation threw him in prison because of his sexual orientation, he said. After his release, he feared that if he stayed in the country, he would be killed.
B., who is now 39 and who asked that he be identified only by his initial because he still has family in Cameroon, arrived in the United States with practically nothing. Since he was granted asylum last year, he has been able to use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, to help him get by.
But now most refugees and asylees, who entered the country legally, including B., are no longer eligible for food stamps. The change is part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the giant federal domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4.
“I think it’s unfair. I understand that there are some people who abuse the system,” B. told Stateline. “There are also people who are in need. And cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.”
SNAP, which is funded by the federal government but administered by the states, helps families and individuals with lower incomes supplement their grocery budgets. The program serves an average of 42 million people a month.

Supporters of the change note that refugees and asylees can get permits to work, and that they have other sources of support.
“It’s not like they have been dropped off in this country with no support system,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that backs stricter immigration rules.
“They have sponsoring organizations that are helping them get settled and they have work authorization. So they really should be moving forward towards self-sufficiency with support right out of the starting gate. And they should be moving ahead to obtain green cards,” she added, referring to the cards that signify permanent residency.
Vaughan cited a federal grant program that reimburses states and nonprofit organizations for financial aid and health care coverage they provide to refugees.
But critics argue that asylees and refugees, who are extensively vetted and have a legitimate path to citizenship, can wait years for a green card, which entitles them to a wider array of benefits.
They also say community organizations that provide aid to asylees and refugees are stretched thin. Without food stamps, they say, many refugees and their families would not have enough to eat.










Cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.


– B., a Cameroonian asylee


“SNAP is an incredibly fundamental program for this population that comes to the United States, really, with very little, if anything,” said Nicolas Palazzo, a policy counsel at the global humanitarian and refugee advocacy organization HIAS. “These are people who literally had to flee — many times overnight — with nothing, but, you know, a pair of clothes in a backpack.”
Palazzo also said SNAP is not a “handout” to refugees or asylees. Rather, he said, it’s a “smart and moral investment” that protects all communities and strengthens the economy, offering people a foundation for self-sufficiency.
“Stripping critical food assistance forces refugees and asylees into the shadows of informal work, labor exploitation and hunger that weakens our workforce and denigrates our moral obligations,” Palazzo said.
 ‘Nowhere else to go’

B. said he applied immediately for asylum when he arrived in the U.S. in 2016, but that he had to wait months for a work permit. He survived by doing odd jobs, such as cleaning homes and delivering food, and got by on very little. It wasn’t until late 2024, when he finally won his asylum case, that he was eligible to get any public benefits, including food stamps.
Eligibility for food stamps came at a critical time for B., as a car accident had prevented him from making food deliveries.
“While not having income, it was very helpful,” B. said. “I’m somebody who if I can work, I will work. The only reason I went over there to ask is because I had nowhere else to go.”
According to a November 2024 report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, a total of 60,050 people were newly admitted to the United States as refugees in 2023, many from unstable countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Syria and Afghanistan.
In 2023, the nation received at least 747,000 applications for people seeking asylum from countries including Venezuela, Cuba and Colombia, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration research group. It’s a tremendous increase from the 68,000 applications received in 2013.
The new domestic policy law specifies that food stamps are still available to Cubans and Haitians who might be refugees and asylees.

As of July 2025, more than 2.2 million immigrants in the U.S. are awaiting asylum hearings or decisions after formally applying for asylum, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, an organization at Syracuse University that tracks immigration cases.
“Getting through the system was difficult,” B. said. “I had to find money. I had to find an attorney who would help me apply for my asylum case. The asylum case itself took a long time.
“I still know people who have been here for more than 10 years and never had an interview.”
 ‘Already stretched’

According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, half of all admitted refugees in 2023 were resettled across just 10 states: Texas, New York, California, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan and Washington.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 41,000 people in the state are getting SNAP benefits while not being lawful permanent residents. She says that group includes refugees and asylees.
“The concerning part there is that these are individuals who were … lawfully admitted to the country, have previously been eligible for SNAP when they need it, and now, simply because of their status, will no longer be able to receive SNAP benefits,” Guinn told Stateline. “There’s nothing we’re going to be able to do to make them eligible.”
Another change under the new law is that for the first time, states will have to pay for a portion of their food stamp programs. States will have to cover between 5% and 15% of their SNAP costs beginning in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they dole out benefits to people eligible for the program.
Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, pointed out that states that want to continue to provide SNAP benefits to refugees and asylees are free to do so — as long as they pay for it.
“If New York state doesn’t want to cut these people off, they can continue to give them something like food stamps. They just have to do it with New York state money right now,” Rector said.

But Guinn said that will be difficult. New York does offer asylum-seekers cash assistance of $180 a month through its Safety Net Assistance Program, but typically recipients must be working.
In Texas, officials at the state’s health and human services agency said that as of last month, roughly 24,600 of the state’s 3.5 million SNAP recipients were refugees or asylees. A spokesperson for Maryland’s human services agency wrote in an email that the state’s SNAP program last year supported more than 10,000 refugees and asylees.
The California Department of Social Services could not provide the number of refugees and asylees receiving food stamps, but projected that a total of 74,000 noncitizens — including lawfully permanent residents, refugees and asylees — would lose eligibility under the new law.
Sherri Laigle, the director of social services at HIAS, said food banks will not be able to make up for refugees’ and asylees’ loss of SNAP benefits.
“They’re already stretched, and now we’re going to see tens of thousands of people also needing to continue to rely on these programs. Of course, there’s limited access to them. You have to have transportation. You have to be able to get there.”
B. said he would apply for food stamps again if he could, because he’s earning too little income to get by.
“There are people who are in need. I think ignoring that — it’s not human.”

Timothy Lang, chairman of the Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules, and Rep. Erica Layon, the vice chair, sit during a meeting at the State House on Aug. 21, 2025. (Photo by Claire Sullivan/New Hampshire Bulletin)A panel of lawmakers on Thursday approved an update to the state’s child care program licensing rule after more than a year of meetings and feedback from the early care and education community.
“I personally think it’s a work of art,” said Shannon Tremblay, director of the New Hampshire Child Care Advisory Council, of the update set to go into effect Sept. 22. (The Couch Family Foundation, which funds the New Hampshire Bulletin’s early care and education reporting position, is a funder of the advisory council.)
Those close to the process said the regulations were combed over line by line through months of meetings and focus groups. The changes, they said, would make the rule a more usable document for those in the field. Providers will now have latitude to set their own policies in certain areas, and the update adds a process for an independent informal resolution to address licensing disputes.
In a document submitted to the Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules, the oversight body made up of House and Senate members, the Department of Health and Human Services pointed to some tweaks that may make care more accessible.
The agency said “broadening of the education and experience requirements” could bring more people into the field and increase the availability of child care. The agency also said that “[f]ewer staff will be required to have certifications in pediatric CPR and first aid,” and required yearly professional development training will go from 18 hours to 12. 
The update also reduces the current requirement of “a minimum of 40 square feet of floor space per child” to 35 square feet.
Additionally, DHHS argued families in the state would “benefit from removal of the requirement for children to have an updated record of a health assessment on file every year or 2 years.” The department also noted program staff would no longer have to complete repeat health assessments after an initial exam upon starting employment.
The rule had been pulled off the oversight panel’s consent calendar, the list of items deemed uncontroversial enough for lawmakers to vote on all at once without discussion, for what Derry Republican Rep. Erica Layon described as “vague concerns” that had been expressed to her.
But lawmakers quickly and unanimously greenlit the rule once a DHHS official explained an urgency to approve them at the August meeting so that the state would be in compliance with federal requirements by the end of September. Layon said she had been unaware of the timeline and supported the move.
“We have worked with our child care community for over a year to go line by line through the rule and to make changes,” Melissa Clement, chief of the department’s Child Care Licensing Unit, told lawmakers. 
That included working with the state’s legislatively enacted Child Care Advisory Council and more than a year of weekly meetings, she said. In July, the department hosted a public hearing that it reported as having roughly 50 attendees. 
State law requires agencies to explain how they incorporated — or didn’t incorporate — public comments into their final rules. A packet submitted to lawmakers by the department shows it made several tweaks to the rule in response to that feedback.
Jennifer Legere, who owns the Brentwood child care center A Place to Grow, said “it was nice that the child care community was involved in the rulemaking process this time.” She said that when she started this work 20 years ago, child care licensing and providers were in “two different worlds.”
“It doesn’t feel that way anymore,” Legere said. “It’s not adversarial in terms of relationship. There’s a lot of collaboration and support with one another, and I really appreciate that shift.”
While she appreciated that engagement, she said she would have liked to see one more opportunity for public review of the rule, once the department had made changes based on public comments.
She also said parts of the rule that now put the responsibility on providers to come up with their own policies in certain areas, rather than spelling out universal guidelines, would pose challenges.
For instance, when it comes to illness, the current rule provides a list of symptoms that should result in a child being sent home or denied entry into a program while exhibited. This list is removed in the updated rule. Concern was raised in public comment, but the department responded that “there are many resources readily available” on the issue.
“There will be more pressure on providers to be responsible for that,” Legere said. “That’s hard, and it provides a lack of clarity for parents, because now they’re going to say, ‘Well how did you come up with your policy, Jen? Why is your policy this?’ … I can go back and research how every single one of those, you know, policies was originally made, but it’s a little bit harder for me to have that content.”
Meanwhile, others view the shift to allowing providers to set more of their own policies as a positive one.
“There was a lot of places where child care licensing was almost micromanaging the way businesses were running,” said Marianne Barter, the departing chair of the Child Care Advisory Council who runs two child care programs, “and we were able to change the onus of the responsibility of certain policies onto the business itself.”
Lynn Ouellette, interim chair of the council, said “it makes it more individualized to how a center runs and what their philosophies are, versus the state saying we have to do this.”
Tremblay, the council’s director, said that might have been “the biggest bone of contention” in the field in regards to the regulations. Some providers want “clear-cut, black-and-white” policies, while others prefer the freedom, she said.
On the space per child change from 40 square feet to 35 square feet, Legere said that was significant and would be useful in her own operation. Though her waiting list spans hundreds, every new spot counts and impacts a family, she said.
“Anytime we can help out with these ratios in these little, tiny tweaks, I think there’s going to be a really big benefit to families in the community,” she said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0029-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-22 05:56:31.716110

(Photo by Megan Henry, Ohio Capital Journal). Ohio advocates are calling on Gov. Mike DeWine to bring home the Ohio National Guard troops recently deployed to Washington D.C. 
President Donald Trump said on Aug. 11 he would send National Guard troops to Washington D.C. to crack down on crime and Ohio is one of six states that has so far sent troops to Washington D.C. 
Secretary of the Army Daniel P. Driscoll asked DeWine on Friday to send 150 members from the Ohio National Guard to Washington D.C., and members of the Ohio National Guard left for a 30-day deployment.

“The deployment of the National Guard should be reserved for situations in which the safety of citizens and the integrity of our nation are actually at risk,” said Common Cause Ohio Executive Director Catherine Turcer. “We are here today calling for Gov. DeWine to recall the National Guard immediately.”
Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, West Virginia, and Tennessee have also sent troops — all states with Republican governors. 
“It’s not too late for Gov. DeWine … to cancel this ill considered, legally problematic and unwarranted mission,” said former Democratic Ohio House Rep. Adam Miller. “This political theater has got to end. Our National Guard families and our soldiers deserve better.” 
Violent crime in Washington D.C., is at a thirty year low and Toledo, Dayton, and Cleveland all had a higher crime rate than Washington D.C. in 2024. 
“Ohio has traditionally helped the District of Columbia, Ohio mayors, and other states when they request assistance from the Ohio National Guard or the Ohio State Highway Patrol,” DeWine’s spokesman Dan Tierney said when asked about the deployment.
The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia has not asked for National Guard troops to be deployed, and Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has spoken out against the deployment. 
“The worst thing you can do as any military leader is to sanction an unwarranted action,” said Miller, who is running for Ohio’s 15th Congressional District. He is also a colonel with more than 20 years of service in the U.S. Army Reserve who served as the Judge Advocate General Corps officer.
None of the 150 Ohio deployed troops are part of the Emergency Response Force package, Miller said. 
“This is a fake emergency,” Miller said. “Shame on our chain of command for not asking the questions, for not doing their independent due diligence, and for pulling our service members out of existing training and into a dangerous situation.” 
Miller praised Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, for rejecting the request to deploy National Guard troops.  
“We have to speak up when something happens that is outside the scope of our legal authorities, outside the scope of our mission,” Miller said. 
The Ohio National Guard is one of the largest in the country with around 17,000 soldiers and airmen, according to the 122nd Army National Guard Band. 
“We’re involved in multiple operations overseas,” Miller said. “We have special forces. You don’t pull people out of critical global terrorism missions for political theater. Putting soldiers and their families into a mission for which they’re not well trained is the worst thing that you can do as a military leader and the governor has got to be more willing to say no, or at least ask questions.”
Part of Trump’s crackdown on crime comes from a recent executive order that forces those experiencing homelessness off the streets. 
“With members of United States armed services, including some from our very state, descending as ordered onto Washington D.C., to sanitize and purge the city of people whose only crime is being homeless, it’s clear that a judgment has been reached,” said Rev. Jack Sullivan, Jr., executive director of the Ohio Council of Churches. “It is clear to us that the so-called homelessness and crime crisis in Washington D.C., serve only as manufactured justification for military mobilization.”
ACLU Ohio Legislative Director Gary Daniels said DeWine “has chosen to be part of the problem instead of part of the solution.”
“Requesting National Guard troops to come to another area of the country should be used only for the most extreme examples where they are truly needed and not for what we are seeing here today,” Daniels said. “What exactly is the exit strategy here?”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-22 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"To replace HB 5002, CT towns pitch regional approach to housing",Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/22/ct-hb-5002-regional-approach-housing/,A proposal from organizations that represent CT’s 169 towns eliminates measures related to zoning and focuses instead on regional planning.,"The primary organizations that represent Connecticut’s 169 municipalities have brought forward an outline for a new housing bill that eliminates previously proposed measures related to zoning and focuses instead on regional planning to address the state’s housing crisis.
The Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, the Connecticut Council of Small Towns and the nine regional councils of government put together a plan to replace the Democrats’ housing omnibus bill, H.B. 5002. That proposal, obtained by The Connecticut Mirror through an open records request, is being presented to policymakers throughout the coming days.
The plan would eliminate long-debated proposals like funding measures for Work, Live, Ride, which focuses on housing near transportation hubs, a policy known as fair share and some off-street parking requirements. Some towns have argued these amount to mandates that don’t account for the individual needs of municipalities across the state.
Advocates of those measures and housing experts, however, have argued that the status quo and lack of state-level intervention has not moved the needle as much or as quickly as needed. The state lacks tens of thousands of units that are affordable and available to its lowest income renters.
H.B. 5002 was a priority of the Democratic caucuses in the House and Senate and passed toward the end of the most recent legislative session. Gov. Ned Lamont, whose staff worked with lawmakers on the bill, vetoed it in the face of mounting opposition.
Lamont said he wanted to find a way to get towns on board, and asked lawmakers to come back in a special session to pass a reworked housing bill.
House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, said he met with the groups Thursday morning to discuss their plan.
“I’m not surprised to hear that there are things they would like to cut,”  he said. “So I didn’t really need to engage in that conversation and nor do I agree that that’s what we would do, but there are certainly changes we’re already making that they weren’t aware of in those areas.”
Lawmakers and housing advocates have been skeptical about whether it’s possible to have a meaningful bill with widespread buy-in from towns that have historically been reluctant to allow more affordable housing or multifamily housing in their neighborhoods.
The town organizations’ plan would eliminate most of the portions of the bill that housing advocates have said are the most meaningful, including the measure to end off-street parking minimums for smaller towns, the prioritization of state grants for towns that build near train and bus stations, a measure to allow conversion of commercial property to residential without a special hearing and the policy known as fair share that would require towns to plan and zone for a set number of units of housing.
Instead, their plan would require towns to work with their regional councils of government, or COGs, to assess housing needs, then set goals and make plans once every 10 years. It would also have the state offer new funding as incentives for towns to implement their plans. Supporters say this would reduce onerous burdens on towns and allow each part of the state to set goals that make sense for them.
But opponents, including housing experts, say without enforcement mechanisms it would do little to actually increase the state’s housing stock.
“It’s sort of where we are right now, just shuffling the deck and looking at the conversation from a regional standpoint rather than a municipal standpoint, but not really increasing expectations on anyone,” said John Guszkowski, co-chair of the Connecticut Chapter of the American Planning Association’s government relations committee.
Guszkowski added that working regionally and working more with the councils of government is a positive step for town planning in Connecticut, but that needs to be paired with ways to hold towns accountable.
Rojas said accountability has been a political sticking point for years.
“I don’t want to engage in this kind of business of punishing communities for not doing X or Y,” he said. “That’s not how I want to approach this. But that poses challenges.”
As originally passed, H.B. 5002 prioritized certain state infrastructure grants for towns that made changes to their zoning to allow more housing.
Matt Hart, executive director of the Capitol Region Council of Governments, said accountability is one issue the group plans to work on as they keep developing the proposal.
“This is just a suggested framework that we focus more on: how do we leverage the COGs in our relationships, where we can help, where we can convene and help lead and bring our towns together to work regionally?” Hart said.
“We haven’t come to a final solution on that, like, what’s going to compel the towns to actually do this?” said Brian O’Connor, director of public policy for the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities.
Betsy Gara, executive director of the Council of Small Towns, said regional efforts would particularly help smaller municipalities that might not have full-time planning staff. She said she wants to see regional housing needs assessments that account more for water and sewage capacity than past studies have.
“This empowers a municipality to provide input through the COG into what that housing goal should be,” she said. Under the plan, Gara added, each town would have their own goals set in partnership with the COG.
Rob Blanchard, the governor’s spokesman, said in a statement that Lamont appreciates the work the organizations put into the proposal to “meaningfully address our housing crisis.”
“One thing we have learned from that work is that local leaders need to be bought in to the solution and rather than simply opposing efforts, they are coming to the table with ideas,” Blanchard’s statement said. “The Governor remains committed to continuing to collaborate with local leaders, legislators, and advocates on improving the housing bill ahead of eventual passage.”
Rojas said he thinks the meeting with the groups was overall positive.
“There is more alignment on ultimate goals than people otherwise want to let on,” he said.

Unruffled, Moreno defended Republican policy and painted the Trump administration in glowing terms.
“He should, and probably will, end up getting the Nobel Peace Prize,” Moreno said of the president.

“Those are just facts”
In a discussion moderated by NBC News’ Henry Gomez, Moreno praised the Trump administration and its centerpiece budget legislation, The One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
The measure makes permanent large tax breaks from Trump’s first administration and adds on temporary deductions for overtime pay and tips that expire in 2028. Opponents criticize Republicans for paying for those tax cuts by rolling back safety net programs like Medicaid and food stamps.
But Moreno claimed there’s no cut.
“The facts are, over the next 10 years, we will spend 20% more on Medicaid nationally than we’re spending now,” Moreno said. “Medicaid spending will be increased by 20%, that’s a fact.”
VP Vance visits Ohio to tout the Trump/Republican One Big Beautiful Bill Act

Despite insisting throughout the event that “those are just facts” and encouraging people to “look it up,” Moreno’s math is fuzzy.
Nonpartisan researchers at the Kaiser Family Foundation note CBO forecasts predict a $911 billion cut to the program and an increase of 10 million uninsured Americans. Ohio Capital Journal asked Moreno’s office about the figure but got no response.
One possibility? He could be comparing apples and oranges.
In June, the GOP-controlled, U.S. House Budget Committee put out a press release claiming the Congressional Budget Office had “set the record straight.” But the committee argued Medicaid spending would climb more than 30% — not 20%.
They arrived at that figure by comparing projected Medicaid costs in 2034 with the current ones. That, of course, ignores the likely increase in program spending if Trump’s legislation hadn’t passed.
The CBO described that comparison in the very same paragraph, stating, “CBO estimates that enacting the Medicaid provisions of H.R. 1 would reduce Medicaid spending by $125.2 billion in 2034.”
Moreno also defended the Trump administration’s approach to tariffs: “We need to make more things here in America so that we have good, high paying middle class jobs — that’s just a fact.”
And he voiced support for the idea of taking an equity stake in Intel.
“If a company is going to ask for help, if a company is going to ask for money, the taxpayer should get equity so we have the upside,” Moreno said.
“As a company becomes successful, we can sell that equity and recoup the money for the taxpayer,” he added. “To me, that’s common sense.”
Ohio’s Intel plant has been stalled for years, now Trump, Moreno, Husted are getting involved

Question and answer
Moreno answers elicited jeers throughout the discussion with Gomez. When the event turned to audience questions, it didn’t get much friendlier.
One person asked what he was doing to protect NASA following major job cuts and another sought his help with changes to the 529 education savings plan making it easier to donate left over money.
Moreno assured the first that NASA is important for national security and the city of Cleveland.
“A lot of that technology and knowledge lives here in Cleveland,” Moreno said before predicting a “big increase in funding.” He promised the other attendee he’d investigate the 529 issue and work on fitting it into upcoming legislation.
Different speakers pressed him on his support for Israel’s war in Gaza and what he’s doing to protect Ukraine from Russia’s invasion.
“This is a total problem caused by Hamas that could be fixed by Hamas, and Israel is defending itself and I support them unequivocally,” Moreno said of the war in Gaza.
As for Ukraine, Moreno said, “We cannot allow 6,000, 7,000 innocent people to die every single week. It is a terrible, terrible situation what’s happening there, and I, for one, I’m on the side of peace.”
One attendee asked about Trump’s recent flirtation with prohibiting mail-in voting. The senator argued the last time Congress proposed federal election laws, Democrats were in charge.
“We’re on the side of states’ rights, and saying, hey, states should manage that,” Moreno said. “But at the same time, it is a federal obligation to make sure those states are doing a good job.”
Notably, the Trump administration is leaning on GOP-led states to redraw maps mid-cycle to advantage the party. Among other changes, the Democratic legislation Moreno referenced would have required states to establish independent redistricting commissions.

Another attendee asked Moreno about changing his tune about the 2020 election and Jan. 6.
“What’s the truth about the 2020 election? Was it stolen, Senator?” the man asked. “And what’s the truth about Jan. 6, Senator? Were they patriots or felons?”
Moreno pointed to Hunter Biden’s laptop.
“That story was supposedly Russian misinformation, which it was clearly not, and did that alter the election? Absolutely it did,” he said.
“I get the question,” Moreno added, “was Joe Biden the legitimate president of the United States for four years. He was legitimately the worst president of the United States for four years.”
Moreno did not address Jan. 6.
Pressing the flesh?
Cleveland’s event is far from the first time Moreno has come home, but his visits have generally relied on private tours and press conferences. Critics have lobbed abuse at Moreno for failing to meet with constituents.
When Ohio Capital Journal reached out to Moreno’s office about events with voters, a spokeswoman sent a press release describing a three-day, 18-county tour promoting the One Big Beautiful Bill earlier this month.
Those visits included a dairy, a restaurant, a steel plant, and a factory. But the events weren’t widely publicized, and most appear to be made up of invited guests. Although the press release notes Moreno visited Ohio’s three most populous counties, it doesn’t mention coverage from any of the numerous news outlets in those areas.
Frustrated with their lack of access, Moreno’s critics have have taken to hosting regular protests outside his Ohio offices. They showed up outside The City Club, as well. In a statement, organizer Ellen Brown said, “he doesn’t represent all of Ohio.”
“He refuses to do a town hall with constituents of different points of view, he’s allowing the executive branch to take power from the Senate as he votes with the president 100%, and the budget bill hurts Ohioans in favor of billionaires,” Brown continued. “He’s allowing illegal deportations against immigrants and he’s an immigrant himself.”

(Submitted by Jennifer Bacani McKenney)Ask Urban Dictionary what a “sausage fest” is, and you get this back: “a party of only guys (or at least 80% guys), where there is a substantial abundance of wiener.”
Given that ribald definition, my grandmother — in fact, both of them — would shudder to know that I asked a Kansan pastor this week what she thought about a sausage fest.
Specifically, Sausage Fest 2025, which starts Saturday in Fredonia.
“I think the part that brings the community together is just to have fun watching people overfill their bellies with hot dogs or running a race around the square carrying a sausage,” said Alice Purvis, who leads the congregation at First United Methodist Church in Fredonia, a town in the southeast quadrant of Kansas with about 2,000 people. “You know, there’s just a silliness in it that I think is awesome.”
Double meanings and dad jokes are at the core of Sausage Fest. Here’s a partial rundown for 2025.
In the morning, you could jog in the 5K — but why not do the Wiener Walk instead?
The Haute Dawg contest is not in fact just for dogs. You can dress up any animal in a costume for the competition. A few years ago at Sausage Fest, you would have seen a goat strutting the stage. Lady Baba was the goat’s stage name.
Next up: The Hot Dog Eating Contest. Each year, Purvis cheers on her son Michael, who joins others on the event’s stage, a repurposed flat-bed trailer. The gathered crowd watches to see who can eat the most hot dogs in seven minutes.
“Whoever the winner is, their stomach might be really full, but they’re also pretty happy because they won,” Purvis said. “And yeah, Michael usually has to take a little while to walk around and get back to normal orientation.”
The indigestion continues during Wiener Weway at 7 p.m. For that event, contestants chug a beer, eat a hot dog and then pass a baton — in this case, it’s kielbasa — in between their running.
Before the night wraps with the Chorizo Challenge Arm Wrestling Tournament, Fredonians will watch the Mr. Hotlink Pageant. The winner will showcase a talent and deliver a speech, which usually panders to the crowd by extolling the virtues of Fredonia.
If you win one of the events, you receive $100 — plus a medal. You might see some of the reigning champions wearing their medals from last year, an organizer said. 
Hosting an event that features such silly sausage names was the brainstorm of Jennifer Bacani McKenney, a local physician and community advocate. Bacani McKenney said she was flying back from Las Vegas and sat next to a Hollywood producer who gave her the idea of creating a signature hometown event for Fredonia.
Local folks, including Bacani McKenney’s partners at her medical clinic, help organize the one-day festival of naughtily named nonsense.
“I mean, honestly, we’re not shy about anything,” Bacani McKenney said about her fellow medical staff. “We deal with penises, vaginas, everything, all day long. So we’re not shy about any of that stuff. … In the end, it ends up being a really good thing, in a very sneaky way.”
When Bacani McKenney talks to students about rural medicine, she brings up the festival — and not because the hot dog eating contest bends typical dietary advice. 
“If you’re a doctor in a small town, the things you can do outside of the exam room for your patients and your community is pretty much limitless,” Bacani McKenney said. “Be creative. Have fun. Be part of the community. Don’t be the doctor that’s just stuffy in the exam room. Make a difference in the whole community.”
Sausage Fest no longer features a best-dressed pig contest (the pigs got too angry) or wiener dog races (dachshunds are too much in demand as rentals for events). However, you can still see Hurtin’ for a Squirtin’ this year, Bacani McKenney said. 
“Oh! That’s our dirtiest one,” she said. “But not just the title, but literally also.” 
Because Bacani McKenney serves as the county’s health officer, she has access to boxes of hazmat suits from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“So we let people put those on, and they have a facemask, gloves and little booties for their feet,” Bacani McKenney said. “And then they get a ketchup and mustard bottle that’s actually filled with fingerpaint. They spray each other and have a little spray fight.” 
When it’s all done, participants pose for a photo inside a frame that says, “I was hurtin’ for a squirtin’ at Fredonia Sausage Fest.”
Cultivate Fredonia organizes the festival, which often raises $10,000 to $15,000 through food and drink sales plus sponsorships, Bacani McKenney said. The festival’s programming starts at 8 a.m. and stretches until midnight.
“What you’ll see is a town square that’s kind of booming with community people that are talking and interacting, and maybe have a beer in their hand,” Bacani McKenney said. “I think just seeing people in a small town, interacting, talking, walking around in a safe space where everybody’s having fun.”

(Getty Images.)Before the data center boom, there was the natural gas boom. Between 2008 and 2023, the last year for which we have data: 
• The natural gas industry invested over $110 billion in Ohio.
• Eight counties in Eastern Ohio (Belmont, Carroll, Columbiana, Guernsey, Harrison, Jefferson, Monroe, and Noble) went from producing negligible amounts of gas to volumes that made Ohio the nation’s eighth largest producer. 
• During this period, the eight counties’ gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services, rose 26% faster than the nation’s GDP.
But, while the gas industry boomed, a new Ohio River Valley Institute report finds that . . . 
• The number of jobs in the eight counties plunged by 10,863 or almost 11%. 
• The counties’ population declined by nearly 28,000 people or 8%. 
• The combined incomes of people who live in the eight counties grew by only two-thirds the amount of income growth nationally.
Whatever changes the natural gas industry’s massive expansion brought to Ohio, it did not bring job growth and prosperity. 
In fact, the data suggest that the gas industry is structurally incapable of meaningfully raising jobs and income regardless of how much money the industry and the state invest. 
This is not an industry state policymakers should subsidize, nor is Ohio’s experience with natural gas one they should want to repeat, although they tried. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Do you remember the seemingly endless saga of the PTT ethane cracker plant proposed for Belmont County? 
JobsOhio squandered tens of millions of taxpayer dollars in a failed effort to launch the plant. Yet, because of the project’s failure, residents of Belmont County and Ohio may have gotten off easy. 
Another equally prized ethane cracker project was completed by Shell just sixty miles away, in Beaver County, Pennsylvania. 
That project, which ostensibly commanded $14 billion of investment, produced a roughly 18-month surge in construction employment, which was promptly followed by an even greater plunge in employment that has left Beaver County with fewer jobs now than it had before the cracker project began. 
None of the anticipated downstream plastics manufacturing development ever materialized. Meanwhile, amid a succession of technical problems, pollution violations, and losses, Shell has put the facility up for sale. 
So much for the $1.6 billion in subsidies that the state of Pennsylvania squandered in its pursuit of the cracker. 
Now, Ohio policymakers have dangling tantalizingly before them another similarly shiny object — a data center boom that state leaders tell us could make Ohio a major player in the AI-driven future.
In their eyes, the prospect is sweetened by the fact that many of the state’s new data centers could be powered by Ohio natural gas — kind of a “twofer” for the obtuse who still hold the deluded belief that natural gas development is a creator of jobs and prosperity. 
The problem is that, if data centers make Ohio a major player in the digital economy, they will do it in the worst possible way. 
That’s because data centers share an important characteristic with the natural gas industry and with ethane crackers. 
They are spectacularly capital-intensive and not very labor-intensive, which means that, of all the money invested to build and operate them, and, of all the revenue they generate by providing services, astonishingly little will find its way into the economies of host communities. 
For instance, if you ask, “Where did the $100+ billion supposedly invested in Ohio by the gas industry go?” the answer is that nearly all of it went and continues to go to investors, shareholders, and service providers, few of whom live in Ohio. 
Only a little goes to the small number of local employees. 
The same is true of gas-fired power plants. The nearly 2,000 MW Guernsey Power Station, for all its immensity and hundreds of millions of dollars in annual sales, employs only about 30 people — roughly as many as an Olive Garden. 
Data centers will merely add yet another highly capital-intensive, not very labor-intensive layer to this economically inert stack of enterprises that inject little money into local economies while imposing major quality of life and cost burdens. 
That starts with electric bills, which primarily because of the mere expectation of data centers, are going up by double digits. 
Ohio needs its policymakers to recognize these industries for what they are and, far from using public resources to attract them, they must tax and regulate them in ways that guarantee they will contribute to local economies and not consign them to the fate that has befallen the state’s eight natural gas counties.

B. said he left Cameroon nine years ago because he was scared for his life. Authorities in the West African nation threw him in prison because of his sexual orientation, he said. After his release, he feared that if he stayed in the country, he would be killed.
B., who is now 39 and who asked that he be identified only by his initial because he still has family in Cameroon, arrived in the United States with practically nothing. Since he was granted asylum last year, he has been able to use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, to help him get by.
But now most refugees and asylees, who entered the country legally, including B., are no longer eligible for food stamps. The change is part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the giant federal domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4.
“I think it’s unfair. I understand that there are some people who abuse the system,” B. told Stateline. “There are also people who are in need. And cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.”
SNAP, which is funded by the federal government but administered by the states, helps families and individuals with lower incomes supplement their grocery budgets. The program serves an average of 42 million people a month.
New work rules could deny food stamps to thousands of veterans

Supporters of the change note that refugees and asylees can get permits to work, and that they have other sources of support.
“It’s not like they have been dropped off in this country with no support system,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that backs stricter immigration rules.
“They have sponsoring organizations that are helping them get settled and they have work authorization. So they really should be moving forward towards self-sufficiency with support right out of the starting gate. And they should be moving ahead to obtain green cards,” she added, referring to the cards that signify permanent residency.
Vaughan cited a federal grant program that reimburses states and nonprofit organizations for financial aid and health care coverage they provide to refugees.
But critics argue that asylees and refugees, who are extensively vetted and have a legitimate path to citizenship, can wait years for a green card, which entitles them to a wider array of benefits.
They also say community organizations that provide aid to asylees and refugees are stretched thin. Without food stamps, they say, many refugees and their families would not have enough to eat.










Cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.


– B., a Cameroonian asylee


“SNAP is an incredibly fundamental program for this population that comes to the United States, really, with very little, if anything,” said Nicolas Palazzo, a policy counsel at the global humanitarian and refugee advocacy organization HIAS. “These are people who literally had to flee — many times overnight — with nothing, but, you know, a pair of clothes in a backpack.”
Palazzo also said SNAP is not a “handout” to refugees or asylees. Rather, he said, it’s a “smart and moral investment” that protects all communities and strengthens the economy, offering people a foundation for self-sufficiency.
“Stripping critical food assistance forces refugees and asylees into the shadows of informal work, labor exploitation and hunger that weakens our workforce and denigrates our moral obligations,” Palazzo said.
 ‘Nowhere else to go’

B. said he applied immediately for asylum when he arrived in the U.S. in 2016, but that he had to wait months for a work permit. He survived by doing odd jobs, such as cleaning homes and delivering food, and got by on very little. It wasn’t until late 2024, when he finally won his asylum case, that he was eligible to get any public benefits, including food stamps.
Eligibility for food stamps came at a critical time for B., as a car accident had prevented him from making food deliveries.
“While not having income, it was very helpful,” B. said. “I’m somebody who if I can work, I will work. The only reason I went over there to ask is because I had nowhere else to go.”
According to a November 2024 report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, a total of 60,050 people were newly admitted to the United States as refugees in 2023, many from unstable countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Syria and Afghanistan.
In 2023, the nation received at least 747,000 applications for people seeking asylum from countries including Venezuela, Cuba and Colombia, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration research group. It’s a tremendous increase from the 68,000 applications received in 2013.
The new domestic policy law specifies that food stamps are still available to Cubans and Haitians who might be refugees and asylees.
A dozen states win approval to restrict soda, candy for SNAP recipients

As of July 2025, more than 2.2 million immigrants in the U.S. are awaiting asylum hearings or decisions after formally applying for asylum, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, an organization at Syracuse University that tracks immigration cases.
“Getting through the system was difficult,” B. said. “I had to find money. I had to find an attorney who would help me apply for my asylum case. The asylum case itself took a long time.
“I still know people who have been here for more than 10 years and never had an interview.”
 ‘Already stretched’

According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, half of all admitted refugees in 2023 were resettled across just 10 states: Texas, New York, California, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan and Washington.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 41,000 people in the state are getting SNAP benefits while not being lawful permanent residents. She says that group includes refugees and asylees.
“The concerning part there is that these are individuals who were … lawfully admitted to the country, have previously been eligible for SNAP when they need it, and now, simply because of their status, will no longer be able to receive SNAP benefits,” Guinn told Stateline. “There’s nothing we’re going to be able to do to make them eligible.”
Another change under the new law is that for the first time, states will have to pay for a portion of their food stamp programs. States will have to cover between 5% and 15% of their SNAP costs beginning in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they dole out benefits to people eligible for the program.
Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, pointed out that states that want to continue to provide SNAP benefits to refugees and asylees are free to do so — as long as they pay for it.
“If New York state doesn’t want to cut these people off, they can continue to give them something like food stamps. They just have to do it with New York state money right now,” Rector said.
GOP cuts to food assistance would hit rural America especially hard

But Guinn said that will be difficult. New York does offer asylum-seekers cash assistance of $180 a month through its Safety Net Assistance Program, but typically recipients must be working.
In Texas, officials at the state’s health and human services agency said that as of last month, roughly 24,600 of the state’s 3.5 million SNAP recipients were refugees or asylees. A spokesperson for Maryland’s human services agency wrote in an email that the state’s SNAP program last year supported more than 10,000 refugees and asylees.
The California Department of Social Services could not provide the number of refugees and asylees receiving food stamps, but projected that a total of 74,000 noncitizens — including lawfully permanent residents, refugees and asylees — would lose eligibility under the new law.
Sherri Laigle, the director of social services at HIAS, said food banks will not be able to make up for refugees’ and asylees’ loss of SNAP benefits.
“They’re already stretched, and now we’re going to see tens of thousands of people also needing to continue to rely on these programs. Of course, there’s limited access to them. You have to have transportation. You have to be able to get there.”
B. said he would apply for food stamps again if he could, because he’s earning too little income to get by.
“There are people who are in need. I think ignoring that — it’s not human.”

Nearly 40% of election officials administering the 2024 election weren’t around in 2020.
Election officials turned over at the highest rate in at least a quarter century during the last presidential election, according to new research from the Bipartisan Policy Center.
An analysis of shifts in election officials published Tuesday found nearly 41% of election officials administering the 2024 election were different than those in 2020. Turnover has accelerated over the past two decades, rising from about 28% in 2004 to 40.9% last year.
The growing percentage of departing election officials comes after years of challenges. They navigated the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as well as harassment and false conspiracy theories surrounding stolen elections that persist today.
The analysis released by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based group that seeks to foster policy cooperation across party lines, represents an updated version of a report that previously examined turnover from 2004 to 2022. The new research, which extends the data through 2024, shows the turnover rate continued to climb.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The change means that, over time, election officials have less experience. The research found that the share of chief local election officials with six or more years in their role has dropped from 60% in 2006 to 47% in 2024.
But last year, 60% of election officials had previously overseen the administration of a presidential election in their jurisdiction.
“Despite increasing turnover and loss of experience, the majority of chief election officials still have experience running at least one presidential election cycle,” the analysis said. “This is important because presidential elections typically see the highest turnout and are the most visible elections administered.”
The analysis found that over the long term, election official turnover rates have been rising gradually in small jurisdictions, defined as areas with fewer than 100,000 voting-age residents. But large jurisdictions have experienced a more sudden jump in turnover.
Small jurisdictions had a 27% turnover rate in 2004 that had risen to 40% in 2024. But large jurisdictions enjoyed a turnover rate as low as 31% in 2018 before climbing rapidly to nearly 46% last year.

Malcolm Ruff (D-Baltimore City) announced his intention to run for the District 41 Senate seat currently held by Sen. Dalya Attar (D-Baltimore City). (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Del. Malcolm P. Ruff (D-Baltimore City) said Thursday he will seek the District 41 Senate seat next year in a rematch, of sorts, against Sen. Dalya Attar (D-Baltimore City).
The two squared off in January when both were in the House and looking to fill the seat vacated by then-Sen. Jill P. Carter (D), who resigned after being nominated by Gov. Wes Moore (D) to serve on the State Board of Contract Appeals. The Baltimore City Democratic Central Committee ended up choosing Attar on a 5-3 vote.
With Moore’s confirmation of her nomination, Attar became the first Orthodox Jewish woman to serve in the Senate. Attar, who previously worked as an assistant state’s attorney in the city, was elected to the House in 2018 and reelected in 2022. Ruff, who is also an attorney, was tapped for his House seat in 2023 by Moore, after the central committee deadlocked 4-4 on candidates to fill another vacancy and sent two names for the governor to choose from.
But Ruff told a crowd of a couple hundred people at a rally-like event Thursday at Gwynn Falls/Leakin Park that he has proven himself since taking office as “a legislator who delivers for my district. I have the trust and support of the people who know me and who have seen my work and who believe in the future that we can build together.”
The crowd included Carter, the former senator, who introduced Ruff to speak,. Others who took the microphone included Dayvon Love, public policy director with Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle, and a member of the central committee who supported Ruff in January; City Council Vice President Sharon Green Middleton; and Evan Serpick with Jews United for Justice.
It also included prominent Baltimore attorney William H. “Billy” Murphy Jr., whose firm employs Ruff as a trial attorney. “We only hire the best. We don’t hire punks. If you’re a punk, go someplace else,” Murphy said to several chuckles in the crowd.
Besides Attar and Ruff, the rest of the District 41 delegation includes the legislature’s longest-serving member in Del. Samuel I. “Sandy” Rosenberg, who was first elected in 1982, and the General Assembly’s newest member in Del. Sean Stinnett, who was sworn in to replace Attar in March. All are Democrats.


In a nearby part of the city…
At the same time as Ruff’s event, Crystal Jackson Parker announced to her supporters Thursday she plans to seek a House seat from neighboring District 40.

Jackson Parker, 58, served on the city’s Democratic Central Committee between 2018 to 2022. She ran unsuccessful for the House in 2022, finishing sixth among eight candidates who were seeking three nominations in the Democratic primary that year.
The current delegates representing that district, all Democrats, are Marlon Amprey, Frank Conaway Jr. and Melissa Wells.
Jackson Parker is the founder of the North Avenue and Hilton Street Business and Community Task Force. Last year, it was awarded a $250,000 grant as part of the Mayor’s Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement’s neighborhood policing plan. The native Baltimorean was the first person in her immediate family to graduate high school and went on to get an undergraduate degree from Cornell University and law degree from the University of Baltimore.
Part of her campaign platform includes investing in youth programs, expanding early childhood education and supporting small businesses and older adults. She summarized part of her life story on her website, as a 9-year-old diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus, a chronic autoimmune disease that attacks the kidneys.
“Doctors told me I wouldn’t live past the age of 25. They told me I’d face a lifetime of pain, kidney failure and experimental treatments,” she wrote. “My story isn’t just about survival; it’s about service. I’ve dedicated my life to Baltimore because I know what it’s like to struggle, and I know what it takes to overcome.”


Hale dismisses Hershey criticism: ‘I don’t even know him.’
Maryland’s newly minted Republican gubernatorial candidate may know business but he doesn’t know many of the players in his new party.
Ed Hale, who announced Wednesday he would switch parties and seek the GOP nomination for governor, dismissed criticism from Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey Jr (R-Upper Shore), who characterized Hale as a political opportunist who is not anchored in Republican values.

Hale, who is only declared but not formally filed, pooh-poohed Hershey and his criticism, saying in an interview on WBAL radio he’s more of a Republican than Hershey.
“I don’t even know him,” said Hale.
The Baltimore businessman, who until Wednesday was a lifelong Democra,t said meeting payroll, hiring employees and adhering “with all the different things I built in my life” made him more of a Republican than Hershey.
Hale announced he would switch parties to run for governor citing his own campaign polling he said showed Moore would be difficult to beat in a primary. The announcement drew a swift critique from Hershey, who questioned Hale’s motives and characterized him as a political opportunist in a statement sent to reporters Wednesday. Hale on Thursday described the statement sent to reporters as “a nasty-gram.”
Hale, in the Thursday morning interview, dismissed Hershey and his criticism.
“And I don’t even care about that guy,” Hale said. “I really don’t. When asked about him, I don’t care.”
Coming together for Western Maryland
Who says bipartisanship is dead?
Well, pretty much everyone, to be honest, but there was a rare example of it out of Washington this week.
That’s when all 10 members of Maryland’s congressional delegation — the nine Democrats and the sole Republican member, 1st District Rep. Andy Harris — put their signatures on a letter to President Donald Trump (R), urging him to declare a federal disaster in Allegany and Washington counties in the wake of severe flooding there in May.
Cost of Western Maryland flood damage more than doubles; state to appeal FEMA aid denial

“Extreme rainfall” from May 12 to 14 in Western Maryland inundated parts of Allegany and Garrett counties, pushing George’s Creek surged to more than 12 feet above major flood stage, while Wills Creek in Cumberland rose 8 feet and the Potomac River also flooded. Midland, Lonaconing and Westernport were among the hardest-hit communities, with floodwaters inundating homes, schools and businesses, washing out roads and damaging pipelines.
The state identified $17.9 million in damages it said qualified for federal relief, but the Federal Emergency Management Agency last month denied the state’s request without explanation. Gov. Wes Moore (D) vowed an appeal which came this week, when he wrote Trump to say the eligible damages now stand at $33.7 million, “nearly triple” the threshhold that would typically qualify the state for federal assistance.
The congressional letter cited Moore’s latest letter, saying the damages “clearly met disaster assistance criteria” established by FEMA. Relief is “necessary and warranted” said the lawmakers, who urged the president to approve a declaration.
“As the new school year begins and winter approaches, we echo the Governor’s concerns that without the requested assistance, the most vulnerable in these communities will be directly impacted,” the lawmaker’s letter said. “These assessments support the need for the requested declaration and assistance…. We urge you to expeditiously review and approve Maryland’s appeal and grant a major disaster declaration for the flooding of May 13, 2025.”
New fiscal year, new faces for pension board
The Maryland State Retirement and Pension System Board of Trustees welcomed three new trustees last week along with a new public adviser to the Investment Committee, as part of what the board touted in a press release as “a refreshed governance structure as of the start of the fiscal year.”
Trustees Vernon A. Reid Jr. and Scott Nicewarner began their terms on July 1, along with Public Advisor Joanna Pratt. Trustee Vickrant Puri began his term on Aug. 1. All were formally welcomed at the Aug. 19 meeting of the board.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“With these appointments, the Board benefits from a rich blend of expertise spanning public service, education, finance and investment management,” System Executive Director Martin Noven said in a prepared statement. “Each new trustee and advisor brings valuable experience that will strengthen our stewardship of the retirement system on behalf of Maryland’s public employees and retirees.”
Puri, a Baltimore County Public Schools personal finance teacher, has prior banking industry expertise and was elected by active and retired members of the Teachers’ Systems. He joins the Investment Committee and the Corporate Governance and Securities Litigation Committee, and his term runs through July 31, 2029.
Reid and Nicewarner both gubernatorial appointees and both serve until June 30, 2029. Reid is retired after decades with T. Rowe Price and will serve on the Administrative Committee. Nicewarner is the Hagerstown city administrator,, and will join the Audit and Administrative committees.
Pratt’s appointment follows the departure of Michael K. Barry. She has more than 20 years of experience managing endowments and foundations, and will provide independent independent expertise managing large investment.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderWhen Georgia Congressman Mike Collins kicked off his 2026 campaign for U.S. Senate this week, many in the  crowd wore shirts emblazoned with stickers featuring his red, white and blue big rig-inspired logo.
More than a few at the rally on Tuesday also wore a rarer adornment: the glossy name tags worn by members of Georgia’s Legislature.
Now weeks into the Jackson Republican’s plan  to unseat Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff, Collin’s campaign is touting endorsements from 40 GOP state senators and representatives.

That might not be surprising except for the presence of two other high-profile candidates in the Republican primary, including one with the backing of Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. The governor was in contact with President Donald Trump to discuss choosing a candidate they could both agree on, though Trump has yet to make an endorsement.
Former University of Tennessee football coach Derek Dooley, son of legendary University of Georgia football coach Vince Dooley, entered the race at the start of the month with Kemp’s backing, joining Collins and U.S. Rep. Buddy Carter.
Lawmakers at the Collins event expressed personal and political  reasons for their support. Many know him personally or knew his father, the late former U.S. Rep. Mac Collins, who served in Congress from 1993 to 2005.
“​​This is probably easiest for me because I live five minutes from Mike,” said state Rep. Clint Crowe, a Republican from Jackson. “This is my hometown. I’ve grown up here. I went to high school with his sister. I go to church with him and his parents. I’ve been friends with the family for most of my life, and so I know Mike and I know who he is and I know where he comes from, so it’s a very easy decision for me to make to support him.”
Others cited the Laken Riley Act, which Collins sponsored and Trump signed into federal law. It expands the government’s power to detain non-citizens, including for non-violent or property crimes. Riley was a 22-year-old student who was murdered last year at the University of Georgia campus in Collins’ district. A Venezuelan man who had entered the U.S. illegally was convicted of her killing and sentenced to life in prison without a chance for parole.
None of the legislators said they had faced pressure from Kemp’s office to support Dooley or not back Collins.
“I haven’t had anybody reach out from Mr. Dooley’s team or from the governor’s office, so I would hope that they would understand my position. If they don’t, my position is not going to change,” Crowe said.
Still a three-man race
Georgia Republican strategist Brian Robinson downplayed the significance of the legislator endorsements in the contest that is still more than eight months away.

Collins’ popularity under the Gold Dome speaks to his political skill and connections, but it’s still early, said Robinson, who is not working with any of the candidates in the race, and even popular politicians can find it difficult to transfer their political capital to another candidate.
Still, Collins is in a good spot, at least at the moment, he added.
“I think Mike Collins is certainly in the pole position, you would have to assume,” he said. “There was a poll out last week that showed him up slightly over Buddy and both about 20 points ahead of Derek Dooley.”
Carter has connections of his own and enough personal wealth to put up a fight, Robinson said, and he’s not counting Dooley out either, especially with the governor’s support — and his financial backing.
“They’re putting some resources into it and providing air cover while Derek builds out his operation, builds out his why for the campaign — why him — and as he fundraises and as he gets around the state to meet people. You can’t do everything at once, and having Kemp spend money on his behalf while he’s doing all that other stuff is hugely important.”
Emory University political science professor Andra Gillespie said Dooley’s “legendary” last name could offer a leg up, and she drew parallels to another recent Republican candidate with ties to football.
  Supporters of Congressman Mike Collins gathered at the Rivers Ranch in Butts County for barbecue and stump speeches. The house was packed tight with a handful of people listening in from a covered patio. The venue website lists the maximum occupancy at 275, but organizers estimated more than 400 people attended. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder.
“I look at the Dooley candidacy as trying to do a better version of Herschel Walker, appeal to primary voters who might be drawn by the name and by their affinity for Georgia football – but hopefully somebody who, you know, has accounted for all of his children and doesn’t make weird comments on the campaign trail.”
Walker, a former UGA and NFL football legend, challenged Democratic U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock in 2022 but fell short in a runoff after a campaign plagued with scandals including acknowledging children he had previously not talked about and allegations of pressuring women he had been in relationships with to get abortions.
During that primary, Trump who was sore at the governor for not backing his false claims of election rigging in 2020. But with a few exceptions, Trump-backed candidates bombed in Georgia in the 2022 primaries.
The Trump effect
Trump’s endorsement may not have been enough for Walker to become a U.S. Senator, but the Republicans vying for Ossoff’s seat are working hard to get the POTUS tap.
Carter went so far as to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, but he’s not likely to get a senate nomination in return, Robinson said.
  President Donald Trump speaks at a rally in Zebulon Oct. 2024. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“Obviously we can assume that Trump is not interested in endorsing Buddy Carter by the fact that Buddy was already in the race when Kemp and Trump were in conversations, and Trump could have said then, ‘I’ll be with Buddy,’ but he didn’t.”
Trump has endorsed Lt. Gov. Burt Jones in his bid for the governor’s mansion, but he’s stayed mum on which Republican he thinks should be  Georgia’s junior senator.
Gillespie said she expects Trump to keep quiet for the time being.
“What I suspect is Trump is going to sit this race out until it’s clear who Republicans want in the state, and then he will just ratify sort of like whoever the frontrunner is by endorsing them, because that’s how he tends to do it,” she said.
Robinson predicts Trump will eventually go with Collins, setting up a new “off again” phase in Trump and Kemp’s on-and-off again relationship.
“It would be my assumption that Trump will endorse Mike Collins at some juncture,” Robinson said. “And you’ll have this proxy war between Kemp and Trump to some degree, if that develops, because Kemp is openly supporting Derek Dooley. The Kemp people feel confident that the Kemp endorsement is influential just like the Trump endorsement is.”

Facing growing pressure from advocacy groups, lawsuits, and climate projections that show hotter days ahead, some state prison systems are moving to install air conditioning and expand cooling measures — although many facilities remain years away from significant upgrades.
But in other states, such efforts have stalled or failed. That may lead to more lawsuits in the future, experts say, even as judges may raise the bar for such cases.
An emphasis on being “tough on crime” and prioritizing other public safety measures may have contributed to less attention on prison conditions in some states. In others, slowing revenue growth and pressure to rein in corrections spending could be making new investments a harder sell.
At least two states this year, Virginia and Texas, considered legislation addressing excessive heat in prisons but neither measure became law. The Texas bill would have required the state Department of Criminal Justice to purchase and install climate control systems in all of its facilities by the end of 2032. About two-thirds of the state’s correctional facilities have only partial or no air conditioning.
The measure passed the House but did not advance in the Senate before the legislature adjourned in June.
In Virginia, lawmakers approved a bill that would have required the state corrections department to install heat and air conditioning in its prisons and to ensure cell temperatures not exceed 80 degrees. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed it, citing the cost of installation and operational burdens. Youngkin wrote that existing state corrections data “does not substantiate the claims of extreme temperatures or health risks.”
But in Delaware, the fiscal year 2026 capital budget approved last month includes $2 million in funding to install air conditioning at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center.
In Florida, legislation to require cooling in prisons over the years have gone nowhere. For example, an inmate bill of rights introduced ahead of the regular legislative session died in the House Criminal Justice Subcommittee without ever going to a vote. A 2023 consultant report estimated it would cost $582 million to install air conditioning in all of Florida’s correctional facilities.
These changes elsewhere mark the latest actions in a long-running debate over how correctional systems respond to rising summer temperatures — an issue that affects both incarcerated people and staff. Some of the policy debates and facility updates this year follow years of advocacy and litigation over the health, safety and operational challenges posed by heat in correctional settings.
Persistent problem
The problem of excessive heat in prisons has persisted for decades and has unfolded alongside other challenges, including chronic understaffing and overcrowding. In some cases, these problems have led to extended facility lockdowns, even during the summer months.
“There are people working in prisons and they have the right to work in climates that are comfortable,” said Nancy La Vigne, a criminal justice researcher and dean of the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University. “When they’re not, there’s retention issues, and it’s hard to replace staff. And when you don’t replace staff, then you have challenges in maintaining the safety and security of the facility.”
In New York, for example, correctional officers staged a three-week strike earlier this year and many didn’t return to work. Some facilities now are operating with 30%-60% fewer guards than needed, resulting in some incarcerated people getting only an hour or two outside of their cells each day.
A 2023 study published in the peer-reviewed PLOS One journal found that mortality in state and private prisons rose during periods of extreme heat, with deaths increasing 3.5% on extreme heat days and up to 7.4% during three-day heat waves. Between 2001 and 2019, nearly 13,000 people died in prison during the summer months, almost half of them in the South, although the study did not determine how many of those deaths were directly attributable to heat.
Climate change is fueling longer, more intense periods of extreme heat. Exposure to extreme heat can worsen conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and asthma, and has also been linked to worsening mental health and higher suicide rates among incarcerated people.
“Average temperatures are rising, and you’re going to have more and more states around the country where incarcerated people are held in conditions that are not livable because they’re too hot,” said Sharon Dolovich, a law professor and director of the Prison Law and Policy Program at the University of California, Los Angeles.
 Some upgrades

At least 44 states lack universal air conditioning within their prison facilities, even in regions known for sweltering summer temperatures, according to a 2022 USA Today analysis. A recent Reuters investigation found that nearly half of state prisons across 29 states have partial or no air conditioning in housing units.
But some states are investing millions to update their prison facilities.
In North Carolina, corrections officials are working toward their goal of installing air conditioning in all 54 state prisons by 2026. To date, 33 facilities are fully air-conditioned, 17 are partially air-conditioned, and four have no air conditioning, according to its dashboard.
In California, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, which operates 31 adult prisons, has spent $246 million in the past five years on cooling improvements at five prisons, according to a department spokesperson.
Lawmakers this year also approved funding for the Air Cooling Pilot Program at three facilities, with $17.6 million allocated for fiscal years 2025-26 and $20 million for fiscal years 2026-27. It will evaluate the effectiveness of two alternatives prior to a statewide plan to address high indoor temperatures across the California prison system.
The Texas Department of Criminal Justice, as of Aug. 1, is building 12,827 “cool beds,” or prison cells in air-conditioned units, and is in the process of procuring an additional 7,162, according to its dashboard.
Texas is one of the states most closely associated with heat-related deaths in prison. A 2022 study estimated that, on average, 14 deaths per year in Texas prisons are associated with heat. And a Texas Tribune analysis found that at least 41 incarcerated people died during a record-breaking heat wave in 2023.
In March, a federal judge ruled the extreme heat in Texas prisons is “plainly unconstitutional,” but declined to order immediate air conditioning, saying the work could not be completed within the court order’s 90-day window and temporary systems might delay a permanent fix.
 ‘More miserable’

Sweltering summer heat can turn prisons into pressure cookers. People inside already may have health conditions, limited access to cooling, or take medications that make it harder for their bodies to handle the heat. And research suggests that high temperatures can heighten irritability and aggression, sometimes fueling more conflicts between incarcerated people or with staff.
“It makes you more miserable. … If you to the point of even thinking about suicide, that’s just going to add to it,” said Ronald McKeithen, who spent 37 years incarcerated in Alabama prisons and is now director of second chances at the Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice. McKeithen recalls feeling “on edge” due to tension among other incarcerated people on hot days.
At the Oshkosh Correctional Institution in Wisconsin, Devin Skrzypchak said the heat worsens his bladder condition, and he often can’t get the incontinence briefs he needs. The heat forces him to drink more water, and on days when ice isn’t available, he’s left drenched in sweat.
“At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating,” Skrzypchak wrote in a message to Stateline through the facility’s messaging platform.
D’Angelo Lee Komanekin — who has spent about 25 years in and out of different Wisconsin corrections facilities — said prison architecture plays a major role in why temperatures inside climb so high.
“The planet is getting hotter and hotter,” said Komanekin, who relies on a small plastic fan to stay cool. Komanekin also is incarcerated at the Oshkosh Correctional Institution. “They’re doing nothing about the architecture. Some institutions’ windows open, some don’t, but most of the doors have steel doors with trap doors.”
Older prison designs that rely heavily on steel and concrete building materials often trap heat, making it difficult to keep temperatures down in the summer. Aging facilities are less likely to be equipped for the installation of central air conditioning.
Some state prison systems, including Alabama’s and Wisconsin’s, are adding air-conditioning or air-tempering systems to new prison construction and major renovation projects.
 Future legal battles

Legal experts say the issue of excessive heat in prisons is likely to become more pressing as climate change drives longer and hotter summers.
Extreme heat in correctional facilities has already been the subject of litigation in dozens of states, with plaintiffs arguing that high temperatures constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Court rulings in these cases have varied, but some experts say even more lawsuits are likely if facilities do not adapt.
“The conditions are going to worsen. [Incarcerated people are] going to be looking for every possible avenue for assistance they can,” Dolovich, the UCLA law professor, told Stateline.
One of the latest cases comes from Missouri, where the nonprofit law firm MacArthur Justice Center filed a class action in May on behalf of six incarcerated people at Algoa Correctional Center.
The lawsuit alleges the conditions violate their constitutional rights under the Eighth Amendment. It seeks to require the Missouri Department of Corrections to work with experts to develop a heat mitigation plan that keeps housing unit temperatures between 65 and 85 degrees. If the department cannot meet that standard, the plaintiffs are asking for the release of three of the incarcerated people who have less than a year remaining on their sentences.
Lawsuits such as the Missouri case often focus on claims that extreme heat worsens existing medical problems. To proceed, they must meet two legal requirements: proving the heat poses a serious health or safety risk, and showing prison officials knew about the danger but failed to address it, according to Dolovich, whose work has focused on the Eighth Amendment and prison conditions.
Courts may also raise the bar for proving such claims if judges echo decisions in cases with similar Eight Amendment arguments related to the death penalty and homelessness, Dolovich said. Judges have shifted, she said, toward a “superadding terror, pain and disgrace” standard under the Eighth Amendment — a higher threshold requiring proof that conditions were created with the intent to cause unnecessary suffering.
Dolovich added that some recent court decisions have provided only narrow remedies, such as ordering ice and fans instead of installing air conditioning.
“Prison officials have a moral and a constitutional responsibility to respond to changing conditions. In this case, it means air conditioning. … Anything less than that, to me, is indefensible.” she said.

Salcedo,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/22/americas-dirty-war-just-say-no/,"The parallels between Argentina's ""Dirty War"" and the one ongoing in the United States could not be more clear.","I don’t know about you, but I believe our second American Civil War already started.  It’s a so-called soft, and to date, generally a bloodless war — only about 150 years since the truly bloody first American Civil War of 1861-1865 ended.
To win his second term, Donald Trump promised to end of the Ukraine War on Day One, to lower grocery and gas prices right away, to stop inflation and to carry out retribution.  Now, the picture is more clear, more cruel, more likely than not that we are racing towards a complete destruction of the rule of law and the U.S. Constitution.
Opposition political parties, the free press and vocal community leaders have not been rounded up under mass arrest — yet.  It may be around the corner. I’m hoping not.  But already, highly qualified and capable women and minority top military leaders were the first to go.  The retribution will keep ratcheting up.
Today I don’t want to expound on predictions about the downward spiral and probable end of the Great American experiment in democracy, one that has lasted almost 250 years as the global standard.  I see that we have almost completely lost the checks and balances of our form of government. It is barely limping toward its semi- quincentennial birthday unless that trajectory is stopped and reversed by a people power –People United Revolt (again, hopefully peaceful and bloodless) to restore an open and fair democracy once again by all, of all and for all.
Today I prefer to focus on the little guys like me and on my reaction to a news article I read recently. It was about ICE offering new recruits –projected to be about 80,000 strong — a $50,000 signing bonus and possible six-figure salary plus a college loan forgiveness package. These are things not offered to other Americans who do the most important work in our society for our collective safety and prosperity like first responders, nurses, teachers, caretakers of our sick and elderly, and many others.  These professions can expect salary cuts, layoffs and zero federal support as they toil daily for the common weal of our nation.
In 1989 I was a 33-year-old mid-grade U.S. Naval Reserve Intelligence Officer serving my obligatory “weekend warrior” two-weeks of active duty annual tour in Argentina’s major naval base in Puerto Belgrano.  One morning, as I rushed out of the officer’s club front door where I was billeted, I almost brushed elbows with an Argentine naval officer who the U.S. Embassy driver waiting for me outside identified as the “Blond Angel of Death.”
Who?
Alfredo Astiz is not a household name in the United States, but in Argentina he is the famed, handsome, blond Navy Special Forces officer who led heroically and gloriously the capture of the South Georgia Island from the British setting the stage for the Falklands/Malvinas War of 1982.

Former Argentina’s navy captain Alfredo Astiz, known as the “Blonde Angel of Death,”who was sentenced to life in prison for torture, murder and human rights abuses in October 2011, attends a new trial, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Nov. 28, 2012.  Credit: AP Photo/Eduardo Di Baia
Today his story is on the internet.  Astiz, now 74, has been languishing in jail for extra-judicial crimes he and his comrades-in-arms committed in their blind fervor to “save Argentina,” then under military rule.  It would take almost 35 years of Argentine national anguish and debate — and international judicial wrangling –to finally bring Astiz and his cohorts to justice for their illegal and criminal acts committed under the guise of “saving our country.”
The parallels today could not be clearer from across the United States of America. There are daily reports on audio and video recordings and victims’/witnesses’ statements about the extra-judicial abuses by unidentified, combat-ready armed, masked personnel who claim to have some vague legal authority from even more questionable government or para-governmental agencies. It will happen one day — maybe not next year, not in five, 10, 20 or 30 years — but it will happen that these horrific stories of human rights abuses and deliberate violations of current laws will be pieced together. They will unmask who the perpetrators are and what they did, what laws they violated in their blind belief in leaders who will not be there to support them for their careless, illegal and inhumane actions during this current, amorphous mission to  “keep America safe.”
Like Alfredo Astiz, they will be left to fend for themselves.  Like Argentina then, the United States now is struggling with itself.  Like Argentina in 1976, we may even lose our democracy, but it will be back — like Argentina did, fighting valiantly, for 35 years under great pain, to restore its democracy.  
If they are 22, 32 or 42 now, the potential new ICE recruits will be only 57, 67 or 77 in 2060.  Want an unprecedented, irresistible $50,000 signing bonus, potential six-figure salary, loan forgiveness plan just to fight America’s very open, clumsy, notorious, not-so-secret Dirty War? 
I would resist. And just say no.

Alaska’s current subsistence fishing program can continue without changes, according to a Wednesday opinion by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
The ruling allows the federal government to continue offering preferential fishing rights to rural Alaskans — mostly Alaska Natives — who live a subsistence lifestyle. 
That preference exists only in public waters under federal control, not in state waters, because federal law requires the preference but the Alaska Constitution forbids state officials from implementing it. 
In their 40-page opinion, the judges said that recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings do not mandate a change in the way the state and federal governments split management of fish and game in Alaska.
Alaska Attorney General Treg Taylor said in an emailed statement that he was disappointed but not surprised by the appeals court’s decision and implied that the issue will be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Attorneys representing the state of Alaska had argued that new Supreme Court precedents — in particular, a 2019 case involving an Alaska man and his hovercraft — mean that the state alone has the power to manage subsistence fishing in Alaska’s navigable waters.
In 2021, attempting to implement that belief, the state issued fishing orders on the Kuskokwim River that contradicted the instructions of federal managers. The federal government sued the state the following year, and Alaska Native groups, including the Alaska Federation of Natives, sided with the federal government. Last year, U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason ruled in the federal government’s favor, but the state appealed to the 9th Circuit.
A ruling in the state’s favor would have ended the so-called Katie John system, named after an Alaska Native woman who served as the lead plaintiff in three key court decisions that define how Alaska fish and game are managed today.
“Although Katie John, the Ahtna woman who advocated for subsistence fishing rights on behalf of Alaska Natives, has since passed away, the precedent that bears her name lives on,” wrote Judge Consuelo Callahan, a George W. Bush appointee, on behalf of the three-judge panel.
At the core of the issue is whether the federal government or the state of Alaska have authority to regulate fishing in navigable waters that flow through federal parks, preserves and reserves.
In 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the federal government could not prevent a man named John Sturgeon from using his hovercraft on the Nation River, located within the Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve, because the river didn’t count as “public land” under the 1980 Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act.
At the time, the court said in a footnote to that decision that the Katie John decisions, which settled subsistence management, were “not at issue in this case, and we therefore do not disturb the Ninth Circuit’s holdings that the Park Service may regulate subsistence fishing on navigable waters.” 
Sturgeon himself told the Anchorage Daily News that he was glad that his case didn’t touch on Katie John. 
But within two years, the state was preparing to take unilateral control over subsistence fishing on rural rivers within parks and preserves, and in particular the Kuskokwim River, where federal fisheries managers had restricted fishing due to low returns.
They imposed fishing limitations. The state didn’t. That mattered because under the state’s rules, anyone in Alaska has subsistence fishing rights. An Alaska resident who flies from Anchorage to Bethel to fish has the same right to fish as someone who lives in Bethel. Under the federal system, the person in Bethel has priority.
Alaska Native groups were alarmed. After the federal government filed suit, the Kuskokwim River Intertribal Fish Commission intervened on the side of the federal government, as did the Association of Village Council Presidents, which represents tribal governments throughout Southwest Alaska.
Ahtna Inc., the regional Native Corp. in the eastern Interior, also intervened even though it had no direct connection to the Kuskokwim River fishery. Instead, it feared broader implications across the state.
So too did the Alaska Federation of Natives, which joined the case later.
Nathaniel Amdur-Clark, who represented the intertribal fish commission, called Wednesday’s opinion “a really big win for tribes and for Alaska Native people” because the federal government can offer the rural subsistence preference and because the federal government has traditionally managed fisheries with extensive tribal input.
The Alaska Constitution requires “maximum sustained yield” for fisheries, and Amdur-Clark said that tends to favor commercial and recreational fishermen, not subsistence users.
“Continuing federal management is akin to — or also includes — continuing tribal management, and that’s a really good thing,” Amdur-Clark said.
While the lawsuit only involved navigable waters, Amdur-Clark said that’s where the majority of subsistence fishing takes place.  
Erin Dougherty Lynch, an attorney with the Native American Rights Fund, represented the Association of Village Council Presidents and some other plaintiffs.
She said it’s important to see the case as part of a broader trend with the state, which has also sought to curtail subsistence hunting management by the federal government. 
“This case is situated within their statehood defense project. It’s a series of cases they’ve intentionally brought to push back against the federal government,” she said.
Among the attorneys representing the state is John Michael Connolly of Consovoy McCarthy, a national firm hired by the state at high cost for its expertise at the U.S. Supreme Court.
Scott Kendall, an attorney representing the Alaska Federation of Natives, said that he hasn’t heard anything from the state directly, “but we have every reason to believe they intend to take this on (to the Supreme Court). I think the state should probably let it be, because it’s been this way for decades. People are relatively satisfied, and that’s been the law of the land, but we won’t be surprised if the state continues.”
Taylor, the attorney general, is resigning on Aug. 29 and is expected to announce a run for governor in the near future. 
About the case, he said by email, “Although the 9th Circuit clearly recognized that prior case law is inconsistent with the recent Supreme Court case, it was unwilling to do the hard work of actually overturning its own case law and properly reconciling the meaning of ‘public lands’ in ANILCA. This continues the unworkable dual management approach to our fisheries to the detriment of sustainable management of our fisheries for all rural subsistence users. The fish don’t adhere to borders, and our fisheries management shouldn’t either. I am disappointed but not surprised. We always knew this case would need to be decided at the highest level.”

The Dollar Lake Fire on the northern end of Wyoming’s Wind River Mountains was reported at 2:16 p.m. about 8 miles north of Kendall and forced the evacuation of campers.
The post Western Wyoming fire explodes to 600 acres, closing Green River Lakes Road and prompting evacuations appeared first on WyoFile .","A fast-moving wildfire along the Bridger-Teton National Forest road to Green River Lakes exploded to 600 acres in about four hours Thursday, closing the road and forcing the evacuation of campers in the area.
First reported at 2:16 p.m. Thursday, the Dollar Lake Fire quickly sent up a thick column of smoke. Sublette County emergency managers issued an emergency notice within an hour of the fire’s detection.
“If you are in the area please evacuate immediately,” the notice read.
“I just see a whole slew of vehicles coming down the road — campers with canoes, bicycles.” Mark Domek
Dollar Lake is about eight miles north of the community of Kendall. The evacuation notice appears aimed at campers.
Dollar Lake is at the northernmost end of the Wind River Mountains along a 25-mile dirt and gravel road that follows the Green River through the national forest. The road is a popular camping and recreation site. Officials placed restrictions on campfires in the area on Aug. 12.
Near Kendall, resident Mark Domek could see the smoke and a stream of traffic leaving the national forest.
“I just see a whole slew of vehicles coming down the road,” he said, “campers with canoes, bicycles.” Emergency responders at the road closure told him Green River Lakes campground was being evacuated, Domek said.
“It’s putting up quite a bit of black smoke,” he said. “When the smoke’s that black it’s definitely eating some timber up, from my experience of fighting fires years ago.”

Sublette County Emergency Management estimated the acreage just before 6 p.m. Thursday. “Resources are engaged on the Dollar Lake Fire,” fire managers said. They rate the fire danger for the region as “very high.”
Teton Interagency Fire defines that rating as an environment in which fires “start very easily and spread at a very fast rate.” The multi-agency group says fires can start from all causes, can spread rapidly and intensify quickly.
“Fires burning in heavy fuels may quickly develop high-intensity characteristics, such as long-distance spotting and fire whirlwinds,” according to the definition. “Direct attack at the head of such fires is rarely possible after they have been burning more than a few minutes.”
Restrictions on fires in the region prohibit lighting, building, maintaining, attending or using a fire, including charcoal fires. An exception allows fires in permanent metal or concrete fire pits or grates that the Forest Service has constructed and maintained at developed recreation sites. Camping stoves that can be turned off are allowed, with some restrictions.
Domek, a self-employed logger and sawmill operator, said he’s ready should the fire spread.
“I’ve got a pump all ready to go and a dozer to protect my neighbors,” he said.

Part One described the emergency effort to rescue Washington state’s last population of Snake River spring and summer Chinook salmon, in the Tucannon River. Part Two explored salmon and steelhead extinction threshold science, showing the Pacific Northwest is entering extinction momentum that will be very difficult to escape.
For Northwest salmon people, grim news and hope seem always intermingled. My previous article held grim news – extinction science, and extinction in motion in the Grande Ronde River. In Part Three, I wish to give the Grande Ronde’s hope its due.

Everyone I spoke with in northeast Oregon, native and non-, raised, and praised, the systematic river and watershed restoration underway in the Grande Ronde and Imnaha since the mid-1990s. More such work has been completed, and is underway, in the Grande Ronde/Imnaha than any other salmon landscape in the Snake River Basin.
The good done reaches well beyond healthier streams.
Tribal restoration projects are many and often large
“All of it is a big source of hope for me,” Bobby Fossek says. “My own project is what I’d call small scale, but I see the connections right up to the biggest ones. At Bird Track Springs, for example, the whole atmosphere of the place is charged now. I can see and feel it, and it’s just beginning.”
Bird Track Springs is the site of a completed project that is now completing itself in the river, restoring sinuosity, vital winter and summer habitat, and freer passage to a pinched and degraded 1.9 mile section of the Upper Grande Ronde River. The Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (CTUIR) sponsored and led the work, with nine co-sponsors, including the cooperating landowner, Jordan Creek Ranch. The cost was $2.5 million.
Bird Track Springs is on Highway 244, just a few miles off the freeway at the Hilgard exit above La Grande. It is signed. The Tribes’ scene-setting and description, on the short walk to the river and an overlook, is very good, with tribal, historical, and river/salmon context in map, image, art and word.
“I’ve seen the project; it looks good,” John Appleton told me. “It’s going to create cooler water and deeper pools.”
With so few salmon in the Upper Grande Ronde now, no hatchery nearby, and little fishing pressure, Appleton says the upper river could almost be called an informal salmon sanctuary for the few salmon that still manage to get there.
The Confederated Umatilla Tribes lead many other restoration projects in the Upper Grande Ronde and Catherine Creek. Rick George calls the Tribes’ McCoy Creek project “a phenomenal success.”
The Tribes also acquired the Southern Cross Ranch, three miles southeast of Union, on ¾-mile of Catherine Creek with 68 acres of historic floodplain.  It is now being restored for channel function, sinuosity, riparian health, floodplain connectivity, and the benefit of Three First Foods – water, salmon and deer.

In Wallowa Country and the Imnaha, the Nez Perce Tribe leads on similar projects. Emmit Taylor Jr., director of the Nez Perce Tribe’s Department of Fisheries’ Resources’ Watershed Division, offered a quick list.
“There’s the Wallowa River work at Tamkaliks, where we put in side channels and revegetated,” he said. “There’s a half-mile project on the Lostine River, at the town of Lostine. It was straight and constrained, most of the habitat gone. We removed levees, re-meandered, and put in side channels. This year we’re planting thousands of trees. It is our goal to see salmon spawn there again.”
A larger project is getting close to going in Chesnimnus Creek, tributary to Joseph Creek.

	“This is 11 to 15 miles of stream, and a very big deal for fish,” Taylor said. “The listed steelhead above it have never been supplemented. We’re working with many landowners, and the Forest Service, on many actions – cattle exclusions, riparian plantings, stream reconstruction, putting wood in the streams, and others. Design is underway, we hope to start work in a year or so. Joseph Creek is steep and largely inaccessible; that’s why it’s a steelhead stronghold. But where it is accessible this work will really improve stream conditions and fisheries habitat.”
Taylor and his team are also part of the Tribe’s long effort, with Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and others, to secure fish passage at Wallowa Lake Dam. That is the only large dam in the Grande Ronde and Imnaha basins.
In addition to Tamkaliks, the Tribe has acquired or been gifted other properties – for example, 140 acres near Joseph, at what Mr. Taylor calls the Place of Boulders. From its Joseph office, Nez Perce Fisheries staff work across Wallowa Country to keep water in streams, repair habitats, restore fish passage and rebuild Nez Perce use of these homelands.
A restoration and a journey at Ascension School Camp and Conference Center
Bobby Fossek’s project at Ascension School is small in comparison, yet large on its terms.
Ascension School Camp and Conference Center, in Cove, Oregon, is the spiritual center of the Episcopal Diocese of Eastern Oregon. The diocese includes 19 churches in eastern, central and southern Oregon.

“Ascension’s mission is to be a place apart, to connect with God’s sacred mystery,” said Amy Jayne, a priest, who serves as the center’s director.  “Our principles are human dignity, creation care and spirituality. Our summer camp for children is 100 years old. We are a full-service outdoor facility, a retreat and conference center, and a community center to serve Cove.”
Three Catherine Creek tributaries – Duncan, Hulick and Mill creeks – roughly bound the School’s 100 acres. Eighty acres are being restored.
“Ascension sits on an old village site called Wiweeletitpe, Place of Many Streams,” Fossek said. “It has been farmed since the mid-1800s, much of the native flora and fauna removed, and the anadromous fish streams straightened and diverted into irrigation ditches. We are working to restore many of the First Foods, Medicines and Materials that historically grew here and that our people have a deep relationship with. Along with it, we are revitalizing skills and lifeways that are part of this landscape, with tribal cultural skills camps on the site.”

	Camas Camp, for example, immerses young native people in gathering, cooking, and sharing camas. A public nature trail also now ribbons the site.
Fossek attended Ascension Camp as a boy and was maintenance man when Amy Jayne became its director six years ago.
“Bobby led us to see we can’t heal the land without assisting the healing of its original caretakers,” Jayne said.
This led to a relationship with Caretakers of the Land, which Fossek and Brosnan Spencer founded “to steward and strengthen the lifeways, languages, habitats, and traditional ecological knowledge of the Blue Mountain bioregion …”

	“We provide Caretakers administrative support, but they have considerable autonomy,” Jayne says. “They have a deep relationship with the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, and those Tribes have events here. There’s a three-day CTUIR symposium this year. The Nez Perce have had an event here too, through Caretakers. I hope the elders and others visiting will recognize Ascension as a shared space. We want to help native people live again in their seasonal rounds.”
For the diocese, it is a journey. In 2022, at its annual convention, the Episcopal Diocese of Eastern Oregon formally repudiated the “doctrine of discovery,” the religious and legal basis upon which the Grande Ronde and Wallowa Country, including Ascension Camp’s 100 acres, were taken from tribal people by the United States and its citizens.
“There is wonderful support here,” Jayne says. “But there is also pushback.  Absolutely nothing is settled in this work. The past systems are massive and in place. It takes a lot of work so people understand what we’re doing, and so we understand them. We forge ahead, and go slowly.”
I asked Fossek if it is fair to see his work, including the Ascension restoration, in three parts: restoring health to ecosystems, building relations with neighbors and communities, and restoring tribal presence and use:  “Yes. They are branches from the same tree – the web of life in this valley.”
A small project gives young fish a place to ‘rest and grow’
David Baum’s little project on Catherine Creek is the first restoration I heard about. Mr. Baum is a retired lawyer, fisherman and kayaker.

	He vividly remembers salmon coming steadily through his grandmother’s place on Catherine Creek in the 1950s. A decade ago, he did a five-acre restoration on the creek, at a different property he owned.
“I worked with Grande Ronde Model Watershed to put in a side channel,” Baum says. “I wanted to build some habitat where overwintering juvenile salmon can rest and grow. It’s still there.”
Bonneville Power Administration ratepayers contributed $117,000 of the project cost, and Baum $3,000, says the project description on the Grande Ronde Model Watershed website.

To get a feel for all the restoration work done and underway across 3.1 million acres of land and water over three decades, visit the Grande Ronde Model Watershed website: www.grmw.org.


In Catherine Creek alone, 38 separate projects, including Baum’s, are listed on the Grande Ronde Model Watershed website from 1995 through 2021. The Confederated Umatilla Tribes are a frequent lead and partner on Catherine Creek, as is the Union County Soil and Water District.
Projects include restored fish passage, restored seasonal flows, riparian habitat re-creation, re-meandered channels, restored pools, better irrigation systems, bridging/fencing/culverting and more.
Kyle Bratcher’s agency is active as well.
“In my Wallowa and Imnaha territory, the main restoration practitioners are Grande Ronde Model Watershed, the Nez Perce Tribe, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, and Trout Unlimited,” he said. “We were a lead on the McDaniel Ranch project, as of course was Doug McDaniel, who did so much for restoration in Wallowa Country.”
McDaniel helped begin Wallowa Resources, which is also active in land and water restoration; Joe McCormack serves on its board.
“Trout Unlimited has done a lot of work in the upper Grande Ronde,” says Noel March, who grew up in La Grande and now works for the group. “In Sheep Creek, for example, about an hour upstream of La Grande, we’ve reversed a lot of historical damage.

	“Among current projects, we’re in Chesnimnus Creek too, just above the Nez Perce project, working with the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest. In six miles of stream, we’re removing levees, returning those spawning gravels to the stream, and depositing large wood. It will give beaver a leg up.”
Together, says March, the Nez Perce and Trout Unlimited projects “will soon be a large, connected corridor of high-quality steelhead habitat.”  March gives particular credit to the many landowners working with the Nez Perce, and to Mr. Taylor’s field staff.
Land and canal owners are often, like Mr. Baum, project sponsors.
“It is real,” says Rick George, “how many landowners are now giving permission to restore waters on their lands, and are supportive of salmon.  They want to reconnect land and water. There are still gaping wounds on this landscape; nothing can turn around all the water conversion and draining in the valleys anytime soon. But there is also change.”
The Grande Ronde Model Watershed calls itself “the primary entity coordinating habitat restoration on private and public lands within the Grande Ronde Basin.” It was created in 1992-3, when the Northwest Power and Conservation Council chose the Grande Ronde as Oregon’s “model watershed” for spawning and rearing habitat restoration.
Bonneville Power Administration ratepayers were starting then to extensively finance such work. Grande Ronde Model Watershed has been a conduit for millions of Bonneville ratepayer dollars to repair Grande Ronde and Imnaha watersheds, while developing funding from other sources too.

	The CTUIR and Nez Perce Tribe each have seats on the Grande Ronde Model Watershed board. Joe McCormack represents the Nez Perce.
“In the early to mid-2000s, GRMW studied all the streams,” he said. “The Upper Grande Ronde and Catherine Creek were in the worst shape, and needed habitat work the most then.”
Kyle Bratcher says: “ODFW helped develop the restoration atlases that prioritize watersheds and places. The Model Watershed holds monthly meetings of the implementors. It is a very big group and a very collaborative effort.”
The Model Watershed also engages students, volunteers and organizations in citizen science.
Ascension School students are in the program. It helps that one week of outdoor school is a fifth grade requirement in Oregon. Kyle Bratcher’s wife, Emily, organizes and teaches youth science education, separately but overlapping with the Model Watershed’s program.
“She takes kids to the projects,” he said. “It’s a great way to teach them about fish and rivers, and spark their interest. They see fish spawning.”
Altogether, an impressively broad local network – tribes and tribal people, agencies local state and federal, ranchers and other landowners, fishers and the conservation-minded, churches, schools, businesses and nonprofits – is restoring waters and lands, public and private, at scales small to large, in the Grande Ronde and Imnaha watersheds. (The Powder River Basin Watershed Council, does similar work with far less resources in the Snake River watershed adjacent on the south. The Powder is without salmon, thanks to impassable dams constructed in Hells Canyon 60 years ago.)
How to restore both salmon habitats, and salmon
Salmon have this quality: People come to them by many paths, and are hooked.
If, as seems likely, federal investments in northeast Oregon now shrivel for a time, it is plain the local restoration work will continue even if slowed. The tribal, community and economic investment is too rooted, and the local good being done too substantial.
But the extinction threshold analyses make a second plain fact plainer.  Watershed repair and renewal in the Grande Ronde and Imnaha will restore natal salmon habitats, but under current conditions in migratory habitats outside the Grande Ronde, it will not restore salmon.



It is real how many landowners are now giving permission to restore waters on their lands, and are supportive of salmon. They want to reconnect land and water. There are still gaping wounds on this landscape; nothing can turn around all the water conversion and draining in the valleys anytime soon. But there is also change.


– Rick George


The riches salmon once gave the Grande Ronde and its people, Rick George’s ocean nutrient freight train, are close to disappearing despite three decades of sustained local river restorations. If all this good work is to achieve its harvest, and community goals for salmon in the Grande Ronde, off-site restoration of equally vital habitat – in this case, over-dammed migratory habitat – must occur soon.
Here I believe the Nez Perce Tribe and Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife have the right three-part response.
They are leading in extinction science and its applications for salmon and steelhead populations at extinction’s door.
They are leaders to responsibly restore 140 miles of the lower Snake River and its habitats, by removing the earthen sections of its four dams, within an inclusive and phased Columbia Basin-wide approach developed by the “Six Sovereigns”: the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, Nez Perce Tribe and Oregon, plus the Yakama Nation, Confederated Warm Springs Tribes, and Washington.
And they are active co-collaborators restoring health and habitats in the Grande Ronde and Imnaha watersheds.

(Pool photo by Bethany Baker/The Salt Lake Tribune) In what is being described as the “last big hurdle” before his Sept. 5 execution, attorneys for death row inmate Ralph Menzies argued before the Utah Supreme Court that the state should pause proceedings and give the 67-year-old convicted killer with dementia another review to see if he is competent.  
Menzies — sentenced to die by firing squad for the 1986 kidnapping and murder of 26-year-old Maurine Hunsaker — is running out of appeals. His death warrant has been signed, the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole recently denied him clemency and his execution is now almost two weeks away. 
But the state’s high court could still force the Utah Department of Corrections to pause proceedings and grant Menzies another evaluation to determine whether he’s competent. 
During a hearing on Thursday, Menzies’ attorneys made what could be their last case for sparing his life, while the Utah Attorney General’s Office argued they haven’t met the requirements for granting Menzies another competency review.

For much of the last year, Menzies’ attorneys have claimed his dementia makes him incompetent to be executed — per state and federal law, an inmate must understand the state’s reasoning for pursuing the death penalty. In June, 3rd District Court Judge Matthew Bates ruled that Menzies, despite having dementia, is competent. 
His attorneys then submitted a petition for another competency evaluation, claiming that Menzies’ mental condition had deteriorated, fueled by a hypoxic event, which is when the brain doesn’t get enough oxygen. For someone with dementia, like Menzies, his attorneys say a hypoxic event can worsen the symptoms. 
Bates denied the petition, writing there wasn’t enough compelling evidence to grant Menzies another review. On Thursday, Menzies’ attorneys said Bates’ ruling was wrong, and that because of the pending appeal, the court should pause proceedings. 
Central to their arguments was the legal principle “prima facie,” which essentially means there is enough evidence before the court for a case to move forward. During the roughly two-hour hearing, Lindsey Layer, one of Menzies’ attorneys, said they’ve shown through expert evaluations that there is ample evidence to suggest Menzies meets the threshold outlined in state code to grant him another review.
“He was unable to answer what he was charged with. That is new,” Layer said, referring to recent evaluations where experts asked Menzies if he understood the state’s reason for executing him. “He repeated the same thing, over and over again.” 
And, the nature of dementia means Menzies’ cognitive abilities will continue to decline. 
“He is only getting worse. That is the only trajectory of his illness, to get worse over time until it is ultimately fatal,” she said. 
Utah Board of Pardons and Parole denies death row inmate Ralph Menzies’ plea for clemency

Attorneys for the state, however, told the supreme court justices that there isn’t enough evidence to grant another competency evaluation. State code sets a high bar, requiring allegations of a substantial change in circumstances — and those allegations “must raise a significant question” about the inmate’s competency.
Daniel Boyer with the Utah Attorney General’s Office argued Menzies’ attorneys have not satisfied those requirements. 
“There needs to be a greater level of specificity” to Menzies’ claims, Boyer said, adding that some of the allegations of decline happened before Bates made his initial ruling in June — before the request for another evaluation. 
“Here, the alleged events that demonstrated a significant decline occurred months before we even had oral arguments on the first petition,” Boyer said.
The five members of the Utah Supreme Court — which on Thursday included 2nd District Judge Ronald Russel sitting in place of Justice John Pearce, who was recused — pressed attorneys on both sides during the hearing. 
The court took the matter under advisement. It’s unclear when they will rule, although prior rulings have been issued roughly a week after arguments. 
Matt Hunsaker, Maurine’s son who has been a spokesperson for the family, told reporters after the hearing that this is the “last big hurdle” in the decadeslong case. 
“If he’s not executed on Sept. 5, they’re not going to execute him,” said Hunsaker. “I’ll give up.”

Taylor, who became the state’s top attorney in 2021 after his two immediate predecessors resigned in disgrace, is expected by political observers to join a competitive field of candidates running for governor in the state’s 2026 general election.
Incumbent Gov. Mike Dunleavy is term-limited and unable to run for reelection, leaving the office open to challengers.
This week, former Alaska Revenue Commissioner Adam Crum formally confirmed his plans to run for governor, and former state Sen. Tom Begich became the first Democrat to announce a run for the office. Bruce Walden of Palmer, who ran as a write-in candidate in 2022, filed for the office on Wednesday.
In addition to Crum and Walden, seven other Republicans have filed documents for a campaign: former state Sen. Click Bishop of Fairbanks; current state Sen. Shelley Hughes of Palmer, Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom of Eagle River; Matanuska-Susitna Borough Mayor Edna DeVries; podiatrist Matt Heilala of Anchorage; former teacher James William Parkin IV of Angoon; and business owner Bernadette Wilson of Anchorage.
No independents have filed for the office, and Begich is the only Democrat who has filed.
While Taylor has not formally stated that he will run for governor, he has participated in a significant number of non-state events that appear to foreshadow a campaign.
Next Thursday, he was scheduled to join other Republican attorneys general in Anchorage at an event hosted by the Anchorage Republican Women’s Club. It wasn’t immediately clear whether that event would still take place.
In a written statement, Dunleavy thanked Taylor for his service and noted that he will end his career as the third-longest-serving attorney general in state history. In the same statement, Taylor thanked the employees of the Department of Law. 
During four and a half years as attorney general, Taylor has tended to favor Christian conservative and Republican causes, aligning the state legally with other Republican attorneys general.
In 2022, Taylor helped fundraising efforts for a Republican group that ran ads opposing more moderate members of the state House and Senate in that year’s elections. Taylor’s family has backed efforts that would allow state homeschool funding to be used for tuition at private and religious schools. 
Earlier this year, Taylor’s travel itinerary drew scrutiny after it was revealed that a corporate-funded group had paid at least $20,000 for a trip to France for Taylor and his wife.
Taylor’s time in office has corresponded with a drop in violent and sexual crime within the state.  Alaska ranks among the worst states in the nation for both categories of crimes.
Dunleavy is expected to appoint an acting attorney general on or before Aug. 29.

Democrats are searching for a leader to take on President Trump. Gov. Gavin Newsom embraced that role with new online trolling and a proposed gerrymander to counter a GOP power play in Texas.



As a partisan redistricting war ramps up across the country, Gov. Gavin Newsom has made himself the general of the Democratic insurgency.
The plan to redraw California’s congressional districts to favor Democrats originated as a farfetched retaliatory taunt to Texas on Newsom’s extracurricular podcast. By last week, the governor was headlining a campaign launch rally for the proposal.
Through flashy photo ops, social media trolling and an increasingly pugnacious posture against President Donald Trump, Newsom tied himself to the California redistricting so intrinsically that some are calling it the “Gavinmander.” He’s enjoying a newfound folk hero status among loyal Democrats that could boost a widely expected bid for the presidency in 2028.
“It’s the fearlessness, the fight. I can’t underscore that enough,” said Christale Spain, chair of the Democratic Party in South Carolina, a longtime early primary state. “In this time of Trump 2.0, folks are just looking for a fighter.”
Now, with the outcome of Newsom’s redistricting plan in the hands of the voters in a November special election, his fortunes could rise and fall with his ballot measure.
For Newsom, the goodwill would be punctured by a belly flop on the ballot. For the redistricting proposal, public sentiment about the governor may ultimately be more determinative than lofty arguments about fair elections or protecting democracy.
Opponents are already framing the plan as a power grab by Newsom that undermines the will of the voters — playing on a long-simmering suspicion among Californians that the governor has his eye on the national prize more than solving the state’s problems.
“He’s clearly decided to do this to further his presidential ambitions. He wants to be seen as the person fighting Trump and to galvanize the Democratic base behind him,” Assembly Republican Leader James Gallagher of Chico said. “It’s not about some greater cause. It’s about him and his image and his ambitions.”
Newsom defends the California redistricting as an emergency measure to neutralize Trump’s attempts to rig the outcome of the 2026 midterms.
Earlier this summer, Trump pressured Texas Republicans to redraw the state’s congressional lines to shore up the narrow GOP majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. Their map, which is on track for final approval this week, creates five new Republican-leaning seats — an advantage that could be offset, if the voters approve, by five more Democratic-leaning districts in California.
“It’s not the rule of law, it’s the rule of Don. And we’re standing up to that,” Newsom said Thursday at a press conference where he signed the proclamation declaring the Nov. 4 special election.
“I’m concerned about what Donald Trump is doing,” he told reporters later, “and to the extent that we can provide a pathway to get support for this initiative, I’m going to continue doing everything in my power.”
Newsom’s redistricting risk
Critics, and even some supporters, warn that redistricting is a high-stakes gamble for Newsom. Independent redistricting is popular with California voters.
Newsom, meanwhile, has faced sluggish approval ratings throughout his governorship — though he often gets a lift when in direct confrontation with Trump. 
If the ballot measure becomes another referendum on Newsom and then fails in November, it would be a black eye for the governor. Gallagher said it would be “the death knell for his political career.”
But for now Newsom is reaping the rewards of jumping into the fray.
While national Democrats and other liberal states wavered about how to counter Trump, Newsom propelled California into an unprecedented special election in a matter of weeks. It once again made him the national face of the anti-Trump resistance, a position that Newsom has cultivated throughout his governorship but which he set aside earlier this year as he sought the president’s help responding to devastating wildfires in Los Angeles County.
Michael Kolenc, a Democratic political consultant based in Houston, said California’s response is now part of nearly every local story he reads about the Texas redistricting.
“People are appreciative that someone is out there having their back,” he said. “We want someone or something to fight, not fold, in the face of authoritarianism. And I think California and Newsom are filling that void.”
In South Carolina, which Newsom visited last month, Spain said the governor’s response is providing an education for Democrats, who worry Trump will also pressure their overwhelmingly Republican state into redrawing congressional lines.
“This is exactly what Democrats in South Carolina have been waiting for, someone to punch back,” Spain said. “They are inspired by it.”
Kolenc said the breakthrough beyond the state’s borders raises Newsom’s reputation not just with Democratic voters he would need in a presidential primary but also with the insider crowd — advisers, staff, donors, endorsers — who may want to be on his campaign team.
And even if voters ultimately reject the gambit, Kolence said he doesn’t see a downside for Newsom, who can still say he was on the frontlines defending the country against Trump.
“At the end of the day, he’s getting attention, which is what he needs and wants,” Kolenc said.
Trolling in President Trump’s style
In recent weeks, Newsom has taken the battle to the digital sphere in a new way. His social media accounts, and those of his press office, post a relentless stream of fiery rejoinders to the president: aping Trump’s quirky, all-caps style, mocking his looks and his masculinity, and accusing him of cheating to win.
The frankly ridiculous posts — have you seen the AI-generated painting of Kid Rock, Tucker Carlson and the late Hulk Hogan praying over Newsom? — are bringing even more focus to the governor. Fox News commentators have spent considerable time lately wringing their hands over the heavy-handed parody of Trump.

But delighted Democrats argue that it’s effectively making the case for redistricting by reminding voters of the stakes for California, which is frequently in Trump’s crosshairs, if Republicans retain unified control of the federal government.
“A lot of voters also think both parties are the same. And they’re not. The reality is we’re trying to stop what is happening,” state Sen. Aisha Wahab, a Fremont Democrat, said. “Honestly, this is probably what a lot of people think but don’t necessarily say.”
Wahab said the viral trolling is cutting through the apathy that typically surrounds special elections and allowing Newsom to connect with younger voters, as well as Democrats who have felt powerless as Trump swiftly reshaped the country during his first months back in the White House.
“We’ve taken a high road for many, many years as Democrats and as a party. And I think we’re watching that high road actively crumble in front of us and we’ve got to chart a better pathway,” Assemblymember Isaac Bryan, a Culver City Democrat, said. “Where I’m from, when somebody steps up, you step up.”
The question remains: what is Newsom stepping up to?
One way or another, the redistricting campaign ends in less than three months. Newsom will still be the governor of California for another year after that, until the beginning of 2027. It’s a long time to sustain this momentum, especially in an era where the political news cycle moves at lighting speed.
Gallagher, the Assembly Republican leader, predicted that “trying to out-Trump Trump” would not work out for Newsom in the long run.
“He’s obviously not talking about the real issues and the real policies and the things that affect everyday people’s life,” Gallagher said. “That’s been the problem with Gavin since day one. It’s been more about his next big shiny object instead of actually getting shit done.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/082125_Redistricting-Newsom_MG_CM_07.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-21 20:57:04.729793
,DC,2025-08-22 00:28:13+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,U.S. Supreme Court gives go-ahead for Trump to cancel $783M in NIH research grants,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-gives-go-ahead-trump-cancel-783m-nih-research-grants,,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Thursday set aside a lower court’s ruling, allowing the Trump administration to cancel hundreds of millions of dollars in National Institutes of Health grants that addressed diversity, equity and inclusion issues.The 5-4 ruling narrowly divided the court, with Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Justice Elena Kagan and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissenting from their colleagues.The Trump administration originally requested the Supreme Court to intervene in the case in July, when Solicitor General D. John Sauer filed an application arguing “the district court lacked jurisdiction to order the government to pay out some $783 million in terminated grants.”Sauer wrote the case was similar to one the Supreme Court had ruled on earlier this year, determining that a district court erred when it blocked “the Department of Education from terminating DEI-related grants.”In that case, the Supreme Court ruled that “such claims likely belonged in the Court of Federal Claims, that the district court accordingly lacked jurisdiction.”Sauer wrote in his application to the Supreme Court that the lower courts in the NIH grants case choose to ignore the justices’ prior ruling.“The district court’s order directs the NIH to continue paying $783 million in federal grants that are undisputedly counter to the Administration’s priorities,” Sauer wrote. “This Court has already intervened to stay a materially identical order … and the same course is even more warranted here given the district court’s brazen refusal to follow controlling Supreme Court precedent.”Democratic AGs weigh inDemocratic attorneys general for Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Wisconsin opposed the Trump administration’s request in a 49-page filing.“The federal government’s application spins a tale of lower courts disregarding established legal guardrails to block routine agency decisions,” they wrote. “That narrative bears little resemblance to reality; indeed, it gets things exactly backward.”The Trump administration’s decision to cancel the NIH grants, they wrote, came “without providing any meaningful explanation of their decisions.“Defendants then executed the directives by, among other things, canceling hundreds of research grants to the plaintiff states’ public universities for projects investigating heart disease, HIV/AIDS, Alzheimer’s disease, alcohol and substance abuse, mental-health issues, and countless other health conditions.”The American Public Health Association also opposed the Trump administration's efforts to get the Supreme Court to throw out the lower court’s rulings.The APHA wrote in its own filing that the Trump administration “failed to consider the reliance interests at stake—namely, the impact to researchers’ career progression, the risk to human life, and the damage to the overall scientific endeavor and the body of public health.”Siding with Trump administrationJustices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh disagreed, siding with the Trump administration and setting aside the lower court’s rulings in the case. Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote a concurring opinion.Gorsuch sharply rebuked the district and appeals courts in his opinion, in which Kavanaugh joined in part and dissented in part.“Lower court judges may sometimes disagree with this Court’s decisions, but they are never free to defy them,” Gorsuch wrote. “In Department of Ed. v. California … this Court granted a stay because it found the government likely to prevail in showing that the district court lacked jurisdiction to order the government to pay grant obligations.”Barrett appeared to agree, writing in her concurring opinion that “the District Court likely lacked jurisdiction to hear challenges to the grant terminations, which belong in the Court of Federal Claims.”In a dissenting opinion, Jackson wrote that the justices did not take enough time to seriously consider the ramifications of their decision in the Education Department case when they spent “a mere nine days” deciding whether a federal district court or the Court of Federal Claims holds jurisdiction when the government terminates “federal grants en masse.”“I viewed the Court’s intervention then—in an emergency stay posture, while racing against a fast-expiring temporary restraining order—as ‘equal parts unprincipled and unfortunate,’” Jackson wrote. “As it turns out, the Court’s decision was an even bigger mistake than I realized.”Ariana Figueroa contributed to this report.",,,,2025-08-21 20:57:04.729793

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)President Donald Trump again called for the release of former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters in a social media post on Thursday, 
Peters is a prominent election denier serving a nine-year prison sentence for her role in a breach of Mesa County’s elections systems during a 2021 software update.
“Let Tina Peters out of jail, RIGHT NOW,” Trump said in the post. “She did nothing wrong, except catching the Democrats cheat in the Election. She is an old woman, and very sick. If she is not released, I am going to take harsh measures!!!”
Peters was convicted by a Mesa County jury in August 2024 on four felony counts related to the security breach, which was part of an effort to demonstrate that the 2020 election was untrustworthy, even though there is no credible evidence to support that position. She was prosecuted by the office of a Republican district attorney.
In May, Trump called for the U.S. Department of Justice to take “all necessary action” to secure her release. Trump cannot pardon Peters, because her conviction involves state crimes.
Peters has appealed the conviction, and while the Colorado Court of Appeals reviews the case, her legal team filed a federal habeas corpus petition. The petition, which was filed in the U.S. District Court of Colorado, argues that Peters should be released on bond pending the appeal decision.
Peters’ attorneys argue in the federal habeas corpus petition that her First Amendment rights have been violated because she has not been allowed bail pending her appeal.
“(Peters) has been made to stay in prison because people are afraid of what she would say,” her attorney Peter Ticktin said in an interview with Newsline earlier this month.
The Colorado attorney general’s office has asked for the dismissal of the habeas corpus petition, arguing that the federal court does not have jurisdiction in the case. In a recent filing, the attorney general’s office cited the 1971 U.S. Supreme Court case Younger v. Harris, in which the court recognized “longstanding public policy against federal court interference with state court proceedings.”

Wes Moore (D) speaks at a ceremony Thursday marking the demolition of the aging Pimlico Race Course to make room for a new facility, hopefully in time for the 2027 Preakness Stakes. (Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)An excavator tore open the walls of the Pimlico clubhouse Thursday as the governor and other dignitaries looked on — the official kick-off for a demolition already underway at the historic track in northwest Baltimore’s Park Heights.
The Maryland Board of Public Works signed off on the demolition and reconstruction project in May, starting a race to demolish and rebuild the aging track in time to bring the Preakness Stakes back to the Baltimore neighborhood by 2027.
But the storied old clubhouse wasn’t the only thing being ripped into Thursday.
After citing his administration’s gains in Baltimore — a massive decline in gun violence, a new lease for the Baltimore Orioles at Camden Yards and the ongoing effort to redevelop Harborplace — Gov. Wes Moore (D) seized the opportunity to lambaste President Donald Trump (R), who said Baltimore is “so far gone” when it comes to violent crime. Trump made the remarks earlier this month as he mobilized National Guard troops to patrol Washington, D.C.
“If you are not willing to be part of the solution, keep our names out of your mouth,” Moore said, eliciting cheers from the crowd. “Specifically, Donald Trump, if you are not willing to walk our communities, keep our name out of your mouth.”

But the next speaker to step to the microphone — a Park Heights clergyman leading the community advisory board for the redevelopment — had a sobering message, and a reminder that the city’s problems have not gone away.
Bishop Troy Randall, who grew up in the neighborhood abutting the racecourse, said he was caught in the crossfire of a shooting near the racetrack 5 p.m. Wednesday that left an 18-year-old man dead.
“My heart grieves, as well as its joy,” Randall said. “I am a product of the good, and I’m a product of the bad.”
Randall said he was sitting in his car, having just dropped off a neighbor at the barbershop, when shots rang out.
“They shot my car, and as I laid on the floor of my car crying, I said, ‘Lord, not this. Not this way. It can’t end like this,’” Randall said.
After the shots stopped, Randall emerged from his car to see the young victim lying on the ground.
“I got out of that car, and I stood there, and I looked at the gentleman gasping for air in his lungs, I prayed that God give him another day,” Randall said.

Randall said the harrowing incident inspired him to continue fighting for Park Heights to benefit from the redevelopment. He said Moore “kept his promise” to visit the neighborhood, by attending Thursday’s ceremony.
Thursday, Moore touted his administration’s plan to reinvest a share of the revenue from the new racing facility in neighborhood improvements.

“The community have to be shareholders,” Moore said. “They have to benefit from all the new revenue that we will see.”
Moore pointed to $75 million in state funding for affordable housing in the neighborhood and $5 million for a new Park Heights public library.
The Board of Public Works vote in May approved a $15.2 million contract with Clark Construction related to the demolition and reconstruction, kickstarting a long-discussed plan to raze the deteriorating racing facility.
The unanimous vote came even as State Treasurer Dereck Davis, one of the three members of the board, wondered if it should be a final handout to a struggling horseracing industry. He pondered aloud if building year-round appeal for the racetrack was a “pipe dream.”
The board also approved $4.5 million that day to buy a farm in Carroll County that is slated to host a new $110 million training center, capable of hosting some 800 horses.
With Pimlico razed, next year’s Preakness is scheduled to be run at Laurel Park. But the state, which owns Pimlico, plans to have the track reopened by May 2027, in time to once again host the second leg of the Triple Crown.
That gives project managers less than two years to complete the full demolition and rebuild. But Moore was optimistic Thursday.
“We are ensuring that the second leg of the Triple Crown will also be the Triple Crown’s crown jewel,” Moore said. “And that that crown jewel will be right here in Baltimore, right where it belongs.”

According to the FY26 General Fund Budget Monitor for August, “After accounting for updated revenue projections, the projected ending balance is negative $79.9 million.” 
Idaho runs on a fiscal year calendar that begins July 1 and ends June 30. 
That means the state is only about six weeks into the current fiscal year, and the new report reflects the first month of revenue activity in fiscal year 2026.
House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, said the budget situation is severe and was created by Republicans who control the Idaho Legislature and set the state budget.

“We’ve been shouting warnings from the mountaintops about this from the very beginning of the session about the extremely reckless, permanent revenue cuts and voucher schemes they passed and the wild overestimates of revenue they adopted that were not in any way in line with what (the Division of Financial Management) projected,” Rubel said. “There were warning signs flashing from miles away that unfortunately our Republican colleagues chose to ignore.”
Rep. Wendy Horman, an Idaho Falls Republican who serves as the co-chair of the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee that sets the state budget, disagreed. Horman said Idaho’s economy is healthy and the state actually collected more in revenue last year than it did before.
“I appreciate you recognizing we are very early in the fiscal year,” Horman said Thursday afternoon. “In my opinion, this is not cause for panic at all. One month of revenue does not make a trend. I always watch actual revenues much more than I watch revenue compared to the forecast.”
 Since record surplus, Idaho lawmakers have reduced state revenue through tax cuts

A projected budget deficit is a major change for Idaho. 
Just over three years ago, Idaho ended the 2022 fiscal year with a record budget surplus approaching $2 billion. 
Since the record surplus, Idaho legislators reduced state revenue significantly.

During the 2025 legislative session alone, legislators and Idaho Gov. Brad Little reduced revenue that would have been available in the state budget by more than $450 million to pay for tax cuts and a new tax credit that reimburses families for education expenses, including tuition at private religious schools.
During a breakfast with the press corps in February, Little told reporters he was “not very happy about” the magnitude of revenue reductions the Idaho Legislature put forward this year. 
“If I would have thought we could do $450 (million), I would have proposed $450 (million),” Little told reporters in February. 
Although he didn’t propose as deep of tax cuts and revenue reductions, Rubel said Little did sign the state budget into law.
“He could have vetoed it; he did sign it,” Rubel said. 
In March, former legislators Fred Wood and Julie Yamamoto – who are both Republicans – and former superintendent of public instruction candidate Cindy Wilson wrote a joint opinion piece published in the Idaho Capital Sun warning that “Idaho’s tax cuts proposed by the Legislature are a risk to our children’s future.”
 Where did the new Idaho budget report come from?

Officials with the nonpartisan Idaho Legislative Services Office compiled the new report and released it Wednesday night. 
The report was released less than a week after the governor announced that all state agencies – other than public schools – must cut their current budgets by 3%.
Although Idaho is just about six weeks into the fiscal year 2026 budget, any projected budget deficit is significant.
One of the only requirements Idaho legislators have under the Idaho Constitution is to pass a balanced budget every year where expenses do not exceed available revenues. 
If the latest revenue projections hold and no other steps are taken, Idaho would fall short of that balanced-budget requirement, the state’s top budget official told the Idaho Capital Sun on Thursday.

“We cannot go through this year with the (budget) appropriation the Legislature set for us or we will exceed revenue,” Idaho Division of Financial Management Administrator Lori Wolff said in an interview Thursday morning. “That is why the governor asked for at least 3% holdbacks.”
Idaho is so early in the current fiscal year that the projected budget deficit could increase, decrease or rebound into a surplus. 
The new budget projections do not include any supplemental funding requests for the fiscal year 2026 budget, Wolff said. That means if the wildfire season runs long and costs exceed state funding levels, or if Medicaid expenses come in higher than projected, the budget deficit could become even larger.
 How can Idaho prevent a budget deficit?

It is likely Idaho won’t actually have a budget deficit when the 2026 fiscal year ends June 30. Horman said there are “all kinds of budgetary levers the Legislature can pull” in response to any budget concerns once they reconvene in January. 
Additionally, Idaho law gives the governor the authority to issue an executive order to reduce spending for any department, office or institution of the state if the governor determines expenses will exceed available revenue. 
The Idaho Legislative Services Office estimated the 3% budget holdbacks Little announced Friday would reduce spending by $86.1 million if implemented by all state agencies this year. If everything else in the August budget projections hold up and there are $0 in fiscal year 2026 supplemental funding requests, the 3% holdbacks would give Idaho a narrow $6.2 million cushion between a budget surplus and a budget deficit at the end of the current fiscal year. 
 Does Idaho have any savings to guard against a budget shortfall?

Idaho has more than $1 billion in rainy day reserve funds in the bank. According to the Idaho Legislature’s 2025 Sine Die Report, the state’s primary rainy day account had a balance of over $880 million, while the Public Education Stabilization Fund had a balance of about $265 million. 
  The Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee co-chairwoman Rep. Wendy Horman, R-Idaho Falls, listens to proceedings at the Idaho State Capitol building on Jan. 11, 2023. (Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)
Horman said it takes legislative action to use rainy day funds, which she does not support at this time.
“We want to save the rainy day funds for when it is actually raining,” Horman said. “It is not raining, in my opinion, on Aug. 21.”
Horman did say she supports the 3% holdbacks Little authorized and said the Idaho Legislature will reassess the budget situation and new revenue projections when the 2026 legislative session begins in January.
When they reconvene, legislators may discuss making the holdbacks permanent, Horman said. 
“As we always do, we will reassess where things are in January and make a determination if the 3% holdbacks need to be made permanent as we see where our revenues are then and what the economic situation is by then,” Horman said. 
On the other hand Rubel, the House minority leader, said that Idahoans will feel the forthcoming budget cuts, and they will hurt many people. 
Idaho Department of Lands seeks to balance pending budget cuts with firefighting needs

Rubel said that cutting all state agencies except public schools means the state is cutting funding for law enforcement through Idaho State Police, cutting funding for prisons through the Idaho Department of Correction and cutting funding for the Idaho Department of Lands, which fights wildfires on state land. 
“This was the most fiscally reckless legislative session by the majority party in modern history and maybe ever,” Rubel said. “They left us unable to cover our most basic needs because of enormous giveaways to the wealthiest people and corporations in the state.”

(Ryan Jones/CPW)Colorado lawmakers gave initial approval Thursday to a bill to redirect a small amount of state money from gray wolf restoration efforts to a health insurance affordability fund, but stopped short of requiring Colorado Parks and Wildlife to pause the capture and release of new wolves this winter.
With the Legislature convened for a special session to cope with a billion-dollar revenue shortfall triggered by changes to the federal tax code, Senate Bill 25B-5 would withhold $264,268 from the state’s general fund previously appropriated for wolf reintroduction. The money would instead be directed to the state’s Health Insurance Affordability Enterprise, which helps subsidize health coverage costs and faces an estimated shortfall of around $100 million after Congress failed to extend federal tax credits for insurance premiums.
Bill sponsor Sen. Dylan Roberts, a Democrat from Frisco, told his colleagues in a committee hearing Thursday that SB-5 “proposes to save a small amount of taxpayer dollars where we can to put them to something that can immediately help Coloradans.”

Amid opposition from Gov. Jared Polis, however, the bill was amended to remove language prohibiting CPW from taking “any action to acquire or reintroduce gray wolves during state fiscal year 2025-26.” The agency’s reintroduction plan calls for annual releases of 10 to 15 wolves in the program’s first three to five years, as wildlife managers target a stable initial population of at least 50 wolves in the state.
State Sen. Matt Ball, a Denver Democrat who introduced the amendment, said that in the absence of the general fund appropriation, the governor’s office and CPW would look to “other sources of funding,” and the reintroductions would “proceed as planned.”
After two years of releases, Colorado’s wolf population currently includes 21 collared adults and an unknown number of pups born to four established packs this spring.
Three new wolf packs established in Colorado in 2025

“I do believe it’s really important to put one more round of 15 animals out,” CPW director Jeff Davis told lawmakers.
Voters in 2020 narrowly approved a ballot measure requiring CPW to reintroduce gray wolves to Colorado in the name of restoring ecological balance. The state’s efforts have been bitterly opposed by livestock producers, who have persistently called for CPW to delay or pause the program since the agency first began to relocate wolves in December 2023.
A series of wolf attacks on livestock in Grand County in 2024 and in Pitkin County this year have inflamed the controversy — as have the deaths of a number of wolves, through both “lethal control” measures authorized by wildlife managers and at least one apparent act of illegal poaching. Speakers on both sides of the issue sparred yet again during more than three hours of testimony Thursday before the Senate State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee.
Callie Scritchfield, a Rio Blanco County commissioner, called the prospect of another year of wolf releases “one more big threat to our agriculture community,” which she said would add to the “despair” ranchers in her county are feeling from the impact of the Lee and Elk fires. Samantha Miller of the Center for Biological Diversity, meanwhile, called the bill “unsupported by science” and “contrary to what the experts at CPW state is needed.”
“At this critical stage of reintroduction efforts, halting even one year would have dire consequences,” Miller said.
Lawmakers on the committee voted 4-1 to approve the amended bill and advance it to the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Authorities in the West African nation threw him in prison because of his sexual orientation, he said. After his release, he feared that if he stayed in the country, he would be killed.
B., who is now 39 and who asked that he be identified only by his initial because he still has family in Cameroon, arrived in the United States with practically nothing. Since he was granted asylum last year, he has been able to use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, to help him get by.
But now most refugees and asylees, who entered the country legally, including B., are no longer eligible for food stamps. The change is part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the giant federal domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4.

“I think it’s unfair. I understand that there are some people who abuse the system,” B. told Stateline. “There are also people who are in need. And cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.”
SNAP, which is funded by the federal government but administered by the states, helps families and individuals with lower incomes supplement their grocery budgets. The program serves an average of 42 million people a month.

Supporters of the change note that refugees and asylees can get permits to work, and that they have other sources of support.
“It’s not like they have been dropped off in this country with no support system,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that backs stricter immigration rules.
“They have sponsoring organizations that are helping them get settled and they have work authorization. So they really should be moving forward towards self-sufficiency with support right out of the starting gate. And they should be moving ahead to obtain green cards,” she added, referring to the cards that signify permanent residency.
Vaughan cited a federal grant program that reimburses states and nonprofit organizations for financial aid and health care coverage they provide to refugees.
But critics argue that asylees and refugees, who are extensively vetted and have a legitimate path to citizenship, can wait years for a green card, which entitles them to a wider array of benefits.
They also say community organizations that provide aid to asylees and refugees are stretched thin. Without food stamps, they say, many refugees and their families would not have enough to eat.










Cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.


– B., a Cameroonian asylee


“SNAP is an incredibly fundamental program for this population that comes to the United States, really, with very little, if anything,” said Nicolas Palazzo, a policy counsel at the global humanitarian and refugee advocacy organization HIAS. “These are people who literally had to flee — many times overnight — with nothing, but, you know, a pair of clothes in a backpack.”
Palazzo also said SNAP is not a “handout” to refugees or asylees. Rather, he said, it’s a “smart and moral investment” that protects all communities and strengthens the economy, offering people a foundation for self-sufficiency.
“Stripping critical food assistance forces refugees and asylees into the shadows of informal work, labor exploitation and hunger that weakens our workforce and denigrates our moral obligations,” Palazzo said.

‘Nowhere else to go’

B. said he applied immediately for asylum when he arrived in the U.S. in 2016, but that he had to wait months for a work permit. He survived by doing odd jobs, such as cleaning homes and delivering food, and got by on very little. It wasn’t until late 2024, when he finally won his asylum case, that he was eligible to get any public benefits, including food stamps.
Eligibility for food stamps came at a critical time for B., as a car accident had prevented him from making food deliveries.
“While not having income, it was very helpful,” B. said. “I’m somebody who if I can work, I will work. The only reason I went over there to ask is because I had nowhere else to go.”
According to a November 2024 report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, a total of 60,050 people were newly admitted to the United States as refugees in 2023, many from unstable countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Syria and Afghanistan.
In 2023, the nation received at least 747,000 applications for people seeking asylum from countries including Venezuela, Cuba and Colombia, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration research group. It’s a tremendous increase from the 68,000 applications received in 2013.
The new domestic policy law specifies that food stamps are still available to Cubans and Haitians who might be refugees and asylees.

As of July 2025, more than 2.2 million immigrants in the U.S. are awaiting asylum hearings or decisions after formally applying for asylum, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, an organization at Syracuse University that tracks immigration cases.
“Getting through the system was difficult,” B. said. “I had to find money. I had to find an attorney who would help me apply for my asylum case. The asylum case itself took a long time.
“I still know people who have been here for more than 10 years and never had an interview.”

‘Already stretched’

According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, half of all admitted refugees in 2023 were resettled across just 10 states: Texas, New York, California, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan and Washington.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 41,000 people in the state are getting SNAP benefits while not being lawful permanent residents. She says that group includes refugees and asylees.
“The concerning part there is that these are individuals who were … lawfully admitted to the country, have previously been eligible for SNAP when they need it, and now, simply because of their status, will no longer be able to receive SNAP benefits,” Guinn told Stateline. “There’s nothing we’re going to be able to do to make them eligible.”
Another change under the new law is that for the first time, states will have to pay for a portion of their food stamp programs. States will have to cover between 5% and 15% of their SNAP costs beginning in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they dole out benefits to people eligible for the program.
Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, pointed out that states that want to continue to provide SNAP benefits to refugees and asylees are free to do so — as long as they pay for it.
“If New York state doesn’t want to cut these people off, they can continue to give them something like food stamps. They just have to do it with New York state money right now,” Rector said.

But Guinn said that will be difficult. New York does offer asylum-seekers cash assistance of $180 a month through its Safety Net Assistance Program, but typically recipients must be working.
In Texas, officials at the state’s health and human services agency said that as of last month, roughly 24,600 of the state’s 3.5 million SNAP recipients were refugees or asylees. A spokesperson for Maryland’s human services agency wrote in an email that the state’s SNAP program last year supported more than 10,000 refugees and asylees.
The California Department of Social Services could not provide the number of refugees and asylees receiving food stamps, but projected that a total of 74,000 noncitizens — including lawfully permanent residents, refugees and asylees — would lose eligibility under the new law.
Sherri Laigle, the director of social services at HIAS, said food banks will not be able to make up for refugees’ and asylees’ loss of SNAP benefits.
“They’re already stretched, and now we’re going to see tens of thousands of people also needing to continue to rely on these programs. Of course, there’s limited access to them. You have to have transportation. You have to be able to get there.”
B. said he would apply for food stamps again if he could, because he’s earning too little income to get by.
“There are people who are in need. I think ignoring that — it’s not human.”

Mississippi is one of the poorest states and has long led the nation in infant mortality, but the worsening numbers and the growing racial disparities call for extraordinary measures, said State Health Officer Dr. Daniel Edney.

“It hasn’t been this bad in a long time,” Edney told Mississippi Today. “And that’s with a lot of us pushing hard to make it better. In the face of us, and so many partners all over the state, really leaning into this space, the numbers show significant worsening.”
Honour McDaniel Hill, director of Infant and Maternal Health Initiatives for March of Dimes, said declaring a public health emergency is not something she’s seen other states do in response to infant mortality in recent years. She called it an “interesting tactic” to move time, energy and resources to an important cause. 
“What a public health emergency does is it allows a state entity – in this case the state Health Department – to put this on high alert, meaning funds can go here, personnel and people’s time and attention can go here,” McDaniel Hill said. “It really does kind of break this barrier.”
Edney said he hopes that with the emergency status, he’ll be able to develop a new system of care six months faster than he’d originally intended. 
That OB System of Care, which has  been in the works since 2023, involves designating birthing hospitals with different care levels – something called perinatal regionalization, which is used in many states. It also includes implementing transportation and tracking to make transfers of high-risk moms more efficient. 
Edney said he hopes to have hospitals designated as early as October, but full implementation of the system could still take a couple of years. 
This fall, Edney also hopes to have expanded perinatal services at county health departments in areas that are obstetric deserts, as part of a “multi-pronged strategy” response to the emergency.
Nearly half of Mississippi’s counties are maternity care deserts, McDaniel Hill said, and those counties make up nearly a quarter of the state’s births, making increased access a vital part of the solution.
Other strategies outlined in the State Health Department’s press release included allocating more staff to a home visitation program called Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies, and educating families on safe sleep practices to mitigate sudden infant death syndrome, one of the leading causes of infant mortality in the state. 
The most recent March of Dimes report card for Mississippi included several policy recommendations the Legislature would be responsible for enacting, including expanding Medicaid to working people with modest salaries, which Republican Gov. Tate Reeves opposes. The Health Department did not mention Medicaid expansion in its plan Thursday.
Monica Stinson, senior program director of the Mississippi Perinatal Quality Collaborative, said her organization will play a central role in the emergency response, particularly by collaborating with community-based groups and connecting families with resources. 
“The declaration is a powerful tool that helps centralize resources, align key partners, and remove barriers that have historically slowed progress,” Stinson said. “This formal recognition of the crisis allows us to move beyond fragmented efforts and toward a more coordinated, statewide strategy aimed at improving outcomes for all mothers and infants in Mississippi.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/06193428/aditya-romansa-5zp0jym2w9M-unsplash-scaled.jpg,,,2025-08-21 19:57:40.922543

(Photo courtesy of Tennessee Department of Transportation)A long-planned new Interstate 55 bridge connecting Arkansas and Tennessee will be known as Kings’ Crossing, officials from the two states announced this week.
The new name “honors three transformative figures known as ‘Kings'” — civil rights martyr Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., bluesman B.B. King and rock’n’roll star Elvis Presley, according to a press release from the Arkansas Department of Transportation. The project had been named “America’s River Crossing,” according to previous news releases. The Arkansas Highway Commission and Tennessee General Assembly officially adopted the new moniker.
The bridge will replace the existing 75-year-old Memphis-Arkansas Bridge that carries I-55 traffic between West Memphis and Memphis. The new bridge is being funded by $400 million from the federal Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) program and $200 million each from Arkansas and Tennessee, making it the single largest transportation investment in both states, according to the press release.
The narrow existing bridge will be replaced with a larger structure designed to meet modern seismic codes, as it sits on the New Madrid fault line, officials said.
“It’s only fitting to name this vital crossing after three historic figures from this region,” said ARDOT Director Jared Wiley. “It truly is the result of a regional effort that will benefit industry across this national corridor and the thousands of individuals who depend on this connection each day.”
Tennessee Department of Transportation Commissioner Will Reid said Kings’ Crossing is a “symbol of our collective history, heritage, and the enduring spirit of unity that defines this region. Naming this bridge in honor of these gentlemen pays tribute to their extraordinary legacies — individuals who transcended barriers, fostered cultural exchange, and used their talents to build bridges between people.”
The Federal Highway Administration has approved a draft environmental assessment for the project, and public hearings will be held in November, according to TDOT’s website.
Design is underway, and right-of-way coordination should begin later this year, according to ARDOT’s press release. Construction is estimated to start in fiscal year 2026.

It was formerly known as the Anderson Landfill. (Photo courtesy of Washington Department of Ecology)Multiple fires have been reported this summer at Rocky Top Environmental, the limited-purpose landfill west of Yakima owned by the Mill Creek-based recycling company DTG.
While the private landfill has had a history of continuously burning fires beneath the surface, the new fires have started as the company moves material from an unlined, temporary cell to a second cell that is lined.
“The fires are not related to operational practices and appear to be the result of oxidation of some degraded materials as they are removed,” said Mark Prentice, spokesperson for DTG. “We have a fire watch in place and suppression equipment onsite to manage these instances should they occur.”
The state Department of Ecology has been alerted to three or four instances of fires from July to mid-August, said Luke LeMond, a hydrogeologist for the agency. In one of the cases, mattresses were on fire, he said.
“This is something we are a little concerned about,” LeMond said.
The limited-purpose landfill is allowed to accept demolition waste, which is loosely defined in state law, he said.
Rocky Top hasn’t been permitted to take mattresses for a few years, and it is plausible that the mattresses were accepted when they were allowed, he said.
“We’re always wrestling with what is permitted and what isn’t. It’s not easy,” LeMond said.
Landfills are not allowed to intentionally burn waste, are required to have a fire response plan, and the facility is required to notify Ecology of fires. Rocky Top has been good about communicating and providing information to Ecology, LeMond said.
Landfill fires are relatively common and usually start from batteries, hot ash, and the exhaust of vehicles and machinery coming into contact with material.
At Rocky Top, these fires seem to be spontaneous, though LeMond doesn’t like the term.
“There’s something going on that causes the conditions for the fires,” LeMond said.
One recent incident prompted a response from local firefighters, he said. But Rocky Top employees usually fight the fire themselves with heavy machinery and water.
Ecology is reviewing information to try to understand what is going on and give the Yakima Health District advice on ways to prevent them in the future.
Prentice said that Rocky Top Environmental’s work moving the material into the new lined cell is nearly complete and that there should be no risk of these fires in the future.
 State pollution board ruling

In other updates, the state Pollution Control Hearings Board determined in August that the Yakima Regional Clean Air Agency complied with state law and properly reviewed concerns about the Rocky Top landfill’s potential environmental impacts during permitting.
In April 2024, Nancy Lust, Carole DeGrave, and Friends of Rocky Top appealed a permit issued to DTG by the clean air agency.
The state pollution panel is a quasi-judicial hearings board that’s part of the state’s Environmental and Land Use Hearings Office. After a three-day hearing in May, board released its decision on Aug. 14.
Prentice said that DTG is “pleased the Pollution Control Hearings Board acknowledged the permitting was conducted correctly by the Yakima Regional Clean Air Agency.”
“We continue to work diligently with many regulators to confirm our operations are in compliance, and protect human health and the environment,” Prentice said.
Lust said FORT was disappointed by the decision.
“We will be looking closely at the PCHB findings and making our decision about whether to appeal or not,” Lust said. “Our mission is to prevent further degradation to the land, air and water resources around Rocky Top.”
 What’s next after landfill law passed

Though the Legislature passed a law last session that gave Ecology more of a say in the landfill permitting process and local health districts the ability to fine landfills for noncompliance, neither Ecology nor the Yakima Health District has made internal changes to be able to do so yet.
The law was championed by Lust and other members of FORT, who believed that local and state regulators lacked teeth in enforcing the rules.
“The Yakima Health District is researching what the Health District’s capabilities are with issuing and enforcing the fines described in House Bill 1154, specifically. However, there have been no changes made by the Health District’s bylaws on this topic at this time,” said Shawn Magee, Yakima Health District director of environmental health in a statement.
LeMond said changes have not yet been made at Ecology either, and that changes to the rules take time.
“Someone has to develop those new procedures so we can follow them in a consistent way,” LeMond said.

(Photo by Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)The chair of the North Dakota State Board of Higher Education said Thursday that he will propose giving interim Chancellor Brent Sanford  the job on a long-term basis. 
Sanford, a former lieutenant governor, was named the interim leader of the North Dakota University System in April. Sanford replaced Mark Hagerott, who left the position at the end of  April.  
Black, who was named board chair in May, spoke to the Legislature’s Higher Education Institutions Committee that was meeting in Dickinson. Black said he favored skipping a nationwide search in favor of giving Sanford the job.

Black said a search would likely cost more than $100,000 and still lead the board back to Sanford. 
He praised Sanford’s work as interim chancellor and said a search “is going to lead us right back to the person we think we know would be the best for the job.”
The eight-member board would have to approve the proposal. 
Sanford is former mayor of Watford City and holds a bachelor’s degree in accounting from the University of North Dakota. He had been interim president of Bismarck State College before being named interim chancellor. Before that, he had been working for the BSC Office of Workforce and Economic Development. 
Sanford, a Republican, served as lieutenant governor under Gov. Doug Burgum for six years before resigning in January 2023. 
Black noted that the board is evaluating what the leadership position should be called. It has been called chancellor, but some states use commissioner and the state constitution refers to a commissioner and chief executive officer. 
“The commissioner, chancellor, whatever title you want to use, is not an academic post,” Black said. “It is very much an executive leadership post.” 
Hagerott, who had led the university system since 2015, had a doctorate degree. Other recent chancellors have had a master’s degree or other advanced degree.

Sen. Jonathan Sickler, R-Grand Forks, chair of the committee, said that one of the advantages of a search process is that it forces the board to undergo a kind of strategic planning process as it evaluates what they are looking for in a candidate. 
Black said the board would still plan to do an evaluation of the roles of responsibilities of University System leadership, including the board. 
“Brent understands that and he is fully on board with that process,” Black said. 
The State Board of Higher Education will meet Sept. 23 at Minot State University. 
Sanford did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment Thursday.

The State Treasurer’s Office has already begun dipping into a $51 million appropriation of general revenue to award private-school scholarships under the MOScholars program, state attorneys said Thursday. Over 6,100 students have been promised scholarships, and any delay would be a “massive disruption to the MOScholars program,” William Seidleck, principal deputy solicitor general, told the judge.
But Loretta Haggard, attorney for the Missouri branch of the Missouri National Education Association, argued Thursday that MOScholars lacks authority to pull directly from general revenue, and taxpayers would be harmed by the illegal use of funds. 
MNEA filed requests at the end of June for a temporary restraining order to block the flow of funds until trial and a permanent injunction. But the attorney general’s office asked the judge to reject MNEA’s request for an expedited timeline, citing the recent departure of two top attorneys. 
The delay pushed the hearing on the injunction past the start of the school year. 
“You can’t just turn on a hose of $51 million in general revenue and force it through the tax credit framework,” Haggard said. “There are gaps in that framework.”
MOScholars was created in a 2021 law which set up the program to work through educational nonprofits approved by the state treasurer. Funding is initiated by donations, which taxpayers are able to receive back as a tax credit equal to 100% of their contribution.
The law set up a fund, the Missouri Empowerment Scholarship Accounts fund, “to be used by the state treasurer for marketing and administrative expenses or the costs incurred in administering the scholarship program, whichever is less.”
But last month, that account received a $48 million infusion, which the treasurer’s office is using to pay for student scholarships.
Haggard argues that using the fund this way is “inconsistent” with the 2021 law, telling the judge to block the outflow of funds before it is too late.
“The money will be gone (if the court doesn’t pause payments),” she said. “Nobody seriously thinks that this court will be able to order the families or the schools to discard the money. That will be gone.”
Seidleck argued that although state law doesn’t explicitly allow for the direct spending of general revenue, there are no provisions that directly forbid it. “Statutory silence,” he said, is not enough.
When deciding whether to issue a temporary restraining order, Circuit Court Judge Brian Stumpe must consider the potential harm to affected parties against the public interest. This piece was a large part of the state’s and intervenor EdChoice’s arguments.
EdChoice Legal Advocates joined the case earlier this month, representing three parents who say the influx of state funding will expand their access to scholarships.
Prior to the $51 million appropriation, MOScholars had a growing waitlist, said EdChoice attorney Bryan Cleveland. With the added funding, the program is now more reliable for those who were previously awarded scholarships, and parents are hopeful to get their other children access as well.
“The plaintiffs have asserted taxpayer standing but they haven’t stated any personal harm,” he said. “In contrast, the families have demonstrated irreparable harm because they need the scholarships to pay not just for tuition but also to pay for reading tutors.”
Seidleck emphasized that the program prioritizes students with an individualized education plan, which serves students with learning and physical disabilities.
MNEA, which is a union of public-school teachers, won’t be harmed by the vouchers, he argued, saying it might help public schools by “facilitating smaller class sizes.” MNEA President Rebeka McIntosh, who was watching the arguments, chuckled at his argument.
Stumpe had few questions Thursday, apart from asking Cleveland how the intervening families would be harmed. He told attorneys he plans on ruling by the end of the day Friday.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/082125_colecountycircuitcourt-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-08-21 18:56:43.674188

CHELSEA —- On Thursday morning, the state moved James Perry, a man found not guilty by reason of insanity for killing his daughter, to a non-hospital mental health facility. 
An Orange County Superior Court judge decided at a hearing on Thursday morning that Perry, who had been detained in prison for four years, will now live in a residential setting while remaining under 24-hour care and supervision. He was taken immediately afterwards to a residential program run by the Clara Martin Center and Health Care and Rehabilitation Services of Southeastern Vermont, according to the court order. 
Prosecutors and Perry’s defense discussed the alternatives of putting him in a hospital setting, which would offer more intensive supervision, or releasing him with no direct oversight. Both sides agreed that it was appropriate to place Perry in a non-hospitalization level of care, an in-between to those possibilities. 
In the hearing, Judge Daniel Richardson grappled with where to place the 74-year-old man who shot and killed his daughter, Karina Rheaume, when she came to bring him cookies and check on him in May 2021. 
Perry was charged with second degree murder, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and reckless endangerment. But in April of this year, he was found not guilty by reason of insanity. 
At that point, with that finding, Perry couldn’t be sentenced to prison, so the case became a matter of managing Perry’s health. Thursday’s proceeding was a hospitalization hearing only, Richardson reminded members of the public, who filled over half the court room. 
“The court doesn’t have a free hand. The court is obligated to follow the law,” Richardson said. Because Perry is no longer considered a criminal, the court has to weigh his personal liberties against concerns that he could pose a risk to himself and others, he added. 
The violence of the crime leaves some to worry that Perry needs a more secure level of oversight. Calista Diane, a close friend of Rheaume’s daughter, stood outside the old courthouse and hugged the family after the hearing. 
“I’ve seen way too many people fall through the cracks,” Diane said as tears welled in her eyes. The court ruling devastated her. She thinks Perry belongs locked up in prison, she said. 
“His daughter brought him cookies and he slaughtered her,” Diane said. 
Rheaume’s family declined to comment after Thursday’s hearing. 
After the mental health treatment he got in prison, Perry appeared to be a changed man, Richardson said. But the judge still had a message for him. 
“I want to address you directly,” Richardson said, pausing to look at Perry from his bench. 
“You have to participate,” Richardson said — emphasizing Perry’s responsibility to keep himself and the public safe. 
Rheaume’s family asked the court earlier this month to keep him under more intensive supervision, citing concerns for their safety, according to reporting from Valley News. 
Diane said that she understands the family’s pain. “They’re terrified,” she said. 
Richardson explained that the court is charged with operating within the law no matter the pressures of public opinion. He asked people in the courtroom to remain respectful, reminding them it was not a town meeting. 
While everyone was silent, benches creaked as onlookers shifted their weight. Some took notes as the hearing went on. 
Crystal Barry, a mental health professional with Burlington’s Therapeutic Works Incorporated, testified before the court. Barry had personally spoken with Perry over a dozen times to discuss his mental state and placement options, she said. 
Barry considers the move to supervised residential care a “good step down for future observation,” she said. 
In the facility, Perry will live among six other patients, be monitored by staff around the clock and be accompanied by staff if he leaves the program’s facilities, Barry said. Perry hasn’t shown signs of delusional thinking for over a year. That’s partly due to the fact that he’s been in a social and regulated environment — something they want to continue, she explained. 
The court order stands for 90 days. After that, it must be revisited in family court, now that the case is no longer criminal. 
“I’m sure we’ll all be here in 90 days,” said Diane, the friend of the victim’s family, gesturing to the small crowd that lingered in front of the courthouse.

Aug. 21, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceMichigan schools facing uncertainty over the state budget are beginning to issue layoff notices to staff, adding another layer of disarray over the Legislature’s strained and stagnant funding plans for the coming fiscal year.
On Thursday, Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) eschewed schools’ claims that new layoffs were related to the current budget fight. Hall also doubled down on his assertion that his chamber’s budget would provide them with more money than in years past.
In a regularly hosted news conference, the speaker told schools to hold the line and wait it out, promising that the House’s full budget would be presented soon, and that negotiations on a consensus plan with the Senate would emerge swiftly.
Those who represent and advocate for Michigan’s K-12 schools, however, said Thursday that districts can’t wait for the Legislature’s fight to continue, and the longer they do, tough decisions would need to be made.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
At present, the Legislature is now many weeks past its statutory July 1 deadline to complete and present to the governor an appropriations bill to fund state departments, public schools and higher education. Although the deadline has been missed before, this year’s budget fight is novel in the fact that partisan gridlock has stalled movement on negotiations.
A full budget has been passed by the Michigan Senate, but the chamber lacks a clear roads funding plan, which the Republican-controlled House has blamed for the current impasse.
The House has yet to present its full budget funding state operations, but it has crafted a roads plan and passed K-12 and higher education budgets. The Democrats who control the Senate say it’s the House that’s holding up the process.
Either way, the two competing school funding plans are diametrically different in their approaches to funding. That’s given K-12 districts no insight into how to best plan for the year to come. To give themselves some cushion, some districts are already either talking about laying off staff or have already done so.
In his press conference to address the ongoing stalemate held Thursday, Hall was asked if he had comment on those schools who are directly tying the budget crisis to their decisions on layoffs.
The question from a reporter focused mainly on school safety and mental health staff that were allegedly getting the ax. 
To that, Hall said that the previous Democratic trifecta, which held power for the last two years, slashed funding for mental health and school safety, and that his chamber’s schools budget this year was a restoration of those areas.

Some have criticized the House budget because it rolled up all the categorical spending line items for funding areas into the total per-pupil allowance, which gave schools no clear direction on how to spend that money. Critics have also said that schools would remove free meals and other key programs if the House budget was adopted into law because the Legislature no longer mandated that they fund them.
Hall said boilerplate language in the House education budget mandates money to be used for mental health and schools.
“Right before the [2024] election, they tried to fix that and put a little bit in, but it’s still way down,” Hall said. “One of the main things we’re trying to achieve in our budget, we … put a rule in place that you must fund school safety and mental health with this money.”
In response to the talk of layoffs in the face of potentially more school funding from the House this year, Hall said he believed those layoffs were more performance based than anything else.
Another reporter noted that despite whatever the House put in its version of the education budget, the lower chamber and its big brother in the Senate still needed to work out a consensus conference budget. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer would also have considerable influence in those negotiations. That could take time even after the House presents its full plan and the Senate finally moves forward on road funding.
Schools would be left in the lurch despite promises of increased funding because they don’t have that money now.
Again, Hall asked schools to hold the line and not make any rash personnel decisions because the money was coming.
“If I was a school superintendent, and I was watching this and I saw that all parties want to increase my funding, I wouldn’t be making all of these crazy decisions, because I see that all parties are trying to fund me more,” Hall said. “I would assume they’ll work it out. … All three budgets [the House, the Senate and the governor’s recommendations] increase funding for schools, it’s just the House Republicans who are increasing it the most.”
Hall chalked up the disconnect to the new House budgeting process, adding that the chamber was doing it “in a way that is a little different than the establishment is used to.”
Robert McCann, executive director of the K-12 Alliance of Michigan, said schools have a reason to be worried as the budget battle rages on.
“The reason for these layoffs is directly tied to the fact that they haven’t passed a budget,” McCann told Michigan Advance. “The budget is more than the per pupil [amount]. The budget is more than the total amount you’re getting. It’s pieces that create an entire budget for a school year, and those individual pieces fund specific programs and specific personnel.”
McCann said schools typically build their budgets in June, even though, as in years past, a final consensus budget might not be completed.
“But we were pretty far along in the process [in previous years] where they can take some reasonable guesses as to where their final budget is and what it’s going to look like,” McCann said. “They might have had to come back and tweak it a little bit at the end of the summer, but it’s close, and they could make enough informed decisions to keep personnel or to bring on new ones.”
In the current saga, McCann said schools have nothing to go on.
“With all due respect to the speaker, I couldn’t disagree more. Yes, they had two budgets that have been passed, but they were radically different from one another,” he added. “That’s where I say, it’s not just the fact that there were two budgets passed that would give them some amount of money, it’s that there were two budgets that contained very different funding and ways of distributing that funding.”
Hall gives clearer look at ‘waste cutting’ calculus
Aside from the dilemma facing schools, the roads issue continues to take precedence in the budget talks for Hall, as does the new Republican ethos to target funding areas that they consider “waste, fraud and abuse.” 
The speaker has said that the full budget hasn’t come out yet, despite an optimistic view from his appropriations chair, state Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton) that it could be delivered as soon as next week, because his team keeps finding wasteful spending areas that it says it can cut safely and responsibly.

Although that concept has been a national GOP talking point, Hall has only given a few examples of where waste was located in previous spending plans and where cuts might come from.
On Thursday, he shared more, targeting the Department of Attorney General, the Department of Technology, Management and Budget, the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity, the Department of Civil Rights and the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy.
Hall showed slides comparing the budgets of former Republican Gov. Rick Snyder to the last two budget cycles when Democrats held all levers of power in state government.
By his caucus’ math, the attorney general’s office budget grew by 22%; management and budget by 36%; civil rights by 80%; labor by 92%; and EGLE by 107%.
For Hall, that was evidence enough for Republicans to take the ax to those ballooning departments and label that all as waste.
Budget no closer as talk continues
The numerous press conferences and tough talk in Lansing, on both sides of the aisle, have brought the budget no closer to completion.
Hall previously said it was his estimation that the full budget proposal would land by Sept. 30, the constitutional drop deadline for the fiscal year before the government lands in a shutdown. The last government shutdown in Michigan lasted only a few hours, with a consensus reached soon afterward.
The Advance asked Hall what that might look like if both budgets are delivered and passed by each chamber on Sept. 30 or Oct. 1, and how swiftly he believed the two sides could come to agreement to stave off a potential shut down.
Hall has said his team was putting together “the perfect budget,” and therefore, any shut down might only last a few hours in this round, if it happens at all.
“In that scenario, we would only need a couple of hours at that point,” Hall said. “But I think we’ll try to give them a little more time, a few more days than that, to work through this.”
In the face of sneering political mistrust between Democrats and Republicans, Hall’s assumption appears highly optimistic.
The speaker, however, blamed any infighting on two opposing factions within the Democratic Party, and not on House Republicans.
“If the Democrats can unify and empower their leader, Governor Whitmer, we’ll get a deal done in about two weeks, probably less,” Hall said. “I think when I show this to her, she will see a lot of this waste, fraud and abuse, and will help us eliminate it. And then I think we share a common goal of getting the roads fixed.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1000068653-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-21 18:56:43.674188

Tony Evers over administrative rulemaking. (Wisconsin Examiner photo)Republican leaders of the Legislature moved Thursday to block the Evers administration from bypassing legislative committees in implementing administrative rules.
Republican leaders of the Joint Committee on Legislative Organization (JCLO), with members from both the Assembly and the Senate, sent committee members a motion Thursday instructing the Legislative Reference Bureau not to finalize or publish any rules unless they have gone through a review by the Legislature in accordance with Wisconsin law.
The motion came two days after a published report that Gov. Tony Evers  instructed cabinet heads to skip the Legislature in the final steps of the rulemaking process.
It is the latest development in an ongoing feud between the Democratic governor and Republican leaders in the Legislature over the power of the executive branch to write rules in order to carry out state laws.
In a memo Aug. 12, Evers told department secretaries, “There no longer remains any statutory requirement to wait for legislative committee review before promulgating a rule once I have approved it.”
The governor’s memo cited the July 8 Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling in the case Evers v. Marklein that curtailed the power of the Joint Committee for the Review of Administrative Rules (JCRAR) to block executive branch rulemaking.
In the 4-3 decision, which has become known as Evers v. Marklein II, the Court majority ruled that state laws giving JCRAR broad powers to block administrative rules indefinitely were unconstitutional.
“This is good and important news as it means we can — and must — continue the people’s work in earnest,” Evers wrote in the memo, first reported by WisPolitics.com. “Accordingly, I am directing agencies to submit rules that have made it through that relevant part of the process to the Legislative Reference Bureau for finalization and publication.”
The motion distributed to JCLO members Thursday takes direct aim at the assertion in Evers’ memo.
The motion states that “the Legislative Reference Bureau (LRB) shall neither finalize nor publish any rules or proposed rules that failed to comply with the standing committee statutory requirements of s. 227.19 (2) to (4), Stats., including rules or proposed rules that have already been submitted to the LRB.”
Those statutes require that when administrative rules are in final draft form, the Legislature must be notified, a detailed report on the rule must be submitted, and the rule must be reviewed by a standing committee of the Legislature.
There are 27 administrative rules submitted to the Legislative Reference Bureau currently awaiting publication in the Administrative Register.
The bureau director, Rick Champagne, told the Wisconsin Examiner on Thursday that 13 of those rules have not yet completed standing committee review. Those have been classified as not to be published.
“Evers v. Marklein II did not address the constitutionality of standing committee review of proposed administrative rules,” Champagne wrote in an email message.
Among the rules held up pending review are one addressing the state’s policy on gray wolf management and one on surface water degradation. 
The remaining 14 rules have completed the standing committee review and are before the Joint Committee for the Review of Administrative Rules or have completed that process, according to Champagne.  
“I believe these are ready for publication under Evers v. Marklein II,” Champagne told the Examiner.
“JCLO has the authority to direct the manner in which the LRB will carry out its statutory duties,” Champagne added.  “The Wisconsin Supreme Court, in Evers v. Marklein II, did not eliminate standing committee review of proposed administrative rules.  If JCLO so directs, the LRB will not finalize or publish any proposed administrative rules that have not completed standing committee review.”
The paper ballot votes on the motion are due Friday and results are expected to be posted by the end of the day. The motion is expected to pass given the committee’s GOP majority.
The committee’s Republican co-chairs, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate President Mary Felzkowski, issued a press release Thursday calling Evers’ action to sidestep submitting rules to the Legislature for committee review a “direct contradiction” of the Court’s ruling.
“In Evers v. Marklein, the Wisconsin Supreme Court clearly stated that the Legislature ‘alone maintains the ability to amend, expand, or limit the breadth of administrative rulemaking in other branches” of government, the press release said. “Governor Tony Evers is attempting to circumvent statutory requirements that are part of the rule-making process and that no court has held to be invalid in any respect.”
“We are following the law and maintaining the fundamental checks and balances of lawmaking,” Vos and Felzkowski said in a joint statement. “The governor is flagrantly disregarding the rule of law and egregiously abusing the power of his office.”
Evers’ communications director, Britt Cudaback, countered with a charge that the Republican lawmakers were defying the law. 
“Republicans are reaching new levels of lawlessness, whether it’s President Trump trying to take over Washington DC, Republicans in Texas trying to rig maps and elections in their favor, or Republicans in Wisconsin who appear poised to disobey decisions made by our state’s highest court,” Cudaback wrote in an email message. “Republicans are not above the law — they should follow the law like everyone else is expected to.”

Employees allege perpetual turnover, unscheduled work hours and safety concerns in decision to unionize.
The post Laramie cement plant workers buck Wyoming’s anti-union politics, vote to organize appeared first on WyoFile .","Citing alleged tensions with management, perpetual turnover, safety concerns and unpredictable schedules, hourly employees at a Laramie cement plant voted to organize Wednesday.
Nearly 80 workers at the Mountain Cement Company plant will join the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers after a 40-26 vote and years of indecision about organizing amid a staunchly anti-union cultural and political environment in Wyoming. Only 5.6% of wage and salary employees in Wyoming last year were union members, down from a high of 13.4% in 1990, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The 2024 rate was well below the national average of 9.9%.
Persistent demands to work unscheduled overtime and alleged intimidation by management pushed workers to seek union protections, some employees told WyoFile.
“Just to talk about [the successful vote to organize] makes me teary eyed,” said Alex Hicks, who works in maintenance as a mechanic and welder. “I was threatened with my job, so now that this is here, I feel like it’s a big weight off my shoulders. Now I don’t have to worry about looking over my shoulder everyday wondering, ‘Is this going to be my day or not?'”

For nearly a century, the cement plant has been considered a blue-collar staple of the college town’s economy, and a place where workers could earn a comfortable living without an advanced degree. But sentiments among employees began to change over the past decade as management seemed to incrementally adopt a “corporate” attitude toward workers, said Robert Hodges, a former lead electrician and automation technician at the plant.
“The younger guys that come out as laborers, they have bad working conditions,” Hodges said. “They’re treated like garbage, and the turnover is tremendous. I can’t think of one laborer that’s been out there for longer than, like, two years.
“In our community,” Hodges continued, “you can go talk to anybody on the street and find somebody who has worked out there, been fired from out there, somebody who is a disgruntled, former employee.”
Hodges worked at the plant for 13 years before being fired in June. He alleges it was for his role in trying to organize a union vote. He’s asking the National Labor Relations Board to hear his case. 
“Now that we are unionized out there, I would be willing to return — absolutely,” Hodges said.
WyoFile’s inquiries to Mountain Cement Company and its parent company, Eagle Materials, were not returned by press time.
Driven to organize
The cement plant taps multiple quarries in the region that supply rock and aggregate. The material is crushed and then baked inside long boilers heated by coal. The slurry is processed into high-quality “portland” cement, according to the company. Cement is in high-demand for things like road construction and buildings, and wind turbine developers in the region use the product to build solid bases for wind towers.
“We’re the reddest right-to-work state in the nation, and they just proved that, even in Wyoming, you can fight and freaking win.”Marcie Kindred, Wyoming AFL-CIO
The nature of the operation — high temperatures, heavy equipment, moving parts and dusty operations that require continual maintenance — demands special attention to safety, according to workers.
“They [management] preach safety 24/7,” Hodges said. “You know, ‘That’s the most important thing,’ until it affects production. Then, all of the sudden, it’s like, ‘Nope. Now we have to get it done no matter what it takes.’”
Frequently, an employee will point out a piece of equipment that’s about to fail, Hodges said. But the fix is put off until it actually breaks down, usually requiring workers to come in during their time off. “Seems like it’s always at 2 a.m. on a Saturday,” he quipped. Management seems to routinely spring unscheduled maintenance tasks, “always on a Friday afternoon,” he added.
Hodges grew up in an anti-union family who worked in the trona patch in southwest Wyoming. For most of his adulthood, he thought he was anti-union, he said, or didn’t think about it much. That was the prevailing attitude at the plant for a long time, but working conditions and relations with management seemed to continually decline, making workers desperate, he explained.

There’s been talk about organizing at the plant for years, Hodges said, and workers gradually began to warm up to the idea. He also attributes this week’s vote to unionize to a growing number of younger workers who “aren’t so set in their ways,” he said.
Wyoming AFL-CIO Executive Director Marcie Kindred, who helped advise the cement plant workers, along with the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, said she was worried sick for the workers ahead of the vote. She alleged the company used typical anti-union tactics in recent months, like mandatory meetings to learn about the pitfalls of working in a union.
In general, management can be particularly retaliatory towards employees after a failed vote to organize, she said. “It can be really just devastating.” 
She was on an adrenaline high, though, after she learned about the successful vote.
“This means so much to Wyoming workers who feel voiceless, like there’s nowhere to turn,” Kindred said. “We’re the reddest right-to-work state in the nation, and they just proved that, even in Wyoming, you can fight and freaking win.”
Hicks said his teenage son frequently begged him to quit working at the plant, because he’d continually get called into work when he was scheduled to be off duty. “There was just no work/life balance,” he said.
The mood among workers was exuberant after Wednesday’s vote, which was tallied in the evening. Hicks said a co-worker sent him a text: “I’ve never been ready to go into work at MCC [Mountain Cement Company] except for tomorrow.”
“This is the first time I’ve seen everybody come together,” Hicks said. “I’ve never seen more hugs and high fives and handshakes and just smiling faces. It was awesome, like the birth of a child, you know. The whole family is just excited that it happened.”

Credit: Justin Taylor/The Current GA/CatchLight Local/Report for AmericaThis story has been republished through a partnership with The Current, an independent, in-depth and investigative journalism website for Coastal Georgia.
International Paper, a longtime pillar of Coastal Georgia’s economy, announced Thursday that it will permanently close its Savannah and Riceboro plants by the end of September and cut some 1,100 hourly and salaried jobs.

The closures of the company’s containerboard and packaging facilities in Savannah and its containerboard mill and timber and lumber operation in Riceboro are part of “actions to enhance its ability to serve and grow with customers while improving its manufacturing footprint,” the firm said in a news release.
While eliminating its operations in Savannah and Riceboro, the firm said it will invest $250 million for renovations at its Riverdale mill in Selma, Alabama, to produce container board and sell its global cellulose.
In its press release, the firm, the world’s largest pulp and paper company, said it will shutter its operations in Savannah and Riceboro “in phases by the end of September 2025.”
IP director of communications, Amy Simpson, said there are approximately 700 workers at the Savannah Mill and 100 at the box plant. The Riceboro plant employs about 300.
“We understand how deeply these decisions affect our employees, their loved ones, and the surrounding communities,” said Tom Hamic, executive vice president and president of the company’s North America Packaging Solutions business.
“We are committed to supporting both our employees and customers as we navigate this transition.”
Reactions
The firm’s operations in Savannah and the surrounding area stretch back nearly 88 years. It has employed generations of mill workers, boosting their families and the region’s economy.

In a statement, Savannah Mayor Van Johnson expressed disappointment about the closure and concern for the 650 Savannah-based employees. 
“Through seasons of change and challenge, International Paper has emerged to be a great corporate partner to our community,” he said. “As Savannah has always done, we will rise together. By combining our collective talent, wisdom, and resources, we will work to ensure that our neighbors have new opportunities to provide for themselves and their families.”
In Liberty County, county commission chair Donald Lovette was still processing the news on Thursday morning. “”All of a sudden, your life is kind of in limbo. So my heart goes out to all of them, especially those who are near retirement. It’s going to be quite an adjustment for them,” he said.
Savannah Area Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Bert Brantley echoed the emphasis on IP contributions to the city and willingness to work to place workers.
“Our Chamber is devastated to hear the news of International Paper’s decision to close its Savannah and Riceboro mills. IP has long been a terrific employer, engaged corporate citizen, and strong partner of the Chamber. In particular, the local leaders at IP have contributed immensely to the betterment of our community in more ways than we can count. We stand ready to work with our state partners at the Georgia Department of Labor, and our local teams at SEDA and RISE to support the employees as they navigate this next step in their lives.”
The corporate news release omits any mention of the company’s Port Wentworth biomass energy plant. The company operates more than a dozen large paper mills in the U.S.
IP’s Simpson confirmed the Port Wentworth pulp mill will not close but had been sold. “The Port Wentworth pulp mill is not affected by today’s closure announcements but is part of our Global Cellulose Fibers business and is included in the sale of that business to AIP, which was also announced today.”
Liberty County impact

The history of the plant goes back nearly 6 decades in Riceboro. The Interstate Paper Corporation established the Riceboro Paper Mill in 1966, the largest privately owned industry Liberty County had ever had, was established near the North Newport River at Riceboro in 1967. It was the site of the old Montevideo Plantation rice farm.
The plant grew to represent $300 million in economic impact for the county, according to Riceboro Mayor Chris Stacy, a 29-year IP employee. He heard the news after he woke up around noon after working last night’s overnight shift.
State Rep. Al Williams, who is chairman of the Liberty County Development Authority, described news of the closures as “difficult for our community, for our region.”
“My first concern is for the people whose livelihoods are affected, men and women who have given years of hard work and loyalty to these operations,” he said. The mill The mill specialized in producing Kraft linerboard, which contains 25%-30% recycled fiber.
Williams, who also serves as chairman of the Liberty County Development Authority, said the agency had offered “strong incentives for International Paper to stay and invest here. I know the company has not made this decision lightly though we had been working and hoping for a different outcome.
The authority, he said, would “do its best” to coordinate with company leadership to understand the timeline and transition plan and would join with local, regional and state agencies to “stand up support services and programs.”
The authority’s CEO, Brynn Grant, said the agency was moving immediately “to support impacted workers and local businesses in every way we can.”
She said she planned to coordinate with SNF, another Riceboro employer, to help find opportunities for IP workers.  “They certainly need people, and these will be people that have a great skill set who can blend into what they do, so we’re looking forward to working with them. She said Workforce Coastal, too, we’re going to work with them, of course Savannah Tech, we’re going to coordinate with them — all the players when it comes to gainful employment.”
Lovette said the county would try to make the process smooth for employees. “About 40% of the employees are from the Liberty County area. The rest of them would be from other areas,” he said. IP was Riceboro’s oldest and second largest employer; SNF is the largest.
A midday check of the Riceboro complex showed operations as usual, with a steady stream of timber trucks entering and leaving the plant. A security officer referred questions to Simpson.
Cars and trucks in the employee parking lot bore license plates not only from Liberty County but also from several surrounding counties: Long, Wayne, McIntosh, Brantley, and Glynn — indicating families throughout Coastal Georgia will be directly impacted by the closures.
“It’s even going to affect your loggers because the Savannah one is closed, Riceboro’s closed … gotta go to I guess Rayonier or either Brunswick, because there’s no more logging in this area,” Stacy said. “It’s going to affect everybody.”
“How do we recover truck drivers, logging company, all those people are affected in that area, you know? I’m really concerned about that,” Stacy said.
Georgia Speaker of the House Jon Burns (R-Newington), a fifth-generation timber farmer, also cited the longer tail of the closures. “I understand firsthand the challenges of facing changing markets and economic instability. These mill closures will undoubtedly deal a devastating blow not only to Georgia’s timber industry, but to the economic fabric of the entire Southeast Georgia region,” Burns said.
Stacy said that the timeline is tight for workers: “Sept. 8 is going to be the last operational [day] of making product, and the gate’s supposed to be locked on Oct. 20.” He said that the company is “doing some negotiation for service pay for some of the people out there” regarding severance. He also said he’d contacted IP with “just some concerns about making sure they get some help out there for the guys to cope with whatever’s going on. Just kind of saying that, in times like that, you’ve just really got to be careful because you don’t know where people’s minds’ (are) at.”
Corporate decision
International Paper employs more than 65,000 people and has operations in more than 30 countries. Its net sales in 2024 were $18.6 billion. In its press release, it said the moves announced Thursday were “part of a series of strategic changes to achieve an advantaged cost position, deliver a superior customer experience and maintain a high relative supply position as part of its ongoing transformation journey.”

Hamic said while “difficult,” the cutbacks in Georgia and investments in Alabama that were announced Thursday were “essential to positioning International Paper for long-term success, enabling us to focus on the geographies, customers, and products where we can create the most value.”
Leaving history
In Liberty County, commission chair Lovette said the county had been working to help IP stay in the county. He said the move would leave a cultural and emotional void.
“I remember people who were able to leave the timbering process, you know? Because Liberty County was primarily agricultural, of course, and timber,” he said. “And when that company came, they gave people a hand up, if you will. People were able to make a good living and provide for their families right from that company.”
In Riceboro, IP’s plant was previously known as Interstate Paper.
“They’ve been there the longest of anybody. Interstate Paper, I still go back to that name, they were the bread and butter for Liberty County for many, many years,” Lovette said. “A lot of our employees have been gainfully employed there. They were able to build homes and send their children to college, and all those kinds of things that made them a major and respected employee here in Liberty County. It’s been Interstate Paper, International Paper … we owe them a debt of gratitude.”

“Please accept this letter as formal notice of my resignation from the Colorado House of Representatives, effective immediately,” the Berthoud Republican wrote.
He did not provide a reason for the immediate resignation, but House Democratic leadership announced earlier in the day that they planned to censure Armagost for taking a photo of a Democratic representative and sending it to an internal Republican group chat in April, as reported by Colorado Public Radio. In that group chat, Republican members compared the Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Yara Zokaie of Fort Collins to a prostitute because of her clothing. The photo became the center of social media harassment against Zokaie.

Alander Rocha/Georgia RecorderVice President JD Vance spoke in Peachtree City Thursday where he promoted the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) as a “tax cut for families” while mounting a campaign against Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia.
Vance, who spoke for just over 30 minutes at the ALTA Refrigeration facility, promoted OBBBA as an “American tax cut,” which he said was designed to benefit American families and workers.
“If you’re working hard every single day right here in the United States, or if you’re building a business right here in the United States, you ought to have a tax code that rewards you instead of punishes you,” Vance said, claiming that OBBBA would increase take-home pay for working class A Americans by over $10,000 over several years, primarily through tax cuts, specifically pointing to a deduction in overtime tax and tips, as well as an increased child tax credit.

He contrasted these policies with what he said was Sen. Ossoff’s opposition to the bill, alleging that Ossoff voted against it “because he is allegedly worried about people getting paid while they’re healthy.”
Ossoff, who is up for reelection in 2026, said in a statement that Vance’s visit to Georgia was to defend the “hugely unpopular budget law.” According to a press release from Ossoff’s campaign, Vance’s visit came during a week when multiple news outlets reported how Trump’s budget law was creating a crisis for rural health care in Georgia.
“I think it is embarrassing for the Vice President to be coming to Georgia to sell a policy that is already resulting in harm to hospitals in the state of Georgia, that’s projected to throw more than 100,000 people off of health care in the state of Georgia,” Ossoff said in a statement.
Vance repeatedly linked immigration to the strain on public resources, particularly health care, and repeatedly used strong language regarding immigration, framing it as a threat to American workers and public services. He claimed in his speech that cuts to Medicaid would only impact “illegal aliens,” claiming that cuts are “not about kicking people off the health care.”
“It’s about people kicking illegal aliens the hell out of this country so we can preserve health care,” Vance said.
He said that government-provided benefits like Medicare and Medicaid should be reserved for American citizens, not “illegal aliens” who he claimed have no legal right to be in the country.
Derek Dooley, a former football coach and candidate for U.S. Senate, also took aim at Ossoff, accusing Ossoff of supporting policies that led to high inflation and borders that were “wide open.”
“And now, he resists any type of progress we’re making, especially all the common-sense provisions of the big, beautiful bill,” Dooley said.
U.S. Rep Mike Collins from the 10th Congressional District, who is also running for U.S. Senate, also used his time to criticize Ossoff, saying that Ossoff “doesn’t reflect Georgia’s values” and called him a “trust fund kid” who comes to Georgia to pay “lip service” who goes to Washington to vote with “the woke.”
“He never had to work hard in his life. He doesn’t know how to build a business, make decisions and have results,” Collins said.
Congressman Buddy Carter, another Republican seeking to run for Ossoff’s seat, also praised OBBBA, blamed immigrants for endangering Medicaid and called for work requirements for the program.
Less than two miles from where Vance spoke, people gathered to protest his appearance. Phyllis Williamson, a 77-year-old resident from Fayetteville, said this was her 21st protest in five months due to deep concern over the budget cuts. She said she was concerned that budget cuts would lead to more hospital closures, as well as cuts to food assistance programs.
“All these cuts are going to hurt us. They’re taking money from poor people,” Williamson said. “Stop hurting the middle class. Stop hurting seniors and children and poor people. Do something for somebody besides the rich.”
Another demonstrator, Loretta Keith, a 65-year-old resident of Fayetteville, said she was protesting the “fascism going on.” She said that as a retired school teacher, she was “doing OK,” but pointed to the children at the protest, saying she was worried about their future.
“I’m 65, but look at these babies out here,” she said. “I’m worried about it going further than it’s gone, and we can’t bring it back, that people are just going to die, just like Nazi Germany, and it breaks my heart.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSC06216-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-21 18:56:43.674188

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)LENEXA — Leon Patton, a retired assistant U.S. attorney who once prosecuted immigrants for violent crimes, is tired of feeling shamed for supporting immigration enforcement efforts and referring to people as “aliens.”
The 74-year-old traversed the Kansas City metro, from his home in Prairie Village to the Lenexa City Council chambers, to grouse about the community’s backlash to federal raids at local restaurants. The Lenexa police investigation of council member Melanie Arroyo’s citizenship also had been a flashpoint for controversy, but Patton wasn’t concerned with that.
He told the council at Tuesday’s meeting that he wanted to share his “specialized knowledge,” gleaned from 30 years of experience as a federal prosecutor before retiring in 2020. Mainly, he wanted them to know that some immigrants are criminals.
“Please,” he implored, “don’t be misled by things you might read in the newspaper or hear on the news.”
He referenced a Kansas City Star report on the July 30 raids at El Toro Loco restaurants in Lenexa and Kansas City, Kansas. The agents brandished a search warrant that authorized them to seize documents relating to the exploitation of workers — but arrested workers instead.
The raids were typical of how federal agents nationwide are carrying out President Donald Trump’s anti-immigration agenda — ignoring civil rights and indiscriminatingly targeting people who have committed no crime, have legal standing to be in the country, or are in fact U.S. citizens.
But the way Patton sees it, that’s not a complete narrative.
He talked about prosecuting Jorge Carrillo-Hernandez, an immigrant from Mexico who had been deported multiple times and repeatedly committed violent crimes after returning to the U.S. A federal judge in 2018 sentenced Carrillo-Hernandez to six years in prison. Patton said a criminal conviction in Johnson County was related to Carrillo-Hernandez “selling his bride of 19 days, who was three months pregnant.”
“You wonder why there are people in the middle of the political spectrum who vote for someone like Donald Trump? Well, part of it is there are haters out there who think that people like me, who are simply enforcing the laws, are evil,” Patton said.
He lamented how “people on the left,” in his mind, “want to scold and shame and silence the people who disagree with them. They call you racist.”
For example, he asserted, there is nothing wrong with referring to an immigrant as an “alien,” because federal law uses the term to refer to someone who is not a U.S. citizen.
“If you think that it’s somehow racist to use the word ‘alien,’ then I presume you got your education by sitting in movie theaters and watching movies about extraterrestrials,” Patton said. “Meanwhile, some of us get our education by sitting in courtrooms and by reading federal statutes.”

‘Progress and respect’
Arroyo — the council member who was forced to prove her citizenship to police because a local resident complained about something he misread — said in an interview that it was “absolutely reasonable” to arrest the kind of violent criminals Patton talked about.
But, she said, Patton failed to mention that federal authorities are targeting immigrants who aren’t criminals.
“A lot of them have never even committed crimes in their own countries of origin,” Arroyo said. “I think it’s OK to have a conversation about immigration enforcement when it comes to violent offenders, absolutely, but we also need to be considerate of the fact that it’s not the reality today.”
Arroyo, a clinical counselor and art therapist, said she felt “a little bit conflicted” about Patton’s point on the use of shame.
On one hand, she said, “shaming others is counterproductive.” Ideally, she said, she could gently point out “certain language or ways or belief systems that are unacceptable.”
“At the same time, most people don’t feel the need to change unless there is some level of shame. So that’s why I’m saying I’m a little bit conflicted,” Arroyo said. “Because the thing is, we have tried to tell them nicely. Like, ‘Please don’t call us that.’ And they still won’t listen. So think the shaming is just a response to the fact that we’re frustrated, that we feel like we’re not being heard or just completely being dismissed.”
She said he understood why people would use the word “alien” to refer to immigrants, since the term has been used to describe foreigners since the country’s founding. But the argument that is merely a legal term “is an attempt to intellectualize your way out of change,” she said.
“Given today’s use of the word ‘alien’ in sci-fi, and the discriminatory context in which the word is used to dehumanize immigrants, it has become insensitive and outdated,” Arroyo said. “This is similar to the same way the mental health profession discontinued using offensive language to diagnose people with disabilities. Language changes over time, and it’s OK to abandon certain terms for the sake of progress and respect.”

‘Quit alienating people’
In an interview after the meeting, Patton said he had never heard anyone use the word “alien” with the intent to dehumanize someone. He clarified that he believes it’s wrong to call someone an “illegal alien” or “an illegal.” And, he said, he is “not a Trump person by any means.”
He noted that his copy of a Bible printed in 1984 uses the word “alien” but that a newer edition changed the word to “foreigner.”
“OK, I sort of get it,” he said, but added, “I don’t think it’s fair to say you’re being racist” by using the word “alien” to refer to a person.
During his comments to the council, he said people might want to think about how they could “actually effect change in our society.”
“Putting signs on your car — ‘Trump lies.’ Yes, he does. ‘Abolish ICE.’ Not going to happen,” Patton said. “You need to quit alienating people in the middle of the political spectrum by calling them racist and evil simply for applying the laws that are in effect. We’re tired of being bullied. We’re tired of people trying to shame us.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/P8190884-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-21 18:56:43.674188

Spencer Cox speaks with members of the media during the governor's news conference broadcast by PBS Utah at the Eccles Broadcast Center in Salt Lake City on Thursday, August 21, 2025. (Pool photo by Rick Egan/The Salt Lake Tribune) An at times heated Utah Gov. Cox sparred with reporters Thursday over the fallout from reports that Utah Senate President Stuart Adams initiated passage of a law that later helped his 18-year-old granddaughter reach a plea deal in a criminal case involving sex with a 13-year-old. 
Cox said he didn’t think an ethics investigation or a third-party review is warranted, saying “there’s nothing to investigate.” 
“The facts are abundantly clear. It’s been reported. I don’t think anybody’s denied that what happened, happened,” Cox said, adding he learned about the situation when The Salt Lake Tribune first reported it earlier this month. 
Cox argued the most pertinent question is whether Adams “should have told me about it” or “should he have leaned on me.” 
“I can only imagine how people would have reacted if he had done that,” the governor said. 
“Look, there have been times in my term as governor, when I’ve been so mad at Stuart Adams that I couldn’t see straight on certain bills,” Cox said, without naming those instances. “That has happened a couple of times. I can tell you this is not one of those times.” 



Cox said he believed Adams acted appropriately by not publicly weighing in on the bill or disclosing his relatives’ involvement to other legislators other than his right-hand man, Senate Majority Leader Kirk Cullimore, R-Sandy. 
“I think it was appropriate for the top person in the Senate not to weigh in on this bill, which is exactly what happened,” Cox said. 
In fact, Cox — who signed the bill after it passed last year — said he’s “very grateful that I had no idea that this was impacting someone in his family, in his granddaughter’s family, because it may have changed the way I reacted to the bill.” Instead, he said he was able to focus only on the policy.
The governor added that there’s “no controversy about whether people knew this was in the bill or not.” 
“The only question I have is this is the right policy? And this is a really tough one, guys,” Cox said. “This is a hard one. You have kids in high school being treated differently, depending on where their birthday falls during the year. And if their birthday falls in May instead of June, then they get treated the same as a 50-year-old who had a sexual relationship with a 13-year-old. And that’s the question. Is that fair?”
The Tribune reported that Adams, “surprised by the severity of the charges” that were first filed against his relative, confided with Cullimore and asked him to look into the issue. The original charges included two counts of child rape and two counts of child sodomy, all first-degree felonies, with the possibility of 25 years to life in prison and requirements to register as a sex offender, the Tribune reported. 
Cullimore also said he consulted Cara Tangaro, the defense attorney representing Adams’ granddaughter, for more information on the case and to help draft language that was later put into a sweeping criminal justice bill, SB213, during the Utah Legislature’s 2024 session. 
That provision allowed lower-level charges to be filed against 18-year-olds still enrolled in high school, allowing them to be treated the same as 17-year-olds in similar cases. The bill was not retroactive, and Adams’ relative was not charged with the lower penalties it created, but the new law was referenced in court hearings before the case was resolved with a plea deal.

“You saw the legislative change,” Tangaro told Judge Rita Cornish at sentencing, the Tribune reported. “We all agree that’s not retroactive, but the government did change their offer based on that.”
Ultimately, Adams’ 18-year-old relative took a plea deal that meant she would not serve additional time in jail, would serve four years on probation, and would not register as a sex offender, the Tribune reported. 
In the interview with KSL.com and Deseret News, Adams said his granddaughter made a mistake, but he also argued she received appropriate penalties, saying she was arrested at her high school, spent eight days in jail, and spent more than 500 days under house arrest with an ankle monitor. 
“What a humiliating event,” Adams told the outlets. “Now we’re heaping on her a scarlet letter on her forehead. It’s wrong. The stories are wrong. … She’s been convicted and tried, and now we’re doing it again in the media and it’s wrong.”
The 13-year-old victim’s mother, however, told the Tribune she felt like she was “punched in the gut” after she learned about the law change, and she felt as though her child was an afterthought both in the policy debate and the criminal case. 
“I feel like a law is the law, regardless of who you are, but that wasn’t what was going on here,” the mother told the Tribune. “I feel like [the 18-year-old] just got special treatment …and nobody was going to say anything about it.”
In wake of the Tribune story, calls for Adams’ resignation have come from some Democrats, including Sen. Nate Blouin, D-Millcreek, and Utah Democratic Party Chair Brian King. They’ve also come from some corners of the right, with roughly 100 mostly conservative people rallying at the Utah Capitol in Salt Lake City over the weekend to call for Adams to resign.

Adams has rejected those calls and has denied any wrongdoing, telling KSL.com and Deseret News that he didn’t tell legislators about the case involving his granddaughter in an effort to keep the process fair. In an interview with the outlets, Adams and Cullimore also argued that the bill’s process was proper and not unusual.
“There’s nothing unusual about how this bill came about,” Adams told the outlets. “Every bill that we run has some type of connection to a constituent, to a lobbyist, to an industry leader, to a personal experience a legislator has.”
Other Republican lawmakers, including Sen. Todd Weiler, R-Woods Cross, have defended Adams and the process that led to the bill’s passage. He told KSL.com and Deseret News that he didn’t know about the connection to Adams’ granddaughter when the bill was debated, and that’s how it should be. 
At least one Republican legislator, however — the House sponsor of the bill, then-House Majority Whip Karianne Lisonbee, R-Syracuse — has expressed concerns that that section of the omnibus criminal justice bill didn’t go through the same vetting process as the rest of the bill.
In a statement issued last week, House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, said due to “heightened attention on SB213, I believe it’s important to reconvene stakeholders for further discussion to ensure we have arrived at the right policy.”
“I have spoken with President Adams, and he agrees,” Schultz said. “We will convene a working group to conduct a comprehensive review of state policy in this area to ensure our laws protect public safety, uphold accountability, and serve the best interests of all Utahns.”
Cox on Thursday left the door open to changes to the law, saying when he signed the bill it was a “close call.” 
“Maybe it’s not the right policy. Maybe now that we have an opportunity to reflect on it, maybe it doesn’t go far enough or it goes too far, and that’s what we do. That’s the process,” Cox said.
The governor again defended Adams’ role in the bill. While he brought it to Cullimore to address, he didn’t publicly debate it or tell legislators about his connection to the issue. 
“Every single legislator has experiences in their life where they see something that they feel may be unjust, and that influences the way they bring legislation to the table,” Cox said. “Again, I have lots of reasons to get upset with Stuart Adams. This was not one of them. I’m really grateful he never talked to me about it.”

(Photo by Shayla Blatchford / Courtesy New Mexico Coalition of Sexual Violence Programs)Community organizations from across New Mexico received a boost of public funding this week that they will use over the next year to prevent violence.
The nonprofit New Mexico Coalition of Sexual Assault Programs distributed $1.5 million in one-time state grant funding to 18 different nonprofit organizations practicing evidence-based solutions to violence, according to a news release on Wednesday. The recipients received between $30,000 to $200,000 each, according to the release.
Coalition of Sexual Assault Programs Executive Director Alexandria Taylor told Source NM on Thursday that the grant recipients use public health approaches to preventing people’s harmful behavior in the first place rather than policing it after the fact.
“It’s investing in longer hours at a community center, people who are holding dance lessons for young people, or giving young people and their peers something to be proud of in their communities and in their daily lives,” Taylor said in an interview. “The antidote to violence is joy and connection.”
Director of Prevention Jess Clark told Source the grant recipients are trying to address the root causes of sexual, intimate partner and gun violence; and they already have deep trusted relationships in their communities.
“These are the programs that our communities who are most impacted by violence are already turning to,” he said in an interview. “One incredible thing about doing prevention work that’s rooted in a public health framework is that when you’re focusing on one area, you end up impacting many other areas of violence. So it ends up being money that is very, very well spent.”
Organizations applied for the grants in July, Taylor said. Recipients had to be nonprofits and were chosen based on their proven histories of culturally reflective violence prevention programming and their abilities to complete the work within the next year, Clark said.
For example, Casa Fortaleza offers prevention presentations and educational workshops for survivors of sexual violence in Spanish-speaking communities. The funding will allow them to expand their services, Director of Education and Community Engagement Marian Méndez-Cera said in a statement.
“We focus on proactive solutions rooted in prevention — educating communities, challenging harmful norms, and fostering a culture of respect and consent,” Méndez-Cera said. “As a trauma-informed agency, we provide strength-based, community-driven, linguistically specific services that honor survivors’ dignity and draw from the values, traditions, and collective strength of the communities we serve.”
More than half of all New Mexicans have been sexually assaulted or raped at some point in their life, and 40% have been the victim of some kind of sexual violence while in New Mexico in the previous year, according to a report the coalition commissioned earlier this year.
Unlock Civics New Mexico received another grant for its work empowering young people impacted by incarceration, poverty and trauma to become civic leaders through project-based learning, peer mentorship and advocacy for systemic change.
“Guided by the truth that our liberation is bound together, we are weaving networks of safety and belonging that resist disposability and affirm life,” Unlock Civics NM Program Director Justin Allen said in a statement. “Together, we are building the conditions for safer, more connected communities, not only for today, but as an inheritance of justice and possibility for generations to come.”
Other grant recipients include the Albuquerque-based Keshet Dance Company, Arise Sexual Assault Services in Portales, Tewa Women United in Española and the Chavez County CASA Program in Roswell.
The money comes from the Violence Intervention Program Fund created in 2022 by the New Mexico Legislature and overseen by the New Mexico Department of Health, which hired the Coalition of Sexual Assault Programs to distribute the funds, Taylor said.
The coalition itself received $200,000 to pay for training the grant recipients and evaluating their work based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention standards, she said.
“We are excited to have this opportunity to expand support for community organizations working on holistic public health approaches to violence intervention,” DOH Office of Injury and Violence Prevention Manager Kathleen Maese told Source on Thursday. “These organizations implement evidence-based, community-centered, and culturally appropriate programs covering upstream prevention and intervention to address violence.”

(Photo courtesy of Rawpixel)Federal Communications Commission documents show internet service providers struggling to bring high-speed connectivity to Montanans, including one provider with contracts from the state through ConnectMT, the state’s organization for building out broadband infrastructure.
Blackfoot Communications told the FCC in May it was not going to be able to finish a project to bring broadband to certain areas, including those that have been targeted for federal funding. 
Blackfoot serves Western Montana and parts of Idaho and specifically has looked to complete projects in rural areas including Plains, Drummond, and Darby. 
Meanwhile, NorthWestern Energy sent the FCC a letter in late February calling into question the construction practices of a multi-state internet service provider, Ziply Fiber, which is attempting to connect as many as 55,000 Montanans with high-speed internet. Ziply has focused on larger cities in Montana, including Missoula, Great Falls, Billings and Butte.
Ziply recently finished a merger process, which prompted the letter, though NorthWestern officially took no position on that acquisition by BCE, Inc. The acquisition was finalized earlier this month.
In another example, Intermountain Infrastructure Group’s legal battle with Burlington Northern Santa Fe centers on easements on railroad property. Court documents in that case stated BNSF had halted permits for all IIG fiber optic projects on the railroad company’s land.
Multiple internet service providers and fiber optic companies appear to be having issues in Montana, though what those impacts are on communities looking for high-speed access is unclear. According to the state’s broadband map, vast swaths of central and eastern Montana are considered “underserved.”
Some of these companies have contracts or are involved with the state’s ConnectMT project in some way. Blackfoot directly has contracts with the nearly billion-dollar program, while IIG is creating the fiber-optic infrastructure some companies with ConnectMT contracts are connecting into. Ziply, meanwhile, is attempting to jump into the fray.
ConnectMT and the state’s broadband buildout was created with two pieces of legislation from 2021 — Senate Bill 297 and House Bill 632. It’s a huge project, not only in cost, but in scale, too. It is estimated nearly a quarter of Montanans do not have an internet subscription of any kind, according to the state.
“The Governor approved 61 projects recommended for funding … covering 61,887 serviceable locations across Montana,” the ConnectMT website reads. “Of these locations, 38,631 are unserved communities, 21,956 are underserved communities, and 1,300 are frontier communities.”
  ‘Alternative funding’

In 2022, Blackfoot Communications applied for and was awarded funding through ConnectMT.
State project recommendation documents show Blackfoot was likely to receive around $60 million dollars for seven projects around the state. 
“Blackfoot will use these grants together with its own capital to build fiber broadband to more locations than ever before,” Blackfoot CEO Jason Williams wrote on the company’s website. “One way or another, Blackfoot plans to bring fiber-based broadband to all of its Cooperative members in the coming years.”
The company was at the top of the state’s priority list, which is shown in the ConnectMT planning documents — project applications are ranked, and Blackfoot Communications is at the top. While not all projects were recommended to be fully funded, every Blackfoot project was. Those documents do not include the number of new high-speed internet connections per project.
Blackfoot Communications did not respond to a request for comment. Locations impacted appeared to be in Missoula and Lake Counties, according to FCC documents.
The letter to the FCC states Blackfoot notified the Montana Broadband Office it wasn’t going to fulfill its obligations, in part “so they can become eligible for alternative funding, particularly Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (“BEAD”) funding.”
Montana qualifies for about $629 million in BEAD funding from that pot which is coming from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. The state Legislature has also squirrelled away money for infrastructure upgrades.
ConnectMT reopened BEAD applications on July 7 of this year.
“The Montana Broadband Office is ready to move the BEAD process forward to finish the drill and connect Montanans,” said Department of Administration Director Misty Ann Giles said in a media release announcing the reopening. “We continue to be grateful for the new guidelines and know that broadband availability for unserved and underserved areas of our state is within reach.”
When asked if there were any long-term concerns with fiber optic providers in Montana in relation to ConnectMT, the Daily Montanan was asked by the program to file a records request.
It’s unclear how much money has been spent in the program since its 2021 inception, how many connections have actually been made and who, exactly, has contracts with the state. The Daily Montanan has filed a records request for every ConnectMT contract to date.
In Blackfoot’s case, costs and money apparently are at the heart of the problems, according to documents filed with FCC.  The company was awarded Rural Digital Opportunity Funding to complete fiber optic upgrades to its system. The letter said the company was “relinquishing” 688 of 2,687 total locations awarded to Blackfoot through the grant in a May, 13, 2025 letter to the FCC. 
It’s unclear if each of the locations represent one business, home, or Community Anchor Institution, which are places like libraries and medical centers. The Flathead Valley, a place where Blackfoot is active, is among the most underserved areas in Montana, according to a five-year BEAD plan document.
“Blackfoot has experienced extraordinary cost increases to build fiber-to-the-premises (“FTTP”). While Blackfoot has made significant progress in building gigabit speed broadband Internet to hundreds of Rural Digital Opportunity Funding (RDOF) locations, it has already spent significantly more capital than it had planned to spend on its entire RDOF project area making it unfeasible to deploy FTTP gigabit speed broadband to the three Census Block Groups (CBGs) that Blackfoot is returning,” the letter reads.
In a response letter, the FCC said it was stopping financial support to Blackfoot for those areas, but would still hold the company responsible for its contractual obligations, according to FCC documents. It said that if Blackfoot doesn’t meet the terms of its contract that it would be placed on a “non-compliance” list.
The FCC said the grant does not provide for partial withdrawals from the program. It was unclear how much money Blackfoot is going to lose and neither FCC document mentions that number.
The FCC also said the census block areas Blackfoot is relinquishing are now available for “alternative funding.”

  ‘Unsafe actions’

Ziply’s problems are different from Blackfoot’s, but could impact thousands of Montanans.
NorthWestern, which owns vast amounts of infrastructure in the state, is concerned with how Ziply is attaching its fiber optic cables to its power poles.
In August 2024, NorthWestern filed a complaint for injunctive relief in Yellowstone County District Court against Ziply.
“In May of 2024, NorthWestern learned that Ziply Pacific, either directly or through Ziply Montana or Ziply Wireless, began attaching infrastructure, to NorthWestern’s poles without waiting for the make-ready work to be approved and completed,” court documents said, which went on to state it was in violation of established agreements.
NorthWestern was represented by Crist, Krough, Alke, & Nord, PLLC. Ziply, meanwhile, was represented by Monica Tranel and Moulton Bellingham P.C.
NorthWestern did not hold back in its letter to the FCC, which included a copy of the complaint and even a sworn statement from a separate investigation the Idaho Public Service Commission is conducting into Ziply.
“The concern we want the FCC to consider is that Ziply has not conducted itself for the good of its employees, customers, or the public,” the letter reads, which is signed by Shannon Heim, a vice president in NorthWestern’s legal department. “Its unsafe actions have negatively impacted, and continue to negatively impact, the communities it purports to serve – which are also our communities.”
The letter also includes agreements between Ziply and NorthWestern, which include specific stipulations for how the internet company could utilize the energy company’s powerlines.
In a 2023 letter from NorthWestern, it stated Ziply was looking to attach lines to approximately 19,500 poles. 
They wanted it to happen quickly, too.
“Ziply desires to expedite and facilitate the application, survey, engineering and make-ready construction process, including the process of replacing poles, which will benefit Ziply in furtherance of its effort to expand its footprint in Montana,” A NorthWestern email to Ziply said. “NorthWestern is willing to expedite and facilitate Ziply’s attachment requests pursuant to the following enumerated process.”
Ziply was expected to pay between $19.75 and $25.50 per pole for the attachments. NorthWestern and Ziply negotiated several agreements, court documents said, but those apparently soured. NorthWestern went so far as to say Ziply was putting its employees at risk, Charter employees utilizing NorthWestern poles at risk and homeowners at risk, too.
In one example, NorthWestern employees observed Ziply cables too close to one of their power lines.
“This creates the risk of the two touching, thereby energizing the Ziply line,” court documents stated. “This does not merely create a hazard for communications workers, it creates a hazard for homeowners or tree-trimmers who maintain trees and shrubs on their property.”
Ziply does not have contacts with the state, Ziply spokesperson Ryan Luckin wrote in an email. He added that Ziply is pursuing BEAD funding.
According to reporting from Fierce, a trade publication, the company was looking to add 55,000 new internet connections in 2024. It wasn’t immediately clear how many connections the company has in Montana, though it is still looking to expand. 
NorthWestern also took aim at where Ziply has targeted its operations.
“Ziply does not appear to be extending broadband services to Montana’s smaller communities or rural areas,” the NorthWestern letter to the FCC stated. “It is difficult to imagine the benefit of bringing an additional broadband service provider to the largest communities in Montana outweighs the risk of Ziply’s unsafe operation around NorthWestern’s electric facilities.”
In a response to the Daily Montanan, Ziply said it’s hoping to work with the energy company moving forward.

(Photos courtesy of campaigns)With Washington state’s primary in the books, the focus shifts to the November general election for nine Democratic state lawmakers seeking to keep seats to which they were appointed.
Each of them won Aug. 5, some more easily than others, in results certified Wednesday by the secretary of state’s office.
In the closest primary contest, Democratic state Sen. Deb Krishnadasan beat Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier by 1,158 votes in the 26th Legislative District that spans parts of Pierce and Kitsap counties. It is expected to be tight when they face off again this fall.
Krishnadasan trailed Caldier on election night. She moved in front on the second day of ballot counting and stayed there. Republicans view this race as their best opportunity to gain a seat in the Senate, where Democrats hold a 30-19 edge.
In another high-profile match-up, Democratic Sen. Victoria Hunt finished comfortably ahead of Republican Chad Magendanz, a former state lawmaker, in the 5th District in east King County. As the only two candidates, they will line up against each other again in a few weeks.
In the 48th District, two Democratic candidates — Sen. Vandana Slatter and Rep. Amy Walen — are advancing. Slatter sent a strong message by garnering nearly 60% of the vote in the district encompassing Redmond, Bellevue and Kirkland.
Democratic Rep. Edwin Obras and fellow Democrat Kevin Schilling, the mayor of Burien, advanced in the 33rd District in south King County. Obras won with 47% followed by Schilling with 31%. Republican Darryl Jones finished with nearly 22%.
Walen and Schilling are each considered the more moderate candidates in those two contests.
In the 41st District, Democratic Rep. Janice Zahn and Republican John Whitney will square off in November. Zahn is heavily favored after capturing 64% of the vote to Whitney’s 28%. This district includes Mercer Island and Newcastle, along with parts of Bellevue, Renton, Issaquah, and Sammamish.
In the 48th District, Democratic Rep. Osman Salahuddin garnered 63% to finish ahead of Republican Dennis Ellis, who had nearly 29%. Democrat Ranga Bondada was a distant third.
Three appointed legislators — state Sens. Tina Orwall of Des Moines and Emily Alvarado of Seattle, and Rep. Brianna Thomas of West Seattle — were unopposed but will still appear on ballots in November. Orwall serves in the 33rd District. Alvarado and Thomas represent the 34th District in Seattle.
Ballots for the Nov. 4 general election will be mailed to voters by Oct. 17.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/primary-2025-krishnadasan-caldier-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-21 18:56:43.674188

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — South Dakota Public Broadcasting Executive Director Julie Overgaard announced Thursday that the organization plans to lay off 15 employees and eliminate two locally produced shows due to a loss of federal funding. 
SDPB depended on $2.2 million in annual funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which was about 20% of SDPB’s budget. Congress and President Donald Trump rescinded $1.1 billion in previously approved nationwide funding for the corporation earlier this summer, causing the corporation to announce it will cease operations.
State funds account for a little more than half of SDPB’s budget, while fundraising, private donations and other sources make up the rest.
Corporation for Public Broadcasting to close its doors after loss of funding

The cuts will eliminate two in-depth public affairs journalism programs, “South Dakota Focus” on television and “In The Moment” on the radio. The cuts will also eliminate education resources provided by SDPB and reduce the output of the magazine-style TV program “Dakota Life.”
“South Dakota Focus” Producer and Host Jackie Hendry will be repositioned, Overgaard confirmed in response to a South Dakota Searchlight question. “In The Moment” Host Lori Walsh’s position is on the chopping block along with her show. 
Overgaard has been in contact with U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson’s office as well as U.S. Sens. Mike Rounds and John Thune, who are all Republicans and all voted in favor of rescinding the Corporation for Public Broadcasting’s funding.
“They’re sorry,” Overgaard said. “But they’re not going to be our champions on the Hill.”
Johnson, who said he donates to the Friends of South Dakota Public Broadcasting, told South Dakota reporters Wednesday at Dakotafest in Mitchell that SDPB “does a really impressive job.”
He supported the recission because he doesn’t believe taxpayers should pay for some of the public broadcasting content he doesn’t agree with in other states, he said. He also spoke of federal budgetary concerns, saying “at some point, when you’re $2 trillion upside down, you do actually have to start tightening the belt.”
SDPB provides non-commercial public radio and television across South Dakota. In addition to news coverage, the organization provides live video and audio feeds of legislative and state government meetings, educational content, cultural programming, high school activities broadcasts, and emergency alerts.
SDPB will continue to deliver content from National Public Radio and the national Public Broadcasting Service. Broadcasts of high school sports and activities, which are among SDPB’s most popular offerings, will also continue.

Overgaard said the layoffs and cuts weren’t based on analytics.
“It was based on not endangering our state funding right now,” she said.
Last winter, the organization fought off a reduction in state funding proposed by then-Gov. Kristi Noem. State Rep. Erik Muckey, D-Sioux Falls, invoked that effort Thursday in a news release while also saying South Dakota’s members of Congress “have forgotten who they serve.”
“This past session, state legislators on both sides of the aisle agreed: SDPB is necessary for the good of our state,” Muckey said. “These cuts were 100% preventable, and if there is any reduction of SDPB programming that South Dakotans know and love, you know who to blame: Sen. Thune, Sen. Rounds, and Rep. Johnson.”
In addition to the 15 layoffs, four open positions will remain unfilled. The layoffs represent about a 25% decrease in SDPB’s current workforce. Overgaard warned of the reduction last month, saying she would make the details public after they were finalized.
The affected employees will remain in their positions until the end of October. Overgaard said some positions could be retained if more funding is secured.
Friends of SDPB, the nonprofit that raises money for the organization, has raised $1.1 million since the potential layoffs were announced. The organization will continue to fundraise through October for the effort to avoid cuts.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_7138-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-21 18:56:43.674188

(Photo: Anna Liz Nichols)State Rep. Donni Steele (R-Orion Township) is looking to shift to the state Senate in 2026, filing paperwork earlier this week to run in the newly redrawn 23rd Senate District. 
Steele is serving her second term in the House after eking out single-digit victories in both the 2022 and 2024 elections. She represents the 54th House District, which includes Bloomfield Hills, Orion Township, a portion of Auburn Hills and portions of Bloomfield Township and Oakland Township.
Steele was considered a rising star for House Republicans heading into 2024, but has broken from her party on some occasions. She was one of the only legislative Republicans to condemn state Rep. Josh Schriver (R-Oxford) for his social media posts supporting the white supremacist “Great Replacement” conspiracy theory. She also voted in favor of legislation instituting safe storage requirements for firearms, prompting a recall effort which was ultimately rejected.

Steele told the Michigan Advance that the Senate offers more autonomy and an opportunity to serve a larger group of people than the House, and she’s ready for that challenge. 
While the current 23rd Senate District is held by Sen. Jim Runestad (D-White Lake), Steele said she views the new 23rd District as Sen. Ruth Johnson’s (R-Holly) district with Runestad’s number, as the new district encompasses parts of northern Oakland County and Lapeer County, although Johnson’s 24th Senate District also included parts of Macomb County. 
“I used to be a realtor and the area in which I mostly sold was North Oakland County. And so for me, that is just like my backyard,” Steele said.
With both Runestad and Johnson at the end of their 12-year legislative term limits, Steele said she thought she would leap while the opportunity is there. 
In making the move to the Senate, Steele said she would like to focus on funding for neighborhood roads in northern Oakland County, which she said have been neglected. She also mentioned advocating for an expansion to the Poly Ann Trail as a smaller project.
With Steele aiming to make the leap to the state Senate, the 54th House District will likely serve as a key target for Michigan Democrats, continuing a trend from the previous cycle.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-25-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-08-21 18:56:43.674188

The increasingly digital world -- in which people and businesses are constantly searching the Internet, turning to AI for help, or storing information in the cloud -- has led to a growing need for data centers to support online activity.
The post Tax change lifts plans for “hyperscale” data center campus in Westfield appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","Developers in the coming months could break ground on a western Massachusetts data center campus where investments could total $4 billion, a project buoyed by a new state tax incentive.
But as officials iron out regulatory frameworks, some advocates urged the state on Thursday to strengthen environmental protections surrounding the facilities.
A 2024 economic development law included a sales and use tax exemption for qualified data centers, which applies to equipment, software, electricity usage, and construction costs tied to the building, renovation or refurbishment of the facilities.
That financial relief was critical to advancing Servistar Realties’ vision to establish a data center campus in Westfield, said Jeff Daley, CEO of Westmass Area Development Corporation. Servistar is currently courting hyperscale developers, companies like Microsoft and Google, interested in setting up shop on the campus.
The increasingly digital world — in which people and businesses are constantly searching the Internet, turning to AI for help, or storing information in the cloud — has led to a growing need for data centers to support online activity.
Daley, who estimates pre-development work could start in the “next six months or so,” said the 2024 law “really put a new focus on the realization that a hyperscale center could come to Massachusetts, particularly the Westfield site.” Daley said pre-development work involves “finishing permitting, putting together bids, power agreements etc.”
“Once a tenant is identified then we start finishing pre development work which will position for construction to begin, likely in the next 12 months,” Daley said.
Local officials approved the data center campus proposal in 2021. Project leaders were drawn to Westfield due to an Eversource transmission interconnect and a new substation improving reliability in the region, fiber infrastructure, airport location access and “very attractive” energy costs through ISO New England, according to minutes from a joint public hearing of the Westfield City Council and Planning Board.
“The final leg of the stool was to get this sales tax exemption passed, number one, to be competitive with the rest of the country, but also really to encourage these end-users and these developers to come in and take this development seriously,” Daley said.
Thirty-two states offer subsidies for data centers, according to Pluribus News. Connecticut passed a law in 2021 to offer incentives for data centers, though the Middletown Press reported last year that only Cigna so far had taken advantage of the tax exemption.
Massachusetts is currently home to 44 data centers, according to The Boston Globe.
In Westfield, 10 to 14 buildings could be built on the roughly 120-acre property, which is expected to generate 400 full-time jobs with average salaries topping $100,000, Daley said. The project will also support 1,800 to 2,000 construction jobs over an eight- to 10-year period, he said.
Rep. Mike Finn, who sponsored the tax exemption in the economic development law, said the measure was designed to deliver a new opportunity for western Massachusetts. Invoking the loss of jobs from regional powerhouses like Smith & Wesson, Lego and MassMutual, Finn said his district is “economically challenged.”
Finn said he worked with Daley to “think outside the box” and seize on the potential of emerging technology and AI. Battery storage companies are likely to follow the launch of data centers, the West Springfield Democrat said.
“We’re doing our best to get this initial player to come to western Mass.,” Finn said. “That would be a really big boon for our area.”
The Executive Office of Economic Development held a public hearing Thursday on proposed regulations for data center owners and operators to apply for certification in order to secure the sales tax exemption.
Data centers must be at least 100,000 square feet; incur at least $50 million in costs for construction, refurbishment, renovation or improvement within a 10-year period from the certification taking effect; maintain a minimum of 100 jobs; and be “used to house computer information technology equipment, networking, data processing or data storage,” including servers and routers, according to the regulations. 
In certification applications, owners and operators may be asked to share estimates of peak electric demand, written confirmation from utilities that the existing grid infrastructure can accommodate the data center, and any commitments to use clean energy or offset greenhouse gas emissions. Certification would last 20 years.
The Westfield site involves a $2.5 billion to $4 billion investment, including $500 million to $750 million in computer costs, Daley said.
“With a sales tax of six and a quarter, that number gets pretty large every year, and these data centers refurbish this equipment every three to five years,” Daley said. “This certainly helps offset that additional cost.”
Building a data center is “cost-intensive,” as Finn put it. 
Only two advocates spoke at the hearing, warning the proposals lack sufficient environmental safeguards.
Dominique Agnew, an attorney at the Conservation Law Foundation, asked the state to consider additional provisions that “prioritize energy efficiency, public protection, decreased resource usage and workforce development.”
“This proposed regulation makes no mention of efficiency measures or climate-related disclosures like energy and water usage. Regulations should require robust disclosures and reporting of these and other environmental protection metrics,” Agnew said. “Regulations should also address how the executive office will monitor the data centers’ environmental impacts, such as its water usage, air quality and natural habitat impacts, and electric grid system impacts, as data centers are known for intense energy usage from grid electricity, as well as back-up gas or diesel generators.”
Tristan Thomas, director of policy for the nonprofit Alternatives for Community and Environment, said the proposed regulations should be rejected since they “lack basic safeguards for our environment, public health and our economy.”
“Absent new provisions around renewable energy requirements, demand response, environmental assessments and reporting, water use, air pollution and more, our economic strategies will directly contradict our climate goals and harm public health,” Thomas said.
Highlighting the health risks, Thomas pointed to a 2024 study from Caltech and UC Riverside that found air pollution from AI data centers could cause up to 1,300 premature deaths annually by 2030. Meanwhile, a Good Jobs First study released in April found that at least 10 states had lost more than $100 million annually in tax revenues from data centers.
Thomas urged a “transparent economic analysis” of the total cost of data centers.

You, as I, might wonder how it feels to win a world championship at age 17. That’s what Mississippian Rachel McAlpin did Wednesday winning the 50-meter breaststroke gold medal at the World Junior Swimming Championships in Otopeni, Romania, nearly 6,000 miles from hometown of Brandon.

Rick Cleveland
“It feels really cool, honestly,” young McAlpin replied in a phone call Thursday afternoon. “It truly is a blessing.”
And then McAlpin apologized for sounding hoarse, not because she is sick, but because, as she put it, “I’ve been cheering so hard all day and night for all my Team USA teammates.”
One of those teammates is Charlotte Crush of Louisville, Kentucky, the 17-year-old daughter of Mimi Bowen, formerly a highly competitive swimmer for the Jackson Sunkist swim program. Crush Thursday won the 100-meter backstroke gold medal. Said McAlpin, “We’ve become really good friends. Charlotte is an incredible swimmer and person.”
McAlpin is fairly incredible herself. You, as I, might want to know more about Mississippi’s new swimming world champion. Here’s a short dossier: Rachel McAlpin, who is home-schooled, has swam competitively since the age of 5 and regularly swims for the Flowood-based Mississippi Makos. She has committed to swim collegiately for the University of Arkansas, beginning in the fall of 2026. She is the middle of Chris and Christie McAlpin’s three daughters. Rachel is deeply religious, soft-spoken and exceedingly polite, which belies a fierce competitiveness. As a swimmer, she is known as a strong finisher.

Rachel McAlpin
McAlpin fell behind early in her championship race Wednesday but then rallied as she typically does and touched .34 seconds ahead of 18-year-old Smilte Plytnykaite of the Republic of Lithuainia. In winning, McAlpin equalled her personal best time of 30.78 seconds.
“I knew I was in pretty good shape in the last 10 meters when I couldn’t see anybody ahead of me,” McAlpin said. “I knew I just needed to hold on and I did.”
No telling how many hours McAlpin has spent training the past decade-plus to prepare for that 30.78 seconds of glory. Competitive swimming can be almost like a full-time job, requiring hours upon hours of rigorous pool time, plus weight room workouts.
“I guess it really is kind of like a job, and you really have to love it, which I do,” she said. “You also have to have great coaching and a strong support group at home, and I have definitely had that.”
McAlpin is probably finished swimming – but not cheering, she says – in the Romania meet, and will now point toward 2026 competition for both the Makos and Team USA. Yes, she says, her dream is to represent the U.S. in the 2028 Summer Olympics at Los Angeles. 
“The Olympics are a goal, but I have a whole lot of swimming and so much work to do before that,” she said.
If nothing else, her victory in Romania establishes her as as a solid threat, if not favorite, to make the U.S. Olympic team.
Meanwhile, her parents have watched, via streaming, at home in Brandon while their middle daugher swam the preliminary heat, the semifinals and, finally, the championship race half a globe away in a country that shares a 384-mile border with Ukraine. With the time difference, they stayed up until 2 a.m. Tuesday to watch the prelims. Said Chris McAlpin, her father, “We were like any parents would be, nervously pacing beforehand and then cheering like crazy during the races. Obviously, we are extremely proud and blessed. It took a minute to sink in but it has: Our daughter is a world champion.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/21141636/Rachel-McAlpin-1.jpg,,,2025-08-21 18:56:43.674188
,Mississippi Today,2025-08-21 22:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Percentage of Mississippi students scoring ‘advanced’ or ‘proficient’ falls for first time since pandemic,Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/21/mississippi-test-scores-drop-public-schools/,"Mississippi public schools, with the exception of the start of the pandemic, had seen steady increases in student proficiency.","The percentage of Mississippi students making high scores on state tests declined in all four content areas, the latest results reveal. 
It’s the first time those numbers have seen a meaningful drop in years, aside from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Paula Vanderford, chief accountability officer for the state education department, conceded the downturn was “unusual for Mississippi” at Thursday’s state board of education meeting.
“With the exception of COVID, we’ve seen steady increases in our overall proficiency,” she said. “So the results this year have given us the need to take a deeper dive into what the results really mean.”
All four end-of-course assessments — Algebra I, English II, U.S. history and biology — saw similar or slightly higher pass rates compared to last year. 
Results were less straightforward for the four subject areas overall. Passing scores went up slightly overall for English-Language Arts and U.S. history, and they fell slightly for mathematics and science. 
However, the percentage of students scoring proficient and advanced during the 2024-2025 school year across the four subject areas fell a couple of points across the board. 
The smallest decline was in English — students fell just a fraction, from 47.8% last year to 47.4% — while the largest drop was in science, going from 63.4% to 60.9%.
“The data is not a warning yet,” said board chair Matt Miller. “It’s a reminder. If it happens next year, we’re sliding into a warning situation.”

Vanderford also cautioned board members from becoming too concerned just yet.
She encouraged them to wait to see the results of the National Assessment of Education Progress tests, which reveals how Mississippi ranks against other states, and compare those results to these statewide assessments, the Mississippi Academic Assessment Program. 
Results from the third-grade literacy test were a little more promising. Those scores went up marginally, from a 75.7% pass rate to 77.3%. 
The Literacy-Based Promotion Act, passed by the state Legislature in 2013, made passing the test a requirement to graduate to the fourth grade. The act has led to higher standards in literacy education in Mississippi, which experts say has largely contributed to the state’s big reading gains, coined “The Mississippi Miracle” by national media. 
Still, Miller acknowledged that the state department of education could be in a precarious situation if it loses momentum.
“The Mississippi Miracle, that’s now in the past,” he said at the meeting. “It’s now the marathon. What can we do to move it to the next level? We can’t rest.”
Board members and top education officials stressed that the agency must turn its focus to pushing students to perform at a “proficient” level on the assessments, instead of just “passing.” 
The state’s new accountability model, which is still being finalized, puts a “greater emphasis on proficiency,” State Superintendent Lance Evans said in a statement. MAAP results are a big part of the state’s accountability grades, which will be released at next month’s board meeting. 
In order to improve scores moving forward, the agency is implementing a number of initiatives. These include increasing the number of literacy and math coaches at schools across the state, encouraging districts to use “high-quality instructional materials,” ensuring administrators know how important it is to implement curriculum based on science of reading research and training teachers in the science of reading. 
Additionally, the agency will be seeking funds from the Legislature this session for literacy and math initiatives, which Evans has already discussed with House Speaker Jason White. 
But none of these programs will make a difference if districts don’t accept the support offered by the state education department, Evans said at the meeting.
“There are some districts that refused literacy coaches last year and some of them fell tremendously,” he said. “I called them and asked, ‘Are you sure this is what you want to do?’ And they said, ‘Yes.’ You see what happened.”
Several public school districts were recognized for their high scores in three to four subject areas, including Long Beach, Ocean Springs, Clinton, Enterprise, Oxford, Pass Christian and Union County.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/28110337/3X0A9506.jpg,,,2025-08-21 18:56:43.674188

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn launched an ad campaign featuring testimony from an Iowan who said the “big, beautiful” budget reconciliation package helped her family through tax cuts — but Democrats have criticized the ad for featuring a person who does not live in Nunn’s district.
Meanwhile, advocacy organizations are running ads criticizing Nunn and other GOP lawmakers who voted for legislation that will cut social safety net programs.
Nunn’s first testimony ad, titled “Tax Relief for Iowa Families,” was unveiled Wednesday. It features Sarah Curry, an Iowan who said the expansion of the Child Tax Credit through the budget reconciliation law from $2,000 to $2,200, as well as the tax cuts during Trump’s first term in office, have helped her family.
“Our kids have needs that we have to meet, and every dollar we can save on our taxes means another dollar we can invest in our family to help our children,” she said in the ad.
Nunn said he met Curry when she testified before the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee in 2024, when the GOP-led panel held a hearing at the Iowa State Fair with Iowans who spoke largely in favor of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The ad was filmed at the 2025 Iowa State Fair, where Nunn said he reconnected with the Curry family.
“When the Curry family received their tax cut back in 2017, they invested it in their family and community,” Nunn said in a statement. “For them, it meant a new water heater on the family farm and vital speech therapy for their son, Isaac, who has autism. That’s what real investment looks like — supporting an Iowa family while strengthening Main Street businesses right here in our communities.”
But Democratic organizers say the ad does not disclose crucial information about Curry. Curry works as the research director for Iowans for Tax Relief, an organization that advocates for tax cuts. The organization has an affiliated Political Action Committee that contributed $14,000 to Nunn’s state legislative campaigns between 2014 and 2020, according to data from the Iowa Ethics and Campaign Disclosure Board.
Curry also lives in Glenwood — a city in Iowa’s 4th Congressional District, represented by U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra — and is not a direct constituent of Nunn.
“Zach Nunn couldn’t find anyone in Iowa’s 3rd district to defend the Big, Ugly Law, so he found a paid political operative from an organization that’s given Nunn’s campaigns thousands of dollars to lie about his bill,” Katie Smith, spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said in a news release. “Iowans see through Nunn’s lies and will hold him accountable for voting to raise Iowans’ costs so he can give tax breaks to billionaires.”
The ad featuring Curry is the first in a series that will run on digital and social media platforms featuring Iowans talking about benefits they will see through the budget reconciliation law. In addition to discussing the Child Tax Credit, future ads will feature Iowans discussing the removal federal tax on tips and overtime pay, small business tax relief and investments for farmers and rural communities, according to a news release.
The ad campaign comes as Democrats have organized around the GOP-led budget reconciliation law ahead of the 2026 election cycle, highlighting the cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. Three Democrats, former Iowa House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst, state Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-Des Moines, and Xavier Carrigan of Waukee have announced campaigns to run against Nunn in the upcoming midterm election.
Ads target Nunn, Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks
As Nunn launches a campaign touting the “big, beautiful” law, the nonprofit “Unrig Our Economy” highlighted their ad campaigns targeting Nunn and U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks for voting to support the law.
Nunn and Miller-Meeks both represent districts political forecasters say will likely be among the nation’s most competitive in 2026.
The organization released an ad in July criticizing Nunn for voting to cut programs such as Medicaid and SNAP to “give billionaires a giant new tax break.” In August, the group published an ad featuring a social worker who said the 1st District representative has “chosen to take care of the billionaires at the expense of the kids I work with.”
Unrig Our Economy Campaign Director Leor Tal said in a statement Thursday that although Nunn and Miller-Meeks have both stated they support preserving Medicaid, the budget reconciliation law will result in cuts. The work requirements and restrictions on state-levied taxes on health care providers are expected to result in cuts of more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, according to a report from the Congressional Budget Office.
“Iowa Republicans’ move to fast track these Medicaid cuts reveals the truth – their tax law was never about ‘preserving Medicaid’ but all about giving handouts to their billionaire buddies by leaving millions without the health care they rely on,” Tal said.
The organization is also targeting Miller-Meeks in a billboard campaign ad, calling for the Iowa Republican to vote in favor of releasing files related to the late financier and sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein. The billboard features a picture of Epstein and President Donald Trump.
The billboard campaigns call for Miller-Meeks, as well as Republican Reps. Rob Bresnahan and Tom Kean Jr. of New Jersey, to support legislation related to the public release of government files on Epstein.
“Congressman Bresnahan, Congresswoman Miller-Meeks, and Congressman Kean Jr. have already sold out working-class families by voting to leave millions of Americans without health care to help billionaires,” Tal said in a statement earlier in August. “Now they are refusing to go after billionaires and predators that endangered American children. It is another example of Republicans in Congress always putting the rich and well connected over the working-class people that power our country.”

(Arielle Zionts | KFF Health NewsEKALAKA — There was no doctor on-site when a patient arrived in early June at the emergency room in the small hospital at the intersection of two dirt roads in this town of 400 residents.
There never is.
Dahl Memorial’s three-bed emergency department — a two-hour drive from the closest hospital with more advanced services — instead depends on physician assistants and nurse practitioners.
Physician assistant Carla Dowdy realized the patient needed treatment beyond what the ER could provide, even if it had had a doctor. So, she made a call for a medical plane to fly the patient to treatment at Montana’s most advanced hospital. Dowdy also called out medications and doses needed to stabilize the patient as a paramedic and nurses administered the drugs, inserted IV lines, and measured vital signs.
Emergency medicine researchers and providers believe ERs, especially in rural areas, increasingly operate with few or no physicians amid a nationwide shortage of doctors.
A recent study found that in 2022, at least 7.4% of emergency departments across the U.S. did not have an attending physician on-site 24/7. Like Dahl Memorial, more than 90% were in low-volume or critical access hospitals — a federal designation for small, rural hospitals.
The results come from the 82% of hospitals that responded to a survey sent to all emergency departments in the country, except those operated by the federal government. The study is the first of its kind so there isn’t proof that such staffing arrangements are increasing, said Carlos Camargo, the lead author and a professor of emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School. But Camargo and other experts suspect ERs running without doctors present are becoming more common.

Placing ERs in the hands of nondoctors isn’t without controversy. Some doctors and their professional associations say physicians’ extensive training leads to better care, and that some hospitals are just trying to save money by not employing them.
The American Medical Association, open to all medical students and physicians, and the American College of Emergency Physicians both support state and federal laws or regulations that would require ERs to staff a doctor around the clock. Indiana, Virginia, and South Carolina recently passed such legislation.
Rural ERs may see fewer patients, but they still treat serious cases, said Alison Haddock, president of ACEP.
“It’s important that folks in those areas have equal access to high-quality emergency care to the greatest extent possible,” Haddock said.
Other health care providers and organizations say advanced-practice providers with the right experience and support are capable of overseeing ERs. And they say mandating that a physician be on-site could drive some rural hospitals to close because they can’t afford or recruit enough — or any — doctors.
“In an environment, especially a rural environment, if you have an experienced PA who knows what they know, and knows the boundaries of their knowledge and when to involve consultants, it works well,” said Paul Amiott, a board member of the Society of Emergency Medicine PAs.
“I’m not practicing independently” despite working 12-hour night shifts without physicians on-site at critical access hospitals in three states, he said.
Amiott said he calls specialists for consultation often and about once a month asks the physician covering the day shift at his hospital to come help him with more challenging cases such as emergency childbirth and complicated trauma. Amiott said this isn’t unique to PAs — ER doctors seek similar consultations and backup.
The proportion of ERs without an attending physician always on-site varies wildly by state. The 2022 survey found that 15 states — including substantially rural ones, such as New Mexico, Nevada, and West Virginia — had no such emergency departments.
But in the Dakotas, more than half of emergency departments were running without 24/7 attending physician staffing. In Montana it was 46%, the third-highest rate.
None of those three states have a program to train physicians as ER specialists. Neither does Wyoming or Idaho.
But Sanford Health, which bills itself as “the largest rural health system in the United States,” is launching an emergency medicine residency in the region. The Sioux Falls, South Dakota-based program is intended to boost the ranks of rural emergency doctors in those states, the residency director said in a news release.
Leon Adelman is an emergency medicine physician in Gillette, Wyoming, which, at around 33,800 residents, is the largest city in the state’s northeast. Working in such a rural area has given him nuanced views on whether states should require 24/7 on-site physician coverage in ERs.
Adelman said he supports such laws only where it’s feasible, like in Virginia. He said the state’s emergency physicians’ organization pushed for the law only after doing research that made it confident that the requirement wouldn’t shutter any rural hospitals.
Camargo said some doctors say that if lawmakers are going to require 24/7 on-site physician coverage in ERs, they need to pay to help hospitals implement it.
Adelman said when instituting staffing requirements isn’t possible, states should create other regulations. For example, he said, lawmakers should make sure hospitals not hiring physicians aren’t refraining just to save money.
He pointed to Vermont, where a report recommended that several of the state’s hospitals cut physicians from their ERs. The report was part of a mandated process to improve the state’s troubled health care system.
Adelman said states should also require PAs and NPs without on-site physician supervision to have extensive emergency experience and the ability to consult with remote physicians.
Some doctors have pointed to a case in which a 19-year-old woman died after being misdiagnosed by an NP who was certified in family medicine, not emergency care, and working alone at an Oklahoma ER. Few NPs have emergency certification, an analysis found.
 
The Society of Emergency Medicine PAs outlines training and experience PAs should have before practicing in rural areas or without on-site doctors.
Haddock said emergency physicians have seen cases of hospitals hiring inexperienced advanced-practice providers. She said ACEP is asking the federal government to require critical access and rural emergency hospitals to have physicians on-site or on call day and night.
Haddock said ACEP wouldn’t want such a requirement to close any hospital and noted that the organization has various efforts to keep rural hospitals staffed and funded.
Dahl Memorial Hospital has strict hiring requirements and robust oversight, said Dowdy, who previously worked for 14 years in high-volume, urban emergency rooms.
She said ER staffers can call physicians when they have questions and that a doctor who lives on the other side of Montana reviews all their patient treatment notes. The ER is working on getting virtual reality glasses that will let remote physicians help by seeing what the providers in Ekalaka see, Dowdy said.
She said patient numbers in the Ekalaka ER vary but average one or two a day, which isn’t enough for staff to maintain their knowledge and skills. To supplement those real-life cases, providers visit simulation labs, do monthly mock scenarios, and review advanced skills, such as using an ultrasound to help guide breathing tubes into patient airways.
Dowdy said Dahl Memorial hasn’t had a physician in at least 30 years, but CEO Darrell Messersmith said he would hire one if a doctor lived in the area. Messersmith said there’s a benefit to having advanced-practice providers with connections to the region and who stay at the hospital for several years. Other rural hospitals, he noted, may have physicians either as permanent staff who leave after a few years or contract workers who fly in for a few weeks at a time.
People eating at Ekalaka’s sole breakfast spot and attending appointments at the hospital’s clinic all told KFF Health News that they’ve been happy with the care they have received from Dowdy and her co-workers.
Ben Bruski had to visit the ER after a cow on his family ranch kicked a gate, smashing it against his hand. And he knows other people who’ve been treated for more serious problems.
“We’ve got to have this facility here because this facility saves a lot of lives,” Bruski said.

The volunteer-run mutual aid effort has recently begun serving hot food three nights a week in City Hall Park to meet growing needs.

BURLINGTON — Upbeat music, colorful lights and delicious smells drew a crowd to a table set up at the corner of City Hall Park downtown Tuesday night.
Amid volunteers dishing out heaped plates of pesto salad and biriyani from a fold-out table was a man expertly folding and filling dough triangles with mixed veggies, while another fried them in a pan of hot oil set up on the sidewalk.
“Free food, free people, free speech,” chanted a cheerful FaReid Munarsyah, a Burlington resident and co-organizer of The People’s Kitchen, a volunteer-led community effort to cook and serve free hot food.
Well-known for his community activism, particularly around food insecurity, Munarsyah and the People’s Kitchen banner are often present at local community events, such as the World Refugee Day celebration at Leddy Park in June.
When he heard about the recent struggles faced by Food Not Cops/Food Not Bombs — another mutual aid free food distribution group in the city — Munarsyah decided to join the effort to feed hungry downtown residents.

“Businesses and the City Council don’t like us being here so we are here harnessing people’s power,” he said as he folded paper-thin egg rolls.
For many years, Food Not Cops/Food Not Bombs has served free lunch out of the Marketplace Garage downtown. This summer, 150 area businesses signed a letter alleging the effort “has had a negative impact on the area.” They sent it to the mayor asking that the food distribution “be relocated to a more appropriate and secure setting.”
The mayor’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
That led to a counter letter signed by dozens of organizations and businesses expressing support for the meal program, followed by a protest outside City Hall before the May 20 City Council meeting. Sam Bliss, one of the organizers of the lunch program, also wrote an op-ed stating that Food Not Cops makes downtown safer.
Progressive Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak signed a resolution allocating $10,000 to support the program’s relocation “to a more accessible and better-resourced location.” Bliss recently told VTDigger the volunteers have not collected the funds. 
“There’s not agreement within the group that it’s a good idea to take the money,” he wrote in a message.
The attention the issue has received led to “The People’s Potluck Protest Picnic & Distro,” hosted Tuesday nights by the People’s Kitchen, according to flyers posted on social media. The group recently began serving hot food in a corner of the park off College Street three nights a week and plan to continue, especially through the winter, according to Munarsyah.
“The city needs to be taking care of its people, right? You want safety, then you start feeding people. People who are not hungry are less desperate,” he said.
It was a slow night this week, but the previous two Tuesday dinners served about 120 and 150 people, he estimated.
This week’s meal included a green salad, pesto chicken pasta salad, vegetable biriyani, seafood biriyani, and fresh peaches with whipped cream for dessert that was donated by a resident.
“It’s delicious,” said a woman who identified herself as Tanya and helped herself to two freshly fried, crunchy eggrolls. 
She said she used to work at a soup kitchen her parents started in Brattleboro about 45 years ago.
“I worked there my entire life all the way ’til they died. Now I’m in need of food,” she said. “I never thought that the tables would turn but here I am on the other side of the table.”
Munarsyah, originally from the Phillipines, is known for cooking food and hosting dinners at his home where all are welcome to cook and eat. So not all who stopped by to volunteer or eat were unhoused. 
Rep. Brian Cina, P/D-Burlington, was among the volunteers there. They said they first started helping during the Occupy Vermont movement in 2011, and continued serving food to the encampment at Sears Lane in 2021 and during the wave of evictions as the state’s motel program was scaled back.
“We saw horrible things,” Cina said, their voice cracking as they described people dying and freezing in the cold and having to call the hospital or arrange for blankets and emergency help.
People’s Kitchen intends to continue serving hot dinner in the park three nights a week and provide essential supplies to those in need in partnership with other efforts, such as the Street Community Action Team of Burlington. It does so with the help of donors like farms and businesses, as well as public donations.
The recent attention Food Not Cops/Food Not Bombs garnered has Munarsyah worried about whether the city will target the volunteer-run effort for removal or impose permit and licensing requirements.
“I think they’re going after the wrong people,” he said. “Politicians, who were responsible for the housing crisis to begin with, are in no position to criticize people who are actually doing something about the housing crisis. And we’re doing something. We’re helping people who are unhoused and anybody who wants a meal, and it’s free.”
As volunteers packed up leftovers and cleaned the area, a plastic LED sign on the table continued to flash colorful messages: “Free food. Good Food. Good mood. 100% halal.”

(Photo via Getty Images)The signs of a driver not fully focused on the road can be small — how and where eyes move, pupil dilation and reaction time, how tense or relaxed their face is — and these indicators can point to a number of causes.
As technology improves and more monitors for driving are being introduced, University of Iowa researchers are working to determine differences in types of driving distractions to better address them.
Researchers at the UI Driving Safety Research Institute are testing drivers’ abilities under a range of impairments to see if unique tells can be spotted by technology, with the overall goal of turning people’s attention back to the road.
Timothy Brown, director of drugged driving research at the UI, said technology for identifying whether someone is driving while unable to do so safely is evolving and becoming more common, especially in industries where fleets of vehicles are employed and supervised.
“There are a lot of forms of impairment out there, and I think there’s a renewed focus on trying to keep people safe on the roads and reducing impairment-related crashes,” Brown said.

Types of impairment Brown mentioned included that from alcohol, drugs, drowsiness and general distractedness. The UI researcher and professor said he’s studied “driver monitoring” and identification of different kinds of impairment on and off since the 1990s, diving into whether vehicle signals could indicate an impaired driver and more.
Technology has improved over time, he said, going from eye movement detectors that cost as much as $60,000 to single-camera systems that can track everything from eye movement to facial changes to how relaxed or tight someone’s skin is.
However, many signs of general impairment can point to multiple causes, and Brown said he hopes the research he is conducting will provide information on whether there are specific indications that can be isolated and categorized with their problem.
“Right now we’re looking at the ability to actually detect and differentiate from other forms of impairment,” Brown said.
How to handle these impairments will be up to car manufacturers if they want to implement monitoring technology, Brown said. Industries most interested in this technology include construction and other areas where employees operate vehicles and heavy machinery.
UI researchers will study people’s driving under different forms of impairment over three sessions, Brown said — two tests where people will drive after consuming enough alcohol to be over the legal limit and one where they will drive sober and alert, then again sober and drowsy. Distraction testing will also be incorporated into the tests.
Participants have already started coming in, Brown said, and he hopes the team will wrap up data collection in November and analysis by early next summer.
Brown said moves have been made at the federal and state level to address different kinds of impaired driving. State lawmakers passed legislation in the spring to ban use of phones and other handheld electronic devices while driving if not in voice-activated or hands-free mode, with police currently handing out warnings to violators. The law is set to take effect fully, making this violation a simple misdemeanor, at the start of the new year.
When testing technology to spot impairments, Brown said it’s necessary to consider the possibility of people using it for the wrong reasons. The goal of such technology is to stop people from driving drowsy, distracted or drunk, not for them to rely on it “as a crutch.”
“This is really meant to aid people when they’re not able to make those judgments appropriately, rather than for them to use them to say, ‘Oh, the car says I’m safe to drive,’” Brown said. “That’s not the intent of the systems, it’s not the way they’ll be implemented, but it is an important consideration from a research perspective as we go through it, to make sure that the technologies don’t open themselves up to misuse.”

(Photo by Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s “busy schedule” Monday means she won’t join Republican lawmakers on a tour of New Mexico’s biggest immigration detention center, a spokesperson for the governor told Source New Mexico on Thursday.
New Mexico Republicans shared a letter on social media Wednesday announcing some members would be touring the Otero County Processing Center on Monday, and they invited the governor to come along. The detention center in Chaparral currently houses most of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees in the state, and its population has increased since President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown began this year. 
The governor’s chief lawyer told an interim legislative committee in July that the governor was considering adding a measure to the agenda at an upcoming special session that would ban immigration detention facilities in New Mexico. 
Medicaid, ICE detention on agenda for forthcoming special legislative session

“Before we take any action with such far-reaching implications (for example, putting New Mexicans out of work and risking millions of federal funding), it is essential that we have a clear first-hand understanding of the conditions within these facilities and the operations that take place there,” Republican lawmakers Rep. Andrea Reeb and Sen. Crystal Brantley wrote in the letter.
The letter went on to invite the governor to tag along for the visit at 8 a.m. Monday. 
“We believe your participation would be instrumental in ensuring that any decisions made are fully informed and in the best interests of the people of New Mexico,” the Republicans wrote.
In an email Thursday afternoon, Michael Coleman, the spokesperson for the governor, told Source that the governor won’t join the tour and also hasn’t decided yet whether she’ll add an ICE detention facility agenda to the special session call. 
“The governor has a busy schedule on Monday and won’t be joining in the tour,” Coleman said. “We’re still working to determine a special session agenda, and no final decision has been made on this particular issue.”
He also said the governor hasn’t yet decided on a date for the special session, which her lawyer said she anticipated would happen later this month or in September to address federal funding cuts Congress recently enacted in the “Big Beautiful Bill” act. Other crime-related measures could also be on the governor’s call. 
Senate GOP spokesperson Brandon Harris told Source New Mexico earlier Thursday that delays around background checks likely mean reporters won’t be able to join the lawmakers during their tour, but they intend to hold a news conference or otherwise provide an update to the public about the tour. 
That could be on social media or at a previously scheduled meeting of the interim Courts, Corrections and Justice Committee also occurring Monday in Las Cruces. But the governor, who hadn’t responded to the GOP’s invite as of 1:30 p.m. Monday, would be able to join if she wanted, he said.
“If anyone could probably get expedited [approval],” it’s the governor, Harris said. “If she wanted to, she probably could.”
The GOP’s letter said the CCJ committee canceled a long-promised tour of the facility, citing concerns about background checks. 
As of Aug. 4, the average daily inmate population at Otero County Detention Center is 863, an increase of about 60 inmates, on average, since December last year, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. The other two New Mexico facilities in Torrance and Cibola counties have average daily populations of 444 and 223 ICE detainees, respectively, according to TRAC.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Gov.-Michelle-Lujan-Grisham-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-21 17:57:51.241994

Kelly Ayotte at a ceremony celebrating the signature of housing-related bills in Manchester, Aug. 21, 2025. (Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s approval rating has dipped in recent months, according to a new survey from the University of New Hampshire, with almost equal percentages of Granite Staters approving and disapproving of her performance. 
That same survey found that majorities of respondents disapproved of some actions by the Republican-led Legislature this term — such as cuts to the University System of New Hampshire and the Department of Health and Human Services — though the moves are popular among Republicans.
According to the survey, conducted between Aug. 14 and Aug. 18, 47% of respondents approved of Ayotte’s performance in office and 46% disapproved. 
The results suggest that Granite Staters’ longstanding tradition of giving bipartisan support to its governors may be fading, with Ayotte’s approval ratings hewing much closer to party breakdowns. 
Of those who approve, 15% said it was because of Ayotte’s handling of education — the highest percentage for any category, followed by 14% who said it was because her handling of immigration, 12% who pointed to her handling of LGBTQ+ issues, and 11% who said it was because of her handling of the state budget and state finances.
Of those that disapproved, a plurality, 29%, did so because of her handling of education, 16% cited her handling of LBGTQ+ issues, and 11% said it was because of her support for President Donald Trump.
The survey did not ask respondents about specific actions taken by Ayotte in any of those areas. But Ayotte has signed bills removing “sanctuary cities” and requiring law enforcement cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, establishing a “parental bill of rights” in public schools, banning gender-affirming medication and surgeries for minors, and making education freedom accounts available to students of all income levels. 
The results show a drop in the governor’s overall approval rating, which was 53% in June, and an increase in her disapproval rating, up from 34% in February. Those changes have happened as more Granite Staters appear to have made up their minds about the governor: The percentage of respondents who did not know whether they support or oppose Ayotte has dropped from 15% to 7%.
Ayotte’s razor-thin approval ratings are a contrast to the last Republican governor, Chris Sununu, who maintained approval ratings between 50% and70% throughout his four terms. Former Gov. Maggie Hassan had an approval rating of 55 percent in February 2015, her last term in office. 
The UNH survey also found that several of Republican lawmakers’ accomplishments this year do not have a majority of support in the state. 
The Legislature’s move to cut $51 million from the Department of Health and Human Services in the budget — one opposed by Ayotte — was supported by 26% of respondents, with 62% of respondents opposed. 
The two-year, $29 million funding cut to the University System of New Hampshire in New Hampshire, is also not popular, with 53% of respondents opposing it, 34% supporting it, and 12% neutral.
Respondents narrowly opposed a bill that allows landlords to end leases at the end of the lease period and initiate eviction proceedings against those who don’t leave, without needing to point to a specific reason. In the survey, 42% of respondents supported that law and 48% opposed it.
And the elimination of state motor vehicle inspections in the bill is nearly evenly split among respondents: 44% support it while 45% oppose it.
In each of those issues, Democratic respondents were strongly opposed while Republican respondents were in support. 
Some of the legislation that passed this year was more popular. Overall, 49% approved a new law allowing cities and towns to create “social districts” where adults 21 and older can purchase alcohol from licensed establishments and consume in public, with 30% opposed and 19% neutral.
And one of Ayotte’s biggest priorities, requiring public schools to create a “bell-to-bell” ban on cell phones in schools, has high support, with 71% supportive, 18% opposed, and 11% neutral.
Even on that issue, there were differences between parties. Among Democrats, 56% approved of that law, while 89% of Republicans did.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_5557-1024x651.jpg,,,2025-08-21 17:57:51.241994

The parcels are small tracts of land scattered throughout Antelope Island and Wasatch Mountain state parks. Amounting to roughly 618 acres total, about 329 acres in Antelope Island and 289 acres in Wasatch Mountain, currently owned by the Bureau of Land Management, will be transferred to the Utah Division of State Parks.
The transfer is made possible by the Utah State Parks Adjustment Act, a 2024 law sponsored by Utah GOP Rep. Celeste Maloy, which targeted several isolated tracks of federal land to be handed over to the state and absorbed by existing state parks.
“Having federal lands interspersed throughout these parks has made effective management more challenging,” Maloy said after the bill passed the House last December.

Bureau of Land Management and state officials said the transfer will improve the visitor experience at Utah state parks.
“This land transfer reflects our commitment to efficient land management,” said Michael Gates, the BLM’s West Desert District Manager, on Tuesday. “By consolidating land ownership, we’re creating a better experience for the public.”
“Federal and state collaboration ensures our public lands are protected and the public is served,” added Utah State Parks Director Scott Strong in a statement. “Public lands are for everyone, and we invite everyone to make lifelong memories experiencing Utah’s incredible state parks. We will continue to ensure these lands are maintained for the enjoyment and preservation of this and future generations.”

UU. desde el segundo mandato del presidente Donald Trump,Wendy Fry,,,,,https://calmatters.org/calmatters-en-espanol/2025/08/como-cambiaron-los-niveles-de-inmigracion-trump/,"Actualmente, la población inmigrante está disminuyendo en todo Estados Unidos, lo que marca el primer descenso de la población inmigrante desde la década de 1960.","This article is also available in English. Read it here.
Por primera vez en más de 50 años, la población inmigrante de Estados Unidos está disminuyendo, mientras que residentes nacidos en el extranjero deciden abandonar el país o son deportados, según los últimos datos del Pew Research Center.
 En enero de 2025, la población inmigrante en Estados Unidos alcanzó un máximo de 53,3 millones. Esta cifra se redujo un 2,6%, hasta los 51,9 millones, en junio de 2025, lo que marca el primer descenso de la población inmigrante estadounidense desde la década de 1960.
Dicho de otro manera: ahora hay 1,4 millones de inmigrantes menos viviendo en el país apenas unos meses después de que el presidente Donald Trump asumiera nuevamente el cargo, según el nuevo informe de Pew.
Mark Hugo López , director de investigación de raza y etnicidad del Pew Research Center, dijo que varios factores pueden estar contribuyendo a la disminución de la población, incluidos los cambios de políticas que comenzaron con la administración Biden, que implementó nuevas restricciones al asilo a mediados de 2024.
“Hay varias razones posibles, desde el flujo y reflujo natural de inmigrantes, pero también las políticas, que han dificultado el cruce de la frontera, y el aumento de la aplicación de la ley en Estados Unidos, todo lo cual podría estar afectando la población inmigrante y su crecimiento o disminución”, dijo López.
Una número sin precedentes de inmigrantes —más de 11 millones— llegó a Estados Unidos entre 2020 y 2025, según los investigadores de Pew. Esto incluyó más de 3 millones solo en 2023, la mayor cifra anual jamás registrada, según el análisis de Pew de fuentes de datos gubernamentales.
 La población inmigrante no autorizada, o aquellos que carecen de permiso legal completo para estar en Estados Unidos, alcanzó un récord de 14 millones en 2023, según muestran los datos.
 La organización recopiló y analizó datos de las Encuestas de Población Actual mensuales de la Oficina del Censo. La reciente tendencia a la baja en la población inmigrante total estimada en Estados Unidos podría deberse, en parte, a que menos inmigrantes participan en la encuesta, señalaron los investigadores.
California tiene la mayor proporción de inmigrantes del país. En 2023, California albergaba a 11,3 millones de inmigrantes, lo que representa el 28,4 % del total nacional. Texas tenía la segunda mayor población inmigrante, con más de 6 millones de residentes nacidos en el extranjero, seguido por Florida y Nueva York.
California también tiene la mayor cantidad de inmigrantes no autorizados, con 2.3 millones. El estado es el centro de la represión de Trump, donde su administración lidera redadas de alto perfil en Los Ángeles y emite órdenes que afectan las protecciones y beneficios estatales para los inmigrantes.
A principios de esta semana, su administración criticó una ley estatal que permite a los inmigrantes indocumentados obtener licencias de conducir, acusando a políticos californianos de ser responsables de un accidente mortal en Florida, presuntamente causado por un conductor de camión  sin estatus legal. El conductor tenía un permiso de trabajo federal.
 En los primeros 100 días del segundo gobierno de Trump, el presidente adoptó más de 100 medidas ejecutivas sobre inmigración, con el objetivo de bloquear la llegada de nuevos migrantes y refugiados a la frontera, despojar a quienes ingresaron legalmente de sus protecciones temporales y deportar a inmigrantes no autorizados.
 Trump ha realizado algunos de los cambios más significativos en la política de inmigración de Estados Unidos en la historia del país, prometiendo una campaña de deportación masiva con un objetivo informado de 1 millón de deportaciones en el primer año.
 El estudio de Pew no reveló las cifras más recientes de deportaciones, y su informe señala que algunos inmigrantes podrían haber abandonado el país voluntariamente como resultado de la represión de la administración Trump. Su administración ha enviado a personas a una prisión de máxima seguridad en El Salvador, donde los reclusos afirman haber sido torturados. Las autoridades han deportado a personas a otros países donde nunca han vivido, como Panamá y Sudán del Sur, un país considerado peligroso por el Departamento de Estado de EE. UU. Agentes federales de inmigración en Los Ángeles y otras partes de California han detenido agresivamente a inmigrantes y ciudadanos estadounidenses , arrojándolas al suelo y rompiendo ventanas de automóviles.
 Pew descubrió que los cambios en las políticas y la aplicación de la ley contribuyeron a la disminución de la población inmigrante entre enero y junio. Los cruces fronterizos no autorizados se redujeron a niveles no vistos desde la década de 1960. Las detenciones de migrantes en la frontera entre Estados Unidos y México se redujeron a poco menos de 8.000 en julio, en comparación con las aproximadamente 96.000 de diciembre, el último mes completo de la presidencia de Biden, según estadísticas del gobierno estadounidense.
 Esta vez, Trump ha centrado sus esfuerzos de control más en el interior del país, apoyándose en la tecnología militar y de vigilancia para reforzar la frontera y alejando de ella a los agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza.

 Dentro de Estados Unidos, una gran parte de los inmigrantes, alrededor del 75%, están aquí legalmente, dice el informe de Pew.
En 2023, el 46% de los inmigrantes eran ciudadanos estadounidenses naturalizados. Casi una cuarta parte eran residentes permanentes legales, o en posesión de la tarjeta verde, y otro 4% eran residentes temporales legales a quienes se les permitía permanecer en Estados Unidos por un período limitado, generalmente para trabajar o estudiar.
 Los inmigrantes restantes en Estados Unidos cayeron en la categoría de “no autorizados” y constituyeron el 27% de todos los inmigrantes en ese país.
 Alrededor del 40% de los inmigrantes no autorizados —alrededor de 6 millones de personas— tienen algún tipo de protección temporal contra la deportación, y algunos también tienen un permiso para trabajar legalmente en Estados Unidos.
 La administración Trump ha rescindido esas protecciones contra la deportación y los permisos de trabajo para unos 500.000 inmigrantes de Cuba, Haití, Nicaragua y Venezuela que ingresaron legalmente a Estados Unidos.
 Los países de origen de los inmigrantes también han cambiado en los últimos años. Una proporción creciente proviene de Sudamérica y Europa, y una proporción cada vez menor de Asia y África subsahariana. Aun así, casi una cuarta parte (el 24 %) de los recién llegados entre 2021 y 2023 provino del sur y este de Asia.
 Los principales países de inmigrantes que llegaron entre 2021 y 2023 fueron: México (11%), India (8%), Venezuela (7%), Cuba (6%) y Colombia (5%).",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/081525_Immigration-Detain_AP_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-21 17:57:51.241994

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Gun owners who want a license to carry a concealed firearm in Pennsylvania would be able to apply at the nearest county sheriff’s office, regardless of whether they live in that county, under legislation proposed in the state House.
To legally carry a concealed gun outside of a home or fixed place of business, owners must have a valid license issued by the sheriff of the county where they live. 
Rep. Zachary Mako (R-Northampton) said Monday he plans to introduce legislation that would make obtaining a concealed carry permit easier for people who live in rural areas where the distance to a neighboring county seat may be less than their own. He said he is proposing the change in response to concerns from a constituent in his Lehigh Valley district.
“The constituent resides three miles away from the Carbon County line in Northampton County. However, to apply for a conceal carry permit, he would need to travel to his county’s sheriff office in Easton, which would be twice the distance,” Mako said in a memo seeking cosponsors for the proposed bill.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Nearly 1.7 million people in the commonwealth hold licenses to concealed carry, according to the Pennsylvania State Police. The number of applications has trended higher over the last decade, according to data reported to the state police by county sheriffs.
The number of concealed carry permits has increased from 237,344 in 2015 to a peak of 384,522 in 2021, according to the state police.
People older than 21 may apply for a license to carry a concealed firearm on their body or in a vehicle. The process requires applicants to pay a fee and pass a criminal background check. Issuing agencies may take up to 45 days to complete the process.
“This is a frustrating procedure that many Pennsylvanians face on a daily basis, and it is an unnecessary burden. With my proposed legislation, it would eliminate the inconvenience so that Pennsylvanians, much like my constituent, can apply at a sheriff’s office much closer to their primary residence,” Mako said.
The permits are good for five years. Carrying a concealed firearm without a valid permit is a first-degree misdemeanor if the offender is otherwise eligible for a license. Such an offense carries a fine up to $10,000 and a maximum of five years in prison.
Carrying a concealed gun without a license during the commission of another crime becomes a third-degree felony punishable by up to seven years in prison. It’s also a felony if the offender is ineligible for a permit. 
Lawmakers have proposed other reforms to Pennsylvania’s concealed firearms rules recently. Rep. Aaron Bernstine (R-Lawrence) earlier this year proposed legislation that would eliminate the requirement to obtain a license to carry a concealed firearm throughout the commonwealth.

“This principle acknowledges that Pennsylvanians have a fundamental constitutional right to keep and bear arms … and that no License to Carry a Firearm (LTCF) is currently required for law-abiding citizens to openly carry a firearm throughout Pennsylvania,” Bernstine said in a cosponsor memo.
Bernstine’s bill would allow people  the ability to optionally obtain a license to carry, so they could also carry a concealed firearm in other states where Pennsylvania permits are recognized. The commonwealth has concealed carry reciprocity agreements with 30 states, including Ohio and West Virginia. The latest was signed in June with Virginia.

Camryn Woods is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
MONKTON — Every day as cars, buses and other motor vehicles drive over Monkton Road, a high-traffic street that connects the towns of Monkton and Vergennes, a culvert-like tunnel underneath the road prevents 80% of small-bodied organisms from being run over.
The tunnel — Monkton’s first and only wildlife crossing — is intended to help amphibians like spotted salamanders, wood frogs and spring peepers reach their breeding grounds. Many amphibians reside in wooded, upland habitats for the majority of their lives but migrate to wetlands during their breeding seasons to lay eggs.
Unfortunately, many roads in Vermont bisect the two ecosystems, forcing amphibians to embark on a journey across busy streets in order to reproduce.
Wildlife crossings like the one in Monkton are often expensive and require evidence of significant animal mortality to be considered by state and federal grants. So in the early 2000s, Monkton community members conducted on-the-ground research to justify the project. 
Volunteers from the town of Monkton, the Vermont Agency of Transportation (VTrans) and the Lewis Creek Association, a non-profit that works with Vermonters to preserve natural landscapes, visited the street at night (when amphibians are most active) to note species and the number of mortalities. In just two nights, they found over a thousand dead amphibians.
“The Monkton area is very biodiverse,” said Kate Kelly, program manager at the Lewis Creek Association. “It has to do with being in the Champlain Valley, but also being on the edge of multiple habitat types and zones.” 
Kelly added that two unusual species were found in the areas surrounding the designated crossing: the blue spotted salamander and the four-toed salamander. “Having those unusual species there was helpful for getting funding,” Kelly said.
The crossing, which ended up costing $342,397, was completed in 2018. It was mainly funded by a U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration grant, state wildlife grant and Lewis Creek Association fundraising, according to Kelly.
The Monkton wildlife crossing also served as the site of a unique 12-year-long research study published in May.
The research was conducted by University of Vermont scientists and assessed amphibian mortality before and after the tunnel’s construction — one of the firsts of its kind. The results were surprising, said Matthew Marcelino, ecologist and lead author for the study. 
“We figured they’d be effective, but we didn’t realize how effective they would be,” Marcelino said. Along with the 80% overall reduced mortality statistic, they found that mortality of non-climbing amphibians decreased by 94% as a result of the crossing. 
Marcelino hopes that the results of the study will encourage people to invest more in wildlife crossings. “It’s important to have evidence to get things funded so that stakeholders feel comfortable with the government disbursing funds to these types of projects,” Marcelino said. “And this really did that.”
Not to mention, amphibians play an important role in local food webs, act as good indicators of environmental health and support human health. 
“They serve both as predators and prey. So they provide a lot of food for mammals, birds, reptiles, et cetera, but they’re also preying on things like mosquitoes and other pests — insects that we humans don’t like,” Marcelino said.
The University of Vermont study came out at the same time as a large wildlife crossing project on Route 2 and Interstate-89 in Western Waterbury was pulled back. The project, which had won $1.6 million in funding from the Federal Highway Administration in 2023, would have cost around $50 million in total, according to Joe Flynn, secretary of VTrans.
The 2023 grant provided momentum for the project, but the state would have needed to apply for a much bigger one to cover the cost. Unfortunately, only $75 million was available for the country, and Vermont didn’t receive part of the funding.
Though the project was retracted due to the lack of funding, Flynn said that the decision to cease looking for grant money was “not intended to diminish the importance of wildlife crossings” and that Vermonters understood the need for them.
Marcelino said that wildlife crossings can save residents money in the long term. “If people are hitting deer or moose or bear, or a turkey, that is a lot of money being spent to either fix the vehicle or have first responders respond,” Marcelino said.
“There is a nexus of wildlife crossings to highway safety, and if that nexus is the nexus that is promoted … then I think there is the possibility that these crossings will be continued in the future,” Flynn said.

The union representing more than 1,400 University of Minnesota service workers is urging its members to vote “no” on the university’s “last, best and final” offer, raising the likelihood of a strike as students begin the fall semester.
The Teamsters Local 320 filed their intent to strike earlier this month with the support of 97% of their members, including cooks, groundskeepers, custodians and other service workers. That triggered a 10-day cooling off period with state-mandated mediation, which failed to yield a deal.
The university presented its final offer at 1 a.m. Tuesday, which the union is required to take to its members for a vote.
Workers will vote on the proposal by mail and in person over the next week, with votes to be counted the day the university’s offer expires on Sept. 5. In the event that members follow their union leaders’ cue and reject the offer, workers could head to the picket lines or decide to go back to the negotiating table.
The university’s offer includes $1,000 bonuses over the next two years, 5% wage increases, and additional market adjustments ranging from 0.5% to 2% depending on the job and seniority. The proposal also includes pay increases for shifts that begin early in the morning or end late at night.
The average unionized service worker makes $26.11 per hour, according to the union.
The offer is silent on health care premiums, which are slated to rise around 10% across the university in the coming year. The union wants to limit those increases, which would eat into the wage gains.
“Health care is a big deal for our membership and it’s why a lot of our members work at the university,” said Jackson Kerr, business agent and lead negotiator for Teamsters Local 320. “When the university raises health care costs, Teamsters feel it the most because we represent the lowest paid workers.”
University of Minnesota spokesman Joe Linstroth noted the university pays 78% of medical coverage costs for employees and that other public employers may increase costs by as much as 22% next year. The university’s proposed premium increases would cost a single employee about $7-$10 more per month and an employee with dependents about $30-$40 more per month.
Federal budget cuts and rising costs have strained university budgets across the country, leading the University of Minnesota’s Board of Regents to approve the largest tuition hike in over a decade while cutting spending by 7% on academics, student services and research.
“The union and broader university community are aware of the financial challenges that higher education faces in the near and long term. The university is not immune to those challenges,” a spokesperson for the university said in a statement following the strike authorization vote.
The university had sought to bypass seniority and pay new hires higher wages than current staff in the same position; that was a nonstarter for the union, and the university dropped it. The university previously turned to gig workers to fill open dining services positions, paying people with no experience 35% more per hour than full-time staff with years of service.
Service workers at the university also authorized a strike three years ago, but called it off after reaching an agreement that raised the minimum hourly wage from $15 to $20.
In announcing their intention to strike, the union boasted of its large strike fund that would allow its members — many living paycheck-to-paycheck — to forgo wages and walk the picket line in the event of a protracted strike. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters approved enhanced strike benefits for University of Minnesota members of $1,000 per week, which exceeds the weekly pay of many members, the union said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/278896987_10158889850691270_7004318446383745963_n-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-08-21 17:57:51.241994

(Screenshot of video provided by SC Chamber of Commerce)Half of working South Carolina parents missed work at least once in three months for lack of child care.
One in 10 reported quitting their job or getting fired, according to a survey by the state Chamber of Commerce.
In March, the state chamber partnered with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation and the state Department of Social Services to poll 500 parents of children under the age of 6 across the Palmetto State. South Carolina is the 16th state in the nation to participate in one of these surveys.
SC spending $2.5M to help families pay for child care but thousands fewer will benefit

The chamber conducted the study to highlight how much the price and availability of child care costs the state’s economy, as the business organization lobbies state legislators to come up with possible solutions. The fiscal impact, the chamber claims, is nearly $1 billion annually. More than half of that is driven by lost productivity from employee absences.
“I had to quit my high-paying, full-time job due to continuous issues with my children’s child care,” a mother of a 1-year-old and 4-year-old wrote in her survey response.
“I left my job because I cannot afford child care,” wrote a mother of a newborn and 5-year-old. “It’s more affordable for me to stay home with no income than to work and pay for child care.”
‘Finding child care was brutal’
The survey, along with legislative efforts using tax credits to address child care in the state, come as South Carolina companies seek to fill the more than 72,000 open jobs in the state as of last month, according to data from the state’s workforce agency.

“Finding child care was brutal,” Leah McCraney, a paralegal and mother of two living in Columbia, told business leaders present at the survey rollout.
“I spent literal years — years plural — on wait lists,” she told the roughly 50 attendees. “I was forced to work part time as a result of that wait period.”
McCraney, who has a 3-year-old daughter, Sophia, and a 7-year-old son, Whit, said the family has spent as much as $21,000 in one year for child care.
“At one point, my wage was so low we couldn’t make it work,” McCraney said. “It was cheaper for me to stay home.”
And even when she was at work, she worried.
McCraney talked about having the livestream of her child care center’s infant room up on one screen while struggling to focus on a second screen for work.
Incentivizing child care
One way the chamber hopes to address the issue of child care is through an upgrade of a nearly 30-year-old tax break in the state.
The little-used incentive enacted during former Gov. David Beasley’s administration credits employers on their corporate income tax for operating on-site child care for workers or providing direct payments for private options.
In 2024, 18 employers claimed a total of nearly $51,000 in credits, according to the state Department of Revenue.
More SC companies offering child care benefits to attract workers

State chamber leadership has said the problem is twofold. Some companies don’t know the credit exists, and the offer needs updating.
The credits are capped at $100,000 in startup expenses or $3,000 per employee for continued operations or direct payments. And the credits can’t exceed 50% of a company’s income tax bill.
A bill pending in the state Senate would up those caps to $1 million and $12,000 per child of each employee.
Most South Carolina companies already pay little in corporate income tax, especially those that received tax breaks to move or expand. So to make the tax break more attractive to companies, the bill would allow businesses to use it as a write off against state licensing fees and companies’ share of state income tax withholdings.
‘We’ve all gotten that call’
Jack McBride, CEO of commercial grade cleaning supply manufacturer Contec Inc. in Spartanburg, told his company’s story via video. For the past five years, he said, Contec has struggled to fill more than 40 job openings.
To try to draw in working parents, McBride said he’s considering offering employees a child care stipend as an employment benefit.

And Nicole Scott, a mother of three who works as a market executive at Bank of America, talked about the benefits the bank offers, including child care reimbursement and 16 weeks of paid maternity and paternity leave.
The bank also has a program that helps parents find and pay for backup child care when their usual provider falls through.
“We’ve all gotten that phone call that the nanny can’t come that day or the child care provider is closing their doors and you don’t have anywhere to take your child,” she said.
Finally, the pending legislation seeks to boost the number of people working in child care in the state by offering them a tax credit on their personal incomes — ranging from $1,500 annually for entry level positions to $3,000 annually for the most experienced workers.
“The child care issue is a critical one both for quality of life and from the economic development perspective,” said Sen. Tom Davis, the bill’s lead sponsor.
The bill has yet to have a hearing, the Beaufort Republican said, but he does not expect any pushback on the issue to keep it from advancing in the next legislative session.
“The private sector is recognizing these are critical pieces to getting a workforce,” he said. “It’s just a question of what, economically, will move the needle. This is just one aspect of it”
Altogether, state revenue officials estimate the legislation could reduce state tax revenues by $26.7 million in its first year — more than 75% of that coming from the credits for child care workers.
Other data
When it comes to South Carolina working parents, a quarter of survey respondents said they cut back on their working hours to care for their children. Other common strategies included parents taking their work home with them. Some took their children to work with them or worked from home so they could care for them.
Another parent, Rob Byers III, shared his story in a video recording played for attendees. He talked about how he and his wife went without child care for two years. They coped by each working four hours a day, splitting time at a Columbia research firm.
Child care options expanded for SC military families needing off-base care

“It’s sad how much mothers, and especially single mothers, have to give up and sacrifice in their careers because they have children,” a mother of a 2-year-old wrote. “I’ve had to delay taking a job to figure out child care or turn down opportunities because of my child.”
The majority of survey respondents said someone in their household stayed home with the children.
High income households, where the family earned $100,000 or more per year, were more likely than mid- and lower-income families to send their children to pre-kindergarten and child care centers.
Those making less than $100,000 who did not have a stay-at-home parent were more likely to leave children with a friend or other family member.

The department overseeing sheriff transport deputies said the decision is due to limited resources. The state’s top defense attorney called the change “a big problem.”

Sheriff’s deputies will no longer transport people who are released from the Springfield prison, according to the Vermont Department of State’s Attorneys and Sheriffs. 
“It’s a problem. It’s a big problem,” Matt Valerio, Vermont’s defender general, said of the decision. 
Southern State Correctional Facility in Springfield is a hub for pre-trial detainees, hosting remote arraignments for people charged with crimes in Windsor and Windham counties. 
Now, if a person is released after their arraignment while awaiting trial, they will be let out of the relatively rural prison to fend for themselves, according to Valerio.
“They’re released at the bottom of the hill and told ‘good luck,’” Valerio said. “When you’re left at the bottom of a hill in zero degrees, you’re going to do what you need to do to survive.”
Due to a lack of capacity, sheriff’s transport deputies, who are paid by the state, have gradually stopped providing post-release rides, according to Tim Lueders-Dumont, executive director of the Department of State’s Attorneys and Sheriffs. Deputies are now ending the practice in the final counties where these transports were still occurring.

“We just don’t have the person power,” he said. “It was a good thing to be doing, but we have to put a stop to it now.”
There are 24 state-funded transport deputies, with one unfunded position recently added by the Legislature. Those deputies started providing rides for people released from prison during Covid-19, when courts began operating remotely, and arraignments took place in the prisons.
Now, as Vermont’s prison population reaches pre-pandemic levels and courts process a greater number of serious crimes like homicides, Lueders-Dumont said the state is prioritizing bringing detained people awaiting trial to court. 
In the past, arraignments — the first hearings in a criminal case — took place in person, so a defendant released by a judge could walk free from the courthouse in their county of residence. But with remote hearings held at the Springfield prison, a person might be released to the streets 40 miles or more from home, with no way to call for or pay for a ride. 
Remote arraignments have been a bane for attorneys and the Vermont Department of Corrections, who have argued that the system is often an inefficient use of resources and, at worst, a threat to the rights of people charged with crimes. 
With post-release transports ending, the virtual hearings pose a new problem. 
This past legislative session, the Department of State’s Attorneys and Sheriffs pushed unsuccessfully to significantly increase the number of state-funded transport deputies. If the department had 30, as requested, it could provide more services, according to Lueders-Dumont. But the department requires “belt-tightening,” he said, warning that the state’s next budget cycle will be even more challenging than the last. 
Problems will arise as people leave prison without a plan, Lueders-Dumont acknowledged. He characterized that concern as beyond the scope of deputies’ duties. The department will consider providing rides in particularly high-risk situations, he said. 
Valerio said he has a meeting Monday with the Department of Corrections and the Department of State’s Attorneys and Sheriffs, where he plans to bring up his concerns — but he doesn’t expect a quick fix. 
“It’s solvable if we have the will to solve it,” Valerio said. “We might be looking for a legislative solution.”

In December 2016, the Iowa Supreme Court suspended the law license of Des Moines attorney Royce David Turner, who was first licensed by the state in 2013. The court reinstated Turner’s license in May 2017.

In 2018, the Iowa Supreme Court Attorney Disciplinary Board filed a set of 13 disciplinary charges against Turner.
The charges related to alleged violations of rules concerning a failure to respond to inquiries related to disciplinary action, failure to provide competent representation for clients, knowingly making false statements of fact or law, failure to keep clients informed as to their cases, failure to retain client funds in separate trust accounts, failure to cooperate with the Office of Professional Regulation in relation to audits and investigations, and several other regulations.
Some of the charges stemmed from Turner’s handling of several different bankruptcy cases over the previous four years. In 2014, a federal judge ordered Turner to appear before her with regard to his alleged filing of inaccurate and incomplete court records, making false representations to a client, failing to appear in court, and failing to comply with court orders that he refund fees paid to him by clients.
The judge subsequently ordered Turner to pay $4,550 to his clients and complete educational training in ethics and management of a law office.
In 2018, the board alleged Turner had yet to refund his clients their fees, but acknowledged that Turner was being treated for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and depression. According to the board, Turner admitted representing clients in bankruptcy proceedings at a time when he wasn’t as familiar with bankruptcy law as he should have been.
In its 2018 filing against Turner, the board stated that although judgments against Turner in favor of his clients had been entered by the courts, the “clients are still waiting for most, if not all, of the money the bankruptcy court awarded them.”
Criminal cases resulted in arrest, fines
The 2018 charges also related to Turner’s representation of clients in criminal cases — cases in which he allegedly failed to appear for hearings and failed to file motions on his clients’ behalf on a timely basis.
In one such case, a Mahaska County judge held Turner in contempt of court and ordered him to complete 40 hours of community service, the board alleged. Turner was again found in contempt of court when the judge in the case concluded he had not complied with the order for community service, according to the board.
In a Story County criminal case, the board alleged, Turner and his client failed to appear for a pretrial conference, resulting in the client’s arrest. Turner then failed to appear for the second day of his client’s jury trial, resulting in a mistrial, according to the board. Turner then failed to appear for a contempt hearing, resulting in Turner being arrested and fined $500 — which, the board alleged, Turner failed to pay.
In yet another criminal proceeding, a Polk County judge allegedly found Turner in contempt for failing to appear in court and fined him $250, which, the board said, Turner didn’t pay.
Based on the board’s findings, the Grievance Commission of the Iowa Supreme Court recommended that the court suspend Turner’s law license for 12 to 18 months, with reinstatement conditioned on “proof of his fitness, particularly with regard to his mental health, and upon successful completion of continuing education in legal ethics and law practice management.”
The court ultimately suspended Turner’s law license for one year.
Board says Turner now citing an ‘imaginary’ case
Since 2022, Turner has filed several applications for reinstatement of his law license. The disciplinary board has opposed that request, arguing Turner has yet to comply with the requirement that he provide “an expert opinion from a mental health professional regarding his fitness to practice law.”
Last month, the Iowa Supreme Court canceled a reinstatement hearing scheduled for July 31, noting that Turner had yet to establish proof of payment to his clients or provide “convincing proof” of his fitness to practice law.
On July 9, 2025, the disciplinary board asked the court to strike “multiple recent filings” by Turner that the board said contained “what appears to be at least one AI-generated citation to a case that does not exist or does not stand for the proposition asserted in the filings.” The board alleged “the imaginary case” was cited by Turner in three separate filings related his efforts to have his license reinstated.
On Aug.14, Turner filed a motion for immediate reinstatement of his law license without a hearing, arguing that a hearing would serve no real purpose as it is clear he meets all of the conditions required for reinstatement.
Turner argues that in January 2024, a licensed psychotherapist conducted a clinical evaluation of him and concluded he was fit to practice. In court filings, he acknowledges that while the board has relied upon a December 2023 evaluation by a psychologist that raises “concerns,” the psychologist’s evaluation “was based in part on discredited statements from a third party.”
The disciplinary board alleges the psychologist’s evaluation “outlined very serious concerns about Turner’s mental health, including that Turner lacked insight about his condition and that Turner attempted to mislead the evaluator about his condition.”
The board claims Turner has submitted two letters from health professionals clearing him to return to work, but notes that each letter is one sentence in length. “Turner’s letters make no mention of mental health, do not appear to have come from a mental health professional, and do not address Turner’s fitness to practice law,” the board alleges.
The board is asking the court to set a date in 2026 for the consideration of any future applications for reinstatement filed by Turner.
Turner declined to comment on the matter when contacted Thursday by the Iowa Capital Dispatch.

(Photo by Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Industrial Commission on Thursday awarded WBI Energy an up to $500 million financial guarantee to build a pipeline that will bring natural gas to the state’s eastern communities.
WBI’s project, which it calls Bakken East, is expected to transport about 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day to eastern North Dakota. 
Bringing natural gas from the Bakken to the eastern part of the state will help North Dakota’s overall economy, Gov. Kelly Armstrong said. Right now, the eastern part of the state only gets gas from the Viking Gas Transmission pipeline, which spans the U.S. and Canada, so WBI’s project will give eastern North Dakota a more secure power supply, he added.
“Communities need gas to grow,” said Armstrong, who chairs the Industrial Commission. “We are taking a product that we have in excess that is stranded in the Bakken, and we are going to be able to move it across the state to people who need it.”
2 natural gas pipelines compete for $500M financial backstop from North Dakota

The pipeline also will support continued oil and gas development in the Bakken, Armstrong said.
The state has had a program to encourage businesses to build natural gas pipelines connecting to eastern North Dakota for over 15 years, though the program initially lacked funding. The Legislature in 2023 made $30 million per year in financing available, which the 2025 Legislature then voted to increase to $50 million per year. 
WBI Energy, a subsidiary of MDU Resources, proposes building the first phase of its pipeline from McKenzie County to Washburn, and the second phase from Washburn to Mapleton, just west of Fargo. The company also plans to build an extension from Jamestown to Ellendale. WBI’s timeline is to have phase one in service in November 2029, and phase two in service in November of 2030.
WBI has not disclosed the total project cost. Justin Kringstad, executive director of the North Dakota Pipeline Authority, has said he estimates a project of this scope would cost $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion.
The project would be built entirely in North Dakota but would be classified as an interstate pipeline since it would connect with other existing pipelines that leave the state. For this reason, it would be permitted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, not the North Dakota Public Service Commission.
Intensity Infrastructure Partners also applied for the state support. Representatives of the companies presented their project proposals to the Industrial Commission in July.
The three member commission — which includes Armstrong, Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring and Attorney General Drew Wrigley — indicated that it chose WBI over Intensity because WBI said it would commit to completing both phases of its project. Intensity representatives said the first phase of the pipeline from Watford City to Underwood was firm, but the company was still securing commitments for a second phase to the Fargo area. 
North Dakota is purchasing capacity on the pipeline as a financial backstop. The state plans to eventually transfer pipeline capacity to private businesses. According to Kringstad, there are already companies expressing interest. 
However, if North Dakota is unable to transfer its pipeline capacity, the Pipeline Authority could work with a gas marketing firm to try to recoup the state’s investment, Kringstad said.

In a worst-case scenario, the state would have to shoulder the full $500 million, or $50 million a year for 10 years. To finance this, it would have to take out a loan from the Bank of North Dakota, which would ultimately be repaid with state dollars from the Strategic Investment and Improvements Fund.
Armstrong said he is “extremely confident” the state will be able to transfer its share of the pipeline capacity to a private business. But even if the state is unable to fully recoup its investment, Armstrong said the economic benefits the project will bring will make it worthwhile in the long run. 
Without additional natural gas pipelines to the Bakken, companies could have to reduce oil production. As Bakken wells age, they produce a higher percentage of natural gas, which is contributing to a shortage of pipeline capacity. North Dakota produces more than 3 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day.
“If we can’t move our gas, we can’t increase oil production or maintain oil production,” Armstrong said. 
Details of the arrangement will be negotiated between WBI and the Industrial Commission. The state would not have any ownership stake in the pipeline, but would have a contract for a certain amount of space on the pipeline for 10 years. Kringstad estimates North Dakota would have roughly 17% of the pipeline capacity for the eastern half of the project. An estimate for the western portion was not immediately available.

WBI Energy President Rob Johnson said he views the state support as a bridge, not a subsidy. The support from the state helps WBI proceed with the project while other potential customers make final investment decisions, he said.
Johnson said the goal is for the project to not use the state support. 
In its application materials, WBI said many customers who have expressed interest in the pipeline are developing power generation projects to support data centers. There also is demand from other potential industrial customers and residential customers, Johnson said.
“It seems like every week, something else is being announced in the state of North Dakota that’s going to benefit from a project like this,” Wrigley said.
Industrial Commission members encouraged WBI and Intensity to try to partner on a project. Intensity had announced an agreement with Rainbow Energy, which owns Coal Creek Station in Underwood.
Johnson said he could not comment on whether WBI would work with Intensity, as the commissioners suggested.
“We’ll work in the best interest of our customers and the shareholders,” Johnson said.
It’s unclear if Intensity would continue to pursue a project on a smaller scale without the state support. Intensity did not respond to an inquiry sent to the company’s media spokesperson.
Armstrong said the two companies working together could reduce “landowner fatigue” from residents potentially getting approached by two different companies.
WBI has received permission to survey land from over 80% of landowners along the 350-mile route, Johnson said. 
The company plans to engage with landowners through meetings. WBI also would hold public meetings as part of the FERC regulatory review process.
The company will begin working with landowners to negotiate easements after the route is finalized. WBI would only use eminent domain for the project as a last resort, Johnson said.
“There are times where sometimes it’s necessary, but the goal going in is to not have to use eminent domain,” Johnson said. “That’s always our stance.”

The Civil Rights Cold Case Records Review Board released the records on Till’s Aug. 28, 1955, killing, many of them never seen before.

“The release of these records is nothing short of historic,” said board co-chair Margaret Burnham. “The brutal killing of Emmett Till helped galvanize the civil rights movement, and generations of Emmett’s family members, as well as historians and the public at large, have deserved a complete picture of the federal government’s response. The story of Emmett Till and the injustices done to him is still being written, but these documents offer up some long-overdue clarity.”
Davis Houck, the founder of the Emmett Till Archives, said for decades historians have longed to see these records, many of them files of the FBI, which balked at a federal investigation in 1955.
“The federal government has always been the final nut to crack in terms of getting these documents. It’s been frustrating. How far did their investigation go? We haven’t known,” said Houck, the Fannie Lou Hamer professor of Rhetorical Studies at Florida State University. “To get these files unredacted is going to be a treasure for researchers.”
The board shared a handwritten letter from 1955, urging federal authorities to pursue the case. “All decent democratic-thinking Americans demand that your dept take steps to end the lynch terror that now exists in the South,” S.H. Malone of Los Angeles wrote. “When local authorities refuse to act, it is up to the federal govt. They have reached a new low when they murder children.”

The records can be seen at the Civil Rights Cold Case Records portal, maintained by the National Archives and Records Administration. A summary of the Till case can be found on the board’s website, coldcaserecords.gov.
According to the board, Thursday’s release “spans 27 files and consists primarily of records from the 1950s. Three of the files include limited redactions protecting confidential informants and personally identifiable information for living individuals; the other files are released in full.”
The board was created as part of the Cold Case Records Collection Act of 2018, which passed Congress and was signed by President Donald Trump in 2019. A group of Hightstown High School students in New Jersey had championed the law.
The board has the power to review and expedite the release of records involving unsolved or unresolved cold cases from 1940 through 1979. Since last fall, the board has released federal case files spanning 31 incidents, involving 36 victims.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-21 20:59:03+00:00,CT Mirror,CT tax revenue surges — for 3rd time since state budget was set,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/21/ct-tax-revenue-surging-budget/,"Lawmakers, who watered down spending this spring thinking funds were unavailable, have learned CT has nearly $1.3B to spare.","When legislators wrapped the 2025 General Assembly session, they watered down new investments in health care and special education and scrapped income tax relief for middle class families, believing finances weren’t robust enough to support it.
But lawmakers learned this week from Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration that Connecticut had nearly an extra $1.3 billion to spare — enough to fund their proposals several times over.
And leaders of the Democratic majority called Thursday for a review of the state’s budget-adoption timetable. While forecasting always has been challenging given Connecticut’s heavy reliance on fluctuating, investment-related income, the stakes have become greater since officials here adopted budget caps that aggressively limit what they can spend.
In its first monthly projection of the new fiscal year, Lamont’s budget staff upgraded revenue estimates by $856 million, with 80% tied to investment-related income tax receipts, or earnings from certain business partnerships that don’t pay the corporation tax — a category that includes hedge funds.
That comes not long after the Lamont administration disclosed revenues for the 2024-25 fiscal year — which wrapped June 30, just 26 days after the legislative session ended— were $420 million greater than expected.
“It’s too much money not to have a conversation about is there a better process,” House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said Thursday, adding these last-minute surges in revenue “puts us at a disadvantage” crafting a state budget normally adopted in May or early June.
“We need a new approach to reflect on and take action on trends as they may be occurring,” said Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven.
The Lamont administration has noted on several occasions that projecting revenues — and income tax receipts in particular — is hardly an exact science.
The income tax, expected to generate more than $13 billion this year, is by far the state’s largest revenue engine, funding nearly half of the overall, $27.2 billion state budget.
But almost one-third of those income tax dollars come not from salary withholdings, but rather from capital gains, dividends, and other investment earnings that fluctuate significantly from year to year. Additionally, many wealthy filers seek and receive extensions, reporting their earnings months after the normal, April 15 filing deadline.
Lawmakers and Lamont build a new budget each spring based largely on an April 30 revenue forecast from analysts for the executive and legislative branches. Traditionally, data from wealthy filers has been limited.
But it’s more complicated than that.
The Lamont administration has been more conservative in its revenue forecasting than its predecessor.
During Lamont’s seven years in office, revenue projections have grown an average of $285 million in the weeks between when legislators adjourn their session and the fiscal year wraps on June 30. That’s more than three times the $92 million average gap lawmakers dealt with between 2011 and 2018 under then-Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, according to state budget records.
And surging revenues just before the fiscal year closes typically translates into extra revenue in the next budget.
The governor’s budget director, Jeffrey Beckham, warned this week that, “It is very early in the fiscal year and there are many factors that could impact our state’s economy and revenue,” including federal budget cuts and tariff policies, varying interest rates and international affairs.
Still, Lamont’s fellow Democrats in the legislature’s majority have been frustrated to learn of the surging revenues this summer — after they’d scaled back several initiatives based on reports the money wasn’t coming.
An Appropriations Committee proposal to add $84 million for special education grants next fiscal year became just $30 million, well below what local school districts need to meet rising costs.
Only $15 million of a planned $75 million increase in Medicaid payments to doctors who accept low-income patients was delivered. Connecticut hasn’t raised rates in a broad-based fashion since 2007, leaving many insured patients unable to find physicians who will treat them. Leaders in January said a $250 million infusion ultimately is needed to reverse a health care access crisis.
And hopes for a new $600-per-child state income tax credit aimed at hundreds of thousands of households eventually became a flat $250 payment — and only to families making about $67,000 per year or less. It would distribute about one-eighth of the projected $300 million cost for a full child tax credit. 
“Every year legislators are working off of estimates of our tax dollars that are billions less than what we actually have to allocate,” said Constanza Segovia, organizing director for Connecticut For All, a grassroots coalition of more than 60 faith, labor and other progressive groups. “And once again we see Lamont surprising us with more money he kept from our communities. How many times are we going to do this?”
Lamont administration officials note budget caps might have blocked more spending anyway, but lawmakers used several accounting maneuvers to work around those in the new budget, often collaborating on them with the governor.
For example, they shifted $300 million outside the formal budget — and spending cap limits — to launch a new program to grow child care program slots dramatically by the early 2030s.
And Democrats increasingly have pressed Lamont, a fiscal moderate, to revise the budget caps that he has championed, arguing they are too aggressive, draining essential funding from municipal aid, health care, education, social services and other core programs.
Republican leaders, who also support the budget caps, have also been frustrated by learning of last-minute revenue surges after the legislature has adjourned.
The House and Senate minority leaders, Vincent J. Candelora of North Branford and Stephen Harding of Brookfield, both told the CT Mirror earlier this summer that unsuccessful GOP efforts to block tax hikes on corporations would have been aided by the knowledge that revenues already were on the rise.
GOP lawmakers were frustrated in June 2022 when they pitched a plan to cut hundreds of millions of dollars in income, fuel and transportation taxes, but were blocked by Lamont and Democrats, in part by arguments that revenues wouldn’t support the cuts.
By mid-July 2022, the administration analysts identified an extra $568 million in tax revenues.
Candelora agreed Thursday that legislators must reassess their budget adoption and revenue forecasting processes.
“We’re all scratching our heads seeing the large quantity of revenue continuing to come in,” he said.
Legislative leaders still are planning a special session for late September or October to address cutbacks in federal assistance to Connecticut ordered this summer by Congress and President Donald J. Trump. 
Ritter said he would ask the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee to conduct hearings into the budget adoption and revenue forecasting issues and wouldn’t rule out reforms being proposed soon.
“It’s definitely going to be conversation for special session this fall,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0205_SR_BudgetDay098-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-21 17:57:51.241994

(Photos courtesy Washington D.C. National Guard/Facebook)Community advocates who oppose Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s deployment of the West Virginia National Guard to support President Donald Trump’s crackdown in the nation’s capital have filed a lawsuit challenging the move.  
The ACLU of West Virginia filed the complaint Thursday in Kanawha County Circuit Court on behalf of West Virginia Citizen Action Group. It lists Morrisey and Maj. General James Seward as defendants. 
“This action challenges an unprecedented and unlawful deployment of West Virginia National Guard forces beyond our state’s borders — not to defend against invasion, not to respond to natural disaster, not to assist a sister state’s emergency request — but to serve as political props in a manufactured crisis,” the group says in the complaint.
“West Virginia law is clear: The governor may deploy the National Guard outside our borders only for specific, enumerated purposes — none of which exist here,” they write. 
The complaint argues that Morrisey exceeded his constitutional and statutory authority with the deployment. The state code that governs National Guard deployments was shaped by legal battles after the 1921 Battle of Blair Mountain, where National Guard troops were deployed against U.S. citizens, ACLU-WV Legal Director Aubrey Sparks said in a news release. 
“The Guard’s services are indispensable to West Virginia, and sending these vital resources out of state to participate in a political stunt by the president is unprecedented, unconscionable, and unlawful,” Sparks said. “Neither state law nor our Constitution permits this deployment.” 
The lawsuit seeks to “restore the rule of law” and return Guard members to their “proper role” of serving West Virginia families and communities, a news release says. 
Morrisey announced Saturday his plans to send between 300 and 400 skilled personnel from the West Virginia National Guard to Washington, D.C. along with “mission-essential equipment” to assist in Trump’s federal takeover of policing there.
Trump has declared a “public safety emergency” in Washington, D.C., mobilizing the local National Guard to “take back” the capital from what he described as violent criminals. Washington’s elected officials have objected to the president’s claims about the city’s crime. Last year the Department of Justice, under then-President Joe Biden, said D.C. crime had hit a 30-year low. 
Trump’s Department of Justice has reportedly launched an investigation into whether the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department manipulated crime data. 
“West Virginia is proud to stand with President Trump in his effort to restore pride and beauty to our nation’s capital,” Morrisey said in a news release Saturday. “The men and women of our National Guard represent the best of our state, and this mission reflects our shared commitment to a strong and secure America.” 
West Virginia Democrats called the deployment “political theatre.”
West Virginia is one of six Republican-led states that are sending a total of more than 1,000 National Guard members to D.C.

Aug. 12, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Education Commissioner Brian Maher says he will no longer mount a 2026 campaign for the University of Nebraska Board of Regents.
Maher, 63, announced his decision Thursday, citing family and professional obligations. He had announced his campaign July 10. But this week, he said now is not the right time for him to pursue an elected office. He said running was pulling him away from his role in the Nebraska Department of Education and that time away from family is “non-negotiable.”
“I am not a politician — I’m a lifelong educator who wants to make a difference,” Maher said in a statement. “The simple reality is that I underestimated the amount of time and attention running a campaign would take.”

The District 1 seat on the NU Board of Regents includes most of Lancaster County and Lincoln, as well as surrounding Emerald, Malcolm, Agnew, Raymond and Davey. In addition to Maher, Lincoln entrepreneur Brent Comstock, 30, had thrown his hat into the 2026 race. 
NU Regent Tim Clare of Lincoln, a regent since 2009, and a registered Republican, does not plan to seek reelection. Maher is a registered Republican in the officially nonpartisan race. Comstock is a registered nonpartisan.
Maher had pledged to “continue faithfully serving” as commissioner throughout the 2026 campaign but, if elected, planned to step down.
‘Laser focus’ on education issues
The state Education Department is undergoing a long-term planning process likely to cover the next five years. It comes as a result of about a dozen forums held statewide earlier this year. 
State education leaders are also working to dole out more than $80 million in state, private and federal funding to improve literacy in Nebraska. Addressing chronic student absenteeism, school staffing vacancies and workforce development are also key department goals.

Maher, as education commissioner, chairs the new School Financing Review Commission, a legislatively created advisory body meant to help the Legislature review and possibly revamp how Nebraska funds its 245 public school districts, including how property taxes fit into the equation.
“My campaign for regent was distracting to the education issues that demand my laser focus,” Maher said.
Maher is a native of Hooper with a 40-year career in education that includes being a teacher at Elkhorn and Clarks Public Schools; a school administrator at Waverly, Elkhorn and Johnson-Brock Public Schools; superintendent of Kearney and Centennial Public Schools in Nebraska, as well as the Sioux Falls School District in South Dakota; and as CEO of the South Dakota Board of Regents (the Nebraska equivalent of NU president), where he served from 2020 to 2023 before returning to Nebraska.

In a brief call with the Nebraska Examiner on Thursday, Maher said the “honor” of being the education commissioner “will have my full attention, other than that which I give to my family.”
“I truly plan to really just focus on being the commissioner and really make sure that the confidence that the board has placed in me was not misplaced,” he said of what’s next.
Maher became Nebraska’s commissioner of education in 2023 on a 5-3 vote for an initial three-year contract. 
The State Board of Education, an officially nonpartisan board evenly split between Republicans and Democrats, voted unanimously in June to extend his contract to July 2027.
State Board of Education support
All eight members of the state board had endorsed Maher’s campaign for regent.
Board members Elizabeth Tegtmeier of North Platte and Deb Neary of Omaha, chair and vice chair of the State Board of Education, said Thursday they fully support Maher’s decision. Tegtmeier is a registered Republican. Neary is a registered Democrat.
“I am relieved that he is going to be staying with the Department of Education, selfishly,” Neary said Thursday.

Neary said she trusted Maher’s instincts when he decided to run and trusts that he knows the implications of his change of heart and is charting the right path now.
Tegtmeier said she supports Maher’s decision to invest in and spend time with his family and noted the Education Department has many undertakings. The board doesn’t want to lose Maher, she said, adding that progress has come, in part, because of his leadership and personality.
“While I’m disappointed, because I think he’d made a great one [regent], I also support it,” Tegtmeier said.
‘Great success’

Comstock said Thursday he spoke with Maher on his decision, where he thanked Maher for the time and decision he put into his regent campaign.
“He’s dedicated his life to educating young Nebraskans, and I know we have a shared interest in seeing the university — and our entire state — succeed,” Comstock told the Examiner.
Maher thanked his wife Peg, family, friends and “countless” Nebraskans who had lent support to his campaign. He asked for understanding for a “deeply personal decision” that was “not the outcome you all envisioned when we launched this campaign.”
“As we move forward, I remain committed to the students and families of Nebraska,” Maher said Thursday. “It is an honor to be the commissioner of education in Nebraska, and together, I look forward to helping Nebraska students achieve great success!”

Campbell plant in Port Sheldon Township, operating since 1962, was scheduled to close partially in 2030 and wholly in 2040. Consumers Energy, however, announced in 2021 it was moving the plan up by 15 years for May 31, 2025. [ONN photo/Sarah Leach]More than two months after Consumers Energy’s J.H. Campbell Coal plant was slated to shut down, President Donald Trump’s administration has ordered yet another extension on the plant’s operations. 
In a Wednesday order, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright added another 90 days onto the plant’s lifetime, arguing the facility is critical in maintaining energy reliability in the central United States. 
However, Michigan energy regulators – with input and consideration from the Department of Attorney General, environmental and consumer advocates, energy developers, businesses and more – found Consumers Energy’s plan to retire the plant and shift to other resources including wind, solar and natural gas, was “the most reasonable and prudent means of meeting Consumers’ energy and capacity needs.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The plant also supplies energy to Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc, or MISO, which operates the electric grid for much of the central U.S. The operator also signed off on the plant’s retirement, determining that it would not violate MISO’s reliability criteria. 
Heading into this summer, MISO projected it would have enough energy supply to meet expected consumer demand. While Wright asserts that the grid operator does not have sufficient resources, a MISO spokesperson told the Advance in an email that its 2025-2026 Planning Resource Auction indicated adequate resources to meet anticipated demand. 
Wright has justified the move by pointing to Trump’s executive order declaring an energy emergency, however several environmental and energy advocates have dismissed the emergency as a sham. 
Dan Scripps, chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission, which regulates energy companies in the state, questioned the decision to extend the operation of the Campbell plant calling it “a justification in search of a problem” and noting both Michigan and its primary electric grid operator have shown they have enough energy to meet demand.
“There is no energy emergency in Michigan or in MISO, and this decision will add even more costs that customers will have to bear,” Scripps said, warning that this system of 90-day extensions would add millions more to customers’ utility bills across the region. 
“Put simply, we don’t plan the grid 90 days at a time,” Scripps said. 
Protestors rally in Holland, call for Campbell coal plant to close

Consumers Energy Spokesperson Katie Carey told the Michigan Advance in an email the company is evaluating the order and expects to continue operating the plant as required by the Department of Energy. The latest order is set to expire on Nov. 19, 2025. 
According to a financial statement, complying with the order has cost Consumers $29 million. 
Environmental advocates call out increased costs, harms brought by continued operations
In response to the initial order, several environmental advocacy groups led by the Sierra Club and Earthjustice filed a petition for review at the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit after the Department of Energy failed to respond to request for rehearing on the order. 
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has filed a similar request, arguing the Trump administration arbitrarily declared a false emergency in order to advance policies through means outside their normal authority.
“There is no energy emergency justifying these orders and the President and his administration have no right to insist it remain operational against the will of the people of this state, or Consumers Energy. My office has taken multiple legal and administrative steps to challenge the Department of Energy’s first order and will continue to fight this latest one to protect ratepayers from footing the bill for a fake emergency,” Nessel said in a statement Thursday. 
Derrell Slaugher, Michigan policy director for climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, called the Department of Energy’s initial decision to extend the plant’s operation “troubling,” noting the decision to shut it down was not made haphazardly. 
In addition to the costs ratepayers will face through the plant’s continued operations, there are also significant health concerns, Slaughter said. 
According to the NRDC, the plant releases several millions of pounds of health-harming pollution and more than 10 billion pounds of climate-harming carbon dioxide into the air each year. It also releases 100,000 pounds of water pollution into Lake Michigan each year, including 10,000 pounds of toxic metals.

Air pollution generated by coal plants has been tied to several negative health impacts, including asthma, cancer and heart and lung conditions. 
Health experts estimate that the Campbell plant causes $389-$879 million in health impacts each year.
“It’s not a great plant to keep going for a variety of reasons,” Slaughter said.
Sierra Club Beyond Coal Campaign Director Laurie Williams also slammed the decision to further extend plant operations, calling it “unnecessary, deadly, and extremely expensive.”
“While Donald Trump and Chris Wright decry this made-up ‘energy emergency’, they are simultaneously limiting our access to cheap, reliable, renewable energy. If they actually wanted to deliver cost-savings and cleaner air to Americans, they would quit this nonsense and invest in renewable energy,” Williams said in a statement. 
Lisa Wozniak, executive director for the Michigan League of Conservation Voters, further stressed the costs brought on by keeping the plant online. 
“Closing the coal plant was expected to save Michigan ratepayers $600 million by 2040.  Now, we’re on the hook for tens of millions of dollars in costs because of this action,” Wozniak said in a statement. “Every day it remains open means more pollution in our air and higher energy costs for Michigan families. Our bills are already too high, and Trump’s reckless energy policies are making it worse.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PXL_20250812_155552401-1.jpg,,,2025-08-21 16:57:53.216282

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch)Prosecutors will pursue the death penalty against the man accused of shooting and killing two Tremonton-Garland police officers and wounding a third sheriff’s deputy and his service dog, according to court documents filed Wednesday that shed new light on the shooting. 
Ryan Michael Bate, 32, is now facing 20 separate charges for the shooting that rocked the small, northern Utah community of Tremonton Sunday night — that includes two counts of aggravated murder for the deaths of Tremonton-Garland Police Sgt. Lee Sorensen and officer Eric Estrada.  
Aggravated murder is a capital offense in Utah, allowing Box Elder County prosecutors to pursue the death penalty. On Wednesday, they announced their intent to put Bate on death row if he is convicted. 
In addition to the aggravated murder counts, Bate is facing a lengthy list of 18 other charges. They include: 

Four counts of attempted aggravated murder, a first-degree felony
Endangering a police service canine, a third-degree felony
Three counts of possession of an incendiary device, a second-degree felony 
Two counts of possession of a dangerous weapon with criminal intent, a class A misdemeanor 
Three counts of assault (domestic violence with a prior), a class A misdemeanor 
Unlawful detention, a class A misdemeanor 
Threat of violence, a class A misdemeanor
Three counts of domestic violence in the presence of a child, a class B misdemeanor

According to an indictment filed in 1st District Court in Box Elder County, Bate got into an argument with his wife Sunday — prosecutors say he headbutted her, then slammed her head with a door before grabbing her throat and pushing her against a wall. 
Prosecutors also say Bate held his wife down on their bed, threatening to kill her as she tried to calm him down. Three children were present during the attack, court documents allege. Bate’s wife was eventually able to call 911, but hung up “in an effort to summon law enforcement.” 
One of the officers arrived — it’s unclear in court documents whether it was Estrada or Sorensen — and spoke to the wife, who “assured there was no physical violence,” the charges read. As the officer was driving away, prosecutors say Bate grabbed a rifle and shot at the police vehicle.
The officer parked his car and called for backup, according to court documents, as the wife ran down the street yelling that Bate had a gun. As the officer went to cross the street and help the woman, Bate fired another shot, killing the officer. 
Shortly after, the second officer arrived on scene to find his colleague “laying in the road,” the charging documents state. As he rushed over to provide aid, Bate fired another shot, killing the second officer.

Mike Allred, a Box Elder County sheriff’s deputy, then arrived on scene — as he pulled up, Bate fired two more shots which barely missed Allred but still caused him injuries. Allred’s police service dog was also struck. Allred and his dog, Azula, have both since returned home and are recovering. 
After killing the second officer, one of Bate’s neighbors who drove a car “that looked like an unmarked police vehicle,” passed by the house, and prosecutors say Bate fired another shot at the neighbor, hitting their car, before they were able to flee. 
Bate “then approached the two fallen officers with a revolver and rifle in hand, as he continued to look around for other targets,” according to court documents, before he was “subdued and  taken into custody.” 
“During a search of the home, officers located three Molotov cocktails,” the indictment reads. 
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, during his PBS Utah news conference on Thursday, told reporters that he supports prosecutors pursuing the death penalty, and that it’s “very appropriate in this case.” 
Bate had been charged with similar domestic violence-related crimes before, including charges last year where prosecutors say he strangled an unnamed victim. Those charges were later dropped when the victim declined to testify, according to KSL-TV.

A California-based company wants to produce its portable nuclear microreactors, called Kaleidos, in Wyoming. 
The post Bar Nunn Town Council again hears opposition, but also support, for Radiant nuclear manufacturing plans appeared first on WyoFile .","A proposal for a nuclear manufacturing facility nearby continues to divide the small town of Bar Nunn, as plans include temporarily storing spent fuel on-site. For over an hour Tuesday, residents expressed fears about transparency and safety risks while others championed the potential for economic growth and the chance to put Wyoming at the forefront of a new industry.
Radiant Industries, a California-based company, is proposing to build a factory in Natrona County to produce its portable nuclear microreactors, called Kaleidos. The small, self-contained fission reactors would use helium as a coolant and TRISO fuel, a type of fuel that is highly resistant to melting. The factory would manage the entire lifecycle of the reactors, from assembly and fueling to on-site testing and storage of used fuel cores in dry casks. 
The company says the project will create high-paying jobs and help diversify Wyoming’s economy. Radiant also has partnerships with the U.S. Department of Energy, U.S. Air Force and Uranium Energy Corp., which is expected to help the company make Wyoming a hub for advanced nuclear technology.
Despite the project’s potential, it faces a legal hurdle. Wyoming law prohibits the storage of high-level radioactive waste unless it’s produced by a nuclear power generation facility located within the state. That means Radiant must convince the state legislature to change the law to allow for the temporary storage of spent fuel cores from its manufacturing process. The project also faces opposition from some local residents who are concerned about the facility’s proximity to homes, potential financial risks and a perceived lack of transparency from the company.
Opposition focuses on safety, financial concerns
Rob Kwasnicki, a resident who opposes the project, argued that spent nuclear fuel “presents an unacceptable risk to the health, safety and welfare of residents and is not a permitted use” for certain industrial zoning districts. 
“As a town council, you are elected to represent the town of Bar Nunn, not the town of Casper, not Natrona County, not the state legislature, not any landowners or business interests,” he said.
Jason Foley, a journeyman electrician with experience at Idaho National Laboratory, expressed his opposition to the facility being 2 miles from his home. He said he viewed Wyoming as “a last bastion of state’s rights” and does not want it to cede power to federal agencies that oversee the industry. 
“If you don’t believe that there is health and safety risks of dealing with nuclear radioactive material … it’s ignorant and it’s naïve,” he added.
Mitchell Groskopf raised concerns about the project’s financial implications. He argued that the tax rules and trade zones related to the project could leave Bar Nunn with costs but little revenue, especially if the reactors are sold out of state.

Other residents pressed the council on a perceived lack of transparency. Rozmaring Czaban questioned whether the town had a legally binding contract with Radiant after the council said it could open the town to litigation if it denied water and sewer hookups for the company. Multiple councilmembers said there was no contract. Czaban also pointed to May 6 meeting minutes that suggested councilmembers were open to supporting a state grant for the company, even though later minutes showed the council’s opposition.
However, Radiant Chief Operating Officer Tori Shivanandan has previously said the company would pay the same taxes as any other business in the region.
Czaban suggested that Mayor Peter Boyer’s, Councilor Dan Sabrosky’s and Councilor Tyler Martin’s beliefs that Radiant’s proposal would benefit Bar Nunn creates a conflict of interest in their ability to make decisions regarding site annexation and zoning. 
The council also heard discontent with the idea to rezone Radiant’s proposed site in favor of the company, which appeared to reference a 6 p.m. Tuesday workshop during which councilors talked zoning with the Zoning & Planning Commission. That discussion was not included in a recording of Tuesday’s Town Council meeting. 
During the council’s Aug. 5 meeting, Boyer responded to requests to annex Radiant’s proposed site and zone it so the company couldn’t place its facility there, saying the town’s legal authority is limited because the site is outside city limits. Boyer explained that a 2019 state law prevents the council from voting on developments outside town limits, even within its designated growth boundary. The council’s only role in such matters is to provide an opinion to the county, which will make the final decision, he said.
Supporters champion economic opportunity
On the other side, supporters of the project focused on the opportunity for economic and technological advancement.
Matt Keating, a Casper resident, said he was excited for Radiant to come to Natrona County, believing it could attract other businesses that will help feed already incoming power-hungry companies like data centers and AI operators to “keep the advantage that we need.” 
“I really believe that you’re here at a pivotal moment because you guys are very much going to help influence the future of Bar Nunn,” he said.
Amy Womack, thanking those who were speaking about Radiant’s plans, said she believed that discussions have been held with integrity and honesty. She said the company will “put not only Wyoming, but America first in the world in this technology.” She dismissed fears about nuclear energy as “old” and urged the council to “stay steadfast in this resolution that we need to move forward.”
“So, if outside companies are already part of our economy, what is the problem with Radiant?”William Wallace
William Wallace emphasized the need to retain young talent in Wyoming. He argued that Radiant’s presence would create “the kind of high-skilled, forward-looking work that makes our young people think twice about leaving.” He also addressed concerns about the spent fuel, calling dry cask storage “the most boring part of nuclear energy” and stressing the safety redundancy of the technology.
He pushed back on the idea that an outside company shouldn’t be allowed to bring investment to the state. He said Wyoming’s economy already depends on outside companies like Exxon, Conoco Phillips and Walmart, the state’s largest private employer.
“Union Pacific Railroad has operated here for generations. Halliburton, McDonald’s, Ford, they are not from here, yet they employ our people, they pay taxes here, and they are part of our daily lives,” Wallace said. “So, if outside companies are already part of our economy, what is the problem with Radiant?”

The former university president, Marcus Thompson, resigned in May, the third departure in seven years. The state’s college governing board did not explain why he or his two predecessors left the post nor has it shared with the public details about its next steps for picking a permanent leader for the school. 
Alumni and supporters of the historically Black university have raised questions to the board about its opaque process, calling for a fair, transparent national leadership search for the university.  
Gee Ogletree, president of the IHL board, said selecting a university president is not easy. He asked members of the public who were present at the meeting to assist with thoughts, prayers and suggestions throughout the process. 
“The committee search involves us walking a very fine line, respecting the need for transparency and openness to the public but also respecting the need for confidentiality for those who will put their name up for potential selection, who would be potentially recruited and interviewed,” Ogletree said. 
Steve Cunningham, vice president of the IHL board, will chair the search committee. He and Ogletree served on the committee that resulted in Thompson’s appointment as university president in 2023. For the university’s leadership search this time, all 12 trustee members will serve on the committee. 
The IHL board said it launched a landing page on its website for the public to receive status updates on the search process. Students, faculty, staff, alumni and supporters of Jackson State University are also invited to submit comments through the webpage. The board reiterated its commitment to a transparent and collaborative process at Jackson State, Ogletree continued
“Jackson State, like every other university, deserves our commitment and our best and I will give you my personal commitment that I will undertake that,” he said. “Having worked with these trustees, I know they will do the same.” 
Members of Thee 1877 Project, a group of alums not affiliated with the national alumni association, submitted its collected survey results from 350 alums to the board on Thursday on leadership traits respondents’ sought in the university’s next chief. Those top qualities listed include values like integrity and ethics, relationship building with politicians and community leaders, financial accountability and strong appreciation for HBCU culture and students. 
The group also submitted a petition and formal public comment with the board. While the board acknowledged submission of these items, Mark Dawson, who chairs the group, said he was disappointed they weren’t allowed to speak or read their statement at the meeting. 
“Like Fannie Lou Hammer said, ‘We didn’t come here for no two seats’,” Dawson said. “Not allowing public comment further shows the lack of transparency with the board. The public should know what constituents are saying, not just about Jackson State, but all citizens of the state of Mississippi should be concerned with by not having a clear process.”
In a letter obtained by Mississippi Today, Al Rankins, commissioner of the IHL board, responded to members of the group stating that the board’s standard practice is to “reply to written submissions rather than oral presentation at Board meetings.” Mississippi’s Open Meetings Act does not require public comment at civic and government meetings. 
Members said they wished the board would acknowledge its past mistakes in selecting presidents for JSU and address some lessons they learned from previous search processes. For the group, what they see as the board’s disregard for accountability or openness to change the process instills a lack of trust. 
“We want a determining stake and seat at the table where we can ‘yes’ and ‘no’ candidates just like the board members do,” Dawson said. “I don’t have any confidence right now. Certainly, I give them a chance to say and hear more. There’s still more questions.” 
Other alumni questioned who will hold the board accountable now that there is no one but the trustees on the search committee. 
“Nobody apparently,” said Monica Smith, a 1985 JSU alum. 
According to IHL board policies, it has two options when it searches for a new university president. It could extend a search that includes hiring a consultant, appointing an advisory board, launching a survey and conducting a series of community listening sessions with constituents before moving forward to post the job and interview candidates. 
It could also expedite the process in which trustees interview candidates that are “known to the board.” IHL has received repeated criticism about its history of elevating internal hires and appointing interim leaders.

That means his classroom needs a diverse toolkit. Scissors to trim plants, construction paper to draw plants, identifying rulers to measure growth, and a lot of sharpies because they get lost easily. 
On Thursday afternoon, Lane was among almost a dozen teachers attending the Wake Ed Partnership’s “Tools4Schools” supply drive to stock up on school supplies.  
“Instead of having parents do a wish list and putting extra weight on families, this is just a super sweet gift for both the teachers and the kids,” Lane said. “This is a treasure.” 
The Wake Ed Partnership, a Wake County nonprofit which advocates for improving public education, has distributed $1.6 million worth of supplies over the past two and a half years through its “Tools4Schools” program. It has more than 100 collection points, including Staples stores and YMCAs and also uses Amazon wish lists to collect donations.
In North Carolina, teachers now spend an average of $1,632 a year out of pocket on classroom supplies — the second-highest figure in the nation, according to a recent survey. That’s well above the national average of $1,021. 
And it’s an amount that could increase this year as inflation and tariffs are driving up the prices of school supplies. An analysis by Groundwork Collaborative and The Century Foundation found that typical first-day school supplies are up 7.3%, nearly three times the rate of inflation. Individual items such as index cards have surged by more than 40%, while binders and folders are up by about 13%.  
Tariffs on goods from China, which is a major source of school supplies, are a primary reason behind the spike. The added costs are putting pressure not just on teachers but also on families doing back-to-school shopping. 
“If teachers don’t have what they need, they can’t teach, and students don’t have what they need,” said Keith Poston, president of WakeEd Partnership. “Anything we can do to provide them with tangible things is also a way of saying thank you. It’s an appreciation thing.” 
Poston said that while the effort helps in the short term, it doesn’t replace the need for public funding. “We recognize that the private sector and nonprofits can’t take the place of sustained, significant investment,” he said. “Our public schools have been underfunded for decades, and things are only getting worse.” 
This school year marks Jess Holloway’s fifth year teaching at East Millbrook Magnet Middle School. Holloway said teachers paying for classroom supplies has become so routine that it’s simply expected.
“I feel like it’s so normalized that most people don’t throw a fuss about it, because that’s just been the standard,” Holloway said. “Teachers buy their own supplies. Teachers work outside of our contracted work hours.” She said this was her first time attending a supply drive, describing it as a critical resource with her next paycheck still weeks away. 
“It does feel good to walk in and have what I need. It shows the community values what we do,” she said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1935-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-08-21 16:57:53.216282

David Bullard, R-Durant, sits at the Senate podium on Monday, May 5, 2025. (Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – County officials across the state gave lawmakers an earful about the myriad of issues they face operating local jails.
Those issues include staff turnover, low pay, lack of mental health and medical care, lawsuits, violence, insurance and funding.
“We have a problem in the state of Oklahoma with county jails and something is going on,” said Sen. David Bullard, R-Durant. “This isn’t happening by random chance.”
Bullard requested the interim study to learn more about county jail insurance. The study was held Wednesday before the Senate Local and County Government Committee. Lawmakers use interim studies to help craft legislation.
“We have a problem in our county jails,” Bullard said. “We have got to get some of these addressed. Everybody has got their own little unique problems.” 
Bullard said he was considering and seeking feedback on voluntary jail consolidation.
Lost insurance coverage
Choctaw County Commissioner Jim Bob Sullivan said his insurer dropped coverage on the jail, and leaders had to shop for a new provider.
“Not everybody wants to cover a high risk jail,” he said. “So, they are hard to find and their coverage is not very good and their deductible is very high.”
The lawsuits against their jail involve offenders who come in on drugs, which has become profitable for attorneys, he said. The jail has been the target of several lawsuits over deaths in the facility, he said.
Pushmataha County Commissioner Mike Brittingham said the liability for jails has increased for several reasons.
“We’ve been put on a watch by the attorneys,” he said. “When they see us have an incident, they are contacting inmates for legal counseling.” 
One of the reasons the insurance rates went up was lack of staffing and sexual assault cases inside the facility, Brittingham said.
He said a lot of the inmates are being held on federal charges. There is not a limit on what the counties can be sued for in federal court, he said.
Carter County Commissioner Berry Lee-Brinkman said counties cannot absorb the payment of damages from large lawsuits brought by inmates. He said it has to be passed on to taxpayers.
Access to medical and mental health treatment 
Lee-Brinkman said paying for appropriate medical care is difficult.
“We cannot afford 24-7 medical care due to the large costs,” he said.
He suggested that the state pay for the costs of inmate medical care.
Atoka County Sheriff Kody Simpson said that in 2019, an offender died of influenza, which might not have happened had the jail been able to provide medical care on site. The death resulted in a $3.2 million lawsuit that the county settled, he said.
County leaders also said their counties struggle to find and access mental health treatment options for inmates.
In Pushmataha County, the jail is not able to house mental health patients. A lack of places to send inmates for care results in jailers or deputies having to sit with offenders 24-7, Brittingham said. 
“We need some kind of help with some type of mental institution,” said McCurtain County Commissioner John Wayne Williams.
Poor funding makes it difficult to attract quality employees, he said. Staffing shortages are a safety risk to the employee and offenders, Simpson said.

(Photo by Gage Skidmore)A federal judge has rejected the Trump administration’s attempt to keep Alina Habba as U.S. attorney for New Jersey and override the judges who last month named Habba’s top deputy to the post.
U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann said Thursday that Habba, President Donald Trump’s former personal lawyer, has served as the state’s top federal prosecutor “without lawful authority” since July 1 and voided all actions she has taken in that role since then.
“The Executive branch has perpetuated Alina Habba’s appointment to act as the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey through a novel series of legal and personnel moves. Along the way, it has disagreed with the Judges of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey and criminal defendants in that District about who should or may lead the office,” Brann wrote in his 77-page opinion. “Faced with the question of whether Ms. Habba is lawfully performing the functions and duties of the office of the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey, I conclude that she is not.”
The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Several criminal defendants challenged Habba’s authority and sought dismissals of their cases after a tug-of-war erupted over the position last month when the Senate did not act to confirm her. A panel of federal judges in New Jersey named her first assistant, Desiree Leigh Grace, to the job, enraging Trump officials, who fired Grace and reinstalled Habba. Brann, the chief judge of the Middle District of Pennsylvania, was tapped to decide the case after a defendant’s attorney successfully requested a venue change.
After hearing four hours of arguments last week in Williamsport, Brann ruled that Habba’s tenure as interim U.S. attorney ended July 1, 120 days after Attorney General Pamela Bondi appointed John Giordano as interim U.S. attorney.
A federal law known as the Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act gives the Senate 120 days to confirm an appointee and tasks federal judges with acting if that clock runs out without Senate action. Giordano served three weeks as interim U.S. attorney for New Jersey before Trump announced March 24 on social media that he appointed Habba to the job and she was subsequently sworn in on March 28.
Habba’s tenure has been turbulent, with New Jersey’s senators — both Democrats — accusing her of using her position to politically attack Trump foes. She has prosecuted two Newark Democrats, Mayor Ras Baraka and Rep. LaMonica McIver, over a May 9 episode at a migrant jail in Newark (her office dismissed the charge against Baraka days after they filed it). And she has said she is investigating two other Democrats, Gov. Phil Murphy and Attorney General Matt Platkin, over the state’s policy of providing sanctuary for some undocumented immigrants.
Brann banned Habba from further prosecutions.
“Because she is not currently qualified to exercise the functions and duties of the office in an acting capacity, she must be disqualified from participating in any ongoing cases,” he wrote.
While the ruling was a resounding loss for the Trump administration, it’s unlikely anything will change yet, because Brann stayed his decision pending an appeal.
Last week in court, he predicted the case likely would ultimately be decided by judges in higher courts than his.

Mark McDaniel (center), 130th Medical Group flight surgeon after assuming command of the 130th MDG, Jan. 8, 2017 at McLaughlin Air National Guard Base, Charleston, W.Va. McDaniel was named West Virginia's state health officer on Thursday, Aug. 21, 2025.
(U.S. Air National Guard photo by Tech. Sgt. De-Juan Haley)Mark McDaniel, a doctor of osteopathic medicine who recently retired as state air surgeon for the West Virginia National Guard, will be the next state health officer, the Department of Health announced Thursday afternoon.
“The role of State Health Officer is pivotal to the success of West Virginia as we work to make this beautiful state the best and healthiest place to live, to work, and to thrive,” Department of Health Secretary Arvin Singh said in a statement. “We thoroughly evaluated the candidates for this position and Dr. McDaniel rose to the top of the list as someone who genuinely cares for the health of West Virginians.”
According to the news release, McDaniel has 25 years of multidisciplinary medical experience in addition to his career in military and civilian health care leadership. As a civilian, McDaniel is a regional medical supervisor for AFC Urgent Care Centers in North Carolina and Virginia, as well as a Regional Medical Director of LabCorp Inc. He previously served as chief of aerospace medicine and senior flight surgeon for the 130th Medical Group at the McLaughlin Air National Guard Base in West Virginia. 
“I am extremely passionate about improving the health of West Virginians. I grew up here; I have roots here, and I know that this state can be one of the best,” McDaniel said in the news release. “I look forward to working with Governor Morrisey and Secretary Singh to tackle long-standing public health issues that have plagued this state for far too long. 
“Nationally, West Virginia ranks 49th in health outcomes and 46th for overall health. We struggle with obesity, chronic disease, and heart health, among many other serious health issues,” he said. “The Morrisey Administration has already proven that West Virginia is ready to make pivotal health changes, and I am excited to lead this vital work.” 
The news release lists McDaniel as “acting state health officer.” A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said Thursday the distinction is so that McDaniel may take on the role without giving up seeing patients. The department interviewed several candidates for the role and the requirement that they not be engaged in any other business, vocation or employment was a dealbreaker for the best ones, Gailyn M. Markham, director of communications, wrote in an email to West Virginia Watch. 
“That should come as no surprise given the importance of patient relations and the desire of physicians to remain current in their clinical skills,” she wrote. “The Department is open to working with the Legislature on statutory changes to address overly-restrictive job criteria that prevent the state from hiring the most qualified candidates for such critical roles.
As state health officer, McDaniel will be responsible for investigating diseases, epidemics and endemics, promoting public health, developing a state plan and other duties. He also becomes secretary for the state Board of Medicine. 
McDaniel fills a position that’s been empty since former state health officer Dr. Matthew Christiansen resigned from the role in December 2024, weeks before Morrisey took office. 
Christiansen had served in the role for nearly two years. 
McDaniel will begin his role Monday.

(Photo from Ryan Anderson's Facebook page with permission)Orlando officials expressed outrage at the overnight erasure of a rainbow-striped crosswalk outside the Pulse Memorial. Critics claim it was removed by the Florida Department of Transportation, but the agency has not responded to a request for comment.
The Memorial honors the 49 people murdered by a gunman at the Pulse LGBTQ nightclub in 2016, in what was the largest mass shooting in the country at the time.
“We are devastated to learn that overnight the state painted over the Pulse Memorial crosswalk on Orange Avenue,” Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer wrote on X. “But we know that while this crosswalk has been removed, Orlando’s commitment to honoring the 49 can never be erased.”
In a written statement, Equality Florida called the presumed move by the DeSantis administration a “cowardly abuse of power” and an “extreme escalation in his agenda to erase LGBTQ visibility and censor our history.”
Orlando Democratic state Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith called the decision to remove the crosswalk a “disgusting act of betrayal.”
However, Gov. Ron DeSantis isn’t backing down. He responded to Smith’s social media posting by simply declaring, “We will not allow our state roads to be commandeered for political purposes.”
Orlando Democratic state Rep. Anna Eskamani responded in turn, saying the rainbow crosswalk “was never a political statement, and caring about people of all backgrounds is not meant to be a political statement. And, more visible crosswalks help to increase visibility and safety too.”
“But what is political, what is authoritative, and what is disrespectful to the 49 lives murdered and our entire community, is sneaking into the city in the middle of the night to literally erase a rainbow crosswalk that was originally established with FDOT approval!!” she added.
FDOT released a memo on June 30 requiring that all traffic control devices, including pavement surface markings, to comply with the FDOT Design Manual. It asserted authority to “enforce compliance and withhold state funds from any public agency that is found to be in violation of the established standards for traffic control devices on public roadways.”
That directive followed a state law passed in the 2025 session (SB 1662) that bans asphalt art of any kind in streets, intersections, crosswalks, and roadside sidewalks.
The federal government has released similar directives. On July 1, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy sent a letter to all 50 states about roadway safety that stressed “consistent” roadway markings that are “free from distractions.”
He posted on X, “Taxpayers expect their dollars to fund safe streets, not rainbow crosswalks. Political banners have no place on public roads. I’m reminding recipients of @USDOT roadway funding that it’s limited to features advancing safety, and nothing else. It’s that simple.”
The Orlando City Council recently approved the hiring of a construction company to design and build a permanent Pulse memorial over the next couple of years, Central Florida Public Media reported.
Saying that they “refused to be erased,” Equality Florida called upon everyone in Orlando to show up for a peaceful gathering at the Pulse Memorial at 6:00 p.m.

Jay Collins, on the ground in California, insisted his trip to the West Coast to extradite to Florida an immigrant charged with vehicular homicide was not performative, although that state’s governor insists otherwise. 
Wednesday, Collins announced he was headed to California to bring back Harjinder Singh, an immigrant from India facing three vehicular homicide charges after attempting a U-Turn in a semi-truck on the Florida Turnpike. A minivan crashed into his vehicle, killing three people. 
“I am here to make sure that things happen the right way,” Collins said during a solo news conference at the airport in Stockton, California.

Following the crash, Singh returned to California, where he lives. 
“It’s not about words, it’s about deeds,” Collins said. “That is why I am here today, to make sure this guy is brought to justice, right back in Florida, to let our folks know we will go to any step necessary to make sure that freedom remains, that justice is served, and the rule of law is held accountable.”
California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, gave his recollection of the events, noting that Florida cops didn’t arrest Singh immediately. 
“Florida let a murder suspect walk, California police had to step in and arrest him, and now Florida’s new LG is staging a photo op to pick him up,” Newsom’s press office posted to social media Thursday. 
A reporter Thursday asked Collins about Newsom’s comments.
“What a bunch of hogwash. I don’t think he understands the first thing about leadership,” Collins said. 
“Leadership is getting on the ground and saying the hard things. This isn’t our home turf. I am out here answering questions in California because I believe in protecting our citizenry that much. I believe in leadership that matters. This is not performative, this is what leadership should be.”
When asked why Florida highway troopers didn’t take Singh into custody, Collins said, “You’re focused on something that’s nonsense, when he shouldn’t have gotten a license in California to freakin’ begin with. It’s wrong. It’s unacceptable.”

Flight data shows that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement jet that Gov. Ron DeSantis frequently rides in took off from the Stockton Metropolitan Airport just before 2 p.m. Eastern Thursday. 
State Rep. Alex Andrade criticized Collins Wednesday on social media, calling him a “politician acting like a keystone cop” and asking, “Why are we wasting taxpayer resources on political stunts? Why was this guy allowed to leave Florida in the first place?” 
Andrade is a Pensacola Republican who clashed with the DeSantis administration over the steerage of Medicaid overpayment settlement funds to the Hope Florida Foundation, a project of First Lady Casey DeSantis. Much of the money was given to groups opposing a marijuana legalization citizens’ initiative.
The Modesto Bee reported Wednesday that Singh signed extradition papers Tuesday, giving Florida 30 days to take him into custody. Singh had a fugitive warrant and appeared in San Joaquin Superior Court in Stockton, the Bee reported.
Collins called on California to take 287(g) agreements and other immigration enforcement measures more seriously. 
“Let’s not overstate, you can not say this enough: Three lives ended early because of that, because of failed border policy,” Collins said.

But the fine went too far, he said.“While the injunctive relief ordered by the court is well crafted to curb defendants’ business culture, the court’s disgorgement order, which directs that defendants pay nearly half a billion dollars to the State of New York, is an excessive fine that violates the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution,” Moulton wrote.The amendment says that “Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.”Trump celebratesOne judge, Justice David Friedman, said he would have thrown out the case entirely, arguing that James overstepped her authority by bringing the civil case because no one was actually harmed. Most of the valuations were not fraudulently high and even if they were, would have resulted in the same favorable terms Trump received, Friedman wrote.“All parties to these private transactions profited handsomely from the deals, from which there was no discernable negative effect on the public interest,” he wrote. “This action does not serve to protect the consuming public… This action does not protect the integrity or operation of the public securities market…, given that defendants do not issue publicly traded securities.”In a post to his social media site, Truth Social, Trump exaggerated the court’s finding, saying it cleared him of wrongdoing.“TOTAL VICTORY in the FAKE New York State Attorney General Letitia James Case!” Trump posted. “I greatly respect the fact that the Court had the Courage to throw out this unlawful and disgraceful Decision that was hurting Business all throughout New York State… The amount, including Interest and Penalties, was over $550 Million Dollars. It was a Political Witch Hunt, in a business sense, the likes of which no one has ever seen before.”In a statement, James pledged to appeal the opinion, while highlighting that the appeals court had affirmed the finding of fraud.“The First Department today affirmed the well-supported finding of the trial court: Donald Trump, his company and two of his children are liable for fraud,” she wrote. “It should not be lost to history: yet another court has ruled that the president violated the law, and that our case has merit.”Thursday’s order does not affect Trump’s May 2024 criminal conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to hush money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels.",,,,2025-08-21 16:57:53.216282

Data centers are popping up all over the country. They provide the massive computing power that tech companies need as they compete for dominance in the artificial intelligence boom. However, there has been community push back, from Oregon to Memphis. 
The impact on energy bills is likely the biggest concern. One study found that electricity bills could increase by as much as 8% by 2030 due to cryptocurrency mining and data centers. Mississippi energy companies have promised customers’ energy bills won’t increase.

‘A no-hire, no-fire labor market‘
“What we’re seeing is kind of a continuation of what we’ve seen for the past few months. In Mississippi as well as across the country, it seems to be kind of a no-hire, no-fire labor market,” said Corey Miller, Mississippi’s State Economist on the latest state unemployment numbers. 
Mississippi’s unemployment rate stayed at 4.0% for the fourth month in a row. July’s unemployment rate for Mississippi was the largest increase year over year in the country,  up from 3.1% in July 2024. 
However, this isn’t necessarily bad news for the economy. The increase in unemployment is likely due to more people entering the labor force. Real wages went up at the end of 2023 and inflation went down encouraging people who were not looking for work to rejoin the workforce.

Kevin Stitt has asked the Oklahoma Supreme Court to toss out an agreement between the City of Tulsa and the Muscogee (Creek) Nation.
Tulsa Mayor Monroe Nichols and the tribe agreed that the city would not prosecute municipal violations against tribal citizens, but would still enforce those laws. Prosecution would take place in a tribal court.
Stitt said Nichols has made Tulsa a sanctuary city with two systems of justice, one for those with tribal membership and the other for everyone else.
The agreement was entered as part of a resolution to a federal court case.
“If left unchecked, Tulsa’s actions would undermine the uniform application of law, create uncertainty in criminal enforcement, endanger public safety, and encourage other municipalities to follow suit unilaterally ceding jurisdiction without lawful authority,” Stitt’s filing said.
The lawsuit argues the issue is of statewide concern and challenges state’s supremacy in criminal law enforcement.
In 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court issued the landmark McGirt decision, holding that the several reservations had never been dissolved, including that of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. It found that the state lacked criminal jurisdiction over Indians committing crimes governed by the federal Major Crimes Act in Indian Country.
Stitt’s brief said the agreement between Tulsa and the Muscogee (Creek) Nation was not approved by the Tulsa City Council, him or the legislative Joint Committee on State-Tribal Relations, which represents lawmakers during the compacting process with tribes.
The agreement creates an intolerable conflict between the state and one of its political subdivisions, the lawsuit said.
“Tulsa has ceased investigating and prosecuting certain criminal offenses based solely on the racial and political status of the offender and whether the person qualifies as Indian,” the suit said. “That policy impacts not only criminal defendants but also victims, witnesses, and the broader public that depends on equal enforcement of the law.”
Some of the statements by Stitt and in the filing are inaccurate and “riddled with just lies,” Nichols said Thursday.
“The notion that there has been any time where we have not enforced the law in this city is false,” Nichols said. “It is incorrect. It is an outright lie. The governor knows that. The governor does not care about that.”
Stitt has not come to him about the issue, Nichols said, adding that the governor is trying to get in the way of progress.
The question at hand is who prosecutes who based on the crime they committed, Nichols said.
The latest action is one of a number of disputes between Stitt and Oklahoma’s federally recognized tribes. Stitt unsuccessfully sought to renegotiate voter-approved gaming compacts. He’s also pushed back against tribal tag owners who use turnpikes but don’t pay tolls.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa Democratic Party is asking voters what they want to see happen with the party’s presidential caucuses — and whether the caucuses should be held in defiance of national Democrats’ presidential nominating calendar.
Though the calendar is far from final, it currently seems unlikely that the Democratic National Committee will return Iowa to the first-in-the-nation position for the Democratic presidential nominating process in 2028. Iowa was booted from its longtime spot after the 2020 caucuses, when issues with reporting caucus results led to greater scrutiny of the caucuses, which some Democrats had long criticized as inaccessible.
In the 2024 election cycle, Iowa Democrats changed from in-person caucuses to a mail-in presidential preference contest. While the shift reflected some of the changes the DNC said it wanted to see from the Iowa nominating process, the 2024 cycle kicked off in South Carolina, followed by New Hampshire, Nevada, Georgia and Michigan.

Iowa has less input on bylaws committee 
Though the DNC has affirmed it will revisit the nominating calendar in 2028, Iowa’s role in deciding the new line-up has diminished. Iowa Democrat Scott Brennan lost his longtime seat on the DNC Rules and Bylaws committee, which oversees the calendar, in June, while New Hampshire has been awarded a second seat. In the 2024 nominating cycle, Iowa Democrats abided by the DNC’s calendar while New Hampshire held an unsanctioned presidential primary.
Whether Iowa Democrats change their caucus structure — or hold a contest outside of the DNC’s schedule — is up for discussion, IDP Chair Rita Hart said in a news conference Thursday.
The “Family Conversation Survey” opened for responses Aug. 21 and will be open through Nov. 15. Though the survey is open to all, the IDP is seeking responses from Iowans who participate or plan to participate in Iowa Democratic caucuses. Respondents are required to submit information including their name, zip code and contact information, and answer questions about how they hope the state party will proceed as a new calendar is formalized.
This includes soliciting feedback on whether Iowa Democrats should go “rogue” and hold the caucuses first in 2028, even if they are sanctioned by the DNC, as well as if the caucuses should return to in-person meetings despite the process making it difficult for people who work late hours, have children or face health care challenges to participate.
Hart said the survey will help the IDP get a better understanding of how Iowa Democrats want the state party to proceed, but said it will not result in a “definitive” answer on how Iowa will move forward with the 2028 caucuses.
“There are far too many moving pieces to say in August of 2025 what will be happening in January or February of 2028,” Hart said. “We will have a lot of choices and tradeoffs during this process, and this feedback that we will receive from the survey will help inform our next steps.”
Brennan advocates ‘full speed ahead’ on caucuses
Brennan, who also spoke at the news conference, said he had filled out the survey, responding to questions with the mindset of “full speed ahead, and damn the DNC.”
“The DNC does not control us, and we control our own destiny — whatever that looks like,” Brennan said.
Iowa state law requires political parties hold caucuses, and Iowa Democrats intend to continue holding caucuses in the future, Brennan said, regardless of national Democrats’ criticism of the contest style. However, he also emphasized that the 2024 process of mail-in presidential preference cards was a step toward “addressing issues that people had with caucuses previously.”
Next week, the DNC is scheduled to kick off its summer meeting in Minneapolis on Aug. 25, which includes Rules and Bylaws Committee meetings, where the nominating calendar could be discussed. Brennan said it is expected that DNC Chair Ken Martin will put forward how the national party plans to approach the nominating cycle and how states will apply for early positions.
Brennan said Iowans are “rules followers by nature,” and will follow the DNC guidance if it is a “open and fair process.” He said the process for setting the 2024 nominating calendar was not open and fair. Iowa Democrats complied with the DNC calendar in 2024 because it was a “different cycle” and there was a presumptive nominee — former President Joe Biden, who ultimately stepped out of the race with former Vice President Kamala Harris becoming the Democratic presidential nominee. But Iowa will not take the same approach to 2028, with an expected open primary field.
“It didn’t work for Iowa Democrats, and it did not work for national Democrats,” Hart said on the 2024 calendar. “… It was a big mistake in the Biden calendar to know that Iowa Republicans are going first here in this state, and that as Democrats, (we) sat and watched all this attention and the millions of dollars being spent in the state without that kind of those kinds of resources to to push back on the Republican agenda. And that did not help us here in Iowa, and it did not help us long-term … for the national Democratic cause, for the presidential cycle. That was just a big mistake.”
Hart also said a major factor in deciding Iowa’s role in the 2028 Democratic presidential nominating calendar will be decided by how Democratic candidates fare in the 2026 midterm elections.
“It’s critical that Iowa Democrats win in 2026,” Hart said. “If we do that, we will have a voice in the 2028 process.”

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas faith leaders petitioned Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Thursday not to restart executions in the state in light of a new law allowing the use of nitrogen gas suffocation for the death penalty.
Seven clergy members of different Christian denominations held a news conference at the state Capitol and spoke against both Act 302 of 2025 and the death penalty itself before delivering a letter to Sanders’ office.
“Together we prayerfully urge you to investigate the problems associated with execution by means of gas suffocation and continue to recognize the value of every human life,” said the letter, signed by 43 faith leaders — 41 Christian, one Jewish and one Buddhist.
Arkansas became the fifth state to permit nitrogen gas executions when state lawmakers and Sanders approved Act 302 in March. The state executed four men within a week in 2017 in advance of its lethal injection drug supply expiring, but no executions have happened since.
Lawmakers who supported Act 302 said the state is responsible for ensuring the punishment of violent criminals and carrying out executions will be easier if lethal injection is not the only option.

Death row inmates challenge new Arkansas law allowing nitrogen gas executions

 

There are about two dozen Arkansans currently on death row, according to the state corrections department’s website. Ten of those inmates filed a lawsuit against Act 302 on Aug. 5, the day the law went into effect.
The suit argues that Act 302 unconstitutionally violates Arkansas’ separation of powers doctrine in three ways — it delegates to the corrections department and its director “absolute, unfettered discretion” to choose between lethal injection and nitrogen hypoxia, it provides no standards to constrain the use of nitrogen hypoxia and it impairs the judicial function by imposing and modifying prior sentences.
Thursday’s speakers presented a moral argument against the death penalty, asserting that all humans are made in God’s image, “even people who have done horrific things,” said Father Phillip Reaves, the Catholic Diocese of Little Rock’s prison ministry director.
Southern states carry out more executions than other regions, and most prisoners on death row are Black, said Rev. Denise Donnell of the New Beginnings Church of Central Arkansas.
“When you think about the history of lynching, you realize, hey, this has a racial component,” Donnell said, pointing out that Jesus’ crucifixion was “a public spectacle” and comparing it to lynching.
Act 302 met opposition from the public, including from clergy, during the 2025 legislative session. Rev. Jeff Hood told a House committee that the nation’s first nitrogen gas execution in Alabama in January 2024 was “horrific” and “devastating” to witness.
Arkansas lawmakers give initial approval to bill permitting nitrogen gas executions

That execution led to a lawsuit filed earlier this year. The plaintiff, an Alabama death row inmate, said Kenneth Eugene Smith’s death after several minutes of violent convulsing was “a human experiment that officials botched miserably.”
Rev. Hammett Evans, a Methodist pastor at Thursday’s press conference, said he got to know a Georgia inmate who converted to Christianity and became a pastor before her execution. He said this story “haunts” him and is a reminder that “no person is beyond redemption’s reach.”
“The state executed God’s son, and God was so opposed to that execution that God raised Jesus from the dead,” Evans said. “The Resurrection was God’s ultimate ‘no’ to the death penalty.”
Unitarian Universalist Rev. Paul Beedle, Lutheran Rev. Jacqui Bushor and Baptist leader Preston Clegg also spoke against Act 302.
“The more we allow violence and torture to shape our moral imaginations, the more alien peacemaking becomes to us,” said Clegg, pastor of Second Baptist Church in Little Rock.
Jennifer Siccardi, a receptionist at Sanders’ office, accepted the letter from the faith leaders after the press conference.
The letter suggests that the state direct resources to “preventing child abuse, providing mental health care and substance abuse treatment, and by investing in community safety programs.”
“We need to do more to help victims in the aftermath of tragedy by providing emotional and financial support and services that help promote healing and recovery, instead of focusing solely on what happens to the person who caused harm,” the letter states.

Most refugees and asylees will no longer be able to get food stamps under President Donald Trump’s new tax and spending law. (Photo by David Dee Delgado/Getty Images)B. said he left Cameroon nine years ago because he was scared for his life. Authorities in the West African nation threw him in prison because of his sexual orientation, he said. After his release, he feared that if he stayed in the country, he would be killed.
B., who is now 39 and who asked that he be identified only by his initial because he still has family in Cameroon, arrived in the United States with practically nothing. Since he was granted asylum last year, he has been able to use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, to help him get by.
But now most refugees and asylees, who entered the country legally, including B., are no longer eligible for food stamps. The change is part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the giant federal domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4.
“I think it’s unfair. I understand that there are some people who abuse the system,” B. told Stateline. “There are also people who are in need. And cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.”
SNAP, which is funded by the federal government but administered by the states, helps families and individuals with lower incomes supplement their grocery budgets. The program serves an average of 42 million people a month.

Supporters of the change note that refugees and asylees can get permits to work, and that they have other sources of support.
“It’s not like they have been dropped off in this country with no support system,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that backs stricter immigration rules.
“They have sponsoring organizations that are helping them get settled and they have work authorization. So they really should be moving forward towards self-sufficiency with support right out of the starting gate. And they should be moving ahead to obtain green cards,” she added, referring to the cards that signify permanent residency.
Vaughan cited a federal grant program that reimburses states and nonprofit organizations for financial aid and health care coverage they provide to refugees.
But critics argue that asylees and refugees, who are extensively vetted and have a legitimate path to citizenship, can wait years for a green card, which entitles them to a wider array of benefits.
They also say community organizations that provide aid to asylees and refugees are stretched thin. Without food stamps, they say, many refugees and their families would not have enough to eat.




Cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.


– B., a Cameroonian asylee



“SNAP is an incredibly fundamental program for this population that comes to the United States, really, with very little, if anything,” said Nicolas Palazzo, a policy counsel at the global humanitarian and refugee advocacy organization HIAS. “These are people who literally had to flee — many times overnight — with nothing, but, you know, a pair of clothes in a backpack.”
Palazzo also said SNAP is not a “handout” to refugees or asylees. Rather, he said, it’s a “smart and moral investment” that protects all communities and strengthens the economy, offering people a foundation for self-sufficiency.
“Stripping critical food assistance forces refugees and asylees into the shadows of informal work, labor exploitation and hunger that weakens our workforce and denigrates our moral obligations,” Palazzo said.
‘Nowhere else to go’
B. said he applied immediately for asylum when he arrived in the U.S. in 2016, but that he had to wait months for a work permit. He survived by doing odd jobs, such as cleaning homes and delivering food, and got by on very little. It wasn’t until late 2024, when he finally won his asylum case, that he was eligible to get any public benefits, including food stamps.
Eligibility for food stamps came at a critical time for B., as a car accident had prevented him from making food deliveries.
“While not having income, it was very helpful,” B. said. “I’m somebody who if I can work, I will work. The only reason I went over there to ask is because I had nowhere else to go.”
According to a November 2024 report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, a total of 60,050 people were newly admitted to the United States as refugees in 2023, many from unstable countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Syria and Afghanistan.
In 2023, the nation received at least 747,000 applications for people seeking asylum from countries including Venezuela, Cuba and Colombia, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration research group. It’s a tremendous increase from the 68,000 applications received in 2013.
The new domestic policy law specifies that food stamps are still available to Cubans and Haitians who might be refugees and asylees.

As of July 2025, more than 2.2 million immigrants in the U.S. are awaiting asylum hearings or decisions after formally applying for asylum, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, an organization at Syracuse University that tracks immigration cases.
“Getting through the system was difficult,” B. said. “I had to find money. I had to find an attorney who would help me apply for my asylum case. The asylum case itself took a long time.
“I still know people who have been here for more than 10 years and never had an interview.”
‘Already stretched’
According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, half of all admitted refugees in 2023 were resettled across just 10 states: Texas, New York, California, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan and Washington.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 41,000 people in the state are getting SNAP benefits while not being lawful permanent residents. She says that group includes refugees and asylees.
“The concerning part there is that these are individuals who were … lawfully admitted to the country, have previously been eligible for SNAP when they need it, and now, simply because of their status, will no longer be able to receive SNAP benefits,” Guinn told Stateline. “There’s nothing we’re going to be able to do to make them eligible.”
Another change under the new law is that for the first time, states will have to pay for a portion of their food stamp programs. States will have to cover between 5% and 15% of their SNAP costs beginning in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they dole out benefits to people eligible for the program.
Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, pointed out that states that want to continue to provide SNAP benefits to refugees and asylees are free to do so — as long as they pay for it.
“If New York state doesn’t want to cut these people off, they can continue to give them something like food stamps. They just have to do it with New York state money right now,” Rector said.

But Guinn said that will be difficult. New York does offer asylum-seekers cash assistance of $180 a month through its Safety Net Assistance Program, but typically recipients must be working.
In Texas, officials at the state’s health and human services agency said that as of last month, roughly 24,600 of the state’s 3.5 million SNAP recipients were refugees or asylees. A spokesperson for Maryland’s human services agency wrote in an email that the state’s SNAP program last year supported more than 10,000 refugees and asylees.
The California Department of Social Services could not provide the number of refugees and asylees receiving food stamps, but projected that a total of 74,000 noncitizens — including lawfully permanent residents, refugees and asylees — would lose eligibility under the new law.
Sherri Laigle, the director of social services at HIAS, said food banks will not be able to make up for refugees’ and asylees’ loss of SNAP benefits.
“They’re already stretched, and now we’re going to see tens of thousands of people also needing to continue to rely on these programs. Of course, there’s limited access to them. You have to have transportation. You have to be able to get there.”
B. said he would apply for food stamps again if he could, because he’s earning too little income to get by.
“There are people who are in need. I think ignoring that — it’s not human.”

Green International Airport has joined a national initiative to make it easier for families to get through Transportation Security Administration passenger screening easier. (Getty image)Rhode Island T.F. Green International Airport has joined half a dozen other U.S. airports in opening a dedicated screening lane for families to get through security easier.
The new family lane has handled about 1,500 passengers a day since Aug. 6, when the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) launched the “Families on the Fly” campaign at the Warwick airport, TSA spokesperson Daniel Velez said Thursday. 
A dedicated family lane is open to people traveling with children ages 12 and under, and the whole family — including aunts, uncles, and grandparents — is welcome to use it, according to the TSA. When a family approaches the security podium, a TSA officer will ask if they are traveling as a family, and direct them to the appropriate dedicated lane — which is marked at T.F. Green with a sign. 
“We’ve gotten nothing but good feedback on it,” Velez said in an interview. “People seem to love it.” 
A spokesperson for T.F. Green did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
At T.F. Green, the family lane is set up in one of the airport’s widest checkpoints to accommodate strollers and extra carry-ons. Officers are also available to assist families with bags, strollers, and other items, Velez said.
“It can be quite a task when you’ve got a few kids running around,” he said.
Families using the lane will still follow standard TSA screening, unlike PreCheck, which lets travelers keep on belts and light jackets and leave laptops and liquids in their bags. But as part of the “Families on the Fly” initiative, the agency is offering a $15 discount on PreCheck enrollment when two adults sign up together. (TSA now allows all passengers traveling through domestic airports to keep their shoes on at security screening checkpoints.)
Children 12 and under can accompany parents through TSA PreCheck lanes. Kids ages 13 to 17 may also join if they’re on the same reservation and their boarding pass shows the PreCheck indicator, according to the agency.
The national campaign officially launched in July at Orlando International Airport in Florida. Along with T.F. Green and Orlando, family lanes are now open at the following airports: John Wayne Orange County Airport in California, Orlando International Airport in Florida, Jacksonville International in Florida, Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Hawaii, Charlotte-Douglas International Airport in North Carolina, Will Rogers International Airport in Oklahoma, and Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in Puerto Rico.
Lanes are expected to open at additional airports across the country, including Tampa International Airport where a family lane is scheduled to open on Monday, Velez said.

Article Summary

JB Pritzker and legislative leaders have suggested Illinois should exercise more regulatory authority over premiums that insurance companies charge for homeowners coverage. That began after State Farm Insurance announced it was raising rates in Illinois by an average 27.2%.
During a Senate Insurance Committee hearing, insurance industry officials said rates in Illinois are rising due to risks posed by severe storms. They said regulating premiums would ultimately harm consumers.
Pritzker has asked lawmakers to consider legislation in the upcoming fall veto session, but it is unclear whether legislation will be ready for consideration by that time.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

Insurance industry officials defended recent homeowners insurance rate spikes this week, blaming such factors as inflation and climate change while warning that attempts to regulate their ability to set rates would be bad for consumers.
In testimony during a virtual meeting Wednesday of the Senate Insurance Committee, officials pushed back against criticisms by Gov. JB Pritzker and legislative leaders who said the hikes raise suspicions that Illinois homeowners are being charged extra to help cover insurance losses caused by wildfires, hurricanes and other natural disasters elsewhere in the country.
Robert Gordon, a senior vice president at the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, said property losses from natural disasters are common in Illinois, and they have been growing more frequent.
“Chicago is the most at-risk of any major city for severe convective storms,” he said. “That’s storms like thunderstorms, hail, tornadoes. … Both the average annual losses and the number of billion-dollar-plus disasters in Illinois has dramatically increased over the last several years.”
Calls for regulation
In July, Pritzker called on lawmakers to pass legislation in the upcoming fall veto session that would give the Illinois Department of Insurance regulatory authority over the rates companies charge for homeowners insurance.
That came after one of the largest insurers in the Illinois market, Bloomington-based State Farm Insurance, announced it was raising premiums for residential property casualty insurance in Illinois by an average 27.2%.
“These increases are predicated on catastrophe loss numbers that are entirely inconsistent with the Illinois Department of Insurance’s own analysis — indicating that State Farm is shifting out-of-state costs onto the homeowners in our state,” Pritzker said in a statement. “Hard-working Illinoisans should not be paying more to protect beach houses in Florida.”

State Farm disputed that claim, saying the rate increases were the direct result of property insurance losses in Illinois. It noted the company had lost money in its homeowners’ line of business in 13 of the last 15 years.
But State Farm’s action also highlighted the fact that Illinois is the only state in the nation whose insurance regulators do not have authority to review and either approve, modify or reject proposed premium changes in the homeowners insurance market. Only in recent years has the General Assembly given the department regulatory authority over health insurance premiums.
‘Competition’ as a regulator
Nat Shapo, a former director of the Illinois Department of Insurance under former Gov. George Ryan from 1999 to 2003 who is now an attorney in private practice, testified that the primary job of state regulators should be to make sure insurance companies remain solvent, not to put caps on the premiums they charge.
“That’s because the greatest harm to policyholders that your constituents is when a carrier can’t pay their claims,” he said.
Instead of regulating premiums, Shapo said, Illinois has traditionally relied on market competition to keep rates affordable while regulators have focused on making sure the premiums companies charge are sufficient to provide them with enough capital to pay claims.
He said regulating premiums in a way that inhibits companies from adapting to changing circumstances often results in driving some carriers out of the market, thereby weakening competition and raising prices for consumers even further.
“For 50 years since the market became competitive, (Illinois) has used competition, the most ruthless regulator of price, to regulate insurance rates,” Shapo said. “The results have been very good.”
Sen. Julie Morrison, D-Lake Forest, who chairs the committee, said Wednesday’s hearing was for informational purposes only. She said more hearings will be held before the committee considers any legislation, but she did not indicate when the next hearing would be.

(Rebecca S. Gratz for the Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska State Auditor’s Office saw dead people in Nebraska’s Medicaid payments to managed care organizations as part of an audit, so it dug deeper and found 13.
The Auditor’s Office reviewed all regular monthly payments made in March to managed care groups by Nebraska’s Medicaid program under the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services.

It identified 83 payments worth a combined $65,554 that were made on behalf of 13 Nebraska recipients of Medicaid after they had died, according to a letter from Auditor Mike Foley’s office.
The state systems that HHS oversees are supposed to flag the Medicaid program when HHS’ own Office of Vital Records notifies its eligibility system and its payment system of a person’s death so the payments stop.
In at least two and possibly three of the 13 people’s cases, Vital Records, which handles birth and death certificates, failed to flag the system automatically about the deaths. 
One Medicaid recipient’s managed care organization received payments for more than two years after the patient’s death — 783 days, the state auditor’s letter says. 
But in seven cases, the payments continued after the Medicaid payment system had been automatically flagged about their deaths. For five people, the state listed them as ineligible rather than dead. The other two had delayed processing.
The auditor’s deeper review of the payments followed its letter in late June to HHS raising questions about the program and its ability to verify proper payments and patient deaths.
“The procedures utilized by DHHS appear to have failed to check for deceased individuals against other systems or records used by the same agency,” the Auditor’s team wrote.
Foley’s office recommended that HHS button up its processes to more quickly stop payments after a Medicaid recipient’s death and that it work more quickly to seek and collect overpayments.
HHS, in a brief response included in the letter, acknowledged that its existing processes failed to properly stop some of the payments and pledged to review its internal controls.
“While DHHS has had processes in place that have largely been effective to identify, take eligibility action and recoup payments made after the date of death for Medicaid recipients, this review highlights opportunities to strengthen established controls,” the agency wrote.

This story by Clare Shanahan was first published by the Valley News on Aug. 21.
HARTFORD — One man is dead and a second victim is receiving medical treatment after a shooting in Hartford early Thursday morning.
Authorities have said there is no ongoing threat to the public, but they have declined to release further details citing the ongoing investigation.
The names of the victims are being withheld pending notification of relatives, Vermont State Police said in a press release issued Thursday morning.
The investigation began at about 3:50 a.m. when a 911 caller reported a disturbance at a home on Verna Court off VA Cutoff Road, according to the release. Hartford Police arrived and found one victim deceased. The victim’s body was still at the scene midday Thursday.
The second victim was hospitalized for treatment and is expected to survive, according to the release.
Police said they have made no arrests nor have they publicly identified a suspect.

Police closed a section of VA cutoff Road in Hartford on Wednesday morning for an “active investigation.“
An autopsy for the deceased victim was scheduled for Thursday, according to the release.
VA Cutoff was closed from Mill Road to Route 4 on Thursday. Police also blocked off Verna Court, a short residential street off VA Cutoff Road just south of the White River.
Verna Court includes only two residential parcels, according to online property records, and was cordoned off by police tape.
On Thursday morning, two police officers at a time were stationed at the intersection with VA Cutoff Road while other officers occasionally stopped by the scene.
At about 9:50 a.m., a woman in a red vehicle drove past the police barricade at the intersection of Mill Road and VA Cutoff Road. She was stopped by Hartford Police and was told to turn around because it was a crime scene.
She said loudly, “That’s my husband. That’s my husband … Is he alive?” The woman said she had been working the graveyard shift and had been contacted by police. A Vermont State Police detective spoke with the woman, and she turned around and left.
In addition to Hartford Police, several divisions of the Vermont State Police are assisting in the ongoing investigation.
A law enforcement officer was canvassing the neighborhood Thursday morning.

A neighbor, Christopher Delong, who lives in an apartment building up VA Cutoff Road from the scene of the shooting, told the Valley News that he heard arguing around 3:30 Thursday morning after he returned home from work.
Delong said he then “dozed off a bit” and was awoken by gunshots. He tried to go back to sleep but was unable to and then he heard emergency vehicles making their way down the road.
“I’m shocked. It’s crazy to think something like that would happen,” said Delong, who has lived in the neighborhood for about two years.
He did note that there have been some vehicles vandalized on the street, including his own.
He also said that one of the properties on Verna Court is the scene of frequent police activity.
Another neighbor, Karasa Dumaine, said her family had heard “some banging” early in the morning but didn’t notice much commotion because of the hour.
Dumaine said she does not know the residents on Verna Court and said “they just keep to themselves” and “were the type to work on their cars and mind their own business.”
On Thursday morning at least four vehicles in various states of repair could be seen parked along Verna Court.

Chris Druge, who works at R.H. Scales and Co. across the street from the scene, said there was frequent traffic at Verna Court.
“There’s a lot of people that come and go from there,” Druge said.
Earlier Thursday morning, the Hartford Police Department and the Vermont State Police announced on social media that they were investigating an “active incident” in the area of 200 VA Cutoff Road.
Police are asking the public to avoid the area and seek alternate routes. Thursday’s incident was the second fatal shooting in the Upper Valley this week. On Sunday, police discovered the body of 67-year-old William Colao at his home in Canaan. Nor arrests have been announced in that case nor have police identified a suspect.

LoMonica McIver with assaulting officers, they excluded key details, McIver now says.","Rep. LaMonica McIver is accused of assaulting officers on May 9 as they tried to arrest Newark Mayor Ras Baraka at the Delaney Hall migrant jail in Newark. (McIver photo by Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)New court filings from U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver, who wants a judge to dismiss a federal indictment against her, allege the charging document excludes key details of what happened at a Newark migrant jail on the day prosecutors claim McIver attacked federal officers.
The indictment, which hit McIver (D-10) with three charges of assaulting or impeding federal agents trying to arrest Newark Mayor Ras Baraka on May 9, leaves out that Baraka had left the facility when ordered, overstates the moments of physical contact between McIver and agents arresting the mayor, and obscures that McIver’s actions were part of her federally authorized oversight duties as a congresswoman, the filings say.
Moreover, McIver’s legal team says, footage from federal officers’ body-worn cameras confirms her version of events. McIver has cited the video footage in court filings, but it has yet to be made public.
“The indictment is skeletal, exaggerated, omits context, and the video evidence squarely contradicts much of it,” one of them says.
McIver was at the migrant jail, called Delaney Hall, along with two Democratic colleagues, Reps. Rob Menendez and Bonnie Watson Coleman. Baraka, a Democrat who at the time was running for governor, had already visited the jail that week to claim that the building’s owner began housing immigrants there before city inspectors had deemed it safe to open.

The indictment alleges that when a security gate separating the Delaney Hall property from the driveway leading to it opened to let a vehicle through, the three representatives “moved quickly inside to the secured area before the gate closed” and then proceeded to an interior reception area.
McIver’s filings say the three identified themselves as members of Congress, explained they were there to “conduct congressionally authorized oversight,” and were told to remain in a secured area for about an hour. During this time, she alleges, ICE was “mobilizing its forces,” with high-level federal officials reporting to the facility, munitions-filled vehicles taking formation in the parking lot, and about 15 armed agents assembling inside the gates.
The indictment alleges this is when Baraka arrived with his security detail, told the guard at the gate that he was part of the congressional entourage, was denied entry at first, and then was “allowed to enter” the property. The guard was concerned about Baraka’s safety “amidst the crowd of protestors” outside the gate, the indictment says.
McIver’s filings say after Baraka arrived, the mayor spoke to the gate guard, who after 10 minutes then spoke to someone on his radio. After that, the guard “invited the mayor and his security detail” onto the property, her filings say.
A U.S. Department of Homeland Security agent approached Baraka, according to the indictment, and ordered him to leave, spending about five minutes issuing “multiple warnings” that he would be arrested if he did not depart.
McIver’s filings cite video footage to say Baraka had been “standing peacefully and quietly” inside the gate for about 40 minutes when a team of agents approached him and told him to leave. Baraka said he had been invited in, was waiting for the Congress members to exit, but was “fine” to leave. He turned to walk out, and McIver, Menendez and Watson Coleman then “approached the circle of agents” who were confronting Baraka.
The indictment alleges that the homeland security agent said he was going to arrest Baraka, to which McIver said, “Hell, no! Hell, no!” As the agent ordered Baraka to place his hands behind his back to be handcuffed, the indictment says, McIver and the other Congress members “surrounded” Baraka and prevented agents from handcuffing and arresting him as the mayor’s security detail escorted him off the property.
McIver’s filings say the agent’s call to arrest Baraka came after the mayor had turned to exit the jail’s property. It cites video footage that claims to show an unidentified man — “not Congresswoman McIver” — moving between the agent and Baraka. Then, McIver’s filings say, the agent allowed Baraka to leave the property.
“Alright . . . walk out,” they claim the agent said to the mayor.
McIver’s filings say federal agents then led the members of Congress toward Delaney Hall “as if they were finally going to permit the Members’ inspection.” Instead, the agent who had moments earlier said he was going to arrest Baraka took a phone call, then again said he would arrest the mayor.
“Even though he stepped out, I am going to put him in cuffs . . . per the deputy attorney general of the United States,” the agent said, according to McIver’s filings.
This is the first allegation that the order to arrest Baraka came from high-level officials with the Trump administration, and not from agents at Delaney Hall.
It’s at this moment, both sides agree, that chaos erupted.

Now outside the gate, federal agents again attempted to handcuff Baraka, according to the indictment, which says McIver “hurried” toward the agents as others yelled to “circle the mayor.” Once she was near Baraka, the indictment claims, she “slammed her forearm into the body of” one of the agents, reached out, and “tried to restrain” him by “forcibly grabbing him.”
According to McIver, when she, Menendez, and Watson Coleman saw Baraka getting arrested, they moved to the public side of the gate along with a phalanx of heavily armed and masked federal agents. She claims an unidentified man yelled out for others to “circle the mayor,” and the members of Congress and others did just that. Federal agents and protestors pushed toward the members of Congress, “destabilizing the group,” McIver’s filings say.
“The members repeatedly asserted their federal status and instructed the agents not to touch them,” one says. “Agents nevertheless pressed in on the members as the crowd formed more tightly around them.”
The indictment claims that after Baraka was arrested, McIver used “each of her forearms to forcibly strike” an agent.
McIver’s filings say video shows any contact between McIver and agents happened after an ICE agent shoved a man from behind, forcing him into the members of Congress and “sending a torrent of jostling through the crowd.” McIver’s actions were a defensive reaction to that force, her lawyers say.
McIver’s filings say an agent “forcefully shoved her backwards” as she returned inside the secured area following Baraka’s arrest. She said that force was “so egregious” she immediately said she wanted to file a complaint.
After the mayor was taken into custody, the scene calmed down, and the three House members were finally given their tour of Delaney Hall, McIver’s filing states.
The Department of Homeland Security soon after this episode posted some video footage of the scuffle on social media, slowed down to highlight McIver’s actions. McIver in her new filings says these social media posts harm her ability to have a fair trial.
“Congresswoman McIver’s contact with agents was a reactive, proportional response to what the government has apparently conceded to be a baseless, pretextual and clearly unlawful arrest in chaotic circumstances that federal agents themselves instigated,” her attorneys wrote.
Federal prosecutors dropped the trespassing charge against Baraka just days after his arrest, leading to a rebuke from the judge overseeing the case. Baraka is suing the federal government for malicious prosecution and false imprisonment.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)Summer heat is bearing down on U.S. prisons, where temperatures in uncooled cells can climb well into the triple digits.
Facing growing pressure from advocacy groups, lawsuits and climate projections that show hotter days ahead, some state prison systems are moving to install air conditioning and expand cooling measures — though many facilities remain years away from significant upgrades.
But in other states, such efforts have stalled or failed. That may lead to more lawsuits in the future, experts say, even as judges may raise the bar for such cases.
An emphasis on being “tough on crime” and prioritizing other public safety measures may have contributed to less attention on prison conditions in some states. In others, slowing revenue growth and pressure to rein in corrections spending could be making new investments a harder sell.
At least two states this year, Virginia and Texas, considered legislation addressing excessive heat in prisons but neither measure became law. The Texas bill would have required the state Department of Criminal Justice to purchase and install climate control systems in all of its facilities by the end of 2032. About two-thirds of the state’s correctional facilities have only partial or no air conditioning.
The measure passed the House but did not advance in the Senate before the legislature adjourned in June.
In Virginia, lawmakers approved a bill that would have required the state corrections department to install heat and air conditioning in its prisons and to ensure cell temperatures not exceed 80 degrees. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed it, citing the cost of installation and operational burdens. Youngkin also wrote that existing state corrections data “does not substantiate the claims of extreme temperatures or health risks.”
But in Delaware, the fiscal year 2026 capital budget approved last month includes $2 million in funding to install air conditioning at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center.
These changes mark the latest actions in a long-running debate over how correctional systems respond to rising summer temperatures — an issue that affects both incarcerated people and staff. Some of the policy debates and facility updates this year follow years of advocacy and litigation over the health, safety and operational challenges posed by heat in correctional settings.
The problem of excessive heat in prisons has persisted for decades and has unfolded alongside other challenges, including chronic understaffing and overcrowding. In some cases, these problems have led to extended facility lockdowns, even during the summer months.
“There are people working in prisons and they have the right to work in climates that are comfortable,” said Nancy La Vigne, a criminal justice researcher and dean of the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University. “When they’re not, there’s retention issues, and it’s hard to replace staff. And when you don’t replace staff, then you have challenges in maintaining the safety and security of the facility.”
In New York, for example, correctional officers staged a three-week strike earlier this year and many didn’t return to work. Some facilities now are operating with 30%-60% fewer guards than needed, resulting in some incarcerated people getting only an hour or two outside of their cells each day.
A 2023 study published in the peer-reviewed PLOS One journal found that mortality in state and private prisons rose during periods of extreme heat, with deaths increasing 3.5% on extreme heat days and up to 7.4% during three-day heat waves. Between 2001 and 2019, nearly 13,000 people died in prison during the summer months, almost half of them in the South, though the study did not determine how many of those deaths were directly attributable to heat.
Climate change is fueling longer, more intense periods of extreme heat. Exposure to extreme heat can worsen conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and asthma, and has also been linked to worsening mental health and higher suicide rates among incarcerated people.
“Average temperatures are rising, and you’re going to have more and more states around the country where incarcerated people are held in conditions that are not livable because they’re too hot,” said Sharon Dolovich, a law professor and director of the Prison Law and Policy Program at the University of California, Los Angeles.
 Some upgrades

At least 44 states lack universal air conditioning within their prison facilities, even in regions known for sweltering summer temperatures, according to a 2022 USA Today analysis. A recent Reuters investigation also found that nearly half of state prisons across 29 states have partial or no air conditioning in housing units.
But some states are investing millions to update their prison facilities.
In North Carolina, corrections officials are working toward their goal of installing air conditioning in all 54 state prisons by 2026. To date, 33 facilities are fully air-conditioned, 17 are partially air-conditioned, and four have no air conditioning, according to its dashboard.
In California, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, which operates 31 adult prisons, has spent $246 million in the past five years on cooling improvements at five prisons, according to a department spokesperson.
Lawmakers this year also approved funding for the Air Cooling Pilot Program at three facilities, with $17.6 million allocated for fiscal years 2025-26 and $20 million for fiscal years 2026-27. It will evaluate the effectiveness of two alternatives prior to a statewide plan to address high indoor temperatures across the California prison system.

The Texas Department of Criminal Justice, as of Aug. 1, is building 12,827 “cool beds,” or prison cells in air-conditioned units, and is in the process of procuring an additional 7,162, according to its dashboard.
Texas is one of the states most closely associated with heat-related deaths in prison. A 2022 study estimated that, on average, 14 deaths per year in Texas prisons are associated with heat. And a Texas Tribune analysis found that at least 41 incarcerated people died during a record-breaking heat wave in 2023.
In March, a federal judge ruled the extreme heat in Texas prisons is “plainly unconstitutional,” but declined to order immediate air conditioning, saying the work could not be completed within the court order’s 90-day window and temporary systems might delay a permanent fix.
 ‘More miserable’

Sweltering summer heat can turn prisons into pressure cookers. People inside already may have health conditions, limited access to cooling, or take medications that make it harder for their bodies to handle the heat. And research suggests that high temperatures can heighten irritability and aggression, sometimes fueling more conflicts between incarcerated people or with staff.
“It makes you more miserable. … If you to the point of even thinking about suicide, that’s just going to add to it,” said Ronald McKeithen, who spent 37 years incarcerated in Alabama prisons and is now the director of second chances at the Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice. McKeithen recalls feeling “on edge” due to tension among other incarcerated people on hot days.
At the Oshkosh Correctional Institution in Wisconsin, Devin Skrzypchak said the heat worsens his bladder condition, and he often can’t get the incontinence briefs he needs. The heat forces him to drink more water, and on days when ice isn’t available, he’s left drenched in sweat.
“At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating,” Skrzypchak wrote in a message to Stateline through the facility’s messaging platform.
D’Angelo Lee Komanekin — who has spent about 25 years in and out of different Wisconsin corrections facilities — said prison architecture plays a major role in why temperatures inside climb so high.
“The planet is getting hotter and hotter,” said Komanekin, who relies on a small plastic fan to stay cool. Komanekin also is incarcerated at the Oshkosh Correctional Institution. “They’re doing nothing about the architecture. Some institutions’ windows open, some don’t, but most of the doors have steel doors with trap doors.”
Older prison designs that rely heavily on steel and concrete building materials often trap heat, making it difficult to keep temperatures down in the summer. Aging facilities also are less likely to be equipped for the installation of central air conditioning.
Some state prison systems, including Alabama’s and Wisconsin’s, are adding air-conditioning or air-tempering systems to new prison construction and major renovation projects.
 Future legal battles

Legal experts say the issue of excessive heat in prisons is likely to become more pressing as climate change drives longer and hotter summers.
Extreme heat in correctional facilities has already been the subject of litigation in dozens of states, with plaintiffs arguing that high temperatures constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Court rulings in these cases have varied, but some experts say even more lawsuits are likely if facilities do not adapt.
“The conditions are going to worsen. [Incarcerated people are] going to be looking for every possible avenue for assistance they can,” Dolovich, the UCLA law professor, told Stateline.

One of the latest cases comes from Missouri, where the nonprofit law firm MacArthur Justice Center filed a class-action lawsuit in May on behalf of six incarcerated people at Algoa Correctional Center.
The lawsuit alleges that the conditions violate their constitutional rights under the Eighth Amendment. It seeks to require the Missouri Department of Corrections to work with experts to develop a heat mitigation plan that keeps housing unit temperatures between 65 and 85 degrees. If the department cannot meet that standard, the plaintiffs are asking for the release of three of the incarcerated people who have less than a year remaining on their sentences.
Lawsuits such as the Missouri case often focus on claims that extreme heat worsens existing medical problems. To proceed, they must meet two legal requirements: proving the heat poses a serious health or safety risk, and showing prison officials knew about the danger but failed to address it, according to Dolovich, whose work has focused on the Eighth Amendment and prison conditions.
Courts may also raise the bar for proving such claims if judges echo decisions in cases with similar Eight Amendment arguments related to the death penalty and homelessness, Dolovich said. Judges have shifted, she said, toward a “superadding terror, pain and disgrace” standard under the Eighth Amendment — a higher threshold requiring proof that conditions were created with the intent to cause unnecessary suffering.
Dolovich added that some recent court decisions have provided only narrow remedies, such as ordering ice and fans instead of installing air conditioning.
“Prison officials have a moral and a constitutional responsibility to respond to changing conditions. In this case, it means air conditioning. … Anything less than that, to me, is indefensible.” she said.

Gabe Vasquez met with Albuquerque Police Chief Harold Medina on Aug. 20, 2025 at the Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Office headquarters in Albuquerque. (Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)In a wide-ranging conversation on Wednesday with police leaders from central New Mexico about local public safety issues, U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.) said he wants to make it a federal crime to not safely store firearms around children and wants to regulate social media use that encourages violence. 
Vasquez also discussed his efforts to boost funding for local law enforcement needs versus immigration enforcement. 
At the Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Office headquarters in downtown Albuquerque, law enforcement officials raised their own concerns regarding local public safety issues.
For instance, Albuquerque Police Chief Harold Medina told Vasquez the area’s biggest problem is providing treatment to unhoused people for substance use disorders and other mental health diagnoses, and suggested he find more funding for the city of Albuquerque and Bernalillo County’s existing mental health facilities.
He also said the problem won’t improve until local courts can process more of the cases against the people police arrest. He said “all they could ever process” would be approximately a quarter of all arrests in the county.
“They can’t be prosecuted,” Medina said. “And it’s unfortunate: The most likely cases that are going to be dumped are involving individuals with mental health concerns or substance abuse problems.”
In Valencia County south of Albuquerque, officers are seeing a lot of unhoused New Mexicans who are dealing with behavioral health and substance use disorders coming from across the state and exiting off the Rail Runner commuter line’s last stop in Belen, according to Belen Interim Police Chief Adam Keck.
“There’s nothing really they’re doing,” Keck told Vasquez. “Maybe yelling and going crazy but they’re not really disturbing or committing a crime at all.”
Bernalillo County Sheriff John Allen and New Mexico State Police Chief Troy Weisler repeatedly brought up crime  they say young people are committing using firearms and driving getaway vehicles on behalf of criminal gangs.
Vasquez asked where young people are obtaining guns, and Medina said both children and adults are stealing guns from vehicles and selling them on social media platforms. Weisler said the guns are sold on Telegram.
At the same time, Medina said most of the stolen guns’ owners are not reporting when the thefts happen.
Vasquez said he supports federal legislation called Ethan’s Law that would set standards for safe gun storage and give states incentives to create and implement safe gun storage laws. New Mexico in 2023 made it a misdemeanor to negligently allow a minor to access a firearm that they then use to harm themselves or others.
“It’s your duty and responsibility to report a stolen firearm because you know that it’s probably going to be used in a crime,” Vasquez said. “Nobody steals your .22 to go rabbit hunting.”
The congressman told attendees his staff will look into regulating social media use that promotes criminal activity on services like Telegram and Signal.

Vasquez also said Wednesday he wants to put “parameters” on the $170 billion allocated in the “big beautiful bill” for President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, including nearly $30 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Vasquez said Congress gave the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, “a blank check,” and he is working on legislation, which he has not introduced yet, that would place limits on how the agency spends the money.
“We’re going to advocate that it be used for public safety at the local level,” he said.
Asked for more detail about the future legislation, Communications Director Delaney Wehn would only tell Source that Vasquez’s office has “big news set to drop next Monday.”
“I can’t share what it is yet but it’s national news,” Wehn said in a text message.
Medina referenced the possibility of the federal government withholding funding from Albuquerque, which was singled out earlier this month by the U.S. Department of Justice as New Mexico’s sole so-called “sanctuary” jurisdiction. U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said the federal government would bring litigation and other penalties against cities, states and other jurisdictions with such policies.
“We will have grant funding withheld from us,” Medina said. “It will get tied up in the courts, and eventually it will work its way to where I’m confident we’ll get it but in the interim, we’re going to lose funding that we use each and every year to assist our officers.”

“Based on Appellants’ factual allegations, Appellants cannot be considered relevantly similar to either felons or dangerous individuals based solely on their medical marijuana use,” a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit said late Wednesday.
“Accordingly, the Federal Government has failed, at the motion to dismiss stage, to establish that disarming Appellants is consistent with this Nation’s history and tradition of firearm regulation.”
The case involved two Florida medical marijuana users who wished to purchase guns and one gun owner who wanted to participate in the state’s medical marijuana program. Along with then-Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Nikki Fried, they filed a lawsuit in the Northern District of Florida in 2022 challenging the federal ban.
“Under my leadership, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services made gun licensing safer and more efficient, while also ending the NRA’s influence over the office,” Fried said in a press release issued Thursday by the Florida Democratic Party, which she now chairs.
“Unfortunately, under Republican leadership, FDACS has pushed to unwind my reforms, abandoned this case against the federal government, and deserted the veterans and Floridians it sought to protect.”
Cannabis activists call it a a clear victory.
“This is a monumental win for medical marijuana patients, who have long been caught in the crossfire of outdated federal policies. This decision sends a clear message that medical marijuana use should not strip away fundamental rights,” said Jodi James, president of the Florida Cannabis Action Network, in a written statement.
The U.S. Department of Justice could appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. A spokesperson for the department said they had no comment.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)Summer heat is bearing down on U.S. prisons, where temperatures in uncooled cells can climb well into the triple digits.
Facing growing pressure from advocacy groups, lawsuits and climate projections that show hotter days ahead, some state prison systems are moving to install air conditioning and expand cooling measures — though many facilities remain years away from significant upgrades.
But in other states, such efforts have stalled or failed. That may lead to more lawsuits in the future, experts say, even as judges may raise the bar for such cases.
An emphasis on being “tough on crime” and prioritizing other public safety measures may have contributed to less attention on prison conditions in some states. In others, slowing revenue growth and pressure to rein in corrections spending could be making new investments a harder sell.
At least two states this year, Virginia and Texas, considered legislation addressing excessive heat in prisons but neither measure became law. The Texas bill would have required the state Department of Criminal Justice to purchase and install climate control systems in all of its facilities by the end of 2032. About two-thirds of the state’s correctional facilities have only partial or no air conditioning.
The measure passed the House but did not advance in the Senate before the legislature adjourned in June.
In Virginia, lawmakers approved a bill that would have required the state corrections department to install heat and air conditioning in its prisons and to ensure cell temperatures not exceed 80 degrees. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed it, citing the cost of installation and operational burdens. Youngkin also wrote that existing state corrections data “does not substantiate the claims of extreme temperatures or health risks.”
But in Delaware, the fiscal year 2026 capital budget approved last month includes $2 million in funding to install air conditioning at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center.
These changes mark the latest actions in a long-running debate over how correctional systems respond to rising summer temperatures — an issue that affects both incarcerated people and staff. Some of the policy debates and facility updates this year follow years of advocacy and litigation over the health, safety and operational challenges posed by heat in correctional settings.
The problem of excessive heat in prisons has persisted for decades and has unfolded alongside other challenges, including chronic understaffing and overcrowding. In some cases, these problems have led to extended facility lockdowns, even during the summer months.
“There are people working in prisons and they have the right to work in climates that are comfortable,” said Nancy La Vigne, a criminal justice researcher and dean of the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University. “When they’re not, there’s retention issues, and it’s hard to replace staff. And when you don’t replace staff, then you have challenges in maintaining the safety and security of the facility.”
In New York, for example, correctional officers staged a three-week strike earlier this year and many didn’t return to work. Some facilities now are operating with 30%-60% fewer guards than needed, resulting in some incarcerated people getting only an hour or two outside of their cells each day.
A 2023 study published in the peer-reviewed PLOS One journal found that mortality in state and private prisons rose during periods of extreme heat, with deaths increasing 3.5% on extreme heat days and up to 7.4% during three-day heat waves. Between 2001 and 2019, nearly 13,000 people died in prison during the summer months, almost half of them in the South, though the study did not determine how many of those deaths were directly attributable to heat.
Climate change is fueling longer, more intense periods of extreme heat. Exposure to extreme heat can worsen conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and asthma, and has also been linked to worsening mental health and higher suicide rates among incarcerated people.
“Average temperatures are rising, and you’re going to have more and more states around the country where incarcerated people are held in conditions that are not livable because they’re too hot,” said Sharon Dolovich, a law professor and director of the Prison Law and Policy Program at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Some upgrades
At least 44 states lack universal air conditioning within their prison facilities, even in regions known for sweltering summer temperatures, according to a 2022 USA Today analysis. A recent Reuters investigation also found that nearly half of state prisons across 29 states have partial or no air conditioning in housing units.
But some states are investing millions to update their prison facilities.
In North Carolina, corrections officials are working toward their goal of installing air conditioning in all 54 state prisons by 2026. To date, 33 facilities are fully air-conditioned, 17 are partially air-conditioned, and four have no air conditioning, according to its dashboard.
In California, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, which operates 31 adult prisons, has spent $246 million in the past five years on cooling improvements at five prisons, according to a department spokesperson.
Lawmakers this year also approved funding for the Air Cooling Pilot Program at three facilities, with $17.6 million allocated for fiscal years 2025-26 and $20 million for fiscal years 2026-27. It will evaluate the effectiveness of two alternatives prior to a statewide plan to address high indoor temperatures across the California prison system.
The Texas Department of Criminal Justice, as of Aug. 1, is building 12,827 “cool beds,” or prison cells in air-conditioned units, and is in the process of procuring an additional 7,162, according to its dashboard.
Texas is one of the states most closely associated with heat-related deaths in prison. A 2022 study estimated that, on average, 14 deaths per year in Texas prisons are associated with heat. And a Texas Tribune analysis found that at least 41 incarcerated people died during a record-breaking heat wave in 2023.
In March, a federal judge ruled the extreme heat in Texas prisons is “plainly unconstitutional,” but declined to order immediate air conditioning, saying the work could not be completed within the court order’s 90-day window and temporary systems might delay a permanent fix.
‘More miserable’
Sweltering summer heat can turn prisons into pressure cookers. People inside already may have health conditions, limited access to cooling, or take medications that make it harder for their bodies to handle the heat. And research suggests that high temperatures can heighten irritability and aggression, sometimes fueling more conflicts between incarcerated people or with staff.
“It makes you more miserable. … If you to the point of even thinking about suicide, that’s just going to add to it,” said Ronald McKeithen, who spent 37 years incarcerated in Alabama prisons and is now the director of second chances at the Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice. McKeithen recalls feeling “on edge” due to tension among other incarcerated people on hot days.
At the Oshkosh Correctional Institution in Wisconsin, Devin Skrzypchak said the heat worsens his bladder condition, and he often can’t get the incontinence briefs he needs. The heat forces him to drink more water, and on days when ice isn’t available, he’s left drenched in sweat.
“At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating,” Skrzypchak wrote in a message to Stateline through the facility’s messaging platform.




At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating.


– Devin Skrzypchak, who is incarcerated at Oshkosh Correctional Institution in Wisconsin



D’Angelo Lee Komanekin — who has spent about 25 years in and out of different Wisconsin corrections facilities — said prison architecture plays a major role in why temperatures inside climb so high.
“The planet is getting hotter and hotter,” said Komanekin, who relies on a small plastic fan to stay cool. Komanekin also is incarcerated at the Oshkosh Correctional Institution. “They’re doing nothing about the architecture. Some institutions’ windows open, some don’t, but most of the doors have steel doors with trap doors.”
Older prison designs that rely heavily on steel and concrete building materials often trap heat, making it difficult to keep temperatures down in the summer. Aging facilities also are less likely to be equipped for the installation of central air conditioning.
Some state prison systems, including Alabama’s and Wisconsin’s, are adding air-conditioning or air-tempering systems to new prison construction and major renovation projects.
Future legal battles
Legal experts say the issue of excessive heat in prisons is likely to become more pressing as climate change drives longer and hotter summers.
Extreme heat in correctional facilities has already been the subject of litigation in dozens of states, with plaintiffs arguing that high temperatures constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Court rulings in these cases have varied, but some experts say even more lawsuits are likely if facilities do not adapt.
“The conditions are going to worsen. [Incarcerated people are] going to be looking for every possible avenue for assistance they can,” Dolovich, the UCLA law professor, told Stateline.
One of the latest cases comes from Missouri, where the nonprofit law firm MacArthur Justice Center filed a class-action lawsuit in May on behalf of six incarcerated people at Algoa Correctional Center.
The lawsuit alleges that the conditions violate their constitutional rights under the Eighth Amendment. It seeks to require the Missouri Department of Corrections to work with experts to develop a heat mitigation plan that keeps housing unit temperatures between 65 and 85 degrees. If the department cannot meet that standard, the plaintiffs are asking for the release of three of the incarcerated people who have less than a year remaining on their sentences.
Lawsuits such as the Missouri case often focus on claims that extreme heat worsens existing medical problems. To proceed, they must meet two legal requirements: proving the heat poses a serious health or safety risk, and showing prison officials knew about the danger but failed to address it, according to Dolovich, whose work has focused on the Eighth Amendment and prison conditions.
Courts may also raise the bar for proving such claims if judges echo decisions in cases with similar Eight Amendment arguments related to the death penalty and homelessness, Dolovich said. Judges have shifted, she said, toward a “superadding terror, pain and disgrace” standard under the Eighth Amendment — a higher threshold requiring proof that conditions were created with the intent to cause unnecessary suffering.
Dolovich added that some recent court decisions have provided only narrow remedies, such as ordering ice and fans instead of installing air conditioning.
“Prison officials have a moral and a constitutional responsibility to respond to changing conditions. In this case, it means air conditioning. … Anything less than that, to me, is indefensible.” she said.

,DC,2025-08-21 18:28:55+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Trump issued an order targeting homeless people. In D.C., he’s giving it a test run.",Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-issued-order-targeting-homeless-people-dc-hes-giving-it-test-run,,"WASHINGTON — Officials have already cleared dozens of homeless encampments in the District of Columbia in recent days as President Donald Trump’s federal takeover of the nation’s capital for a “crime emergency” at the same time takes aim at people without housing.Advocates working to end homelessness within the district and across the country raised alarm to States Newsroom over these removals and their impact on people without housing and the providers trying to serve them. The drive to push out homeless people came after Trump in July signed an executive order that attempts to overhaul federal policy on homelessness, declaring: “Endemic vagrancy, disorderly behavior, sudden confrontations, and violent attacks have made our cities unsafe.”Multi-agency teams had eliminated 48 encampments in the District of Columbia as of Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at a briefing. Metropolitan Police Department patrol units “are actively working with city officials to locate and clear additional encampments and remove homeless residents off of Washington’s streets,” she said.Leavitt told reporters days prior that homeless people in the city would be “given the option to leave their encampment, to be taken to a homeless shelter, to be offered addiction or mental health services,” and would be “susceptible” to fines or jail time if they refused.A day before Trump declared his “crime emergency” in Washington, D.C., on Aug. 11, the president wrote on social media that homeless people must move out “IMMEDIATELY.”“We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital,” he wrote. Days later, bulldozers and garbage trucks were at work dismantling campsites.According to WTOP News last week, leaders in the surrounding area of Montgomery County, Maryland, were preparing for a potential rise of homeless people in the county as a result of the president’s crackdown.An annual point-in-time count released in May from the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments saw 5,138 people experiencing homelessness in the district on one night in 2025 — a 9% decrease compared to 2024.Homeless people’s belongings tossedJesse Rabinowitz, campaign and communications director at the National Homelessness Law Center, said “things seem so fluid and so chaotic that it’s hard to get an accurate representation” of where Trump’s campaign to get homeless people out of sight stands.Rabinowitz said last week he witnessed the tossing of people’s belongings and the evictions of people experiencing homelessness, noting that “it was fast, it was chaotic, it was expensive, and it didn’t help anybody.”“We know that clearing encampments makes it harder for people to get into housing,” he added. “People’s IDs that they need to get into housing are destroyed, people’s medications that they need to stay healthy are thrown away, people’s bikes that they need to get to work are often trashed.”Ann Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said the practice and policy of fining, ticketing and arresting people rather than creating housing and services for them is “devastating” — both to people experiencing homelessness and the providers who serve them.Oliva said outreach workers can lose track of people that they’ve been working with for a long time, destroying trust between the two.“That’s some of what I’ve seen over the last week here — as providers are trying to keep people as safe as possible, it’s getting harder to track them down to make sure that they can provide the services that are necessary for folks.”Street outreach teams at workLara Pukatch, chief advocacy officer at Miriam’s Kitchen, said the organization, which works to end chronic homelessness in Washington, D.C., is “deeply concerned about what’s happening.”Pukatch said the group’s street outreach teams “have really been working almost around the clock to address what’s going on,” including sharing information with people living outside when they hear about threats of encampment evictions to make sure they know what’s happening and the options they have.“This also involves working nights, working weekends, connecting people to the life-saving supplies and supports that they’ve always needed, but in addition, really working hard with people to make sure that they’re safe and that they are not going to be further harmed or traumatized by what’s happening in the city.”July executive orderTrump’s federal takeover in Washington, D.C., and the encampment clearings build off of the sweeping July executive order he signed.The order says it aims to end federal support for “Housing First” policies that “deprioritize accountability and fail to promote treatment, recovery, and self-sufficiency.” The “Housing First” model focuses on providing immediate housing, with services offered afterward.The order also calls on Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner to ensure that programs receiving federal housing and homelessness assistance require people with “substance use disorder or serious mental illness” obtain treatment or mental health services in order to participate.Part of the order also encourages involuntary civil commitment expansion, where individuals with mental health conditions are placed into treatment facilities against their wishes.Administration officials who say they are fighting crime in the district have also emphasized actions of homeless people. Vice President JD Vance, talking to National Guard troops at Union Station on Wednesday with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, said when he visited the transit center with his children two years ago, they were “screamed at by violent vagrants and it was scaring the hell out of my kids.” Now, he said, “DC is already safer than it was nine days ago. We’re going to make it safer still to come. This is your city. You should feel free to come and visit here, have a meal, see all these incredible monuments, and actually enjoy yourself.”Supreme Court decisionOliva, of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, noted that while the events of the past week are “certainly alarming,” they mark a broader trend that has gained steam, beginning with the 2024 Supreme Court decision that allowed cities to punish homeless people for sleeping outdoors, even where there is no shelter available to them.“What we’ve seen since President Trump came into office is a series of policies put in place — or attempted to put in place — through executive orders that really don’t do anything to address the root causes of homelessness because we know that homelessness itself is not actually a criminal issue, it’s an economic issue,” she said.Though the president’s federal takeover has a 30-day limit, Trump wants an extension, leading to questions about how long these actions will continue.",,,,2025-08-21 15:57:34.112030
,California,2025-08-21 18:05:31+00:00,CalMatters,California lawmakers are voting on Gavin Newsom’s gerrymandering plan. Here’s the latest,Maya C. Miller and Jeanne Kuang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/08/california-redistricting-vote/,"Many California Democrats are reluctant to give up the state's independently drawn congressional districts, but they say it's a necessary step to counter gerrymanders in Republican states.","In summary
Many California Democrats are reluctant to give up the state’s independently drawn congressional districts, but they say it’s a necessary step to counter gerrymanders in Republican states.




California lawmakers today are expected to greenlight Gov. Gavin Newsom’s plan to ask voters to gerrymander the state’s congressional districts, solidifying the governor’s response to President Donald Trump’s effort to get more GOP seats out of Texas a day after that state passed its own new maps. 
The constitutional amendment that voters will see on their Nov. 4 ballots passed the Assembly and awaits a vote in the Senate. It asks voters to suspend the state’s existing congressional districts, which were drawn by an independent commission, and replace them with a map intended to favor Democrats.
The Assembly passed the measure 57 to 20, and lawmakers on the floor erupted in applause even before they closed the vote.
“We will not let our political system be hijacked by authoritarianism. And today, we give every California the power to say no,” said Speaker Robert Rivas, Democrat of Hollister, on the Assembly floor shortly before the vote. “To say no to Donald Trump’s power grab and yes to our people, to our state and to our democracy.”
California voters in a 2010 ballot measure backed independent redistricting, a process meant to cultivate fair, competitive elections. Democrats say they’re reluctant to give up that system, even temporarily, but believe they have to in order to counter Trump’s bid to retain control of Congress after 2026. 
“If unaddressed, Texas’ actions – which occur without the vote of the populace – will disenfranchise California,” said Assemblymember Josh Lowenthal, a Long Beach Democrat whose father had pushed for nonpartisan redistricting as a state lawmaker and Congressman.
“It’s imperative that Californians have a voice in selecting the political party that controls Congress in 2026,” said Lowenthal in an emotional speech from the floor before the vote. “So today, I proudly join with my father, the architect of this commission, in urging its temporary suspension.”
Republicans before the vote pleaded with their colleagues to resist following Texas in the race to the gerrymandering bottom.
“There’s really only one way to stop – someone has to refrain from striking back, and show a better way,” said Assemblymember James Gallagher, Republican of Chico and the minority leader. 
Lawmakers still need to approve two additional bills that will facilitate and fund the special election, as well as a bill containing the new congressional map voters will be asked to approve. Those measures are set to pass before the Legislature adjourns for the week, and Newsom is expected to sign them today.
The change is intended to be temporary; the measure that will go before voters requires the state to return to nonpartisan map-drawing after the 2030 Census. 
Newsom kicked off the special election scramble after Trump declared that he was “entitled” to five more GOP congressional seats in Texas. He demanded that Lone Star State lawmakers shore up Republicans’ razor thin, three-seat House majority by redrawing their congressional maps mid-decade. When Gov. Greg Abbott indicated Texas would redistrict, Newsom said California would retaliate. 
Democrats today hold 43 of the state’s 52 congressional seats. The Newsom-backed maps transform five Republican seats into districts that heavily favor Democrats. By ousting those incumbents, Newsom would effectively essentially cancel out Trump’s effort in Texas. The maps also strengthen Democrats’ hold on three other competitive California districts, making it harder for the GOP to flip them next year.

California Republican lawmakers spent the week throwing up a variety of procedural blocks to try to stop the bills’ fast-tracked progress through the legislature, including by asking the California Supreme Court to weigh in on their challenge to the short time between the legislation’s public release on Monday and their final vote on the Assembly and Senate floors on Thursday. 
They demanded an end to the redistricting arms race nationwide, with some willing to condemn Texas and other red states that Trump has urged to redraw their maps. 
But their efforts ran up against both political numbers and longtime legislative practice in California. 
Polling shows most Democratic voters want the party to do more to fight the Trump administration. In the past few weeks, Democratic lawmakers, who command a nearly three-quarters supermajority in both chambers, have overwhelmingly fallen in line behind Newsom on the redistricting effort.  
Every year, lawmakers regularly reveal last-minute deals that they fast-track for passage 72 hours later, in a way that nominally complies with state constitutional requirements. 
The timing of the votes may be litigated, but California Republicans have already lost in court once. The state Supreme Court on Wednesday night declined to take up the GOP’s timing-based challenge to the map-drawing effort. 
GOP lawmakers acknowledged they’ll likely have to fight the issue at the polls. 
“We will defeat this, if it’s not here in the Capitol, it will be in a courtroom or it will be at the ballot box,” Assemblymember Alexandra Macedo said this week.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/082125-Redsitricting-Vote-Assm-FG-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-21 15:57:34.112030

For educators, there’s something about this back-to-school season that feels familiar.
It’s “the amount of information that’s coming to you all at once,” said Jeremy Vidito, chief financial officer for the Detroit schools. On a recent webinar, he laid out a litany of hardships, including figuring out “what’s true, what’s not. Emergency orders. Budget cuts.”
Leaders felt similar uncertainty in the fall of 2020, when the pandemic forced them to scramble to educate, feed and transport students. But this time, as 47 million students return to school in the coming weeks, the source of the unease is the federal government. The Trump administration has already frozen and unfrozen education funds, and seeks to further reduce school spending. Vidito said he’s urging principals in his district to stay calm, but “a lot of the stuff, we can’t control.”
As Education Secretary Linda McMahon travels to schools across the country to spread her gospel of returning control to the states, leaders say they’re hoping for something simpler: a return to normalcy.
“What is the next freeze, or what is the next issue that the administration may have with some of the funding that school districts get?” asked Mark Sullivan, superintendent of the Birmingham, Alabama, schools.
At a meeting with governors last month, McMahon offered “no guarantees” that she could prevent the kinds of “communication gaps” that led to previous dustups. Her comments came the same day that the Office for Management and Budget completed its unexpected review of several annual grant programs for schools. Officials said their initial inspection turned up expenditures at odds with Trump’s agenda — offering up, without elaboration, the use of school improvement funds on “a seminar on ‘queer resistance in the arts.’ ”
But after seven months with Trump in office, some district leaders have grown cynical.
David Law, superintendent of the Minnetonka Public Schools in Minnesota, doubts there ever was a thorough analysis and suggested that the few examples cited were meant as a warning.
“I think the pause was intended to let people know, ‘We don’t like these things, so if you’re doing them, you should be worried,’ ” he said. As they try to prepare for additional shocks to their budget, leaders nationwide, he said, are adjusting to the pendulum swing over diversity, equity and inclusion.
Under the Biden administration, “we were trying to prove we were caring about kids enough,” he said. “Now we’re trying to prove that we’re not meeting the definition of indoctrination. It’s a bit of a wild ride.”

 ‘Safe to speak’

For now, Congress has rejected Trump’s proposed cuts to K-12 funding. But OMB has still floated the possibility of a rescission package that would claw back unspent education funds from the current budget before the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. Congress’ watchdog agency says that if the administration doesn’t give Congress ample time to approve or reject the cuts, the move would violate the law.
In a CBS interview, McMahon said funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act will flow with or without the Department of Education.
But reports that the administration might cut some special education grants already awarded for research, technology, and teacher and parent training alarm district-level staff.
“A reduction in this funding will create challenges for districts and could lead to the need to re-evaluate essential programs that help to support students eligible for special education services,” said Jessica Saum, a special education coordinator in the Cabot Public School District, outside Little Rock, Arkansas.
President Donald Trump has said that ensuring schools teach children English is the federal government’s only education-related obligation. But Vidito in Detroit said he’s still bracing for the elimination of funding for English learners.
Federal officials rescinded 2015 guidance stating that districts must take “affirmative steps to ensure” that English learners “can meaningfully participate in their educational programs and services.” The move expands on a July memo from Attorney General Pam Bondi saying that despite the president’s executive order declaring English the official language, the government should “minimize non-essential multilingual services” and focus on assimilation.
The unpredictability of this moment has prompted Merica Clinkenbeard, who directs English learner programs for the Springfield, Missouri, district, to remind teachers that the federal money is supplemental: Teachers are responsible for ensuring students become proficient in English with or without it.


Due to the threat of federal funding cuts, she lost three members of her leadership team.

“They felt like perhaps they would not have jobs in this field ever again,” she said. Now she has two positions she can’t fill. “I was telling my husband, ‘This is just like COVID, like everything I’ve known is going away.’ ”

Districts serving large English learner and immigrant populations are more cautious than most as students return this fall, especially after Immigration Customs and Enforcement officials detained an 18-year-old Los Angeles student last week while he was walking his dog. Officials said he had overstayed his visa by two years.
The fear of ICE raids has prompted more parents to ask about remote learning, said Sharon Balmer Cartagena, an attorney with Public Counsel, a nonprofit public interest law firm. She’s been holding “family preparedness” workshops for southern California districts, encouraging them to update emergency contact information in case a parent is deported.
Los Angeles Unified is one district trying to prevent ICE raids by stationing volunteers, staff and campus police around school zones. But she expects enforcement actions to ramp up with the start of the school year. Even so, she encourages parents to send their children to school in person.
“We saw what happened during COVID with younger kids learning remotely,” she said. Students in the early grades didn’t learn as well as they would have in a classroom and experienced both academic, social and behavioral setbacks, studies show. Now, many of those students are in middle and high school.
“To have that hit them again would be really detrimental,” Cartagena said. “Some of them are just starting to catch up.”



 ‘Doing it right’



Not all education leaders are dreading the next announcement from Washington. Louisiana Superintendent Cade Brumley welcomed McMahon to Baton Rouge Aug. 11, where she celebrated the state’s rising performance in reading. On the last National Assessment of Educational Progress, the state scored above the national average after trailing the rest of the country for years.
McMahon also hit Arkansas, Tennessee and Florida last week, three more states that embrace the Trump administration’s plans to reduce federal education oversight. Since her confirmation, she has limited most of her school visits to charter and private schools, to emphasize the administration’s focus on expanding choice. But this tour is giving her more exposure to traditional district schools.
“Louisiana is doing it right — and they don’t need the federal bureaucracy to make it happen,” McMahon posted on X after her visit to Jefferson Terrace Academy in East Baton Rouge.
But the state did need federal money, specifically the COVID relief funds, Brumley said during the CBS interview.
“We were able to use those pandemic dollars around the academic efforts that we knew were best for students,” he said. He agrees with McMahon’s position that fewer strings tied to education funding will lead to stronger results. “We’re just really excited about … not having these excessive restrictions and bureaucratic needs surrounding dollars.”


Educators want assurances that the funding their students count on is stable, said Saum, in the Cabot district. Some students with disabilities require significant hands-on help from staff members.

“Parents are following along,” she said “They want to know ‘Is my child going to get what they need to be safe and cared for at school?’ ”
Jessica Saum, an inclusion coordinator for special education in Arkansas’ Cabot Public School District, said because of her title, she has to clearly explain that she works with students who have disabilities. (Courtesy of Jessica Saum)
With the formal title of “inclusion coordinator,” Saum said she has to be clear about her role at a time when the administration is trying to ban DEI-related programs.
“It can be so divisive when people don’t really understand we’re talking about children with disabilities,” she said. Others with similar positions, she said, have changed their titles to emphasize “meaningful access.”
If anything, Law, from the Minnetonka district, said the administration’s “critical lens” on schools have forced leaders to be “crystal clear” about their work. During a recent visit to a nursing home, as part of his efforts to connect with members of the community, he said a resident told him, “You should be teaching all these kids English.”
“ ‘I have great news. The only thing we’re teaching these kids is English,’ ” Law said he told him. “There will always be people that say you don’t need to kowtow to certain populations. I’m still going to say public education is all students getting free education.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/back-to-school-white-house-linda-mcmahon-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-08-21 15:57:34.112030

(Photo by Brent Fuchs/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The list of candidates seeking to lead Oklahoma’s public education system has grown to five, including two former Tulsa Board of Education members and a rural public school leader making his fourth campaign.
Former Tulsa school board members Jennettie Marshall, a Democrat, and Jerry Griffin, an independent, each filed paperwork with the Oklahoma Ethics Commission this month to establish campaigns for the 2026 state superintendent election. This is Griffin’s second run for the post, having initiated a brief campaign as a Republican in 2022 before dropping out of the race.
John Cox, the longtime superintendent of Peggs Public School in rural eastern Oklahoma, is running again as a Republican. He campaigned for state superintendent as a Democrat in 2014 and 2018, losing both times to former state Superintendent Joy Hofmeister, and as a Republican in 2022, finishing third in the GOP primary.
Republican Rob Miller, who recently retired as superintendent of Bixby Public Schools, far outpaces the field in fundraising. He’s raised $128,778 in individual contributions, much of it coming from fellow educators and district administrators, since he became the first candidate to enter the race in February.

Ana Davine Landsaw, a Republican from Tahlequah, has raised the next-highest amount, $1,050. Another GOP candidate, Riley Williams, of Calera, raised $300 before dropping out of the race.
No other candidates have reported receiving any campaign contributions so far.
Oklahoma’s incumbent state superintendent, Ryan Walters, hasn’t announced a campaign for reelection nor for any other office. He is eligible for a second four-year term as superintendent.
Miller, a longtime educator and former Marine, has been highly critical of Walters’ divisive style of politics. He said a cornerstone of his campaign is to restore “pride and respect back to education.”
Entering his 40th year in education, Cox pledged to keep schools safe from indoctrination, inappropriate materials, sexual predators and harmful intruders, according to his campaign platform. 
He said benchmark assessments that gauge students’ progress throughout the school year would better improve academic outcomes than once-a-year state tests. Walters has made a similar proposal to change Oklahoma’s testing model.
Cox said this would leave more time for classroom instruction in the spring months, which schools often dedicate to annual testing.
“I’ve been campaigning on that for several years, and I think (Walters) saw what I was saying that it brings value to the classroom,” Cox said. “It allows teachers to be teachers.”

Cox also pointed to phonics-based reading instruction, also known as the science of reading, and emphasizing parental involvement in schools, particularly to improve growth of students with disabilities, as key points of his campaign.
The race’s lone Democrat, Marshall, intends to “clean up” the Oklahoma State Department of Education and refocus it back on children’s schooling, especially to address “deficits in special education,” according to a campaign flier she shared on social media. She did not immediately return a request for comment from Oklahoma Voice.
Marshall, who has a background as a pastor and funeral director, said she would prioritize teacher retention, accountability of districts, and improving the relationship between public schools and parents.
Griffin, a longtime Republican, decided to run as an independent to focus on solutions rather than political labels, according to a news release he posted to social media. He did not immediately return a request for comment from Oklahoma Voice.
Like Miller, Griffin is a U.S. Marine Corps veteran and former educator. In 2023, Griffin published a reading-centric blueprint for education reform.
“I firmly believe we are positioned to win and to become the first Independent in Oklahoma history to capture a statewide office,” Griffin said in a statement.
Griffin left the Tulsa school board in 2024. Marshall did so in April.
Landsaw did not immediately return a request for comment from Oklahoma Voice for this story. She is still registered with the state Ethics Commission as having an active campaign, but her campaign website and social media accounts have been discontinued.

(Photo by David Dee Delgado/Getty Images)B. said he left Cameroon nine years ago because he was scared for his life. Authorities in the West African nation threw him in prison because of his sexual orientation, he said. After his release, he feared that if he stayed in the country, he would be killed.
B., who is now 39 and who asked that he be identified only by his initial because he still has family in Cameroon, arrived in the United States with practically nothing. Since he was granted asylum last year, he has been able to use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, to help him get by.
But now most refugees and asylees, who entered the country legally, including B., are no longer eligible for food stamps. The change is part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the giant federal domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4.
“I think it’s unfair. I understand that there are some people who abuse the system,” B. told Stateline. “There are also people who are in need. And cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.”
SNAP, which is funded by the federal government but administered by the states, helps families and individuals with lower incomes supplement their grocery budgets. The program serves an average of 42 million people a month.

Supporters of the change note that refugees and asylees can get permits to work, and that they have other sources of support.
“It’s not like they have been dropped off in this country with no support system,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that backs stricter immigration rules.
“They have sponsoring organizations that are helping them get settled and they have work authorization. So they really should be moving forward towards self-sufficiency with support right out of the starting gate. And they should be moving ahead to obtain green cards,” she added, referring to the cards that signify permanent residency.
Vaughan cited a federal grant program that reimburses states and nonprofit organizations for financial aid and health care coverage they provide to refugees.
But critics argue that asylees and refugees, who are extensively vetted and have a legitimate path to citizenship, can wait years for a green card, which entitles them to a wider array of benefits.
They also say community organizations that provide aid to asylees and refugees are stretched thin. Without food stamps, they say, many refugees and their families would not have enough to eat.













Cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.


– B., a Cameroonian asylee





“SNAP is an incredibly fundamental program for this population that comes to the United States, really, with very little, if anything,” said Nicolas Palazzo, a policy counsel at the global humanitarian and refugee advocacy organization HIAS. “These are people who literally had to flee — many times overnight — with nothing, but, you know, a pair of clothes in a backpack.”
Palazzo also said SNAP is not a “handout” to refugees or asylees. Rather, he said, it’s a “smart and moral investment” that protects all communities and strengthens the economy, offering people a foundation for self-sufficiency.
“Stripping critical food assistance forces refugees and asylees into the shadows of informal work, labor exploitation and hunger that weakens our workforce and denigrates our moral obligations,” Palazzo said.
‘Nowhere else to go’
B. said he applied immediately for asylum when he arrived in the U.S. in 2016, but that he had to wait months for a work permit. He survived by doing odd jobs, such as cleaning homes and delivering food, and got by on very little. It wasn’t until late 2024, when he finally won his asylum case, that he was eligible to get any public benefits, including food stamps.
Eligibility for food stamps came at a critical time for B., as a car accident had prevented him from making food deliveries.
“While not having income, it was very helpful,” B. said. “I’m somebody who if I can work, I will work. The only reason I went over there to ask is because I had nowhere else to go.”
According to a November 2024 report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, a total of 60,050 people were newly admitted to the United States as refugees in 2023, many from unstable countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Syria and Afghanistan.
In 2023, the nation received at least 747,000 applications for people seeking asylum from countries including Venezuela, Cuba and Colombia, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration research group. It’s a tremendous increase from the 68,000 applications received in 2013.
The new domestic policy law specifies that food stamps are still available to Cubans and Haitians who might be refugees and asylees.

As of July 2025, more than 2.2 million immigrants in the U.S. are awaiting asylum hearings or decisions after formally applying for asylum, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, an organization at Syracuse University that tracks immigration cases.
“Getting through the system was difficult,” B. said. “I had to find money. I had to find an attorney who would help me apply for my asylum case. The asylum case itself took a long time.
“I still know people who have been here for more than 10 years and never had an interview.”
‘Already stretched’
According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, half of all admitted refugees in 2023 were resettled across just 10 states: Texas, New York, California, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan and Washington.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 41,000 people in the state are getting SNAP benefits while not being lawful permanent residents. She says that group includes refugees and asylees.
“The concerning part there is that these are individuals who were … lawfully admitted to the country, have previously been eligible for SNAP when they need it, and now, simply because of their status, will no longer be able to receive SNAP benefits,” Guinn told Stateline. “There’s nothing we’re going to be able to do to make them eligible.”
Another change under the new law is that for the first time, states will have to pay for a portion of their food stamp programs. States will have to cover between 5% and 15% of their SNAP costs beginning in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they dole out benefits to people eligible for the program.
Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, pointed out that states that want to continue to provide SNAP benefits to refugees and asylees are free to do so — as long as they pay for it.
“If New York state doesn’t want to cut these people off, they can continue to give them something like food stamps. They just have to do it with New York state money right now,” Rector said.

But Guinn said that will be difficult. New York does offer asylum-seekers cash assistance of $180 a month through its Safety Net Assistance Program, but typically recipients must be working.
In Texas, officials at the state’s health and human services agency said that as of last month, roughly 24,600 of the state’s 3.5 million SNAP recipients were refugees or asylees. A spokesperson for Maryland’s human services agency wrote in an email that the state’s SNAP program last year supported more than 10,000 refugees and asylees.
The California Department of Social Services could not provide the number of refugees and asylees receiving food stamps, but projected that a total of 74,000 noncitizens — including lawfully permanent residents, refugees and asylees — would lose eligibility under the new law.
Sherri Laigle, the director of social services at HIAS, said food banks will not be able to make up for refugees’ and asylees’ loss of SNAP benefits.
“They’re already stretched, and now we’re going to see tens of thousands of people also needing to continue to rely on these programs. Of course, there’s limited access to them. You have to have transportation. You have to be able to get there.”
B. said he would apply for food stamps again if he could, because he’s earning too little income to get by.
“There are people who are in need. I think ignoring that — it’s not human.”

The offers Prospect has received through the bankruptcy sale process aren’t as high as the $435 million Yale New Haven Health agreed to pay for the facilities in an April 2022 deal, Thomas Califano, a lawyer for Prospect, told the judge during the proceeding.
“We anticipate having stalking horses this week,” Califano told the bankruptcy court judge. “Admittedly, the Yale New Haven contract provides a better return to the estate.”
A “stalking horse bidder” is the initial bidder in a bankruptcy sale and sets a minimum offer other bidders have to beat, either with a higher price or better terms. 
Califano’s reference to multiple “stalking horses” could imply that the hospitals will be bid on as separate assets. Spokespeople with Prospect Medical Holdings and Prospect CT did not respond to a request for comment regarding how many stalking horse bids the company expects. 
Prospect must complete the sale auction for the Connecticut hospitals by Sept. 19 and a final order approving the transaction must be entered by Oct. 3, according to a recently updated agreement with one of its lenders.
Rob Blanchard, a spokesperson for Gov. Ned Lamont, told The Connecticut Mirror the state would work “diligently on the regulatory approval process” once it’s presented with a sale to approve. As of the bankruptcy filing, Prospect owed Connecticut upwards of $127 million in unpaid provider taxes, in addition to other unpaid state and municipal taxes, the governor’s office confirmed.
On Monday, lawyers for Prospect filed a motion to hold Yale New Haven to the terms of the 2022 deal, meaning Yale would either have to purchase the hospitals for $435 million, pay a penalty to Prospect or challenge them in court. 
During Wednesday’s hearing, the judge seemed surprised by Prospect’s motion and, at first, confused about moving forward with a sale process while also holding Yale New Haven to its 2022 agreement. 
Califano explained that, if the judge grants Prospect’s motion, Yale would be considered as the first bidder to come in over the floor set by the stalking horses, and be given the option to close the deal.
If Yale New Haven refused to move forward with the deal, “we would close with whoever is the other highest bidder, and we treat Yale as defaulted under their contract and we’d see the difference in damages,” Califano told the judge.
The bankruptcy court judge will decide whether to grant Prospect’s request in a hearing scheduled for Sept. 23. 
Yale New Haven Health is also petitioning the judge to facilitate its effort to get out of the 2022 contract to purchase the hospitals. 
In May 2024, following a cyberattack and reports of dire financial conditions at the Prospect hospitals, Yale New Haven sued Prospect in Connecticut Superior Court to get out of the deal. The health system alleged that Prospect breached its contract by, among other actions, defaulting on rent and tax liabilities. 
But, when Prospect declared bankruptcy in January, all ongoing litigation happening outside of bankruptcy court paused, including Yale’s lawsuit. Yale New Haven has asked the bankruptcy judge to allow that lawsuit to proceed in Connecticut state court. The judge will also rule on Yale’s motion during the hearing scheduled for Sept. 23.
“Based on Prospect’s history of mismanagement of the Connecticut hospitals, it remains clear that they have never been in a position to close the transaction on the terms set in our 2022 asset purchase agreement,” a spokesperson with Yale New Haven Health stated in emailed comments.
On Wednesday, the judge encouraged Yale and Prospect to enter into mediation talks. A lawyer for Prospect said they “would be happy” to, while a lawyer for Yale said they’d need time to make a decision. 
“Any discussions that have happened between the parties prior to this point have not been fruitful, so we’re not encouraged that there’s a mutually acceptable resolution,” Yale New Haven’s lawyer told the judge, but added that he’d still take the question to his client. 
The judge asked the parties to let her know within a week whether they will move forward with mediation.
The Yale New Haven spokesperson declined to comment on what options the health system might be open to in mediation, including purchasing the hospitals at a revised price or paying damages to Prospect in order to officially exit the contract. 
This isn’t the first time Prospect has claimed the auction was close to launching. Roughly a month after filing for bankruptcy, Prospect told the court it expected to finalize the sale of the Connecticut hospitals by June 5. During a July 23 hearing, Prospect lawyers told the judge the auction would take place soon.
In Pennsylvania, Prospect shuttered two hospitals because it couldn’t find viable buyers. Blanchard said the governor is hopeful Connecticut won’t face a similar outcome.
“We too have been frustrated with the length of this ordeal and sympathize with the health care workers at each hospital and the communities who rely on them for care,” he said. “It is our hope that through our involvement, we do not end up in a scenario with no viable buyers for these facilities.”

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)Summer heat is bearing down on U.S. prisons, where temperatures in uncooled cells can climb well into the triple digits.
Facing growing pressure from advocacy groups, lawsuits and climate projections that show hotter days ahead, some state prison systems are moving to install air conditioning and expand cooling measures — though many facilities remain years away from significant upgrades.
But in other states, such efforts have stalled or failed. That may lead to more lawsuits in the future, experts say, even as judges may raise the bar for such cases.
An emphasis on being “tough on crime” and prioritizing other public safety measures may have contributed to less attention on prison conditions in some states. In others, slowing revenue growth and pressure to rein in corrections spending could be making new investments a harder sell.
At least two states this year, Virginia and Texas, considered legislation addressing excessive heat in prisons but neither measure became law. The Texas bill would have required the state Department of Criminal Justice to purchase and install climate control systems in all of its facilities by the end of 2032. About two-thirds of the state’s correctional facilities have only partial or no air conditioning.
The measure passed the House but did not advance in the Senate before the legislature adjourned in June.
In Virginia, lawmakers approved a bill that would have required the state corrections department to install heat and air conditioning in its prisons and to ensure cell temperatures not exceed 80 degrees. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed it, citing the cost of installation and operational burdens. Youngkin also wrote that existing state corrections data “does not substantiate the claims of extreme temperatures or health risks.”
But in Delaware, the fiscal year 2026 capital budget approved last month includes $2 million in funding to install air conditioning at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center.
These changes mark the latest actions in a long-running debate over how correctional systems respond to rising summer temperatures — an issue that affects both incarcerated people and staff. Some of the policy debates and facility updates this year follow years of advocacy and litigation over the health, safety and operational challenges posed by heat in correctional settings.
The problem of excessive heat in prisons has persisted for decades and has unfolded alongside other challenges, including chronic understaffing and overcrowding. In some cases, these problems have led to extended facility lockdowns, even during the summer months.
“There are people working in prisons and they have the right to work in climates that are comfortable,” said Nancy La Vigne, a criminal justice researcher and dean of the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University. “When they’re not, there’s retention issues, and it’s hard to replace staff. And when you don’t replace staff, then you have challenges in maintaining the safety and security of the facility.”
In New York, for example, correctional officers staged a three-week strike earlier this year and many didn’t return to work. Some facilities now are operating with 30%-60% fewer guards than needed, resulting in some incarcerated people getting only an hour or two outside of their cells each day.
A 2023 study published in the peer-reviewed PLOS One journal found that mortality in state and private prisons rose during periods of extreme heat, with deaths increasing 3.5% on extreme heat days and up to 7.4% during three-day heat waves. Between 2001 and 2019, nearly 13,000 people died in prison during the summer months, almost half of them in the South, though the study did not determine how many of those deaths were directly attributable to heat.
Climate change is fueling longer, more intense periods of extreme heat. Exposure to extreme heat can worsen conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and asthma, and has also been linked to worsening mental health and higher suicide rates among incarcerated people.
“Average temperatures are rising, and you’re going to have more and more states around the country where incarcerated people are held in conditions that are not livable because they’re too hot,” said Sharon Dolovich, a law professor and director of the Prison Law and Policy Program at the University of California, Los Angeles.
 Some upgrades

At least 44 states lack universal air conditioning within their prison facilities, even in regions known for sweltering summer temperatures, according to a 2022 USA Today analysis. A recent Reuters investigation also found that nearly half of state prisons across 29 states have partial or no air conditioning in housing units.
But some states are investing millions to update their prison facilities.
In North Carolina, corrections officials are working toward their goal of installing air conditioning in all 54 state prisons by 2026. To date, 33 facilities are fully air-conditioned, 17 are partially air-conditioned, and four have no air conditioning, according to its dashboard.
In California, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, which operates 31 adult prisons, has spent $246 million in the past five years on cooling improvements at five prisons, according to a department spokesperson.
Lawmakers this year also approved funding for the Air Cooling Pilot Program at three facilities, with $17.6 million allocated for fiscal years 2025-26 and $20 million for fiscal years 2026-27. It will evaluate the effectiveness of two alternatives prior to a statewide plan to address high indoor temperatures across the California prison system.
The Texas Department of Criminal Justice, as of Aug. 1, is building 12,827 “cool beds,” or prison cells in air-conditioned units, and is in the process of procuring an additional 7,162, according to its dashboard.
Texas is one of the states most closely associated with heat-related deaths in prison. A 2022 study estimated that, on average, 14 deaths per year in Texas prisons are associated with heat. And a Texas Tribune analysis found that at least 41 incarcerated people died during a record-breaking heat wave in 2023.
In March, a federal judge ruled the extreme heat in Texas prisons is “plainly unconstitutional,” but declined to order immediate air conditioning, saying the work could not be completed within the court order’s 90-day window and temporary systems might delay a permanent fix.
 ‘More miserable’

Sweltering summer heat can turn prisons into pressure cookers. People inside already may have health conditions, limited access to cooling, or take medications that make it harder for their bodies to handle the heat. And research suggests that high temperatures can heighten irritability and aggression, sometimes fueling more conflicts between incarcerated people or with staff.
“It makes you more miserable. … If you to the point of even thinking about suicide, that’s just going to add to it,” said Ronald McKeithen, who spent 37 years incarcerated in Alabama prisons and is now the director of second chances at the Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice. McKeithen recalls feeling “on edge” due to tension among other incarcerated people on hot days.
At the Oshkosh Correctional Institution in Wisconsin, Devin Skrzypchak said the heat worsens his bladder condition, and he often can’t get the incontinence briefs he needs. The heat forces him to drink more water, and on days when ice isn’t available, he’s left drenched in sweat.
“At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating,” Skrzypchak wrote in a message to Stateline through the facility’s messaging platform.
D’Angelo Lee Komanekin — who has spent about 25 years in and out of different Wisconsin corrections facilities — said prison architecture plays a major role in why temperatures inside climb so high.
“The planet is getting hotter and hotter,” said Komanekin, who relies on a small plastic fan to stay cool. Komanekin also is incarcerated at the Oshkosh Correctional Institution. “They’re doing nothing about the architecture. Some institutions’ windows open, some don’t, but most of the doors have steel doors with trap doors.”
Older prison designs that rely heavily on steel and concrete building materials often trap heat, making it difficult to keep temperatures down in the summer. Aging facilities also are less likely to be equipped for the installation of central air conditioning.
Some state prison systems, including Alabama’s and Wisconsin’s, are adding air-conditioning or air-tempering systems to new prison construction and major renovation projects.
 Future legal battles

Legal experts say the issue of excessive heat in prisons is likely to become more pressing as climate change drives longer and hotter summers.
Extreme heat in correctional facilities has already been the subject of litigation in dozens of states, with plaintiffs arguing that high temperatures constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Court rulings in these cases have varied, but some experts say even more lawsuits are likely if facilities do not adapt.
“The conditions are going to worsen. [Incarcerated people are] going to be looking for every possible avenue for assistance they can,” Dolovich, the UCLA law professor, told Stateline.
One of the latest cases comes from Missouri, where the nonprofit law firm MacArthur Justice Center filed a class-action lawsuit in May on behalf of six incarcerated people at Algoa Correctional Center.
The lawsuit alleges that the conditions violate their constitutional rights under the Eighth Amendment. It seeks to require the Missouri Department of Corrections to work with experts to develop a heat mitigation plan that keeps housing unit temperatures between 65 and 85 degrees. If the department cannot meet that standard, the plaintiffs are asking for the release of three of the incarcerated people who have less than a year remaining on their sentences.
Lawsuits such as the Missouri case often focus on claims that extreme heat worsens existing medical problems. To proceed, they must meet two legal requirements: proving the heat poses a serious health or safety risk, and showing prison officials knew about the danger but failed to address it, according to Dolovich, whose work has focused on the Eighth Amendment and prison conditions.
Courts may also raise the bar for proving such claims if judges echo decisions in cases with similar Eight Amendment arguments related to the death penalty and homelessness, Dolovich said. Judges have shifted, she said, toward a “superadding terror, pain and disgrace” standard under the Eighth Amendment — a higher threshold requiring proof that conditions were created with the intent to cause unnecessary suffering.
Dolovich added that some recent court decisions have provided only narrow remedies, such as ordering ice and fans instead of installing air conditioning.
“Prison officials have a moral and a constitutional responsibility to respond to changing conditions. In this case, it means air conditioning. … Anything less than that, to me, is indefensible.” she said.

The backpedal comes three days after striking Butler Hospital workers voted to approve a new labor agreement that concluded their three-month-long walkout. Approximately 720 members of SEIU 1199NE work at the Providence psychiatric hospital. 
The six violations were issued early in the strike, during late May and early June. All six violations involved what the city’s municipal code calls “excessive” or “amplified” noise from bullhorns or vehicle horns on the picket line on Blackstone Boulevard.  
Josh Estrella, a spokesperson for Providence Mayor Brett Smiley, said via email Thursday that the city made “an administrative decision” not to pursue further action on the matter and has dropped the fines.
“As with all municipal court cases, the Solicitor’s office reviews the matter and evaluates whether or not to prosecute,” Estrella wrote. “This is done on a case by case basis.”
The Providence City Council took partial credit for the reversal in a Thursday morning press release, citing “sustained pressure from Council leadership” as an impetus for the fines’ negation.
“Earlier this week, we celebrated the ratification of a contract that meaningfully improves their lives,” Council President Rachel Miller said in a statement. “Today, we welcome the reversal of unjust noise citations that should never have been issued.” 
“$500 fines could not quiet the striking workers, whose tenacity and solidarity led directly to a strong new contract,” Miller continued. “When the City punished workers for raising their voices, we raised ours, and I’m happy today to see the penalties dropped.”
Over the course of the strike, several councilors, including Miller, marched the picket line alongside workers. The City Council also passed a resolution on June 5 in support of the workers.
An update posted Thursday to Butler’s negotiations website, ButlerInfoForYou.org, noted that back-to-work instructions were sent to union workers on Tuesday via certified mail. 
SEIU 1199NE did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.

(Reeg photo: David Becker/Getty Images for Caesars Entertainment; Horbuckle photo: Ethan Miller, Getty Images)A new report criticizes gaming giants Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts International for investing more in their CEOs and corporate investors than in supporting the tens of thousands of workers who keep their casinos operating.
The Institute for Policy Studies and Inequality.org each year analyze the 100 S&P 500 corporations with the lowest median worker pay. They’ve dubbed these corporations the Low Wage 100 and highlight the growing disparities between those average workers’ pay and their CEOs.
Only three S&P 500 companies, all gaming giants, are headquartered in Nevada. All three fall within the Low Wage 100.
Caesars CEO Thomas Reeg was compensated $18.4 million in 2024 while the median worker earned $43,880. That translates to a CEO-to-worker pay ratio of 419-to-1.
Put another way: For every $1 the median worker earned, Reeg made $419.
According to their SEC filing, Caesars calculated that median (half make more, half make less) worker salary from its 48,261 full-time, part-time, and seasonal employees, all based in the U.S. Less than 5% of their total workforce is located outside of the U.S. and were excluded from the ratio.
Meanwhile, MGM Resorts CEO William Hornbuckle was compensated $15.8 million last year while the median worker earned $47,607. That translates to a CEO-to-worker pay ratio of 332-to-1.
According to their SEC filing, MGM Resorts employed 76,527 last year, including 13,063 as MGM China. Those figures include full-time, part-time, seasonal, and temporary employees.



Non-S&P gaming companies
The “Executive Excess” report only evaluated the largest 500 corporations in the United States. So how do the gaming corporations that fall outside of the S&P 500 fare?
Here are their 2024 CEO pay ratios, as reported on their SEC filings:

Bally’s Corp: 54-to-1. CEO Robeson Reeves made $2.3 million; the median worker made $41,912.
Red Rock Resorts, parent company of Station Casinos: 78-to-1. CEO Frank Fertitta made $3.3 million; the median worker made $42,864.
Golden Entertainment: 155-to-1. CEO Blake Sartini made $5.4 million; the median worker made $34,783.
Boyd Gaming Corp: 304-to-1. CEO Keith Smith made $11.5 million; the median worker made $37,755.
Penn Entertainment: 734-to-1. CEO Jay Snowden made $26.6 million; the median worker made $36,322.




Since 2019, Caesars CEO compensation rose 106.4% while its median worker pay rose 40.8%. Reeg has been CEO that entire time. Meanwhile, MGM Resorts CEO compensation rose 20.3% while median worker pay rose 22.2%. Hornbuckle has been CEO for most of that time, securing the corporation’s top spot in July 2020.
Caesars and MGM Resorts are both major employers in Nevada.
The third Nevada-based S&P 500 company, Las Vegas Sands, no longer operates casinos within the state, but its majority shareholder, billionaire Miriam Adelson, remains a powerful figure. Las Vegas Sands paid CEO Robert Goldstein $21.9 million last year and their median worker $42,426.
Adelson is one of at least 32 billionaires who owes their wealth to a Low Wage 100 company, according to the report.
The “Executive Excess” report also compared what each corporation spent on stock buybacks with what was spent on capital expenditures, arguing that the former “creates huge short-term windfalls for executives and shareholders at the expense of workers and long-term productive investments.” Stock buybacks were illegal until 1982.
MGM Resorts last year spent $9.565 billion on stock buybacks, more than double the $4.349 billion it spent on capital expenditures.
Meanwhile, Caesars and Las Vegas Sands spent more on capital expenditures than stock buybacks. Caesars last year spent $4.77 billion in capital expenditures and $191 million on stock buybacks. Las Vegas Sands spent $6.95 billion on capital expenditures and $3 billion on stock buybacks.
Excluding Amazon, whose spending on expansion is an outlier and dwarfs all others on the list, the Low Wage 100 companies collectively spent more on stock buybacks between 2019 and 2025 than they did on capital expenditures.
Across all of the Low Wage 100, average CEO compensation rose 34.7% between 2019 and 2024 while average median worker pay rose 16.3%. Inflation was 22.6% over that same period.
The average CEO total compensation for these companies in 2024 was $17.2 million while average median worker pay was $35,570. That’s a CEO-to-worker pay ratio of 632-to-1.
The report notes that, if the analysis is expanded to all S&P 100 corporations, the CEO-to-worker ratio lowers to 285-to-1. If you go back six decades, to 1965, CEO-to-worker pay was 25 to 1.
Since 2019, Caesars’ CEO pay ratio has expanded 47% and MGM’s has decreased minimally by 1.5%.
“America’s largest low-wage employers continue to fixate on enriching their CEOs at the expense of both their workers and their corporate prospects for long-term growth,” concludes the report.

At the height of the racial justice protests in 2020, the Rev. Jerry McAfee was on the front lines in Minneapolis. When residents filled the streets after George Floyd’s murder, McAfee and other veteran peacemakers handed out food, broke up fights, and tried to dissuade further violence. In one case, they formed a protective escort for police officers moving through a tense crowd to reach a stabbing victim. At that point, McAfee had walked the city’s most gun violence-stricken areas, working with active and former gang members to prevent shootings, for nearly three decades.
“We were the line between the police and the community,” McAfee said of 2020, recalling the climbing rates of violence at the time. “The city needed us out there.” 
Five years later, the urgency has faded. Gun violence in Minneapolis has trended downward, though at a slower pace than in many other cities, and the network of street-level interrupters that emerged from that chaotic summer are caught in a contract standoff with the city, at risk of losing critical momentum in maintaining the decline in shootings.
In March, Minneapolis’s Neighborhood Safety Department approved a new round of biannual contracts for a group of city-funded violence intervention groups. Only three organizations,  Restoration Inc., Metro Youth Diversion, and Sabathani, have agreed to the terms. At least four others have walked away, accusing the city of imposing burdensome requirements — dictating where the outreach teams can operate, how they should engage the community, and how much they’re allowed to pay staff — that they say make it harder for them to do their work. 
“They’re bullying the organizations to sign these contracts in this new structure,” said Muhammad Abdul-Ahad, who leads TOUCH Outreach, an organization that does street outreach and intervention work. “It’s a bully tactic that they’re using. Take it or leave it.” Abdul-Ahad said he was sent a revised contract by the Neighborhood Safety Department earlier this week, but hasn’t signed it.
The ongoing dispute exposed a foundational fracture in the city’s community violence intervention efforts. In 2020, as Minneapolis poured millions of city and federal dollars into containing the historic shooting surge during the pandemic and rebuilding public trust, the city’s Public Health Department was working successfully with Adbul Ahad and other grassroots leaders through its Office of Violence Prevention, which was established two years earlier. But in 2022, the office was folded into a newly created Neighborhood Safety Department, an initiative that brought multiple public safety programs under one umbrella. That structural shift, according to several local activists, marked the beginning of a more top-down, enforcement-driven approach. 
“What was a fast and growing violence prevention effort was then shuffled from the Health Department to a new department, under a new commissioner, that has four other departments to help and support,” said Sasha Cotton, who led the Office of Violence Prevention before it was absorbed into the Neighborhood Safety Department in 2022. “It sort of bastardized the CVI work and left it hanging out to dry.”
Since its creation, the Neighborhood Safety Department has cycled through multiple commissioners, faced allegations of mismanagement, and withheld funding to CVI groups.
The fabric further unraveled in November 2023, when the Neighborhood Safety Department was sued by local attorney Dean Thomson, who alleged that the city had failed to track how CVI dollars were being spent, including who was paid and what services were delivered. As part of a settlement reached last August, city officials pledged to tighten oversight and increase transparency, but several CVI leaders said the new requirements undermine their mission by requiring drug testing, background checks, and visible ID badges for the workers. 
“I think there’s a lack of true understanding of what violence intervention and prevention is from the top,” Cotton said. 
Amanda Harrington, the newly appointed director of the Neighborhood Safety Department, would not comment on the details of the individual contracts, but said the office is willing to address the concerns of community outreach workers in the negotiation process. When asked about concerns that the ongoing disputes will stymy shooting decreases, Harrington said “a mix of different strategies” by the city contributed to the overall decline, including ongoing efforts by police and prosecutors. “The department is going through some changes, and there are growing pains that go along with that,” she said.
Abdul-Ahad said changing the designation from independent contractors to city employees would be more in line with the new contract requirements and make workers eligible for city benefits. As contractors, they have little support.
When Abdul-Ahad launched TOUCH Outreach in the aftermath of Floyd’s murder, police-community relations had reached a breaking point, and “we were just trying to hurry and get services out to the community,” he said. Residents depended on CVI workers to make up for the lack of law enforcement presence. Now, homicides are down 23 percent and nonfatal shootings have dropped 30 percent, according to police data, putting both metrics below pre-pandemic levels from 2019. The police are more active, but as local CVI leaders see it, a steady presence of violence interrupters across the city is still vital to sustaining the progress in lowering shootings. 
“You’ve got direct intervention, and you got prevention. Most of the money is going towards prevention and very little to direct intervention,” said McAfee, who has recently clashed with officials over the direction of violence reduction. His boots-on-the-ground violence intervention organization, 21 Days of Peace, is not currently contracted with the city, and two of its workers faced weapons charges earlier this year after a shooting. While prevention is more focused on long-term, systemic changes to address violence, intervention deals with the more immediate actions necessary to stop violence. 
CVI groups often disagree about how the work should be done and who should be leading it, a common dynamic in cities grappling with high levels of gun violence, and not everyone is dismayed by the city’s approach. 
Connie Rhodes, who runs Restoration Inc., a community-based organization focused on outreach, education, and gun violence reduction, signed the new contract. She believes there needs to be more of a “give and take” between community leaders and city officials, “a compromise,” she said, acknowledging that violence prevention efforts are better rooted in a public health framework, as they used to be. “It shouldn’t have left the Health Department.” 
Cotton thinks there’s a middle ground. “Everybody has their own role to play in this,” she said. “If the goal is to do violence prevention work, then we should be able to look past our different approaches and focus on what we bring to the space.” 
Community leaders worry that the disagreement over the new contract will disrupt outreach at a time when federal funding is being cut, and consistency and trust are critical. That’s why Abdul-Ahad said his organization will continue to do the work, whether they’re partnered with the city or not. “We still have work to do,” he said. “We’re going to keep doing it.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/14-1024x600.jpg,,,2025-08-21 13:57:50.796622
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-21 17:19:18+00:00,CT Mirror,CT homeschoolers still fighting regulation in legislature’s off season,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/21/ct-homeschool-laws-op/,Connecticut's 2025 legislative session ended without any bills coming up for debate. Homeschool families want to keep it that way.,"Connecticut’s 2025 legislative session ended in early June with no resolution on whether, or how, the state should regulate homeschooling. 
In the months since, a working group convened to consider the issue met twice and disbanded. Current state law governing homeschooling specifies only what subjects should be covered and little else.
But a vocal contingent of homeschool families — who packed the state Capitol earlier this year, urging lawmakers to drop fledgling efforts to regulate home-based education — are keeping up the fight in the legislature’s off season. 
[RELATED: In CT, homeschooling debate heats up as parents plan daily protests at Capitol]
Rebecca Urrutia, a mother of four who lives in Tolland, says she watched her children struggle in the public schools. But since she decided to homeschool, she said they’ve been thriving. 
“I’m watching them stand up for themselves. I’m watching them be able to socialize with people of all ages, be able to nurture younger ones and look up to older ones,” Urrutia said during a forum held by a small group of Republican lawmakers in Tolland on Monday.
“The socialization that we have gotten through homeschooling is so far beyond what we had when we were in the public school and never saw each other, and we’re having it as a family,” she said. 
The lawmakers now taking up the cause, on Urrutia and other parents’ behalf, include Rep. Tammy Nuccio, R-Tolland, Rep. Anne Dauphinais, R-Killingly, and Rep. Tim Ackert, R-Coventry. About 15 parents, children and homeschool advocates spoke at the Monday forum they hosted, underscoring that independence from the state was part of the reason they valued homeschooling, and insisting that they should be allowed to continue as they have in the past. 
Nuccio said she was compelled to invite constituents to share their stories after seeing the turnout at the Capitol this spring. “I walked out of the Appropriations room to a Capitol full of about 2,000-plus people. And I had never seen that for any cause anywhere in the state,” Nuccio recalled. 
Monday’s forum also came just days after Deborah Stevenson, an attorney who represents several homeschooling organizations in Connecticut and the founder of the National Home Education Legal Defense, published a summary of documents she obtained through a Freedom of Information request from several state agencies.
The documents showed that lawmakers had drafted legislation that would have required parents withdrawing their children from public school to present a description of the curriculum they would use in homeschooling and a health assessment or proof of enrollment in a private school.
The drafts also included requirements that homeschooling parents present an annual academic evaluation of their child to the state. Parents of homeschoolers are not currently required to formally evaluate their children, although some parents say they do assess their children’s progress using standardized evaluations. 
Cathy DeCaprio, who homeschooled her seven children over the course of 25 years, said she felt that forcing standardized assessments on homeschoolers would undermine their ability to teach children at their own pace. “Words like equivalency and standardized tests concern me. The beauty in why homeschoolers do better on standardized tests is because of the flexibility that is offered,” DeCaprio said. 
DeCaprio said one of her children had been able to attend the Yale School of Music, which she attributed to the flexibility that homeschool allowed for her child to put aside other subjects, like Algebra II, to focus on music. She said all of her children are now functioning adults, even one who struggled early on in his schooling career. “You can’t put the public system onto a family. It doesn’t even make sense to do that. It won’t be effective,” she said. 
Parents also balked at the idea of having to appear back at their local school district each year. 
“I had a really terrible experience in the public schools. And to have to go back to the system that failed you to prove that you’re not abusing your children is insanity,” Urrutia said. 
(Tolland Public Schools superintendent Walter Willett said that while they can’t comment on specific families, “the district is committed fulfilling the needs of children and their families, and respects the right of families to take the actions they feel are in the best interest of their children.”)
The fact that the General Assembly got as far as drafting legislation this year came as upsetting news to homeschool parents — even though the bills never came up for a hearing or a vote. 
Dauphinais, the ranking member on the Children’s Committee, told The Connecticut Mirror that she’d been unaware of it. Christina Ghio, acting state Child Advocate, said she had sent the draft legislation to the chairs of both the Education and Children’s Committees, but that ultimately it had gone nowhere. 
Homeschooling in the spotlight
The argument over homeschooling and regulation came to the forefront in May, after the Office of the Child Advocate published a report saying that withdrawals of children from public school under the pretense of homeschooling had been used to hide abuse; the report recommended the state establish certain checks to ensure homeschoolers were meeting standards of academic progress and wellbeing. 
After an outcry from the homeschool community, lawmakers didn’t move forward with legislation this spring. But the topic remains contentious, and discussions continue to break down. A working group of lawmakers and homeschool advocates that was meant to discuss the topic recently disbanded over disagreements in how the group should run. 
The idea of regulating homeschooling has arisen in the state legislature in the past. In 2017, after 17-year-old Matthew Tirado died from starvation and abuse at home, the Office of the Child Advocate proposed a bill placing stricter requirements on homeschoolers that ultimately failed in 2019. 
The catalyst this year was the case of a Waterbury man who escaped his home after allegedly being held captive by his stepmother for two decades. The man was reportedly withdrawn from public school at around age 11.
Homeschool advocates have repeatedly insisted that neither of these cases have any connection with homeschooling, saying instead that the state of Connecticut failed to properly investigate the abuse that took place. 
Ghio told CT Mirror that her office knew of cases where parents told school districts that the children were being removed for homeschooling, but that the children, in fact, were being abused and neglected out of sight. 
“That doesn’t mean that all homeschool parents are abusing, neglecting their children. It doesn’t mean homeschooling in and of itself is bad. It means we have a problem, and the reality is that if we don’t address this gap, we will continue to leave kids at risk,” she said. 
Many of the examples of children withdrawn for homeschooling that Ghio offered in her report had already been the subject of multiple reports to the Department of Children and Families while they were still enrolled in public school. But Ghio said her biggest worry was that homeschool provides an opportunity to isolate a child from the people who are required to make reports. 
She referenced the case of a 10-year-old child she called William, who was discovered locked in a room, bruised and malnourished, in 2023. Although his family had been the subject of 13 DCF reports, including two about him, DCF wasn’t notified when his mom withdrew him from the public schools to homeschool him. William was allegedly isolated and abused after being withdrawn from public school, until the police found him. The police warrant said the mother corroborated that William was removed from school to hide his injuries.
Another proposal written in the draft bill said that if a parent told the district that they wanted to withdraw their child for homeschooling, the district would be required to review whether the school had any records of investigations or allegations against the parent that would warrant a call to the Department of Children and Families.
One person at the Monday forum, a public school student named Beckett Murray, said he agreed with the Child Advocate’s recommendation. 
“What I am seeing on that report is trying to prevent child abuse,” he said. “Most people aren’t abusing their kids. We need a way to check up on the kids to make sure that they’re not getting abused.” 
But the lawmakers there disagreed. Nuccio referenced an analysis done by the Office of the Child Advocate that found out of a sample of about 750 children over age 7 who were withdrawn to be homeschooled between 2021 and 2024, roughly a quarter were in families where there had been at least one report of abuse or neglect accepted by DCF. 
She said  while there were some “egregious” cases referenced in that analysis, more than 75% of the homeschoolers had no DCF involvement. “I’m always afraid of over-legislating and looking at certain cases that feed a narrative, and then providing laws for everybody outside of that, which I don’t always think is fair,” Nuccio said. 
Lawmakers at the forum said they believed the state should be focusing on cases where abuse or neglect has been verified by DCF, rather than blanket regulations that would affect all homeschoolers. 
“All of us up here … don’t want any child abused, and I think everybody in this room would agree with that,” Dauphinais said. “These regulations and policies they’re trying to put in are over-intrusive and above and beyond that.” 
Dauphinais told CT Mirror that serious incidents happen both in school and at home, and she said she felt homeschoolers were being targeted despite having done nothing wrong. 
During a meeting of the homeschool working group last week, DCF staff underscored that homeschooling alone was not a reason for the agency to open an investigation for possible abuse and neglect. 
In a statement, Peter Yazbak, communications director for the department, said that reports to DCF are for things like chronic absenteeism, physical or sexual abuse, a child being unsupervised or lack of medical care. He said they rarely are contacted just because a family decides to pull their children out of public school to homeschool.
“DCF recognizes a family’s right to choose in what setting to educate their child whether that is homeschool or a neighborhood school,” Yazbak said. “While school personnel and law enforcement are the two top mandated reporters that contact [DCF] with reports of neglect and abuse, removing a child from school to be homeschooled does not, in and of itself, constitute neglect.”
Ken Mysogland, the bureau chief for external affairs for DCF, said during the working group meeting that the department often doesn’t even know where a child is being educated when they begin to look into allegations of abuse. 
“ We’re investigating allegations of child maltreatment, not allegations of homeschool,” Mysogland told the working group. 
‘Let’s figure it out’
Megan Chimento, who attended the forum and has three children between the ages of 7 and 11, told CT Mirror that she decided to homeschool her children during COVID. 
“It started just because my daughter was too young to be sitting on a device with a mask on. She was only 6, and that’s not going to be happening,” she said. 
Once she started, she said, she saw the benefits. Her children could move through subjects at their own pace, taking more time where they struggled and speeding through things that were easy. They had unlimited time together as a family, and were able to take field trips wherever they wanted to go. 
Flexibility and freedom to teach their children at their own pace, as well as shared family time and outdoor experiences, were themes parents mentioned again and again on Monday. They said they wanted that freedom from additional assessments. 
They also expressed frustration at a process of drafting regulations they described as happening in secret, without their knowledge.
Nicole Foote, who homeschools her four children, said she began considering it while watching her oldest daughter struggle at private school. “I would find out six months into the year that my daughter was not doing well in math. And I’m like, ‘Well, what do I do now?’” she said. 
Foote said homeschooling meant they no longer had to rush out the door in the morning. It gave them time to sit and have breakfast as a family, and also to spend time outside during the day. She pushed back on the idea that parents who hadn’t done well in school themselves couldn’t teach their children. 
“I think it’s a good thing to have our children watch us learn alongside them. And I can’t tell you how many times that I’ve sat there with my kids [and] I’m like, ‘Hey, I don’t know how to do this. Let’s figure it out,’” she said.
Ray Guidone said he decided to homeschool his four children because he felt the public schools were placing too much focus on standardized testing rather than teaching subjects that would be useful in life after school. 
Guidone said his children are involved in outside organizations like Makerspace CT in Hartford. He said his 15-year-old son is on his way to earning his pilot’s license. “They’re involved in so many different things through the town, through the state, just being more aware of what’s going on in the actual world instead of what’s being taught in the public school world,” he said. 
Children also spoke at the forum, saying they enjoyed the flexibility of their schedules and being able to read whenever they wanted to. 
Annalise Harper, a former homeschooler who is now a senior at Eastern Connecticut State University, said the idea of public school — getting up early after staying up late doing homework the night before, sitting in a classroom for eight hours rather than being outside — never appealed to her. 
Harper, who is studying to become a social worker, said she was able to take college-level classes in English at the age of 16. She said her education also gave her the opportunity to learn how to talk with people of all ages, including professors, something she said her classmates struggled with.
“I couldn’t have asked for a better education, for a better childhood,” she said. 
The disbanded working group
After the legislative session ended in June, Rep. Patrick Biggins, D-Manchester, convened a working group to discuss homeschooling.  
He told CT Mirror that he’d hoped to continue the conversation begun at the informational hearing May 5 in response to the Child Advocate’s report. He said he hoped the group could be a place to answer questions from the homeschool community and provide an opportunity for their voices to be heard. 
The group included lawmakers from both parties and representatives from homeschool groups, including Stevenson, of the National Home Education Legal Defense, Diane Connors of the Connecticut Homeschool Network, and Donna Person, vice president of The Education Association of Christian Homeschoolers of CT. 
After two meetings, the working group was disbanded. Biggins said he was unhappy that people from the homeschool community were gathering outside the meeting room in protest — at the behest, he said, of some of the working group members. 
“ If you’re asking people to show up, that means you’re not actually going to engage in the conversation in the room, or you’re not going to engage in the conversation in the room in good faith,” he said. 
Connors disagreed with that interpretation, saying the people gathered outside were not protesting and carried no signs.   
“ People in the homeschool community are sensitive to the fact that their voices were shut out on May 5th. And they have asked us what was going on, and we answered them. We told them when the meetings were, and while they were shut out of the room, they have a right to be in the building, and they wanted to find out after the meeting how it was going. And we respected that,” she said. 
Working group members were also in disagreement over a previous meeting, where the Department of Children and Families had been invited to respond to questions from the working group.
Dauphinais and Connors said they believed the meeting was supposed to give them the opportunity to freely ask questions to the commissioner of DCF. Instead, multiple department staff members attended the meeting and offered prepared responses to questions that were submitted ahead of time. Yazbak said DCF believed the meeting was to discuss the questions and answers they received from the working group and noted that they could not discuss specific abuse cases because of federal privacy laws.
Biggins said he planned to continue looking into the issue on his own. “I think that there are loopholes in our system currently where bad actors can use our lack of regulations to isolate a child or do things that are not representative of the homeschool community … and not representative of what we want to see as a state,” he said. 
He said he didn’t have any suggestions for specific policies, but that he would strongly support any regulation that would enable the state to better protect children. 
Ghio said the Office of the Child Advocate would continue to push for an annual academic evaluation for homeschoolers, annual proof of enrollment and some kind of wellness check. 
At the forum, Ackert told homeschool families that the key to stopping a bill regulating homeschooling would be to keep it from reaching a vote. He said last year, Republicans had told Democratic leadership that they would filibuster the bill if it reached the floor. 
He urged homeschoolers to use their network and continue advocating. He said while everyone was against child abuse, he questioned whether the remedy being proposed was deflecting attention away from the actual problem. 
“I think the key is that you need to make sure that your voice is heard,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0001-Copy-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-21 13:57:50.796622

This week, Keller defended the city’s “immigrant-friendly” policies after a letter from Attorney General Pam Bondi to “sanctuary” jurisdictions across the country. (Photo courtesy of El Centro de Igualdad y Derechos)Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller wrote in a letter this week that the city’s policies do not impede federal immigration enforcement and that he stands by “immigrant-friendly policies” he believes reduce crime in New Mexico’s biggest city.
The letter was a response to the latest pressure campaign from United States Attorney General Pam Bondi, who demanded Albuquerque and 34 other “sanctuary” jurisdictions say by Tuesday whether the jurisdictions commit to complying with federal law and identify which steps they are taking to “eliminate laws, policies, and practices that impeded federal immigration enforcement.”
Feds list Albuquerque as NM’s sole “sanctuary” jurisdiction

Keller, in an undated letter city officials provided to Source New Mexico on Wednesday afternoon, wrote that Bondi has no basis to threaten the city and that, “The City will not give in to bullying.” He added that he can commit to complying with federal law “without hesitation.” As for the second request:
“None of the City’s laws, policies or practices impede federal immigration enforcement,” he wrote. “I therefore see no need to propose any initiatives.”
Keller went on to write that he is unaware of any way in which Albuquerque’s policies “thwart” operations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement or other federal authorities. Instead, he said the city’s policies that aim to protect immigrants ensure crime victims feel safe to come forward. 
“And the results have been clear: In the past two years, the City has seen a marked decrease in crime,” he said. 
Albuquerque is one of 18 cities nationwide that the DOJ targeted earlier this month as a “sanctuary” jurisdiction, and the only New Mexico locale. The national list also includes four counties, 12 states and the District of Columbia. Bondi issued a letter Aug. 13 to all the jurisdictions, warning local leaders that the areas they represent and people implementing the policies could face criminal or civil penalties or a loss of federal grants. 
Resentment against Albuquerque ‘deliveristas’ may have sparked viral Walmart ICE arrest

“I have made clear, repeatedly, that the immigrant-friendly policies do not limit legitimate efforts at law enforcement,” Keller said. “If you commit a crime in Albuquerque, you will be held accountable, regardless of your immigration status.”
In July, Keller signed a new executive order that expanded the city’s 2018 Immigrant-Friendly Resolution, which states that no city entity will assist in federal civil immigration enforcement, including raids, detentions or information-sharing unless legally required by a court.
Keller’s executive order also states that ICE must clearly identify officers and avoid “harmful or disruptive detainment tactics in public spaces.” Keller signed the executive order shortly after video went viral online of ICE violently arresting a Venezuelan immigrant at a Walmart in Albuquerque. 
The mayor ended his letter with hopes that his response would prompt Bondi to stop issuing threats to the city, but he said the city “ will continue to fight if any federal agency attempts to cut the City’s funding or otherwise seeks to harm the City’s interest.”




Read Keller’s full letter here: 
Dear Attorney General Bondi,
I am writing in response to your letter of August 13, 2025. I want to be clear that protecting the safety of the residents of Albuquerque is now, and has always been, my top concern. I hope that the Department of Justice will continue to partner with Albuquerque in that effort. But I also want to be clear that the Department has no basis to threaten the City or its residents, and the City will not give in to bullying. The City will respond, as necessary, to any action taken against it.
Your letter includes two requests. First, you asked that I confirm the City’s commitment to complying with federal law. I can do so without hesitation. Second, you ask that I identify the initiative we are taking to “eliminate laws, policies, and practices that impeded federal immigration enforcement.” None of the City’s laws, policies or practices impede federal immigration enforcement. I therefore see no need to propose any initiatives.
Albuquerque is also one of the most culturally diverse cities in the country. Native American groups have inhabited the region for thousands of years – many centuries before Europeans reached the Americas.  Spanish settlers began settling the area in the 1500s, followed later by Anglos seeking opportunities during the country’s westward expansion. Albuquerque is also home to rich and thriving African-American and Asian-American communities, among others. The City has, throughout its history, welcomed immigrants.
It is in part due to this history that the City has adopted policies designed to protect the immigrants within the community. I stand by these policies. These policies are designed to, and have, made the City safer. These policies ensure that victims of crime feel that they can come forward, without fear of reprisal. And the results have been clear: in the past two years, the City has seen a marked decrease in crime.
In your letter, you assert that the City’s policies “thwart federal immigration enforcement to the detriment of the United States.” This claim is baseless. Your letter does not include a single example of activities that have interfered with federal immigration enforcement, and I am not aware of any. I have made clear, repeatedly, that the immigrant-friendly policies do not limit legitimate efforts at law enforcement. If you commit a crime in Albuquerque, you will be held accountable, regardless of your immigration status.
I hope that, with this clarification, the threats against the City of Albuquerque will come to an
end. I would note, however, that there is already an injunction preventing federal agencies from cutting off funding to the City. Another one is forthcoming. The City will continue to fight if any federal agency attempts to cut the City’s funding or otherwise seeks to harm the City’s interest.
 
Sincerely,
Mayor Tim Keller",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1159-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-08-21 13:57:50.796622

(Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)This week, the Trump administration’s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced an effort to check the immigration status of people who get their health insurance through Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.
Medicaid is the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. For families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford private insurance, CHIP is a public program that provides low-cost health coverage for their children.
The feds will begin sending states monthly enrollment reports that identify people with Medicaid or CHIP whose immigration or citizenship status can’t be confirmed through federal databases. States are then responsible for verifying the citizenship or immigration status of individuals in those reports. States are expected to take “appropriate actions when necessary, including adjusting coverage or enforcing non-citizen eligibility rules,” according to a CMS press release.
“We are tightening oversight of enrollment to safeguard taxpayer dollars and guarantee that these vital programs serve only those who are truly eligible under the law,” Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who oversees CMS as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said in a press release announcing the new program.
As of April, roughly 71 million adults and children nationwide have Medicaid coverage, while another 7 million children have insurance through CHIP. Immigrants under age 65 are less likely to be covered by Medicaid than U.S.-born citizens, according to an analysis from health research organization KFF.
Immigrants who are in the country illegally aren’t eligible for federally funded Medicaid and CHIP. Only citizens and certain lawfully present immigrants — green card holders and refugees, for example — can qualify.
But some states have chosen to expand Medicaid coverage for immigrants with their own funds. Twenty-three states offer pregnancy-related care regardless of citizenship or immigration status, according to KFF. Fourteen states provide coverage for children in low-income families regardless of immigration status, while seven states offer coverage to some adults regardless of status.
The tax and spending package President Donald Trump last month cuts federal spending on Medicaid by more than $1 trillion, leaving states to either make up the difference with their own funds or reduce coverage. But the new law also includes restrictions on coverage for certain immigrants, including stripping eligibility from refugees and asylum-seekers.

(Photo: John Partipilo)Election officials turned over at the highest rate in at least a quarter century during the last presidential election, according to new research from the Bipartisan Policy Center.
An analysis of shifts in election officials published Tuesday found nearly 41% of election officials administering the 2024 election were different than those in 2020. Turnover has accelerated over the past two decades, rising from about 28% in 2004 to 40.9% last year.
The growing percentage of departing election officials comes after years of challenges. They navigated the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as well as harassment and false conspiracy theories surrounding stolen elections that persist today.
The analysis released by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based group that seeks to foster policy cooperation across party lines, represents an updated version of a report that previously examined turnover from 2004 to 2022. The new research, which extends the data through 2024, shows the turnover rate continued to climb.
Wanted: Poll workers. Must love democracy.
The change means that, over time, election officials have less experience. The research found that the share of chief local election officials with six or more years in their role has dropped from 60% in 2006 to 47% in 2024.
But last year, 60% of election officials had previously overseen the administration of a presidential election in their jurisdiction.
“Despite increasing turnover and loss of experience, the majority of chief election officials still have experience running at least one presidential election cycle,” the analysis said. “This is important because presidential elections typically see the highest turnout and are the most visible elections administered.”
The analysis found that over the long term, election official turnover rates have been rising gradually in small jurisdictions, defined as areas with fewer than 100,000 voting-age residents. But large jurisdictions have experienced a more sudden jump in turnover.
Small jurisdictions had a 27% turnover rate in 2004 that had risen to 40% in 2024. But large jurisdictions enjoyed a turnover rate as low as 31% in 2018 before climbing rapidly to nearly 46% last year.

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado Legislature is meeting in a special session to address a nearly $800 million hole in the state budget. Work began on Thursday morning and is expected to last through the weekend.
After Republicans in Congress passed the federal tax cut and spending bill in July, Colorado’s estimated tax revenue collections shrunk by about $1.2 billion for the current fiscal year, which began July 1. Most of that is a loss of corporate income taxes.
Colorado has to have a balanced state budget, so lawmakers must figure out a way to get backed to a balanced bottom line. The Democratic majority in both chambers, alongside Gov. Jared Polis, plan to do that by dipping into the state’s reserves, cutting program spending and passing an array of tax laws to eliminate some deductions and loopholes.
In his call for the special session, Polis also allowed bills on health insurance premiums and artificial intelligence regulations. A controversial AI law is set to go into effect next February and it has been a longtime goal of Polis and moderates to tweak it before then.
Legislative action is live-streamed and archived on the General Assembly’s website.

The Colorado House and Senate gaveled in for the special session shortly after 10 a.m. After some procedural business, the chambers recessed to start committee work for the first introduced bills.
Earlier this morning, the caucuses laid out their priorities in separate press conferences.
“We’ve got our work cut out for us. We’re back to address a $1 billion budget shortfall thanks to Trump and Republicans in Congress — $1 billion that should be invested in Colorado, for Colorado, but instead is for tax breaks for corporations and the ultra wealthy,” Senate President James Coleman, a Denver Democrat, said.
The Republicans were less optimistic.
“When we walk away from this session, the Democrats will have increased taxes. The Democrats will have done nothing to cut General Fund spending — that’s the $700 million we’re in the red — and the Democrats will not have rebalanced the state’s budget,” Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, a Brighton Republican, said.
In addition to finding solutions to that revenue shortfall, Gov. Jared Polis tasked lawmakers with addressing health insurance premium costs, tweaking the state’s artificial intelligence law and shoring up food assistance program funding.
Committee work will begin around 11:30 a.m.

BESSEMER — Residents living near the site of a proposed 4.5 million square foot data center delight in even small victories.
Their satisfaction was apparent as they exited Bessemer’s City Council chambers, where community members wearing red in opposition to the plan had once again filled the room to capacity.
On Tuesday, City Council members voted unanimously to send a recommendation to approve rezoning and a development plan for the project back to Bessemer’s planning and zoning commission for further consideration, a move that is likely to delay a final vote on the project for weeks.

Mary Rosenboom smiled outside the council chambers Tuesday but said she knows that even with a delay, the battle is just beginning.
“Any delay is good,” Rosenboom told Inside Climate News. “For the sake of saving themselves from embarrassment, the council framed this delay as caring for the community. But in the end, this is about the almighty dollar.”
The rezoning of around 700 acres of wooded land from agricultural to light industrial would facilitate the construction of a hyperscale data center. The delay comes on the heels of a letter sent to the council, signed by environmental lawyers, community groups and impacted residents opposed to the facility’s construction, which could take up to 10 years.
The letter emphasized legal, logistical and environmental concerns around the council’s consideration of a development and rezoning plan supported by Logistic Land Investments LLC, the developer behind the proposed data center.
“We urge you to take this zoning proposal into careful consideration for the citizens of Bessemer, their neighbors, and all Alabamians. As the record stands now, there are simply too many unanswered questions for the City Council to approve this rezoning proposal,” the letter said.
In addition to residents, signatories included representatives of the Southern Environmental Law Center, Alabama Rivers Alliance, Black Warrior Riverkeeper, Center for Biological Diversity, Energy Alabama, the air pollution nonprofit GASP and the People’s Justice Council. They said the project would have serious implications for air quality, consume massive amounts of energy and water, threaten imperilled and endangered species and burden communities already impacted by outsized environmental risks.
During Tuesday’s meeting, city attorney Aaron Killings read a prepared statement saying that the council had determined that it “may be beneficial to ensure full consideration of public input and consistency with city zoning and comprehensive planning objectives” to refer the project back to Bessemer’s planning and zoning commission.

That body has twice recommended approval of the proposals. After its first recommendation, a lawsuit by residents over allegedly improper public notice led to a temporary restraining order that prevented the council from considering the matter. Tuesday’s vote, then, was the council’s reaction to the commission’s second vote to recommend approval.
After the council voted unanimously to send the issue back to the planning and zoning commission for a third round, Council President Donna Thigpen relayed a message for those in attendance.
“We’re hearing you,” she told the packed room. “Don’t think we’re not hearing you.”
Rosenboom said the $14.5 billion project will ultimately make its way back to council members.
“In my heart, I want to trust them, but in the end, I just don’t know,” she said.
Representatives for the developer did not appear to be present for Tuesday’s 9 a.m. meeting, which to Rosenboom suggested that the council had already planned its decision ahead of time. Residents have had to repeatedly adjust their schedules to pack the city’s council chambers for meeting after meeting, she said, all to ensure that they’re given the same consideration as the project’s developer.
“People have to take off work and change their schedules. We have to make sacrifices to be there,” she said. “They’re trying to wear us down.”
She said she believes that the council delayed final consideration of the proposal to ensure that all procedural boxes have been adequately checked, particularly in light of the letter from environmental lawyers and community groups, as a way of staving off any potential legal challenges down the road.
The delay, while a small victory for residents, should be seen for what it is, Rosenboom said.
“I want to see the beauty in it, but you can’t look this monster in the face and make it beautiful,” she said.
Despite the obstacles of challenging such a large project, she said she and other residents are prepared for what’s to come.
“We’re fighting. We’re going to use every tool available in our arsenal,” she said. “This developer needs to tuck their tail and run.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Vote-no-Bessember-for-Aug-21-2025-story-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-21 12:57:25.209930

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)LOUISVILLE — Republican megadonors Joe and Kelly Craft again joined Central Bank in bidding $10 million on a country ham for charity. 
Kelly Craft, a former United Nations ambassador and 2023 Republican gubernatorial candidate, and her husband, coal executive Joe Craft, have had the winning bid at the annual Kentucky Farm Bureau Country Ham Breakfast during the state fair in Louisville for years. The two were not present at the breakfast, but sent Jennifer Barber, of law firm Frost Brown Todd, to make the winning bid with Central Bank Thursday morning. The Crafts and the bank donated $5 million each. 
While the ham auction is the star of the breakfast, Kentucky politicians flock to the event to campaign and meet movers and shakers. Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell emphasized his longtime record in office while addressing the crowd. Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul was invited but did not attend. 
The three Republicans hoping to replace McConnell — U.S. Rep. Andy Barr, former Attorney General Daniel Cameron and Lexington businessman Nate Morris — took the opportunity to mingle with breakfast-goers and give interviews to reporters. 
Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear was invited to speak, but did not attend this year. However, Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman, a possible candidate for the state’s 2027 governor race, went to the breakfast. 
A video tribute by the Kentucky Farm Bureau to McConnell highlighted the senator’s influence on Kentucky and American politics, particularly in agriculture. The video emphasized McConnell’s role in landing President Donald Trump three appointments to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
McConnell and his wife, former Secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor and U.S. Department of Transportation Elaine Chao, received standing ovations from the crowd. McConnell’s remarks about his start in politics to now echoed much of what he has said at recent appearances in Kentucky. McConnell spoke about international issues, saying he was “skeptical” of Trump’s push for tariffs on imported goods and that “Ukraine needs to have a

deal that they can live with, that needs to be enforceable, because that sends a message around the world” to adversaries of the U.S. 
“There’s always a lot of talk about who’s popular and who isn’t,” McConnell said, alluding to polls that have shown dissatisfaction with the longtime senator. “Let me tell you how to measure popularity. It’s winning elections. Thanks to you, I won seven Senate races, nine leader races. I’m undefeated at the end of my long game.”
One of the candidates in the GOP Senate primary, Morris, has made his disapproval of McConnell a central message of his campaign. After the breakfast, Morris said that McConnell’s recently focused on “what he’s brought back. 
“What he doesn’t tell you is the policies that he supported have destroyed the Kentucky economy,” Morris told reporters. . “And what I want to be known for is bringing policies that are conducive to our farmers, people that work in our factories, families like mine that got impacted by NAFTA, people losing their job, getting laid off, have their job sent to Mexico.”
Barr told reporters that he is supportive of Trump’s trade policies “precisely because I believe in free trade.” Barr added that he will soon meet with the Japanese ambassador at Beam Suntory and Toyota plants to discuss trade.

“The bottom line is, I understand what the senator is saying about a trade war, but what the president is doing is actually achieving the very objective that the senator is seeking, which is more open access to American and Kentucky exports,” Barr said. 
Cameron, too, was complimentary of Trump ahead of the breakfast. The president has not made an endorsement in the competitive Senate primary, but the candidates have attempted to tie themselves closer to Trump’s positions in recent months. 
Cameron said he believed “we could very well be on the verge of some significant peace agreements in this country, in this world.” Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has returned to the White House this week and Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met in Alaska days ago. 
“I think a lot of it started because our president was willing to show force when it came to Iran,” Cameron said. “And now you’ve brought Putin to the table. Zelenskyy is back at the table. So many European leaders were meeting at the White House yesterday. A lot of them were lauding the fact that this president has brought all these divergent parties to the table to have a conversation around peace.” European leaders joined Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House Monday.

Eddie Melton, the president of the Kentucky Farm Bureau, introduced speakers for the breakfast and recognized many elected officials in attendance, including members of the General Assembly. 
“One thing that makes this special is that we have a lot of political leaders that come here to this ham breakfast and get to work through the crowd here, and we laugh about it, don’t we, President (Robert) Stivers?” Melton said, calling to the Republican state Senate president in the crowd. “But it is, it is good, and we do appreciate y’all coming out and being here with us today.”
Barber, the Craft’s representative, told reporters after the auction the money will support charities including the Barren County Boys and Girls Club, the Craft Academy at Morehead State University and building homes in Eastern Kentucky.
“The Crafts are thrilled to be able to once again contribute to Kentuckians and help improve the lives of Kentuckians,” Barber said. 
KFB said the auctioned ham weighs 16.5 lbs. and was produced by Josh Poling of Broadbent’s Country Hams in Kuttawa in Lyon County.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_4947-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-21 12:57:25.209930

The Florida Central Operations and Coordination Office opened as the division’s director, Kevin Guthrie, fended off comments suggesting the state hasn’t been preparing for hurricane season. 
“This is more than a building, it’s a strategic expansion that places logistics and personnel where they can have the greatest impact,” Guthrie said at the facility in Auburndale. 
It’s located near Interstate 4 can hold 300 personnel and provides storage for resources like water, food, tarps, medical supplies, and trailers. The facilities has a helipad to assist in faster deployments during emergencies.

“Within the last 24 hours it’s been suggested by some that we don’t use taxpayer dollars to keep Floridians safe. That is false and it is proven with this facility and this opening that that is just 100% false information,” Guthrie said. 
It wasn’t exactly clear what Guthrie was referencing, but on Wednesday state Rep. Alex Andrade went on a social media posting spree criticizing Lt. Gov. Jay Collins’s trip to California to extradite a truck driver charged with vehicular homicide, calling it “the most expensive police ‘ride along’ a politician has ever done.”
Democrats especially have criticized the division recently, slamming the its involvement in immigrant deportation centers during hurricane season. 
“Our teams have been hard at work over the last month getting this place ready should a storm impact any of our communities. We also have been doing that against the false narrative that we are not ready for hurricane season. We can walk and chew gum at the same time, so we’re going to do that,” Guthrie said.

“With this expanded space, additional features, advanced features, enhanced logistics — this warehouse squarely puts Florida at the forefront of modern emergency management,” Guthrie said, encouraging Floridians to do their part in preparation by reviewing disaster plans and supplies. 
The state acquired the more-than 422,000 square feet warehouse last year following a vote of the Cabinet. Last year’s budget provided $116 million for project, $75 million of which was allocated for the purchase, the rest for the retrofitting. Guthrie said Thursday that the project was finished “technically under budget.” 
“It was about a dollar under budget, but we came in under budget,” Guthrie said.
Guthrie said some 75 positions managing Central Florida operations will move from the Tallahassee office to Auburndald and that there will be more media activity in that facility when responses are activated.

Jim Pillen has issued a state disaster declaration for 23 central and eastern Nebraska counties as a result of severe wind and thunderstorms Aug. 8-11.
The state estimates the “exceptionally” high winds, heavy rain and flooding caused $24 million in damage to public property and infrastructure. Damage estimates are likely to increase as the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency begins required preliminary damage assessments with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, a NEMA spokesperson told the Nebraska Examiner.

The Nebraska State Penitentiary in Lincoln was among the damaged properties, with storms ripping off the roofs of two housing units and displacing 387 inmates, 137 of whom were sent to temporary housing at Omaha and Tecumseh facilities.
The two State Pen housing units are expected to be operational again by late September, according to the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services. A department spokesperson confirmed damage estimates at the prison are still being tabulated.
The NEMA spokesperson said some damage to the prison, after insurance, may be eligible under the disaster aid.
Blair and Lincoln also were among those hit hard by the hurricane-force winds. At least 78,000 Nebraskans lost power from the storm, according to Nebraska Public Media reporting.
The disaster declaration opens up state disaster-aid funding and directs the Nebraska adjutant general, the state’s disaster response coordinator, to help the affected areas “until such time as the threat to life and property created by the situation has been alleviated.”
The declaration covers the counties of Burt, Butler, Cass, Dodge, Douglas, Fillmore, Gage, Harlan, Jefferson, Johnson, Lancaster, Nemaha, Nuckolls, Otoe, Pawnee, Saline, Sarpy, Saunders, Seward, Thayer, Washington, Webster and York.

Honduran and Nicaraguan holders will lose their status by Sept. 8.The judges on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals — Michael Daly Hawkins, Consuelo M. Callahan and Eric D. Miller — did not give a reason for their decision. Former President Bill Clinton nominated Hawkins, former President George W. Bush nominated Callahan and President Donald Trump nominated Miller in his first term.Wednesday’s decision pauses a late July ruling from California District Judge Trina Thompson that found Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s decision to end deportation protections for those nationals to be rooted in racism.Instead, Thompson extended TPS for nationals from Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua until Nov. 18 while the case proceeded through the courts.“The freedom to live fearlessly, the opportunity of liberty, and the American dream. That is all Plaintiffs seek,” Thompson wrote in her 37-page ruling. “Instead, they are told to atone for their race, leave because of their names, and purify their blood. The Court disagrees.”As the Trump administration aims to carry out its plans of mass deportation of immigrants in the country without legal authorization, DHS has also moved to end the temporary legal status many immigrants have held.Noem has acted to halt TPS for nationals from Haiti and Venezuela and end humanitarian protections for those from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The Supreme Court has allowed, for now, many of those moves by the Trump administration.DHS praises decisionDHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin in a statement called the decision from the appeals court a victory for the Trump administration.“TPS was never meant to be a de facto asylum system, yet that is how previous administrations have used it for decades while allowing hundreds of thousands of foreigners into the country without proper vetting,” McLaughlin said. “This unanimous decision will help restore integrity to our immigration system to keep our homeland and its people safe.”Certain nationals are granted TPS because their home country is deemed too dangerous to return to due to war, disaster or other unstable conditions.Immigrants who are granted TPS go through vetting by DHS, including a background check, and have to re-apply roughly every 18 months to keep work permits and have deportation protections. A misdemeanor could result in the loss of TPS status for an immigrant. ‘Fear and uncertainty’“I am heartbroken by the court’s decision,” Sandhya Lama, a TPS holder from Nepal who is a plaintiff in the case, said in a statement.“I’ve lived in the U.S. for years, and my kids are U.S. citizens and have never even been to Nepal. This ruling leaves us and thousands of other TPS families in fear and uncertainty,” Lama continued.Many immigrants are on TPS for lengthy periods due to their home country’s condition. Those from Nepal had TPS for more than 10 years and those nationals from Honduras and Nicaragua were on TPS for more than 26 years, attorneys at the American Civil Liberties Union, which is one of the groups that filed the suit, said.“This administration’s attack on TPS is part of a concerted campaign to deprive noncitizens of any legal status,” Emi MacLean, an attorney at the ACLU Foundation of Northern California said in a statement. “(Wednesday’s) ruling is a devastating setback, but it is not the end of this fight. Humanitarian protection–TPS–means something and cannot be decimated so easily.”Organizations that filed the suit include the ACLU Foundations of Northern California and Southern California, the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at the UCLA School of Law and the Haitian Bridge Alliance.",,,,2025-08-21 12:57:25.209930

They grew up together in the small north Mississippi town of Marks, both raised by devoutly Christian families. 
Marks has struggled with poverty for generations, and problems were compounded by Mississippi’s history of underfunding public education for Black students. Schools remained segregated, and both said it was common for Black children around them to drop out or miss school so they could work in the fields.

“That was the life we knew, the life we inherited,” Hilliard Lackey said. 
Hilliard and Lillian met as classmates in sixth grade, started dating in high school and married in 1966. Despite the challenges of the time, their parents and church leaders encouraged them to be ambitious and succeed.
Today, several members of the Lackey family have doctoral degrees: Hilliard and Lillian Lackey; their daughters, Tahirih Lackey and Dr. Katrina Davis; the couple’s daughter-in-law, Tracy Knight Lackey; and his stepbrother and sister-in-law, Dr. Robert Long and Vanessa Rogers Long.

Tracy Knight Lackey
Pew Research Center found that as of 2023, about 26% of all Black Americans 25 and older have a bachelor’s degree or higher, and 11% have advanced degrees. In Mississippi, 18.5% of Black residents have a bachelor’s degree or higher.
Hilliard Lackey is a longtime professor of urban higher education and lifelong learning at Jackson State University. He attended what was then called Jackson State College, earning his bachelor’s in history and political science, pre-law track, in 1965. (It became Jackson State University in 1974.)
Hilliard Lackey – who later earned a master’s degree in educational administration, an education specialist degree in the same topic, and a doctorate in higher education administration – was the first in his family to go to college. 
“I left home and came to a whole new city, a whole new environment. It’s a college,” he said, looking back on the experience. “And I was astounded, and scared, and frightened and bewildered.”

Lillian, then still named Troupe, attended Coahoma Community College before transferring to what was then called Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College – since 1974, Alcorn State University. She graduated from Alcorn with a bachelor’s in business education in 1966 and earned a masters in education administration from Jackson State in 1974. 
She was still living and working in Marks during community college.
“I went to Coahoma … rode the school bus, came home, got out of my clothes, went to the field, picked cotton,” she said. “And so I picked my way out of the cotton field to Alcorn.”

In June, West Coast Bible College & Seminary awarded Lillian Lackey an honorary doctorate for her years of community service. 
Two of Hilliard and Lillian Lackey’s four children have doctorates. Davis has a medical degree and is a urogynecologist. Tahirih Lackey has a doctorate in civil environmental engineering and is a research hydraulic engineer at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Research and Development Center.

Dr. Katrina Davis
Both sisters say their parents’ emphasis on education and success and their religious faith influenced their career paths. 
Davis recounted that every Sunday, each member of the family stood in front of the fireplace and discussed what they’d done that week to achieve their goals. She and her siblings attended a variety of academic and athletic summer programs before and during college.
Hilliard and Lillian Lackey converted from Christianity to the Baha’i faith as adults. They raised their children “essentially as Christian Baha’is,” according to Hilliard Lackey, and let them choose what religion to follow when they were 15 years old.
“They pretty much told us, ‘Whatever you want to be, you can be, and we’ll be there to help you,’” Davis said.
“I would recognize that my parents, they were always helping other people. Like, throughout my whole life they demonstrated those concepts,” Tahirih Lackey said.

Tahirih Lackey
“None of us thought we had any barriers,” Davis said. “If there were barriers, they were from our own mental blocks.”
Hilliard Lackey’s stepbrother, Dr. Robert Long, is a dentist in Clarksdale. Long also credits his upbringing for his success, saying his parents raised him and his siblings with a strong work ethic and Christian values.
“They instilled in us that nobody is going to give you anything, nobody is obligated to give you anything,” Long said.
Long grew up in a small rural town in Quitman County, 15 miles from Marks. He had a similar upbringing to Hilliard Lackey. His parents encouraged him to get an education. 
He attended Earlham College, where he majored in biology and found a mentor who inspired him to become a dentist.
He described his undergraduate experience as a “culture shock” and an “academic shock.” He chose to persevere through the challenges.
“I knew I could go home,” he said, “but I didn’t want to go home.”

Vanessa Rogers Long and Dr. Robert Long
Vanessa Rogers Long grew up in a middle-class family in the small community of Memphis, Mississippi, and, like most of her family, has lived a life dedicated to service.
She was the first Black hospital administrator for the Mississippi Department of Corrections. She founded Mississippi Delta Connection, which is part of Links Inc. She also mentors teens on service and leadership skills. She has received several honors, including having her sorority,  Alpha Kappa Alpha, dedicate a bench to her at her alma mater, LeMoyne-Owen College. 
“Service is what I do,” she said.
Hilliard and Lillian Lackey are also deeply involved in community service, including their “Lackey Scholars” program inspired by a former teacher. Hillard Lackey estimates they’ve helped more than 500 high school students from Quitman County attend and graduate from Jackson State since 1967. In addition, they mentor dozens of students from Quitman County’s Madison Shannon Palmer High School to act as role models for their peers and the community.

“That’s just been our thing, it’s always been,” Lillian Lackey said. “To help somebody, if they were hungry, if they were cold, if they were whatever.”
When asked what he would tell first-generation college students, Hilliard Lackey said: “Education is an equalizer. It gives an advantage to the disadvantaged. It levels the legacy playing field.”

Boston’s two leading public media executives say that rebuilding trust and community are the keys to survival in the face of the loss of $1.1 billion in federal funds for public broadcasting over the next two years. 
The post At a moment of crisis, Boston’s top two public media leaders argue that building community is the way forward. They’re right.  appear[...]","AT A MOMENT when public broadcasters are staggering from the loss of $1.1 billion in federal funds over the next two years, Boston’s two leading public media executives say that rebuilding trust and community are the keys to survival. 
“I think the best way to build trust is from the local community up,” said Susan Goldberg, president and chief executive of GBH, which operates television, radio, and digital platforms. She touted the radio station’s studio at the Boston Public Library as a way for people to come in “and watch us create the content in front of them,” saying: “I think it’s that kind of transparency that can help build back trust.” 
Margaret Low, chief executive of WBUR Radio, agreed, observing that her station reaches beyond its airwaves and digital presence through events at its CitySpace venue and through such initiatives as the WBUR Festival. 
“There’s something very powerful about bringing people together in a place to talk about some of the most pressing issues of the day,” she said. “And it’s different than the one-to-many that broadcasting is, or even a newsletter is. It’s actually people feeling like they’re part of something bigger than themselves, that they’re part of a community.” 
Goldberg and Low spoke Wednesday at a webinar sponsored by the New England chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists. The theme of the evening was survival. Earlier this summer the Republican-controlled Congress, acting at the behest of President Trump, eliminated the budget for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), a semi-independent agency that provided funding for PBS, NPR and local public television and radio stations. 
Though public media outlets receive a majority of their funds from private grants, donations, and corporate underwriting, a number of stations — especially in rural areas and urban communities of color — were heavily dependent on CPB money and are now struggling to stay afloat. Earlier this week a consortium of foundations led by Knight, MacArthur, Ford and others announced an emergency grant of nearly $37 million to 115 stations that are at the highest risk of closure. 
The irony is that even though national operations at PBS and NPR will suffer less than some of their member stations, studies such as a 2024 survey by the Pew Research Center show that local news outlets remain more trusted than national organizations, which have gotten hopelessly caught up in the partisanship that is tearing the country apart. Even as mainstream outlets attempt to reassure their audience that they are dedicated to fair, truth-telling journalism, critics rail that they are hopelessly biased. 
These claims are especially loud on the right, as years of deriding sources such as The New York Times, The Washington Post and, yes, NPR and PBS as “fake news” have taken a toll. The latest survey from Pew, for instance, shows that 73 percent of Democrats and respondents who lean Democratic say that journalists’ role in society is “extremely” or “very” important, whereas only 45 percent of Republicans and Republican leaners say the same. 
Evidence suggests that robust community journalism can offset such polarization, with one study even showing that readers of a newspaper that eliminated national opinion content and replaced it with local commentary for just one month demonstrated a measurable decline in partisanship. Communities without reliable news and information suffer from lower voter turnout in local elections, fewer candidates running for office, and other civic ills. Yet local news is in crisis, with one recent study finding that there are 75 percent fewer journalists working in local news today than in 2007. 
A thriving public media ecosystem could help solve the local news crisis and ease the partisan divide. Unfortunately, Trump and the MAGA movement want to move in the opposite direction. 
Both GBH and WBUR produce a variety of national and local programming. Susan Goldberg noted Wednesday that GBH is the largest producer of national programming for PBS, and that the failure of local stations would harm GBH since they would no longer be able to pay for that programming. 
“There are a lot of efforts under way to help stabilize the system,” she said, observing that PBS has cut member fees by 21 percent so that they are better able to pay for national programming. She added: “We’re going to have to make some hard decisions as well.” 
Likewise, Margaret Low pointed out that WBUR produces two national programs, “On Point” and “Here & Now,” both of which are paid for by member stations. “We may have to make some tough decisions,” she said. “It’s serious. It’s not insurmountable…. It’s hard to know how serious that impact will be.” 
As Low and Goldberg said, though, it’s the connection with the local community that will determine whether public media rises or falls. Both outlets have robust news staffs and cover local and regional news as part of the national morning and afternoon newscasts. 
Unfortunately, financial challenges that arose even before Trump’s second term have forced both outlets to make some painful cuts at the local level. ’BUR canceled its daily “Radio Boston” program last December. GBH-TV canceled all four of its public-affairs programs over the past several years (“Beat the Press with Emily Rooney,” “Great Boston,” “Talking Politics,” and “Basic Black”), though it has revived “Basic Black” as “GBH News Rooted” on digital and has plans to bring back “Greater Boston” in some form as well. GBH Radio also broadcasts four hours of local talk each day via “Boston Public Radio” and “The Culture Show” as well as an hour on Sundays with “Under the Radar with Callie Crossley.” 
With no government funding to fall back on, such locally oriented programming, more than ever, is going to depend on viewers (and listeners) like us. Goldberg and Low said that their stations as well as public media throughout the system have experienced a heartening spike in giving since the CPB was defunded. 
“We have a direct relationship to the audience. The fact that people give even though they don’t have to is astonishing,” Low said, adding: “As we anticipate the year ahead, if we could find 10,000 more donors and have everybody who gives give 10 percent more, that would cover it.” 
Low told the story of a wealthy listener who had never given before and who donated $10,000. Some checking revealed “that he had capacity, as we gently like to say.” He was invited to visit WBUR, and he ended up giving $250,000. “Part of it is figuring out how to tell that different story so people feel motivated to support something that they actually love,” she said. 
Goldberg, though, issued a caution. 
“I don’t think that fundraising alone is going to solve what is going to be a structural problem,” she said. “Long term, it is pretty hard across the system to replace $1.1 billion, or $535 million each year, which is how much the CPB has given. So I do think that we need to think of other really creative ways, in addition to reaching out to audiences, to helping them understand our value. We’ve got to be better. We’ve got to be more clear about what our value proposition really is.” 
Building community, encouraging civic engagement, and telling the stories of the people who live here need to be at the heart of that mission.

Photo credit: Alondra Madrigal/MGNewsThe federal immigration case against a jailed, Spanish-language journalist has been bolstered by the help of a metro Atlanta sheriff’s office, public records show. Mario Guevara’s two-month confinement in immigration detention has drawn outcry from free press and immigration advocates.
Immigration officials’ primary objection to releasing Guevara on bond as he awaits the outcome of deportation proceedings, according to court records, is rooted in how he reports on law enforcement.
The revelation of the close coordination between the Gwinnett County Sheriff’s Office and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to keep Guevara in jail comes amid growing calls for him to be freed, and warnings that the Trump administration and local governments are trampling First Amendment rights.
A team of attorneys representing Guevara, including the ACLU of Georgia,  filed a motion Wednesday in federal court for his immediate release. They argue that targeting Guevara for his work as a reporter is government censorship.

The filing also claims that because Guevara’s continued detention violates his First Amendment right to free speech, it also violates his right to not be “deprived of life, liberty or property without due process” under the Fifth Amendment. Guevara is a caretaker for his adult son, who suffered a stroke during surgery to remove a brain tumor in 2021. His family has also struggled financially since his arrest.
Guevara, who fled El Salvador in 2004 because his work as a journalist put him in harm’s way, has spent over two months in immigration detention, much of that time in solitary confinement, according to his attorneys, Zachary Gaeta and Giovanni Diaz. Immigration officials have moved Guevara repeatedly; he has been held in six different detention centers and jails since his arrest on June 14.

Despite having valid authorization to work in the United States and being granted bond by an immigration judge on July 1, Guevara has remained in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Guevara also has a path to a green card through his adult son.
Records obtained from the Gwinnett County Sheriff’s Office under the Georgia Open Records Act show that in preparation for Guevara’s bond hearing in immigration court, federal officials reached out to the Gwinnett County Sheriff’s Office. Assistant Field Office Director Dan Jones, based in ICE’s Atlanta office, emailed the Gwinnett County Sheriff’s Office on June 18 seeking any information that would help “fight his [Guevara’s] bond request.”
The sheriff’s office provided that information in the form of what appears to be two narrative reports apparently created after ICE made its request detailing a litany of issues against Guevara’s style of reporting, particularly filming undercover law enforcement officers. The reports claim Guevara’s journalism “contradicts societal norms,” among other complaints. Some of the activity documented in the reports happened in February.
A deputy with the sheriff’s office replied to Jones later on June 18 stating: “I will also send over all the synopses we have for all interactions we have had for him. I am just waiting on 2 more from 2 of our investigators.”
The reports were sent to ICE on June 24, but copies provided to the Georgia Recorder were dated June 26.
Jones also requested copies of three just-issued warrants for month-old alleged traffic violations. Guevara was accused of running a red light, using a smart phone while driving, and reckless driving — all misdemeanor charges that were later dropped. The warrants were taken out on June 17, one day before Jones’ email, and four days after Guevara’s arrest in DeKalb County.
Diaz said he finds the timing of the warrants and the creation of the reports concerning.
“They may claim they’ve been preparing this information, but the warrants weren’t sworn out until after he was detained and in ICE custody. The timing of it is baffling,” Diaz said.
When asked for comment for this story, the Gwinnett County Sheriff’s Office provided a previously released statement about the implementation of Georgia’s new immigration law, saying its role is “limited to honoring ICE-issued detainers.”
ICE did not respond to multiple requests for comment. ICE has disputed claims that Guevara’s arrest was connected to his reporting.
‘Antithetical to what Georgia law and the U.S. Constitution grant us’
The reports provided by Gwinnett County appear to form the backbone of ICE’s arguments against Guevara’s bond. On July 1, an immigration court judge authorized Guevera’s release on bond. On July 3, ICE filed a request for an emergency stay of Guevara’s release:

“Between February and May 2025, the respondent confronted local Georgia law enforcement officers and federal agents on five separate occasions while they worked on undercover narcotics, gang, and human trafficking investigations. Each time, the respondent recorded or live streamed the encounter and compromised operational security and the integrity of those investigations by posting videos of undercover agents, their vehicles, and tag numbers. Local law enforcement reviewed the respondent’s public posts and learned that the videos were viewed by hundreds of thousands of people.”
The stay was granted by the U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals on July 7. Guevara remains in custody at the Folkston ICE Processing Center in southeast Georgia.
The newsgathering activities described by ICE and the Gwinnett County Sheriff’s Office are legal under Georgia law, according to Nora Benavidez, senior counsel at the national nonprofit Free Press and a board member of the Georgia First Amendment Foundation, both of which have advocated for Guevara’s release.
“In the case of Mario Guevara, filming people in public places has suddenly been recast as illegal interference or surveillance of undercover police activities — this is antithetical to what Georgia law and the U.S. Constitution grant us,” said Benavidez.
“Sadly, it’s arrest first and find cause later, even if that is through troubling coordination between local and federal officials to get Mr. Guevara’s phone, work materials, notebook. Anything to legitimize his detention after the fact,” Benavidez said. “It’s unconstitutional and a chill for other reporters who might seek to report on ICE or expose government wrongdoing.”
The Atlanta Press Club and other organizations joined calls for Guevara’s release in an August 14 open letter. Addressed to U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, the letter describes Guevara’s arrest and detention as “an erosion of democratic norms.”
While law enforcement agencies do regularly collaborate with each other, Atlanta-based immigration attorney Charles Kuck believes the level of cooperation seen in Guevara’s case is unusual and concerning. “The preparation of such a detailed response reflected here indicates an extraordinary level of hostility to a member of the press,” he said.

“While the police might not like the level of scrutiny that the First Amendment allows the press, it is a bedrock principle of our Republic and one which law enforcement should be trained to deal with,” Kuck said.
Over the past 20 years, Guevara became well-known, if not always well-liked by some, for his coverage of immigration enforcement in metro Atlanta communities. He worked as a reporter for Mundo Hispanico, a popular Spanish-language news source based in Georgia before starting his own outlet, MGNews in 2024. Guevara has a strong following on social media, with just under 800,000 followers on Facebook.
Guevara has said he seeks a balance with his journalism, equally covering stories like the devastating aftermath of immigration raids and profiling crimes allegedly committed by members of the Spanish-speaking community.
“When I have to expose something bad about the authorities, I’ve done it. And when I’ve had to expose something bad about the immigrant community, I have done it as well,” he said in a 2019 New York Times documentary.
The film follows Guevara as he meets with an officer from the Gwinnett County Police Department, a separate law enforcement agency from the Gwinnett County Sheriff’s Office.The officer and Guevara discuss the importance of creating an environment where immigrants can report possible crimes or other dangers to local police without fear of deportation. Guevara has continued to work to create trust between metro Atlanta law enforcement and the Spanish-speaking residents they serve in the years since.
Guevara’s arrest and continued detention shows just how far that community trust has eroded in recent years, according to Gigi Pedraza, executive director at the Latino Community Fund Georgia.
“We’re supposed to be partners in keeping the community safe and this only makes us all weaker and our communities less safe,” she said.
What role did Georgia’s new immigration law play? 
A controversial 2024 Georgia law, which passed the Legislature as House Bill 1105, requires jails across the state to determine the immigration status of any person in custody that a jailer suspects might be an immigrant. If it is believed that the person is in the United States without authorization, ICE may request the jail hold an arrestee so that the agency can come to the jail and arrest that person on additional immigration charges. If such a request is made, the jail is required to hold that person for 48 hours pending a transfer into ICE custody. These procedures, which can lead to deportation, must be followed for any arrest, regardless of the severity of the charge. Any municipality that does not comply with the state’s new immigration law risks losing significant state funding.
When Guevara was arrested on June 14, he was live-streaming from an anti-ICE protest in Embry Hills, a diverse neighborhood in DeKalb County about 20 minutes northeast of downtown Atlanta. The protest turned violent when police released tear gas into the crowd after protesters began to march in a roadway and police claimed firecrackers were thrown at them. Thirty people in total were arrested at the protest.
Guevara was charged with pedestrian in the roadway after an officer observed him stepping off the sidewalk and into the street, in addition to  two other misdemeanor offenses and taken to the DeKalb County Jail. He was granted an unsecured judicial release, also known as a signature bond, which is common practice for low-level misdemeanor charges in DeKalb County. A signature bond allows a person to be released from jail on their own recognizance and not pay a cash bond.
But instead of being quickly released, he was transferred into ICE custody five days after his initial arrest under the terms of Georgia’s new law. DeKalb County later dropped its charges against Guevara — the same charges that enabled Guevara to be taken into custody by ICE in the first place.
Pedraza said she believes that legal uncertainty about some of the new immigration law’s requirements, combined with the bill’s role in Guevara’s transfer into ICE custody, has exacerbated the damage to community trust.
“Once you don’t have due process for someone with a platform as large as Mario, what can we expect for the rest of us?” Pedraza  said.
  Rep. Marvin Lim, right. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
In June, Norcross Democratic state Rep. Marvin Lim, who represents parts of Gwinnett County, sent a letter to Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr requesting clarification of HB 1105’s legal requirements. The attorney general’s office advised that each city or county should rely on their own attorneys’ legal opinions on the matter.
Gwinnett County Sheriff Keybo Taylor attempted to address community concerns about Guevara’s case and House Bill 1105 at a news conference in late July. Taylor acknowledged that his agency may choose to cooperate with ICE beyond the requirements of the law.
“If ICE comes in and they’re conducting an investigation and it falls within the purviews of what we do to get criminals off the street, then we will cooperate,” Taylor said.
Guevara is not currently facing any criminal charges.
When asked about the timing of his agency’s arrest warrants against Guevara, Taylor told reporters that mid-June was the “best time” but did not explain further. The sheriff said at the time that his office had no “hidden agenda” against the journalist.
But his attorneys dispute that statement.Gaeta argues the Gwinnett County Sheriff’s Office was influenced by ICE to take out the warrants to help the federal agency keep Guevara in custody.
“They perceive him as a threat because of what he does as a reporter. Mario reports where the latest ICE raids are, is the first on scene — things like being a communicator and a voice for his community are all being characterized as interfering with law enforcement,” Gaeta said. “In our opinion, this is completely legal work for him to be doing as a reporter.”
Guevara’s lawyers are considering filing a civil lawsuit against the federal government for violation of Guevara’s First Amendment rights. But right now they are focused on fighting to overturn the stay order that is keeping Guevara in ICE custody.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1000001076-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-08-21 12:11:54.049288

That has conservationists worried about the precedent this could set for other at-risk species in the Permian Basin.
Best known for a comical display of courtship during mating season, the lesser prairie chicken causes a ruckus every spring by inflating the bright orange-red air sacs on the sides of its neck and stamping its feet.
Because of habitat loss from the fossil fuel and agriculture industry, the bird’s population has dwindled significantly over the years – leading to a 90% reduction in its historical range.
The bird’s road to recovery has been up and down over the past decade. It was first listed as “threatened” after a significant population decline in 2014. The following year, that decision was vacated on procedural grounds.
After substantial review, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service made the decision to relist the grouse’s population in New Mexico and the southwestern Texas Panhandle as federally threatened in 2022.
Other populations in the bird’s northern range of Texas, Kansas, Colorado, and Oklahoma were separately deemed “endangered” and afforded stronger protections.
This is when the state of Texas decided to sue in 2023, saying the increased protections afforded to the grouse curtailed oil and gas production.
Then, in a drastic shift in agency sentiment, the parent agency of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service – the Department of the Interior – released a May memo asking the presiding judge over the case to undo their listing decision and dismiss the lawsuit.
Interior argued they made a “foundational error” and didn’t have the legal and scientific evidence to list the two lesser prairie chicken populations.
Shortly thereafter, a judge in Texas vacated the 2022 ruling this month.
“That means that you can destroy its habitat, you can hunt it, you can shoot it, you can do whatever you want, subject to any rules that may be in place in the given states,” said Jason Rylander, legal director for the Center for Biological Diversity’s climate law institute.
In a statement to KUNM, Permian Basin Petroleum Association President Ben Shepperd welcomed the ruling, saying the “listing was legally flawed, scientifically unsupported and unnecessarily harmful to the communities, landowners and industries that have long been committed to voluntary conservation efforts for the lesser prairie chicken.”
On the other hand, Rylander is nervous about the precedent it sets for other species in the Permian Basin – such as the dunes sagebrush lizard or Mexican spotted owl.
“What right do we have to decide that some species no longer have the right to exist on this earth,” Rylander said. “Because it’s more convenient for us to let them go?”
According to a March Federal Reserve report, New Mexico’s oil production has boomed recently – surpassing two million barrels per day last year. That’s double the output reported in 2019. A state economic report found the industry generated $15 billion in income for New Mexico in FY 2023.
Overall, the United States is producing more oil than it has ever before.
As it happens, the state of Texas – including state oil regulators – filed a similar suit against the lizard’s endangered listing last year. The dunes sagebrush lizard is native to southeastern New Mexico and across the border in west Texas.
In an effort to protect the lizard, Rylander said they have filed to intervene as the case snakes through the courts.
As for the lesser prairie chicken, the Center for Biological Diversity is considering an appeal.
“What the Trump administration has done is essentially lawless,” Rylander told KUNM. “It doesn’t have any foundation in science, and it is going to potentially cost the Lesser Prairie Chicken its chance at survival.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chicken-copy.jpg,,,2025-08-21 12:11:54.049288

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Despite the Trump administration threatening to withhold funding from Maine schools for allegedly violating federal rules against sex-based discrimination, no funding has been permanently taken away from public schools, so far.
In a heated exchange, President Donald Trump told Maine Gov. Janet Mills during a February National Governors Association event at the White House that she must comply with his executive order barring transgender athletes from competing on women’s sports teams consistent with their gender identity. Otherwise, he warned, “you’re not going to get federal funding.”
In the wake of that, several federal agencies targeted Maine for its inclusive policies that allow transgender girls to play on girls sports teams.  The Trump administration argued the policy is in violation of Title IX, the federal nondiscrimination law that bans sex-based discrimination, and opened several investigations into the Maine Department of Education (DOE). An investigation was also launched into the Maine Principal’s Association, which regulates school sports, and Greely High School in Cumberland after a state legislator posted a picture of a trans athlete from the school on her legislative Facebook page. 
Here’s a running list of all the probes, funding cuts since Trump threatened Maine

In April, the U.S. Department of Education and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services concluded that Maine had violated Title IX and referred their cases to the U.S. Department of Justice. In a statement, the federal education department also said it would simultaneously “initiate an administrative proceeding to adjudicate termination of MDOE’s federal K-12 education funding, including formula and discretionary grants.”
Last year, the Maine DOE received $183.9 million from the U.S. Department of Education, which amounts to roughly 65% of the federal funding the department received that year.
The DOJ’s lawsuit is pending, according to the Maine Attorney General’s office, but neither federal agency withheld any funding from the Maine DOE as a result of their guilty finding, said Maine Deputy Attorney General Christopher Taub.
Withholding of federal education funding was one of the primary concerns Republican state lawmakers cited as they introduced several bills aiming to restrict trans rights this past legislative session, all of which ultimately failed.
Also this spring, several federal agencies began withholding funds from Maine, many of which were challenged or walked back. For example, in April, Maine successfully sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture for freezing school nutrition funding, which federal courts ordered the agency to restore.
The ruling marked Maine’s first legal victory in fighting the Title IX violation allegations, but other lawsuits are still pending.
The USDA, which never launched an official probe, is the only agency so far to withhold federal funding from Maine schools, the attorney general’s office confirmed. The funding was frozen on April 2, and restored by a federal judge’s order on April 11. In a letter to Mills announcing the freeze, USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said “this pause does not impact federal feeding programs or direct assistance to Mainers; if a child was fed today, they will be fed tomorrow.” 
But according to Jane McLucas, Maine’s child nutrition director, the agency froze roughly $2.75 million in funds that impacted various aspects of the school nutrition program. While reimbursement funds for the National School Lunch and School Breakfast programs were still accessible, money used to run those programs — including for the salaries of 12 state employees, as well as funding for office technology and oversight — was temporarily blocked, McLucas said. Also, funding for the Child and Adult Care Food Program, which provides food reimbursements to eligible children and adults in after school programs, child and adult day care centers, was also hit, with providers losing access to “cash in lieu” payments they use to buy food and to administrative funds that cover staffing costs. 
Two months later, Maine also sued the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) after the agency canceled a $9 million grant to the Maine Department of Marine Resources. That grant had been awarded to restore tidal salt marsh habitat and protect coastal infrastructure from flooding. The lawsuit, which is also still pending, alleges that NOAA may have terminated the grant because of Maine’s alleged violation of Title IX, according to Danna Hayes, director of public affairs for the Maine Attorney General’s Office. 
Nearly $50 million in federal funding has also been withheld from Maine’s public universities, as of May, including grants that were temporarily frozen and then restored, terminated or threatened. This funding was cut despite the USDA determining in March that the university system is in compliance with the Trump administration’s transgender policy.
How much of this funding was related to Title IX is unclear, and the university system declined to provide specifics on at least one grant that was withheld due to Title IX, then temporarily restored and ultimately terminated.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Gov. Mike Braun and key administration officials will headline a “policy summit” Aug. 27 raising money for a nonprofit that supports his agenda.
The price to attend ranges from $2,500 for one session and lunch with the governor all the way to $100,000 as a headline partner.
The event is for Hoosiers for Opportunity, Prosperity and Enterprise (HOPE) — a social welfare nonprofit that provided support during Braun’s campaign in the form of policy briefs and polling. The group then expanded its role to helping Braun’s transition into office and ran ads against lawmakers on property taxes during session.
Nonprofit Braun transition group follows former governors’ model

Social welfare nonprofits typically have undisclosed donor lists — which is why they are often referred to as dark money.
The day-long event at the JW Marriott in downtown Indianapolis will include sessions on energy sources and production, road funding, the future of gaming, K-12 education, health care, wage growth, maternal health, tort reform, housing and the state budget.
It begins with a VIP breakfast for partners and also includes a lunch with Braun alongside legislator awards.
Confirmed guests include Braun, his Chief of Staff Josh Kelley, Senior Policy Advisor Adam Battalio and Mitch Roob, the secretary of the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration.
Other cabinet secretaries have been invited. It is unclear if those attending will be on personal time or state time.
Indiana Democrats took aim at the event in a Wednesday fundraising newsletter.
“Next week, Governor Mike Braun’s dark money group HOPE is holding a conference at a luxury Indianapolis hotel where entry costs $5K, and sponsorships to be involved in roundtable discussions cost $100,000,” the email said.
“Twenty-one years of one-party rule in Indiana has made the Republicans so corrupt that they’ll sell you out to the highest bidder without even trying to hide it.”
HOPE’s six-person board is led by Ryan Black, who works for philanthropic organization Stand Together and was previously at advocacy group Americans for Prosperity. Both organizations have ties to the Koch family — super-funders of Republican causes.
Other board members include prominent Republican attorney Jim Bopp, “school choice” advocate Betsy Wiley, retired tax attorney and former Indiana state representative Dan Dumezich, and career lobbyist Jim Purucker.

(Photo by Evan Popp/ Maine Morning Star) Election officials turned over at the highest rate in at least a quarter century during the last presidential election, according to new research from the Bipartisan Policy Center.
An analysis of shifts in election officials published Tuesday found nearly 41% of election officials administering the 2024 election were different than those in 2020. Turnover has accelerated over the past two decades, rising from about 28% in 2004 to 40.9% last year.
The growing percentage of departing election officials comes after years of challenges. They navigated the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as well as harassment and false conspiracy theories surrounding stolen elections that persist today.
The analysis released by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based group that seeks to foster policy cooperation across party lines, represents an updated version of a report that previously examined turnover from 2004 to 2022. The new research, which extends the data through 2024, shows the turnover rate continued to climb.

The change means that, over time, election officials have less experience. The research found that the share of chief local election officials with six or more years in their role has dropped from 60% in 2006 to 47% in 2024.
But last year, 60% of election officials had previously overseen the administration of a presidential election in their jurisdiction.
“Despite increasing turnover and loss of experience, the majority of chief election officials still have experience running at least one presidential election cycle,” the analysis said. “This is important because presidential elections typically see the highest turnout and are the most visible elections administered.”
The analysis found that over the long term, election official turnover rates have been rising gradually in small jurisdictions, defined as areas with fewer than 100,000 voting-age residents. But large jurisdictions have experienced a more sudden jump in turnover.
Small jurisdictions had a 27% turnover rate in 2004 that had risen to 40% in 2024. But large jurisdictions enjoyed a turnover rate as low as 31% in 2018 before climbing rapidly to nearly 46% last year.

(Credit: Cassandra Glaspie)Despite being called a “cruise,” the people on board The Pelican described the experience on the hypoxia monitoring expedition as very different from the elaborate dinners on a towering vacation ship or booze- and buffet-filled Caribbean itinerary.
Passengers describe waves up to 5 feet high in the Gulf of Mexico, swinging the 116-foot research vessel like a pendulum, plaguing anyone who didn’t have sturdy sea legs with bouts of seasickness. Daytime temperatures in late July soared ever higher as sweat dripped down the backs of hard-hat covered heads.
The guests on board The Pelican weren’t seeking pleasure or status. They were unpaid students and researchers who say they weathered the conditions in the name of science itself.
“It’s not glamorous, but it is very important,” said Cassandra Glaspie, assistant professor at Louisiana State University and the chief scientist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s annual hypoxia cruise.
The 11-day voyage provides vital information on the sealife and environmental conditions within the seasonal low-oxygen zone that develops off the coast of Louisiana. The data the cruise collects informs state and federal efforts to reduce the size of the “dead zone” and sheds light on impacts to those who rely on the water for their livelihoods, like shrimpers and fishermen.
Now, after its 40th year and 38th hypoxia cruise, The Pelican’s annually planned journey faces challenges to stay afloat, potentially undermining decades of research and future plans to get the dead zone under control.
 
A decades long struggle 
Biologists, undergraduate student researchers and crew alike celebrated the cruise’s 40th anniversary aboard The Pelican with a party that had an “old bird” theme, chosen to honor the boat, which has also been sailing for 40 years.

More than just an excuse to eat cake (with rainbow sprinkles), the purpose of the cruise is to capture information snapshots of just how bad conditions get in the dead zone.
“We bring water up to the surface. We have a little chemistry lab … to figure out what the oxygen level is chemically, and then we can validate that against what our sensors are telling us,” Glaspie said.
The low-oxygen area appears annually as nutrients, primarily from agricultural fertilizers from the massive Mississippi River Basin, drain downriver and spur algae overgrowth.
Algae eat, defecate and die, using up the oxygen in the water when they decompose and sink to the bottom. Fish, shrimp and other marine life leave the low oxygen area when they can and suffocate when they can’t, putting pressure on the vital commercial Gulf fishery and the people who rely on it. Exposure to low-oxygen waters can also alter reproduction, growth rates and diet in fish species.
Glaspie took over the work of coastal scientist Nancy Rabalais, who launched the maiden cruise in 1985 and led it for decades after. Every summer begins with a forecast of the zone’s predicted size, estimated by various scientific models and measurements of nitrogen and phosphorus throughout the river basin taken throughout the year.
“A lot of times with pollution, you hear anecdotal evidence of how it might be increasing cancer rates or it might be causing fisheries to fail,” Glaspie said. “Here, we have an actual, measurable impact of nutrient pollution in the Mississippi River watershed.”
The Mississippi River/Gulf of America Hypoxia Task Force, an interagency federal, state and tribal effort to reduce the size of the dead zone, uses data from the cruise to determine whether it is meeting its goals.
In the past five years, the dead zone has been as large as 6,700 square miles, and even larger in previous years, reaching nearly the size of New Jersey.
While still more than two times the size that the Task Force wants, the Gulf dead zone was slightly smaller than forecasted this year, about the size of Connecticut at around 4,400 square miles.
Federal and state officials lauded the limited success of the zone’s smaller size in a July 31 press conference held to discuss the results of the hypoxia cruise’s 2025 findings. They also called for continued work.
“It requires strong collaboration between states, tribes, federal partners and stakeholders,” said Brian Frazer, the EPA’s Office of Wetlands, Oceans and Watersheds director.
Mike Naig, Iowa’s agriculture secretary, said states should be “scaling up” initiatives to reduce nutrient pollution.
Whether or not this will actually happen is uncertain.
Funding cuts 
Since the Trump administration took office, funding for nutrient reduction efforts upriver as well as money to operate the cruise itself have been scaled back or cut entirely.
The Environmental Protection Agency’s 319 and 106 funding programs under the Clean Water Act are the main funding mechanisms for states to reduce nutrient pollution throughout the Basin. Those grants aren’t funded in President Trump’s proposed FY 2026 budget, said Frazer.
The 106 programs have historically doled out $18.5 million annually, according to the EPA, with additional money sometimes allocated from Congress. The 319 program provided $174.3 million in FY 2025.
The cuts to these programs are not yet final. Congress can decide to add in additional funding, and has in past years.
States rely on both funds to reduce and monitor nutrient runoff in their waters, said Matt Rota, senior policy director for Healthy Gulf, a nonprofit research group. Rota has monitored policy changes surrounding the Gulf dead zone for more than 20 years, and he questions whether current reduction strategies can be maintained, let alone efforts redoubled.
“It’s always good to see a dead zone that’s smaller than what was predicted,” Rota said. “I am not confident that this trend will continue.”
Aside from cuts to reduction efforts, money for The Pelican’s annual cruise is also slipping away. Glaspie said that, ideally, the cruise has 11 days of funding. It costs about $13,000 a day to operate the vessel, she said.
“It’s a relatively inexpensive program” with big payoffs for seafood industry workers who rely on the water for their livelihoods, Rota said.  “This is baseline stuff that our government should be doing.”
Funding for the hypoxia cruise has been part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s annual operational budget, making it a more reliable source than grant funding. But with the Trump administration taking a hatchet to government-backed research, there is increasing uncertainty over whether The Pelican and its crew will embark upon future missions.
This year, Glaspie said, NOAA defunded a day of the cruise. The Gulf of America Council, a partnership group to support the Gulf’s economic and environmental health amongst the five bordering states, stepped in to make up the difference. Glaspie said having that additional day was a saving grace for the research.
“This is a fine-tuned machine, and the consequences for cutting it short are really predictable and well-known,” she said. “If I’m asked to create an estimate of the surface area of hypoxia, and we’re not able to cap off the end in Texas waters, I’m not really going to be able to give a reliable estimate.”
Even without additional cuts, Glaspie said she already conducts the hypoxia cruise “on a shoestring budget.” Researchers on board don’t get paid, and every person who supports its mission – besides the crew that runs the boat – are volunteers.
“It’s tough for me to not pay people. I mean, they’re working solid 12-hour shifts. It is not easy, and they are seasick for a lot of this, and they can’t call home,” Glaspie said. “It doesn’t sit well with me to not pay people for all this work, but this is what we’ve had to do because we don’t have the money to pay them.”

A rapidly changing Gulf
Defunding research as climate change intensifies – creating extreme heat in the Gulf – could further undermine hypoxia containment efforts and the consistency of decades worth of data collection.
“I think the rising temperatures is a big question,” Rota said.
“We have 40 years of data, which is almost a gold standard,” Glaspie said. “We’ve just reached that threshold where we can really start to ask some more detailed questions about the impacts of hypoxia, and maybe the future of hypoxia.”
Despite this year’s smaller zone surface area, low oxygen levels went deeper into the water than Glaspie had ever seen before.
“The temperature drops [as the water gets deeper], the salinity increases, and the oxygen just goes basically to zero,” she said.
In some areas, Glaspie’s measurements showed negative oxygen levels.
“Oxygen doesn’t go in the negative. It was just so low that the sensor was having trouble with it,” she said. ”It’s the first time I’ve seen it like this.”
The smaller-than-forecasted size of the dead zone surprised researchers on The Pelican who saw just how deep the low oxygen levels went.
“None of us really thought until the estimate came out that it was below average size because we’re able to see the three-dimensionality of it. That’s not really incorporated into that estimate,” Glaspie said.
She also noticed unusually large amounts of algae on the surface of the water “like ectoplasm in Ghostbusters.” Toxic algae blooms can kill fish and other sea life as well as poison humans.
“If I had to say what would be important for us to monitor in the future, it would be these algal blooms, and making sure that we’ve got a good handle on which ones have harmful species,” she said.
This is why Glaspie, donned in her sun-protective clothes and work boots, braves the waves, the heat and the journey across the Gulf every year.
“This is our finger on the pulse of our nutrient pollution problem that Louisiana is inheriting from the entire country,” Glaspie said. “We cannot take our finger off that pulse. It is unfair to Louisiana. We have this pollution problem. We need to understand it.”

With billions of dollars at stake, Bayer has gone on the offensive.
Billboards along major highways. A social media offensive.
Tens of thousands of dollars in campaign donations in Missouri alone.
And a major push in at least 11 states to change pesticide labeling laws.
Such efforts by the agricultural biotech company and others are tied to a chemical that, for years, was found on garage shelves throughout America and is still being applied to commercially-grown crops throughout the country.
The battle over Roundup and glyphosate, the controversial chemical it contains, is a case study in how regulation, politics and big business are intertwined in the agricultural industry.
When Germany’s Bayer AG bought Monsanto in 2018, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology company set aside over $16 billion to cover litigation liability associated with thousands of U.S. lawsuits alleging its glyphosate-based weed-killer Roundup causes non-Hodgkin lymphoma cancer. The lawsuits often hinge on whether Roundup should have a warning label.
After losing cases to cancer victims, Bayer said in 2020 that it would pay more than $10 billion to address, through a mix of rulings and settlements, roughly 125,000 claims. The chemical giant also said that by 2023, it would replace its glyphosate-based products in the U.S. residential market with new formulations using alternative ingredients. Bayer Crop Science’s head of communications, Jess Christiansen, said the move was made exclusively to manage litigation risk, as most legal claims have come from residential users, and not because of any safety concerns with glyphosate.
Roundup, with glyphosate as its main active ingredient, is still available for commercial purchase.
Bayer has been involved in 181,000 Roundup cases in total, with 67,000 still open, a Bayer spokesperson said.
As the cost of litigation soared, Bayer ramped up its support to alter pesticide labeling in states across the country. Legislation and litigation go hand in hand; what’s proposed in the statehouse has a direct impact in the courthouse.
Legislation in Missouri and across states from Montana to Florida has looked to address pesticide labeling and product liability.
The bills stated that if a pesticide product is approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or is consistent with the agency’s cancer classifications, it doesn’t need additional cancer warning labels.
Proponents claim this legislation is about protecting access to pesticides, which they say are critical tools for farmers. Opponents claim it’s a litigation and liability immunity shield.
 The duty to warn

While a few similar bills were proposed last year, Bayer and other companies greatly increased their lobbying efforts in 2025.
Christiansen said these bills would ensure any pesticide registered with the EPA — and sold under a label consistent with the EPA’s own determinations — satisfies health and safety warnings. Because the EPA has not determined that glyphosate is linked to cancer, no such warning is required by the agency.
On its own and through various coalitions, Bayer has supported legislation in about a dozen states. As of May, two states have signed pesticide labeling bills into law: North Dakota and Georgia, both of which received praise from Bayer. Bills have failed in several other states, including Missouri, where two identical pesticide bills backed by Bayer died when the session ended in May.
Missouri appeals court upholds $611M judgment in Roundup liability case

Proponents and opponents of these bills cite the most common claim under product liability for these types of cases, but at different ends of the spectrum: the duty to warn.
Failure to warn is frequently raised in product liability lawsuits, such as those against Bayer. Plaintiffs commonly use this to allege a product manufacturer did not provide adequate warnings or instructions about a product’s safe use. A plaintiff then needs to prove that the manufacturer must have known or could have easily discovered risks associated with the product but failed to warn consumers, resulting in the plaintiff’s injury.
Tort liability is the legal responsibility that comes from causing harm as a result of a wrongful act or omission. Bayer has argued that it does not have tort liability because the EPA has already assessed glyphosate and determined it is not a probable carcinogen.
Some argue that a cancer warning is good for transparency and right-to-know reasons, said Penelope Fenner-Crisp, the former senior science advisor to the director, EPA Office of Pesticide Programs. But adding short statements to labels does not reflect the nuances associated with assessing chemical exposures. which is one reason the EPA does not require a cancer warning, Fenner-Crisp said.
Christiansen said that “if a company like Bayer goes through this rigorous scientific process with the EPA, and we label the product how we’re legally required to label it, then we’ve satisfied the duty for health and safety warning.”
The stakes are high, and not just for Bayer.
More than 25,000 lawsuits alleging glyphosate caused the plaintiffs’ non-Hodgkin lymphoma and failed to warn them about potential danger are pending in Cole County, Missouri, according to reporting by the Missouri Independent. In 2023, three plaintiffs were awarded $1.56 billion, which was later reduced to $622 million. After Monsanto appealed, the court upheld the original ruling in late May of this year.
And Bayer isn’t the only litigation target; Syngenta has faced backlash from the chemical paraquat.
Thousands are suing chemical giant Syngenta, which sells paraquat under the product name Gramoxone. Lawsuits allege the weedkiller led to Parkinson’s disease, which destroys motor functions.
The company has disputed the allegations, stating that there is no connection between paraquat and Parkinson’s disease. Yet records released in litigation show Syngenta scientists found that paraquat had the potential to damage the brain and nervous system, first reported by The Guardian.
The first federal trial alleging that glyphosate in Roundup caused the plaintiff to develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma was in Hardeman v. Monsanto, using failure-to-warn claims. The case made it all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which in 2022 determined there was no need to reconsider the lower courts’ rulings in favor of Edwin Hardeman’s claim. Hardeman’s $25.2 million in damages remained intact.
“Our issue in the lawsuit was that Monsanto should not have concealed the truth and should have told consumers about the risk of cancer,” said Jennifer Moore, an attorney who represented Hardeman.
Attorney Matt Clement, who represents roughly 100 cases against Bayer, said his concern with the legislation pushed in Missouri and elsewhere is that it would do away with failure to warn claims. These bills could prevent Missourians from suing chemical manufacturers relating to a lack of health-risk warnings, Clement said. However, it’s hard to determine how the courts would navigate litigation if such bills were enacted.
The legislation backed by Bayer and other companies “would essentially take away the main claim that these folks have seeking compensation for their injuries,” Clement said.
Ethan Duke, co-founder of the Missouri River Bird Observatory, spoke in opposition to Missouri Senate Bill 14 in a Senate committee hearing in January. He said he is concerned about “protecting people’s ability to stand up for themselves” through litigation rather than safeguarding the chemical manufacturers.
Many testified that the warning labels serve a crucial role.
“When you are in the business of selling an inherently dangerous product, product liability 101 says you need to have a warning label on it, otherwise you will be susceptible to litigation,” said Melissa Vatterott, director of policy and strategy for the Missouri Coalition for the Environment. “And so, if agrochemical companies are tired of class action lawsuits, then they should put a warning label on the product or change the ingredients so that it’s not harmful.”

Rep. Adrian Plank, a Democrat from Columbia, agrees, saying litigation keeps corporations accountable.
There is a narrative that multi-billion-dollar corporations are too big to fail, but “we have to understand that there’s got to be a balance,” he said.
Missouri House debate shows GOP split over bill to protect pesticide makers

While no Missouri pesticide labeling bills became law in the 2025 session, an identical bill, House Bill 544, did pass the House. Before that vote, Rep. Doug Clements, a Democrat from St. Ann, cautioned against messing with the judicial process.
“We’re not talking about whether a chemical causes cancer or not. That’s not our job. Our job is to legislate. We have an entire branch of government designed to handle that sort of thing,” Clements said. “So we need to stay out of it.”
Christiansen said that legislative efforts take time and will continue. Keeping glyphosate-based Roundup on the market won’t be sustainable if litigation continues, she added.
If farmers don’t have access to tools such as pesticide sprays, then the amount of food they can produce and the cost of production would affect consumers at the grocery store, Christiansen said. The legislation “is really in support of protecting access to products that go through really rigorous, scientifically backed processes.”
Companies should be held accountable if they’re doing something wrong, Christiansen said, but Bayer is not.
“These bills are not blanket immunity. People should still absolutely have their day in court if they deserve that,” she said. “It just makes no sense, particularly in the case of Roundup, where it does not cause cancer.”
 Influencing the debate

Modern Ag Alliance’s website home page displays a message at the heart of the industry’s push for legislative action: “Control weeds, not farming.”
The Alliance’s site lists many benefits of glyphosate:

Pesticides save the average family of four up to 48% on their average grocery bill.

Glyphosate-based products are Missouri farmers’ best tool for controlling weeds and using less land and resources.
The chemical saves Missouri farmers an estimated $358 million annually compared to “pricier alternatives.”

Modern Ag Alliance was founded by Bayer.
Residents in districts represented by nine conservative Missouri state senators who opposed the bills were sent politically charged flyers. The campaign warned that chemicals from Communist China would pour into the state, if the legislation were enacted. Bayer officials said the company was not involved.
The book “Seed Money,” written by environmental historian Bart Elmore, examines the influence of Monsanto (the company Bayer bought) over the food system. His book suggests a “cozy relationship” between the regulated and regulators — chemical manufacturers and the EPA, respectively.
In his book, such evidence includes when an arm of the World Health Organization determined that glyphosate was probably carcinogenic to humans in 2015, Monsanto officials s sent text messages to EPA officials. They were worried about the CDC’s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry’s review of glyphosate, and “pushed” the EPA to ensure both U.S. agencies were aligned in glyphosate assessments.
“The point is, it’s a broken system already, and the confluence of chemicals that are out there is the problem,” Elmore said in an interview with Investigate Midwest.
John Madras, a Sierra Club member who testified against one of the Missouri bills, explained that the negotiation between EPA and the manufacturer sometimes involves a “give and take” on what the label says. “Reopening discussion on the label is a mammoth task,” Madras said.
Fenner-Crisp said that it’s appropriate to have back-and-forth negotiations between the registrant and the agency. If both can talk about registering a chemical and its uses being approved, the registrant can understand what’s required and the EPA can communicate how it would interpret information presented.
Since the 2018 acquisition of Monsanto, Bayer’s political influence has surged. Though Bayer does not make corporate contributions to political parties or politicians, the company has a political action committee. The Bayer PAC and other committees that list Bayer as the contributor name spent more than $151,000 in Missouri during the 2023-2024 election cycle, according to the Missouri Ethics Commission.
Bayer CEO Bill Anderson, met with Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe when the legislative session began this year as a “normal course of business,” Christiansen said.
Rep. Dane Diehl, a fifth-generation farmer who sponsored the legislation, plans to continue the effort in the next legislative session in January 2026.
Bayer officials are happy with how the legislation has progressed this year, Christiansen said, noting that in 2024, when the effort began in three states, none of the legislation passed.
Vatterott, of the Missouri Coalition for the Environment, said lawmakers should resist corporate influence.
“Legislators are voted in by the people, not corporations,” Vatterott said. “They should not be bending backward for corporations.”

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)Democratic Ohio House state Rep. Allison Russo announced her candidacy Thursday for Ohio Secretary of State in 2026. 
This announcement comes a little more than two months after Russo stepped down as Ohio House Minority Leader, a position she held since January 2022. 
“I am running because I want there to be trust and transparency in the Office of the Secretary of State, and making sure that voters feel confident that when they go into the ballot box and cast their votes, that their vote matters,” Russo said in an interview with the Ohio Capital Journal. 

Russo was first elected as a state representative in November 2018 and her term ends on Dec. 31, 2026. She ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 2021, losing to U.S. Rep. Mike Carey 58% to 42%.
“When I think about what is one of the most important, impactful statewide offices, other than the governor, it is secretary of state because the job of secretary of state is to protect the ability of Ohioans to vote,” Russo said. “I am running because I feel that I’m the most qualified to walk in on day one and get the job done.”
Current Republican Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague and retired Air Force intel officer Marcell Strbich are running in the Republican primary for secretary of state. 

Bryan Hambley, a cancer doctor with University of Cincinnati Health, is running in the Democratic primary for secretary of state, and will now be in a primary with Russo.
In a release Thursday, Hambley welcomed Russo to the primary race, saying that he’s looking forward to a positive and honest campaign focused on delivering Ohioans a democracy where every community can thrive.
“My fellow Ohioans have told me, loud and clear, that Ohio needs new voices in state government and a less partisan Secretary of State,” Hambley said. “This is why I am running: to make our elections fair and ensure Ohioans can hold politicians accountable.”
Russo does not think the secretary of state office should be partisan.
“My primary focus will be on making sure that people have access to their right to vote, and ensuring that ballot language is honest, it’s transparent, and respects the intent of voters, regardless of how I feel about an issue that has been brought before us by Ohioans,” she said. 
The Democratic lawmaker from Upper Arlington supports citizen-led redistricting commissions.
“I do not think that politicians should be drawing our own districts,” she said. “I fundamentally believe that if we’re going to truly have a fair redistricting process, that we have to take politicians out of it.”
Russo served on the Ohio Redistricting Commission with current Secretary of State Frank LaRose in 2023 and has criticized LaRose throughout his time in office — from ballot language to redistricting to the money LaRose spent on the 2023 August Special Election.
“I’ve had a front row seat watching how this Republican supermajority and the current secretary of state have undermined both the voice of voters at the ballot box, but also the will of voters,” Russo said. “I feel that fundamentally, voting is a right, it’s not a privilege, and that power should be restored back to where it belongs, and that is with voters and with the people.”
Ohio 2026 election 
Ohio voters will cast their ballot for a new governor in 2026, along with all of Ohio’s other statewide executive offices, as all current officeholders are term-limited.
Dr. Amy Acton, the former director of the Ohio Department of Health, is the only announced Democratic candidate running for governor. Businessman Vivek Ramaswamy and political newcomer Heather Hill are competing for the GOP nomination. The Ohio Republican Party officially endorsed Ramaswamy in May.
Current Republican Ohio Auditor Keith Faber and former Democratic state representative Elliot Forhan are running for attorney general in 2026. 
Current Republican Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose is running for auditor in 2026. 
A Republican primary for the nomination for Ohio treasurer includes former state Sen. Niraj Antani, current state Sen. Kristina Roegner, former state Rep. Jay Edwards and Lake County Treasurer Michael Zuren.
“I think what we’ve seen with these statewide office candidates on the Republican side is just musical chairs,” Russo said. 
No Democrats have yet announced their candidacy in 2026 for Ohio auditor or treasurer.
There is one Ohio Supreme Court race in 2026. Democratic Ohio Supreme Court Justice Jennifer Brunner is being challenged by four Republicans — Rocky River Municipal Judge Joseph Burke, former Franklin County Common Pleas Judge Colleen O’Donnell, Fifth District Court of Appeals Judge Andrew King and Second District Court of Appeals Judge Ron Lewis.
The last time a Democratic candidate won any of Ohio statewide executive offices was back in 2006 when Ted Strickland was elected governor, Marc Dann was elected attorney general, Richard Cordray was elected treasurer and Bruner was elected secretary of state. 
But that does not intimidate Russo. 
“I don’t shy away from hard work,” she said. “I think there is a lot at stake in 2026. We have seen almost three decades of a Republican trifecta, and unfortunately, the outcomes that we have gotten because of Republicans being fully in control of the state have not been good.”
Also in 2026, former Ohio Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown will challenge appointed Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Jon Husted, who replaced JD Vance in the chamber. Husted is seeking his first election to the position.

The first two assertions are correct. The third runs up against the plain text of Florida law and puts the provider and the patient at risk of felony penalties.
Nevertheless, an abortion pill advocacy group is spreading the messages via floating digital boat advertisements across some of the Tampa Bay area’s most prominent beaches this month — even though Florida abortion laws ban abortion pills from being sent in the mail. Abortion medication in Florida must be ordered by a physician and dispensed in person at a clinic or doctor’s office.
Mayday.Health’s abortion pill boat tour is cruising along two coastal routes in St. Pete Beach and Clearwater Beach throughout August with a simple message: “MIFEPRISTONE AND MISOPRISTOL” — the two FDA-approved medications used in medication abortion.
“In a state like Florida, where abortion access has been significantly restricted, many people still don’t know these options exist,” said Tamara Stein, deputy director of Mayday.Health, a health-education nonprofit. “Our campaign is designed to spark curiosity, prompt people to search for information, and ultimately empower them to make informed decisions. It’s bold, it’s visible, and it cuts through the noise.”
Whether it’s through floating advertisements on Florida beaches or through other routes, the message is being received.
A study conducted by #WeCount, a Society of Family Planning project, shows that 13,380 abortions in Florida were provided to pregnant patients under shield laws in 2024. These are legal protections put in place by some states to reduce legal risk for clinicians who offer abortion to states where abortion is prohibited or severely restricted.
#We Count says its data include clinician-provided abortions, defined in this report as medication or procedural abortions completed by a licensed clinician within the United States in a clinic, private medical office, hospital, or virtual-only clinic.
Bree Wallace is director for case management with the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund. She says self-managed abortions with pills are becoming more popular because of websites like Mayday.Health, as well as PlanCPills.org and Aid Access.
“Many Floridians and people in other states with abortion bans use websites like Mayday or other trusted resources to find information about accessing pills on their own,” Wallace said.
One such group is the Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project, or The MAP. In a story published by WBUR in Boston in April, the group expected to mail 2,500 packages of abortion pills in that month alone, “with just over half going to Texas, Georgia and Florida.”
But Wallace stresses: “It’s important that individuals assess their legal risks and utilize trusted helplines to learn more about potential legal risks that can come with that — but it’s very medically safe.”
Those legal risks include breaking Florida law and facing criminal sanctions. Only a physician can perform an abortion here and they cannot use telehealth for medicinal abortions. “Any medications intended for use in a medical abortion must be dispensed in person by a physician and may not be dispensed through the United States Postal Service or by any other courier or shipping service,” state statute reads.
Any person who willfully performs, or actively participates in, a termination of pregnancy commits a third-degree felony, punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.
Tallahassee attorney Julie Gallagher said that means the physician and the patient are breaking the law if they either order or receive the pills in the mail.
“I would say the pills are safe, but it’s not legal to get them through the mail in Florida. You have to go to a clinic and you have to get the doctor to dispense directly to you,” said Gallagher, an abortion-rights advocate who defended an abortion doctor when the administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis tried to revoke her license.
When asked whether patients should be wary of physicians willing to violate the law, she replied: “Do you want to go to a physician who is willing to violate the law? And possibly put you in a situation where you’re violating the law? I wouldn’t.”
Florida’s abortion landscape
Abortions in Florida are legal but only through six weeks of pregnancy, before many women even discover they are pregnant. There are exceptions for rape, incest, or human trafficking when the fetus is not more than 15 weeks old.
Abortions also are legal in Florida through the end of the second trimester to save the pregnant patient’s life or to avert a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment, and when there’s a fatal fetal abnormality. Two physicians must certify that the termination meets the statutory criteria unless it’s an emergency situation, which requires certification from one doctor.
In addition to a six-week ban, before having an abortion a patient must undergo a sonogram and wait 24 hours. Minors must receive permission from a parent. And only physicians can perform abortions.
Options
Abortion rights advocates in Florida argue women need to be aware of what state law says but still need options.
“Florida bans abortion before many people realize they’re pregnant. And not everyone can afford to travel, take off work, or coordinate childcare in order to leave the state for abortion care,” said Cheyenne Drews, reproductive freedom program director with Progress Florida.
“Research shows that with the right information and support, having an abortion at home is overwhelmingly safe, and organizations like Repro Legal Helpline are helping people understand their specific legal risks,” she said.
Mayday.Health was founded in the immediate aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022. The organization does not itself ship pills needed for a medical abortion, but does provide information to patients and links to providers that do.
“We wanted to give people clear, trustworthy, and accessible information about how they could still make their own decisions about their own bodies — even in states with abortion bans,” Stein said.
“The moment demanded action, and we knew we had a responsibility to meet it with facts, not fear,” she said. “We understand that fear is real, especially in a state like Florida where the laws are complex and changing. But people deserve access to information. We believe everyone has the right to make informed decisions about their own bodies — safely, privately, and on their own terms.”
Telehealth abortions increasing
The FDA first approved mifepristone to terminate pregnancies in 2000, initially through seven weeks of pregnancy. The drug blocks progesterone, a hormone necessary to maintain a pregnancy. Another drug, misoprostol, causes uterine contractions and sometimes in applied in miscarriages. 
In 2016, the FDA extended the approval of mifepristone to 10 weeks. In May, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that he had directed the Food and Drug Administration to review its regulations for mifepristone.
The practice of consulting with patients remotely and prescribing them medication via the mail has grown in recent years, with 25% of abortions delivered through telehealth as of the end of 2024, the #WeCount study shows.
More than 14% of the 92,040 abortions performed in Florida in 2024 were provided via telehealth, the report indicates, notwithstanding the law. The group reports that shield laws continue to facilitate abortion access, especially in the 12 states where abortion is banned in the United States.
Challenging the protections
Maggie Carpenter, a physician who practices abortion care via telemedicine, was the first to be criminally charged for prescribing over state lines, and is being protected by New York’s shield law against a lawsuit from Texas’ attorney general and criminal prosecution from Louisiana.
In July, a Texas man sued a California doctor in federal court for allegedly sending abortion pills to his partner. Jonathan Mitchell, former Texas solicitor general, filed the lawsuit July 20 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern Division of Texas, Galveston Division, on behalf of Jerry Rodriguez.
Florida only requires a physician to register as a telehealth provider, which means that the Florida Board of Medicine cannot rescind the license of a telehealth provider who violates the state’s abortion law.
Overall, medication abortions accounted for more than 60% of all abortions in the formal health care system in 2023, according to the Guttmacher Institute. The organization says that refers to data on procedural and medication abortions provided at brick-and-mortar health facilities (such as clinics or doctor’s offices), as well as medication abortions provided via telehealth and virtual providers in the United States.
Abortions are counted as having been provided in the state in which a patient had a procedure or where pills were dispensed. It does not include medication abortions provided under the protection of shield laws to a patient in a state where abortion is completely banned.

A Thursday press release from the Unified Judicial System said the emergency was rescinded “after carefully monitoring current circumstances related to a large-scale technical issue which impacted the State of South Dakota network.”
The state’s Bureau of Information and Technology announced Wednesday that “core” systems like phone lines, state radio, internet access and wireless services were back online, but that “full restoration is still in process.”
During the outage, which began on Tuesday, people couldn’t get vital records, driver’s licenses, vehicle registrations or license plates. For part of the outage, law enforcement was unable to run license plates during traffic stops to check for warrants or access state criminal background records.
The IT bureau has blamed the outage on a power supply problem but did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday morning on the cause of that problem. Previously, it said that the incident was not related to a cybersecurity breach, and that the cause was under investigation.

Research from the Bipartisan Policy Center shows turnover among election workers reached a new high in 2024. (Photo by Spenser Heaps/Utah News Dispatch)Election officials turned over at the highest rate in at least a quarter century during the last presidential election, according to new research from the Bipartisan Policy Center.
An analysis of shifts in election officials published Tuesday found nearly 41% of election officials administering the 2024 election were different than those in 2020. Turnover has accelerated over the past two decades, rising from about 28% in 2004 to 40.9% last year.
The growing percentage of departing election officials comes after years of challenges. They navigated the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as well as harassment and false conspiracy theories surrounding stolen elections that persist today.
The analysis released by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based group that seeks to foster policy cooperation across party lines, represents an updated version of a report that previously examined turnover from 2004 to 2022. The new research, which extends the data through 2024, shows the turnover rate continued to climb.
The change means that, over time, election officials have less experience. The research found that the share of chief local election officials with six or more years in their role has dropped from 60% in 2006 to 47% in 2024.
But last year, 60% of election officials had previously overseen the administration of a presidential election in their jurisdiction.
“Despite increasing turnover and loss of experience, the majority of chief election officials still have experience running at least one presidential election cycle,” the analysis said. “This is important because presidential elections typically see the highest turnout and are the most visible elections administered.”
The analysis found that over the long term, election official turnover rates have been rising gradually in small jurisdictions, defined as areas with fewer than 100,000 voting-age residents. But large jurisdictions have experienced a more sudden jump in turnover.
Small jurisdictions had a 27% turnover rate in 2004 that had risen to 40% in 2024. But large jurisdictions enjoyed a turnover rate as low as 31% in 2018 before climbing rapidly to nearly 46% last year.

It prohibits the ""establishment of religion,"" which the courts have interpreted as a ban on government endorsing one religion over others. (Photo from iStock via Getty Images Plus)It might surprise many South Carolinians to learn that blasphemy is still punishable by jail time in their state — an absurdity that needs to be remedied.
Under South Carolina code section 16-17-520, it’s a misdemeanor to use “blasphemous, profane, or obscene language” at or near a house of worship.
South Carolina is one of only six states that still have archaic anti-blasphemy laws, alongside Massachusetts, Michigan, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Wyoming. These antediluvian statutes date back to America’s colonial era, long before the U.S. Constitution, when church and state were entangled and religious orthodoxy was enforced by law.
You might assume laws like this aren’t enforced anymore. But in Pennsylvania, it happened as recently as 2010. George Kalman attempted to register a film production company named I Choose Hell Productions. State officials rejected his application because state statute says corporation names were not allowed to be “blasphemous.”
Thankfully, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania stepped in. The court ruled that the state’s enforcement of its blasphemy statute violated the First Amendment, which protects freedom of speech and religion. And yet, that unconstitutional law remains on the statute books, just like South Carolina’s law remains today.
Why? Not because anyone is defending it. Not because it’s needed. But because no one has taken the time to repeal it.
Leaving laws like this in place sends the wrong message. It tells South Carolinians that your rights are conditional, that religious speech is protected, but religious dissent can still be punished.
And it leaves open the possibility that someone could misuse the law again, especially since the U.S. Supreme Court has shown a willingness to rewrite constitutional law in favor of religious litigants.
Even conservative evangelical politicians agree that blasphemy laws are wrong.
In December 2019, U.S. Sen. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, introduced a bipartisan Senate resolution calling for the global repeal of blasphemy laws. The resolution condemned foreign governments that jail or persecute individuals for religious speech and nonbelief.
It passed unanimously in the Senate in December 2020, less than two weeks after the House passed a matching resolution introduced by Rep Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, by a vote of 386–3.
Such rare and overwhelming support demonstrates that protecting religious expression, including the freedom to question or reject religion, is a shared American value that transcends party lines.
It’s also worth noting that faith-based religious liberty advocates, including the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty, support repealing blasphemy laws.
They recognize and acknowledge what the Founding Fathers believed: True religious freedom requires the freedom to criticize, question, reject religion, and speak freely without fear of censorship or punishment.
For South Carolina, the solution is clear. Repeal the state’s blasphemy law and bring its statutes in line with established Supreme Court precedent.
Doing so costs nothing, harms no one and reaffirms the state’s commitment to both religious liberty and freedom of expression for all.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/first-amendment-1024x680.jpeg,,,2025-08-21 10:52:18.840754

(Reworld application to Unified Government of Wyandotte County planning commission)KANSAS CITY, Kan. — Activists and community members are attempting to shield a historic Kansas City, Kansas, neighborhood from further industrialization as a recycling company, touting a new age of environmentalism, tries to wedge its way into a local warehouse.
Reworld, a global industrial waste company, wants to open a processing and recycling facility in Armourdale, a neighborhood near the Missouri border enclosed on all sides by a meander of the Kansas River, highways and an interstate.
In Reworld’s bid to the Unified Government of Wyandotte County’s planning commission for a special use permit, the company’s representatives argued that the facility would bring economic development to the area and redirect waste from aging landfills.
Armourdale residents, neighboring property owners and environmental justice advocates raised concerns about inadequate and inaccessible outreach from Reworld, potential traffic hazards, excessive noise, odors, flood risk and the company’s track record in other communities.
Most of all, said Beto Lugo Martinez, a local environmental justice activist with grassroots organization RiSE, the health and safety of a community are at risk.
“At the core of all of this is the health of the people,” Lugo Martinez said, “and the health of the people is what’s compromised.”
Reworld assured the planning commission at an Aug. 11 meeting that all waste activities will be contained within the nearly 94,000-square-foot building that has concrete walls more than a foot thick, and no incineration will take place on site. The facility would accept commercial and industrial waste from companies such as Walmart and Procter and Gamble, which has nearby manufacturing and shipping facilities. The waste would be processed and shipped elsewhere. In some cases, waste would be transformed into usable low-carbon coal alternatives for the cement and limestone industries.
A fleet of around 30 trucks would deliver and transport the materials, resulting in a weekday average of more than 1,200 trips in and out of the facility, according to a traffic memo provided to the commission.
Previously, the building was home to a steel plant and, before that, a silver and lead smeltery, said Greg Kindle, president of the Wyandotte Economic Development Council and a proponent of Reworld’s bid.
“It’s built like a tank,” Kindle said.
But Lugo Martinez is concerned with Reworld’s track record.
The company was formerly named Covanta. It rebranded after it was bought by a Swiss private equity company, EQT. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency criminally investigated Covanta in 2018 for “alleged improprieties in the recording and reporting of emissions data during an October 2013 incident,” at the company’s Tulsa facility. According to public enforcement and compliance records from the EPA, in October 2018, Covanta settled the investigation with a non-prosecution agreement that released the company of charges if, for a year, it satisfied requirements within the agreement and complied with other laws and regulations. The company also paid the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality $200,000 to fund air quality and environmental efforts.
  Residents of the Armourdale neighborhood in Kansas City Kansas, worry about increased truck traffic if global recycling company Reworld opens a processing warehouse in an industrial area that is just a few blocks from an elementary school. (Reworld application to Unified Government of Wyandotte County planning commission)
The company has signed a 15-year lease with the owners of the Armourdale facility, and it committed to bringing in 25 new jobs with a $55,000 annual base salary.
Linda Ribakusky, a spokesperson for the company, said in an emailed statement that Reworld is “excited” to serve the Kansas City community.
“We will continue to work with local community members to address any remaining concerns and questions,” Ribakusky said.
Scott Wagner, executive director of Kansas City, Missouri, environmental nonprofit Bridging the Gap, said Reworld’s project represents a new kind of environmentalism and sustainability.
“Any sort of alternative that can come forward to bring or to push away material going to the landfill only allows more time for those landfills to work,” Wagner said.
The closest public landfill to Armourdale is the Johnson County Landfill in Shawnee, which is expected to be full in the next 20 years.
Jeff Carson, chair of the planning commission, asked during the Aug. 11 meeting if the company conducted traffic, flood or environmental studies in preparation for its application, which it did not.
“Everybody knows Armourdale floods,” Carson said. “It’s been mentioned over and over and over. Basically everyone has lifejackets in their house in Armourdale, so what happens if that facility were to flood?”
The site is located in a zone designated as a minimal flood risk area, said Joe McLaughlin, a Kansas City-based civil engineer representing Reworld.
“Minimal and Armourdale and flood don’t all go in the same sentence,” Carson said.
The company intends to build a six-inch berm inside the building to protect against potential floods, said Andy Purgason, vice president of operations for Reworld.
The majority of commissioners weren’t convinced.
They voted 4-2 to delay for 30 days a decision on whether to grant Reworld’s permit. During that time, the company must meet with community groups and conduct an environmental study.
Lugo Martinez said there is nothing Reworld could do that would make him support the project.
“At the meeting, it was very evident that this industry with no ties to Kansas City is trying to bully their way into Kansas City when they have repeatedly heard from community members that they do not want this chemical recycling industry in their (community),” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kckwarehouse2-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-21 10:52:18.840754

Tommie Cardin, an attorney in the Ridgeland office of national law firm Butler Snow, has listed in his online profile that he is counsel to the chair and staff of the Texas House Select Committee on Congressional Redistricting. 

Cardin Credit: Butler Snow LLP
Cardin and a spokesperson for the law firm did not respond to questions for this story. But Texas news outlets have reported that Cardin is the attorney for the committee, and the House member who filed the redistricting legislation said he received the proposed maps from Butler Snow.
After the U.S. Census is completed at the start of a new decade, states typically use the new data to tweak congressional district lines to account for population shifts.  But President Donald Trump pushed Texas leaders to redraw the state’s congressional maps to flip five safe Democratic U.S. House seats in favor of Republicans. 
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that states can draw electoral maps on partisan grounds. But under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, communities of color must still have an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice. 
The Texas House was set to approve the maps on Wednesday, launching a tit-for-tat battle among Democratic- and Republican-led states. 
California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced last week that he will ask voters in a Nov. 4 special election to approve redrawn districts intended to give Democrats five more U.S. House seats in the fight for control of Congress.
Cardin was perhaps enlisted to help the Texas efforts because Mississippi is in the same appellate circuit as Texas. Mississippi lawmakers also have a long history of tangling with civil rights groups, federal courts and themselves over congressional district boundaries. 
Cardin has represented the Mississippi Legislature in numerous complicated redistricting litigation cases, including its latest congressional redistricting effort. Civil rights groups attempted to challenge the state’s map, but a federal court dismissed the effort over legal technicalities. 
For decades, white Democratic leaders sought to diminish Black voting blocs during the redistricting process. Mike Espy became the first Black person elected to Congress from Mississippi when he won the 2nd Congressional District seat in the late 1980s. (Mississippi had two Black U.S. senators during Reconstruction, when senators were appointed rather than elected. Hiram Rhodes Revels served 1870-71, and Blanche Kelso Bruce served 1875-80.)
In the early 2000s, when Democrats still controlled both chambers of the Mississippi Legislature, lawmakers faced the difficult task of drawing new districts as the state went from five districts to four. 
House Speaker Tim Ford proposed drawing the state’s 1st District to encompass much of north Mississippi and stretching it down toward suburban Jackson. He dubbed his plan the “tornado district,” which opponents of his proposal used to prevent its adoption.
Lt. Gov. Amy Tuck, the presiding officer of the Senate who was then a Democrat but later switched to the Republican Party, blocked the “tornado” plan. The chambers’ two leaders couldn’t agree on a plan, so the courts also drew the congressional maps that decade. 
Cardin helped represent the Legislature in that unusual scenario as well.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06172904/AP_21349657014068-scaled.jpg,,,2025-08-21 10:52:18.840754

But the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced in a memo on July 24 that the department would reduce its workforce and relocate most staff from Washington, D.C., to five locations throughout the country in North Carolina, Missouri, Indiana, Colorado and Utah.

The move would bring the department “closer to the people it serves,” Secretary Brooke Rollins said in the memo. Rollins planned to speak at Dakotafest on Wednesday but was unable to attend.
Gene Stehly has farmed in the Mitchell area for 46 years. He said the staffing decision compounds an already “unpredictable” political atmosphere affecting agriculture.
Stehly incorporated a no-till strategy, planted cover crops, added a riparian buffer and placed land into the Conservation Reserve Program over the last four decades, he told South Dakota Searchlight.
He and his work partner wanted to save time and soil moisture, not realizing initially the benefit their decisions would have on productivity and overall soil health.
“None of it would have ever occurred without federal funding,” Stehly said.
The Conservation Reserve Program specifically increased profitability, he said. The program pays farmers and ranchers to remove environmentally sensitive land from agricultural production and maintain grass, trees and other plant species on enrolled acres. That helps prevent soil erosion, filters runoff that enters waterways, and establishes habitat for wildlife.
Invest in Our Land Executive Director Rebecca Bartels said farmers “overwhelmingly voted” for the Trump administration, and she had hoped to hear more about the USDA reorganization and staffing cuts from Rollins. The conservancy advocacy organization ran a booth at Dakotafest.

A recent report from the University of Illinois projects that the additional funding will infuse another $2 billion into South Dakota conservation efforts over the next decade.
Bartels worries not enough staffers will relocate out of Washington, D.C., to manage the USDA workload. Democrats on the House Committee on Agriculture expressed similar concerns and questioned Rollins’ reasoning for the reorganization in a letter last week.
“It’s great that the funds are protected,” Bartels said. “Now how do we make sure they actually get used and that farmers have partners in getting these practices on the ground?”
“We don’t want to see a dip in program use and adoption because farmers don’t have the support they need to use these practices for the first time,” Bartels added. “Farmers are operating on razor thin margins, so to take a risk and take on a new practice is intimidating.”
Members of South Dakota’s congressional delegation  spoke to the benefits of the conservation programs during a Dakotafest policy panel. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, talked about his recently introduced bill to increase maximum annual payments from $50,000 to $125,000 for the Conservation Reserve Program.

The program expires at the end of September unless it is re-authorized by Congress.
“I want to encourage conservation,” Thune said. “A lot of our conservation policies do that, but we also want to make sure that those are workable.”
The bill would also provide cost-share funds for grazing infrastructure, like fencing and water tanks, and on conservation contracts that include grazing. It would also expand a program that helps landowners plant trees and create wetlands on enrolled acres, and make it easier to produce hay on land set aside for conservation during drought conditions.
Thune said after the presentation that his office will pay attention to whether USDA offices are able to keep up with the workload.
“At the end of the day, they’ve got a job to do,” Thune said. “We want to make sure they get it done efficiently and in a timely way so that producers know what the rules are and begin to make their planning decisions.”

Now, the population of immigrants is decreasing across the U.S.","In summary
California is at the center of President Donald Trump’s aggressive deportation campaign for unauthorized immigrants. Now, the population of immigrants is decreasing across the U.S. 


For the first time in more than 50 years, the U.S. immigrant population is declining, with foreign-born residents either choosing to leave the country or being deported, according to the latest data from the Pew Research Center. 
In January 2025, the immigrant population in the United States topped out at 53.3 million. That number shrank 2.6% to 51.9 million as of June 2025, marking the first decline in the U.S. immigrant population since the 1960s. 
Put another way: There are now 1.4 million fewer immigrants living in the country just months after President Donald Trump took office again, according to the new report from Pew, a nonpartisan fact tank. 
Mark Hugo Lopez, the director of race and ethnicity research at Pew Research Center, said a several factors may be contributing to the decline in population, including policy changes starting with the Biden administration, who put in new restrictions on asylum in mid-2024. 
“There are a number of possible reasons from the natural ebb and flow of immigrants, but also policy, which has made it harder to cross the border and also increased enforcement in the U.S., all of which could be shaping the immigrant population and whether or not it grows or declines,” said Lopez.
An unprecedented number of immigrants — more than 11 million — arrived in the U.S. between 2020 and 2025, Pew researchers found. That included more than 3 million in 2023 alone, the largest annual total ever recorded, according to the Pew analysis of government data sources. 
The unauthorized immigrant population, or those who lack full legal permission to be in the U.S., reached a record high of 14 million in 2023, the data show. 
The organization gathered and analyzed data from the Census Bureau’s monthly Current Population Surveys. The recent downward trend in the estimated total U.S. immigrant population may be in part because fewer immigrants are participating in the survey, researchers noted. 
California has the largest share of immigrants in the nation. In 2023, California was home to 11.3 million immigrants or 28.4% of the national total. Texas had the second-largest immigrant population with over 6 million foreign-born residents, followed by Florida and New York. 
California also has the largest number of unauthorized immigrants, with 2.3 million. The state is ground zero for Trump’s crackdown, where his administration is leading high-profile raids in Los Angeles and issuing orders that target the state’s protections and benefits for immigrants. 
Earlier this week, his administration took aim at a state law that allows undocumented immigrants to obtain driver’s licenses, accusing California politicians of responsibility for a fatal crash in Florida allegedly caused by a semitruck driver who lacked legal status. The driver had a federal work permit. 
In the first 100 days of Trump’s second administration, the president took more than 100 executive actions on immigration, aiming to block the arrival of new migrants and refugees at the border, strip those who entered legally of their temporary protections, and deport unauthorized immigrants. 
Trump has made some of the most significant changes to U.S. immigration policy in the nation’s history, vowing a massive deportation campaign with a reported goal of 1 million deportations in the first year. 
The Pew research did not reveal the most recent numbers of deportations, and its report notes some immigrants may have left the country voluntarily as a result of the Trump administration’s crackdown. His administration has sent people to an El Salvadoran supermax prison where inmates claim they were tortured. Authorities have removed people to other countries where they have never lived, such as Panama and South Sudan, a country considered dangerous by the U.S. Department of State. Federal immigration agents in Los Angeles and other parts of California have aggressively detained immigrants and U.S. citizens, throwing people to the ground and smashing car windows. 
Pew found that the policy and enforcement changes contributed to the decline in the immigrant population between January and June. Unauthorized border crossings fell to levels not seen since the 1960s. Arrests of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border fell to just under 8,000  in July, compared to about 96,000 in December, the last full month of the Biden presidency, according to U.S. government statistics.
This time around, Trump has focused his enforcement efforts more in the interior of the country, leaning on the military and surveillance technology to reinforce the border and moving Border Patrol agents away from it.

Inside the U.S., a large portion of immigrants, about 75%, are here legally, the Pew report says. 
As of 2023, 46% of immigrants were naturalized U.S. citizens. Nearly a quarter were lawful permanent residents, or “green card holders,” and another 4% were lawful temporary residents who were permitted to stay in the U.S. for a limited period of time, usually for work or study. 
The remaining immigrants in the U.S. fell into the “unauthorized” category and constituted 27% of all U.S. immigrants.
About 40% of unauthorized immigrants —  about 6 million people —  have some form of temporary protection from deportation, with some also having a permit to work in the United States legally. 
The Trump administration has rescinded those deportation protections and work permits for about 500,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela who entered the U.S. legally.
The countries where immigrants are coming from has also shifted in recent years. A growing share is coming from South America and Europe, and a declining share arrived from Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Still, nearly a quarter, 24%, of the new arrivals between 2021 and 2023 were from South and East Asia. 
The top countries for immigrants who arrived between 2021 and 2023 were: Mexico (11%), India (8%), Venezuela (7%), Cuba (6%), and Colombia (5%).",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/081525_Immigration-Detain_AP_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-21 10:52:18.840754

Photo by Joseph LaForest, University of Georgia, Bugwood.org If you catch your neighbor staring at a plant and counting bugs, don’t be alarmed – they’re doing science.
Friday and Saturday mark the Great Southeast Pollinator Census, a University of Georgia project aimed at creating a head count of all the creepy crawly critters that help keep Georgia’s plants in bloom.
Last year, more than 18,000 people and exactly 398,269 insects took part in the census across Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida. This year, the count is expected to be even higher as Alabamians will join in for the first time since the count started in 2017.
Agriculture is Georgia’s biggest industry, and little pollinators contribute $600 million a year just by doing what comes naturally, said Becky Griffin, a pollinator health associate for the University of Georgia Extension and mastermind behind the count. But pollinators like bees, wasps, flies, butterflies and others count for more than just dollars, she added.
“Do you like eating watermelon? Do you like peaches and apples and strawberries? Because your plate’s going to look a lot different if we don’t have pollinators, and it’s going to be a lot more expensive as well,” she said. “Do you like flowering plants? Because pollination is not just about what we eat, but it’s how plants make seeds, how they continue their species. So it really does affect everybody, whether you live in an apartment complex in Midtown or whether you have a farm in south Georgia. And the beauty is we can all make a difference.”
Many participants are biologists, entomologists or gardeners, but a lot of people are complete bug-counting amateurs, and even children can take part.
“We have a lot of what we call ‘non-traditional stakeholders’ who also are out there counting,” Griffin said. “An example is people at the Georgia Aquarium have contacted me. They’re out counting. People at the Monastery for the Holy Spirit, they count every year. The Daughters of the American Revolution make a big push for people to count. So it’s not just the biologists and the ecologists, but really it’s all citizens who want to participate in something that’s meaningful.”
Participants can download a tally sheet on the census website and find out everything they need to know, like how to tell a bumblebee from a carpenter bee (bumblebees have fuzzy abdomens while carpenter bees have smooth tummies). When the day comes, the whole job is to watch a pollinator plant for 15 minutes, counting and categorizing each time an insect lands on it. You can repeat it as many times as you want.
It’s a simple job, but the data that citizen scientists gather can be a big deal.
“Growers use the data to determine what kind of insects are in their county, in their area, and what they need to do to up that if they need to. Educators use the data in school lessons,” she said. “There are some peer-reviewed journal articles about the data as well, so it is being used. It’s not just a fun, feel-good project. It is generating important data.”
People ranging from researchers and teachers to gardeners and city planners make use of the data, and with a few more years of counting, Griffin said she hopes it will be of use to scientists studying the declining honeybee population.

(Photo by Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)Hurricane Erin pounded the Outer Banks Wednesday evening, leaving behind floodwaters and closing portions of Highway 12.
But the storm spared most of North Carolina. For the Research Triangle area, it’s been a lull in what feels like a constant stream of raining and flooding this summer.
There have been 134 flash flood warnings in North Carolina so far this year as of Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service. That’s the third most by Aug. 20 on record.
Only two years have had more: 2024 and 2003.

Flash flooding is occurring or imminent, according to the National Weather Service. A warning indicates the potential for a threat to life or property that could result in the need for immediate action to avoid or mitigate the threat.
The past few weeks have been unusually rainy in the Research Triangle, according to Jonathan Blaes, meteorologist-in-charge for the National Weather Service’s Raleigh office.
Official observations for the Raleigh-Durham area are at the airport. It rained nine out of the first 13 days of August for a total of 7.93 inches, more than triple the normal rainfall at that point of the month.
“We’ve already had three times as much rain as we normally do, and even if it doesn’t rain the rest of the month, we’ll have almost double the normal rainfall for the whole month,” Blaes said. “We’re not even at the peak of hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean.”
That’s usually closer to the start of September, meaning storms start becoming more active around this time of the year.
The National Weather Service calculates climate based on a 30-year normal.
Typically in August, the Raleigh-Durham area receives an average of 4.71 inches of rain total. The average rainfall for the first 13 days of August in the Raleigh-Durham area is 2.06 inches, placing 2025 well above normal.
Tropical Storm Chantal brought heavy storms and flooding to the central part of the state in July, including businesses in Chapel Hill.
“Part of that problem is that as the area becomes more urbanized, there’s more impervious surfaces or places where the water can’t soak into the ground. Think parking lots, rooftops of buildings, shopping areas, buildings” Blaes said.
Rain landing in those areas doesn’t get soaked into the ground. Instead, it’s redirected to drains, pipes, and gutters, which then gets dumped into creeks and other bodies of water.
The influx of water in those creeks and streams then leads to flooding.
“That is a pretty significant problem, for sure, and there’s not an easy solution to that,” Blaes said.
But some municipalities in North Carolina are implementing measures to reduce and prevent flooding.
For example, Raleigh is developing a comprehensive plan to address flood resilience in the face of climate change. The city’s Flood Early Warning System helps the public by identifying and predicting flood locations as soon as possible. It’s also working toward creating more green spaces to prevent flooding and runoff.
“The city cannot prevent flooding.  We can only mitigate the impacts of flooding events to protect property and keep our community safe,” Wayne Miles, engineering services assistant director for the city of Raleigh, said in a statement.
Looking at the past four decades, 2024 had the most flash flood warnings on record, with 272 total.
At the start of the year, a strong cold front moved across the Carolinas, bringing about a line of severe thunderstorms. There were 22 flash flood warnings issued in the Tar Heel State on Jan. 9, 2024.
Later on, Hurricane Helene wreaked devastation towards the end of September, particularly in the western portion of the state.
The National Weather Service issued 71 flash flood warnings in the week between Sept. 24 and Oct. 1. There were 46 on Sept. 27, the most intense day.

There have been 11 years on record with more total flash flood warnings than what there’s been so far in 2025.
“Some of the years with the highest number of flash flood warnings were years with hurricanes that produced big flood events,” Nicholas Petro, warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service’s Raleigh office, wrote in an email.
Petro pointed to Hurricanes Helene in 2024, Florence in 2018, and Floyd in 1999 as examples of that.
Fewer flash flood warnings were issued in the 1980s and the early 1990s compared to later years. Petro said he wasn’t sure why there were fewer warnings. Climatologists have attributed the rising precipitation and flooding in recent years to climate change.
The majority of climate models project a rise in annual total precipitation by the middle of the 21st century due to increases in greenhouse gas concentrations, according to the North Carolina Climate Science Report, revised in September 2020.
“Heavy rains from hurricanes and other weather systems will become more frequent and more intense,” the report read. “Annual precipitation is also expected to increase. These changes are driven primarily by increases in atmospheric water vapor as the climate warms.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7182574-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-21 09:57:16.355778

(Photo: Hugh Jackson/Nevada Current)Last year nearly half of all Nevada voters cast their ballots by mail. In the 2022 general election, it was a little more than half. Voting by mail is popular in Nevada.
Donald Trump is promising to kill it. 
Nevada Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo is also not a fan. One of his first proposals as a new governor in 2023 was to get rid of universal mail-in voting. Like the overwhelming majority of legislation and initiatives Lombardo has proposed as governor, it didn’t go anywhere. 
Now, disturbingly but predictably, and perhaps thoughtlessly, Lombardo is gushing over Trump’s war on mail ballots, telling the Review-Journal that he thinks Trump’s executive assault on the laws of Lombardo’s state is just swell. 
From Russia, with malice
As with many issues — TikTok, cryptocurrency, Yucca Mountain, Jeffrey Epstein, etc. — Trump has adjusted his position on mail-in voting in accordance with his situational interest.
But mostly he’s been against it, in a rabid sort of way. He’s conjured up fantasies about make-believe mail voter fraud, part of his long-running campaign to bury democracy under the stench-ridden torrent of fraud and deceit gushing from his own mouth.
Monday morning he belted out an unhinged lie-laced social media post declaring jihad on mail-in voting.
Trump claims the diatribe was prompted by his role model, Vladimir Putin. Trump confided to one of his publicists at Fox News last week that while Trump was lovingly getting lost in Putin’s soulless, murdering eyes in Alaska, Putin told Trump the 2020 election was, as Trump put it, “rigged because you have mail-in voting.”
Putin, Trump continued, told him “no country has mail-in voting. It’s impossible to have mail-in voting and have honest elections.”
“And he said that to me,” Trump humblebragged, so proud that Putin has once again taken him under his wing. “And it was very interesting, because we talked about 2020, and he said ‘you won that election by so much.’” 
Second-guessing Putin on questions of democracy should be done with care; nobody could subjugate and vulgarize democracy in such a corrupt, vile and violent fashion, as Putin has (and Trump is in the process of doing), if they didn’t know at least a little something about it, right?
And yet Putin’s gospel rendered unto his worshiping acolyte notwithstanding, as it happens, the U.S. is not, in fact, alone. A dozen countries let all voters cast their ballot through the mail, and another 22 have varied degrees of mail voting.
Speaking of facts, and the malignant disregard in which Trump holds them, in his social media flameout, Trump asserted: “Remember, the States are merely an ‘agent’ for the Federal Government in counting and tabulating the votes. They must do what the Federal Government, as represented by the President of the United States, tells them, FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY, to do.” 
As approximately … hmm … let’s see … oh that’s right … ALL the nation’s constitutional scholars have observed at some point since Trump busted out that pseudo-proclamation all Queen of Hearts like, he’s so full of it.
Article 1, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution states:
The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators. 
There’s no mention of the president having jack doodley squat to do with that. Not even if the president is Trump.
The twisted vulgarity of Trump’s assertion was underscored, albeit politely, in a statement posted Monday by Utah’s Republican lieutenant governor, who also serves as the state’s chief election official (Utah is one of the few states where, unlike Nevada, the office of lieutenant governor is an actual job).
“The constitutional right of individual states to choose the manner in which they conduct secure elections is a fundamental strength of our system,” said Utah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson.
Utah started sending mail ballots to voters in counties more than a decade ago and eventually adopted the practice statewide. There, like in Nevada, it’s been really popular, though MAGAUtahans enacted a bill earlier this year to phase out universal mail ballots by 2029 anyway. 
But that’s not the point. 
The point — the Utah Republican lieutenant governor’s point — is that no matter how many phony allegations of fraud Trump screeches or how achingly he yearns to render elections obsolete, Trump can’t rewrite state election procedures by edict, because doing that is unconstitutional as hell.
Area man misses the point
Which brings us back to Lombardo. He doesn’t like the idea of sending ballots to all voters. Fine. If he wins reelection and gets to be governor again during a regular legislative session, he’s totally free to once again ask legislators to make it stop.
Similarly, if Lombardo would like to publicly urge Trump to order the Republican controlled Congress to pass legislation to “alter” (as Article 1 puts it) state legislative authority over election proceedings, that’d be a squirrelly request for the leader of any state to make, but at least it would be advising a course that’s more or less within the law.
But no matter what Lombardo thinks about the merits or faults of sending ballots to all voters, that’s the law in his state now, the U.S. Constitution leaves election procedures to his state, and as governor, Lombardo has a responsibility to his state to tell Trump to back the hell off. Whether he’s shirking that responsibility out of ignorance of the Constitution or fear of Trump doesn’t matter, the result is the same either way: Lombardo is facilitating the nation’s deterioration into autocracy.
One of the more insidious markers along the fast path to autocracy in the U.S. over the last six months has been the pattern where Trump does some unconstitutional thing, one or more federal courts say yup, that’s unconstitutional, and then the obsequious Republican majority on the U.S. Supreme Court goes way out of its way to find some futzy and overwrought quasi-rationalization to send it back to lower courts, while allowing Trump to continue doing whatever unconstitutional thing he’s doing for the foreseeable future.
That might be what happens with his lawless assault on states’ rights as enumerated in the Constitution to run their own elections, especially if Republican governors zip their lips and sit on their hands, perhaps hoping that one of these days all the Trump chaos will somehow magically disappear.
Alas, preventing and reversing the U.S. disintegration into autocracy isn’t just going to happen on its own. It will depend on people who will defend the rule of law and stand up to Trump. You can count Lombardo out.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DB8BA576-0193-4AC2-BEDF-808A96E5C978-scaled-e1716417110774-1024x633.jpeg,,,2025-08-21 09:57:16.355778

Authorities in the West African nation threw him in prison because of his sexual orientation, he said. After his release, he feared that if he stayed in the country, he would be killed.
B., who is now 39 and who asked that he be identified only by his initial because he still has family in Cameroon, arrived in the United States with practically nothing. Since he was granted asylum last year, he has been able to use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, to help him get by.
But now most refugees and asylees, who entered the country legally, including B., are no longer eligible for food stamps. The change is part of the giant federal domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4.
“I think it’s unfair. I understand that there are some people who abuse the system,” B. told Stateline. “There are also people who are in need. And cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.”
SNAP, which is funded by the federal government but administered by the states, helps families and individuals with lower incomes supplement their grocery budgets. The program serves an average of 42 million people a month.
New work rules could deny food stamps to thousands of veterans

Supporters of the change note that refugees and asylees can get permits to work, and that they have other sources of support.
“It’s not like they have been dropped off in this country with no support system,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that backs stricter immigration rules.
“They have sponsoring organizations that are helping them get settled and they have work authorization. So they really should be moving forward towards self-sufficiency with support right out of the starting gate. And they should be moving ahead to obtain green cards,” she added, referring to the cards that signify permanent residency.
Vaughan cited a federal grant program that reimburses states and nonprofit organizations for financial aid and health care coverage they provide to refugees.
But critics argue that asylees and refugees, who are extensively vetted and have a legitimate path to citizenship, can wait years for a green card, which entitles them to a wider array of benefits.
They also say community organizations that provide aid to asylees and refugees are stretched thin. Without food stamps, they say, many refugees and their families would not have enough to eat.










Cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.


–  B., a Cameroonian asylee


“SNAP is an incredibly fundamental program for this population that comes to the United States, really, with very little, if anything,” said Nicolas Palazzo, a policy counsel at the global humanitarian and refugee advocacy organization HIAS. “These are people who literally had to flee — many times overnight — with nothing, but, you know, a pair of clothes in a backpack.”
Palazzo also said SNAP is not a “handout” to refugees or asylees. Rather, he said, it’s a “smart and moral investment” that protects all communities and strengthens the economy, offering people a foundation for self-sufficiency.
“Stripping critical food assistance forces refugees and asylees into the shadows of informal work, labor exploitation and hunger that weakens our workforce and denigrates our moral obligations,” Palazzo said.
‘Nowhere else to go’
B. said he applied immediately for asylum when he arrived in the U.S. in 2016, but that he had to wait months for a work permit. He survived by doing odd jobs, such as cleaning homes and delivering food, and got by on very little. It wasn’t until late 2024, when he finally won his asylum case, that he was eligible to get any public benefits, including food stamps.
Eligibility for food stamps came at a critical time for B., as a car accident had prevented him from making food deliveries.

“While not having income, it was very helpful,” B. said. “I’m somebody who if I can work, I will work. The only reason I went over there to ask is because I had nowhere else to go.”
According to a November 2024 report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, a total of 60,050 people were newly admitted to the United States as refugees in 2023, many from unstable countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Syria and Afghanistan.
In 2023, the nation received at least 747,000 applications for people seeking asylum from countries including Venezuela, Cuba and Colombia, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration research group. It’s a tremendous increase from the 68,000 applications received in 2013.
The new domestic policy law specifies that food stamps are still available to Cubans and Haitians who might be refugees and asylees.

As of July 2025, more than 2.2 million immigrants in the U.S. are awaiting asylum hearings or decisions after formally applying for asylum, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, an organization at Syracuse University that tracks immigration cases.
“Getting through the system was difficult,” B. said. “I had to find money. I had to find an attorney who would help me apply for my asylum case. The asylum case itself took a long time.
“I still know people who have been here for more than 10 years and never had an interview.”
‘Already stretched’
According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, half of all admitted refugees in 2023 were resettled across just 10 states: Texas, New York, California, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan and Washington.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 41,000 people in the state are getting SNAP benefits while not being lawful permanent residents. She says that group includes refugees and asylees.
“The concerning part there is that these are individuals who were … lawfully admitted to the country, have previously been eligible for SNAP when they need it, and now, simply because of their status, will no longer be able to receive SNAP benefits,” Guinn told Stateline. “There’s nothing we’re going to be able to do to make them eligible.”
Another change under the new law is that for the first time, states will have to pay for a portion of their food stamp programs. States will have to cover between 5% and 15% of their SNAP costs beginning in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they dole out benefits to people eligible for the program.
Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, pointed out that states that want to continue to provide SNAP benefits to refugees and asylees are free to do so — as long as they pay for it.
“If New York state doesn’t want to cut these people off, they can continue to give them something like food stamps. They just have to do it with New York state money right now,” Rector said.

According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, half of all admitted refugees in 2023 were resettled across just 10 states: Texas, New York, California, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan and Washington.

But Guinn said that will be difficult. New York does offer asylum-seekers cash assistance of $180 a month through its Safety Net Assistance Program, but typically recipients must be working.
In Texas, officials at the state’s health and human services agency said that as of last month, roughly 24,600 of the state’s 3.5 million SNAP recipients were refugees or asylees. A spokesperson for Maryland’s human services agency wrote in an email that the state’s SNAP program last year supported more than 10,000 refugees and asylees.
The California Department of Social Services could not provide the number of refugees and asylees receiving food stamps, but projected that a total of 74,000 noncitizens — including lawfully permanent residents, refugees and asylees — would lose eligibility under the new law.
Sherri Laigle, the director of social services at HIAS, said food banks will not be able to make up for refugees’ and asylees’ loss of SNAP benefits.
“They’re already stretched, and now we’re going to see tens of thousands of people also needing to continue to rely on these programs. Of course, there’s limited access to them. You have to have transportation. You have to be able to get there.”
B. said he would apply for food stamps again if he could, because he’s earning too little income to get by.
“There are people who are in need. I think ignoring that — it’s not human.”

“The Warrick County Sheriff’s Office is engaged in an investigative review of the incident that occurred at the town hall appearance by Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith on Wednesday evening.  Given the number of persons involved, including two off-duty Warrick County deputies who were providing security support, it will take time to review physical evidence and complete interviews of witnesses and individuals involved in the incident.
“For that reason, it is premature to make any further comment about the incident until the Sheriff’s Office can complete that investigation.  I cannot yet predict the duration of that investigation but can assure the public we will work diligently to understand what happened and who was involved.  When the investigation is complete, I will provide additional comment and information,” Wilder said. 
The Evansville Courier & Press detailed the town hall in a developing story, including photos and videos of the arrests. According to their reporting, authorities warned the woman to stop shouting at Beckwith or said she would be removed. 
Beckwith reportedly told the crowd that, “Unfortunately it is a mental disorder,” as the woman made her way to the exit. There was a “commotion” and she was tackled to the ground. A man was later arrested after he attempted to step in and yelled at the officers. 
The state’s second-highest official panned the Courier & Press coverage as “Left-wing journalism at its finest.” 
Video captured by local station WEHT documents shouting throughout the town hall, with several residents booing Beckwith, a self-described Christian nationalist. The Newburgh town hall is the latest in a series of events across the state.

A recent National Association of Realtors report found affordability increased slightly from last year, but the typical family is still priced out in the West and Northeast. (Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer)
Housing became more affordable this June, as higher incomes and slightly lower interest rates overcame higher prices, according to a National Association of Realtors report.
However, the South and the Midwest are the only regions where a family with typical or median income can afford a median-priced house, according to the report. The group considers a mortgage to be affordable if the monthly payment (principal and interest) is 25% or less of the family’s income.



The affordability gap is highest in the West, where the typical family income is $113,783, just over two-thirds of the $164,832 that would be needed to purchase a median-priced home.
The Northeast, where the typical family makes $114,559, is also unaffordable by this measure, as a median-priced home requires an income of $141,264.
In the Midwest, the median family income is $102,419, more than the $86,256 needed to buy a median-priced home. The same is true in the South, where the median income is $97,812, slightly more than the $96,720 required to buy a typical home.
Nationally, affordability increased slightly compared with June of 2024, with the typical family making $105,431, about 94% of the $111,648 it would need to buy the median-priced home. That’s up from about 92% in June 2024.
In a video posted Aug. 15, Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, said he expects lower interest rates to increase affordability in the months ahead.
“We know that mortgage rates will be coming down and that will bring additional buyers into the market. We just need to make sure we have more supply, more supply to meet that demand,” Yun said.

Earthquake activity suggested the volcano was close to erupting again in 2025. (Photo by R.G. McGimsey/Alaska Volcano Observatory/U.S. Geological Survey, CC BY)Alaska’s volcano experts no longer expect an eruption anytime soon from Mount Spurr, the closest active volcano to Anchorage.
On Wednesday, the Alaska Volcano Observatory formally lowered the alert level for Mount Spurr from yellow to green after months of declining activity.
“Things are OK right now, and hopefully that continues in the future,” said David Fee, coordinating scientist for the University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute, which operates the observatory alongside the U.S. Geological Survey.
While the land immediately around Spurr isn’t inhabited, ash emitted from the volcano has disrupted life in Southcentral Alaska before. In 1953 and 1992, Spurr eruptions dumped ash on Anchorage, disrupting air travel.
Starting in February 2024, scientists had observed large numbers of small earthquakes beneath the volcano, and ground near it was deforming, surging upward. Ice atop the volcano melted, and air samples taken above the volcano showed signs of magma moving beneath the surface.
Scientists had been monitoring Crater Peak, a site south of Mount Spurr’s summit, as the likely spot of an eruption.
In October 2024, they raised the volcano’s alert level, and by March of this year, the volcano observatory said an eruption was “likely.”
But soon after that estimate, the signs of an imminent eruption began to diminish. There were fewer earthquakes, and the ground stopped rising as quickly as it had been.
Earlier this summer, the volcano observatory issued a statement saying that the odds of an eruption had fallen, and Spurr continued to quiet, leading to Wednesday’s announcement.
“What we’re seeing right now is all … really consistent with magma that intruded (beneath the volcano) and then stopped intruding. But it’s still creating some signals such as increased gas emissions and kind of weak seismicity,” Fee said.
While Spurr erupted in 1953 and 1992, darkening the skies over Anchorage with ash, it has also previously signaled an eruption that never came to pass.
In 2004 and 2006, the volcano showed signs of unrest for months but never erupted. The most recent period of unrest seems to resemble those two false starts.
Even though the volcano didn’t erupt, it has the potential to offer a scientific bonanza. AVO staff installed a network of seismic, infrasound and ground-measuring devices around Spurr, making it the most-monitored volcano in the state, according to the number of instruments listed on the AVO’s website.
“As we’re starting to look back now, at the period of unrest, it’s often just as interesting or scientifically valuable to understand why volcanoes don’t erupt, because they don’t, over half the time, approximately. Are there maybe some signals or something in our data that we can kind of tease out to help us understand why it didn’t erupt?” Fee said, looking back at what was learned.
“I think understanding why that occurred will be really important,” he said.
AVO and the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management also spent months educating Southcentral Alaskans about the possibility of ashfall, reminding them that they live in a volcanically active area.
That work will live on, too, Fee said, and people will be better informed the next time an eruption looks likely.
“Because they don’t happen that frequently in Cook Inlet, it was kind of a good reminder for people to be aware, to understand the hazards that are out there,” he said.

Turnover ha[...]","Election workers process ballots at the Davis County Administrative Building in Farmington, Utah, during November’s election. Research from the Bipartisan Policy Center shows turnover among election workers reached a new high in 2024 (Spenser Heaps/Utah News Dispatch).Election officials turned over at the highest rate in at least a quarter century during the last presidential election, according to new research from the Bipartisan Policy Center.
An analysis of shifts in election officials published Tuesday found nearly 41% of election officials administering the 2024 election were different than those in 2020. Turnover has accelerated over the past two decades, rising from about 28% in 2004 to 40.9% last year.
The growing percentage of departing election officials comes after years of challenges. They navigated the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as well as harassment and false conspiracy theories surrounding stolen elections that persist today.
The analysis released by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based group that seeks to foster policy cooperation across party lines, represents an updated version of a report that previously examined turnover from 2004 to 2022. The new research, which extends the data through 2024, shows the turnover rate continued to climb.
The change means that, over time, election officials have less experience. The research found that the share of chief local election officials with six or more years in their role has dropped from 60% in 2006 to 47% in 2024.
But last year, 60% of election officials had previously overseen the administration of a presidential election in their jurisdiction.
“Despite increasing turnover and loss of experience, the majority of chief election officials still have experience running at least one presidential election cycle,” the analysis said. “This is important because presidential elections typically see the highest turnout and are the most visible elections administered.”
The analysis found that over the long term, election official turnover rates have been rising gradually in small jurisdictions, defined as areas with fewer than 100,000 voting-age residents. But large jurisdictions have experienced a more sudden jump in turnover.
Small jurisdictions had a 27% turnover rate in 2004 that had risen to 40% in 2024. But large jurisdictions enjoyed a turnover rate as low as 31% in 2018 before climbing rapidly to nearly 46% last year.

As California cities and counties become more aggressive with banning public camping, the need for consistent and clear encampment policies become more pressing. But local governments employ a patchwork of rules for encampment sweeps — exposing a vulnerable population to even more harm, reports CalMatters’ Marisa Kendall.
CalMatters asked nearly three dozen cities and counties for copies of their encampment management policies, and found that their approaches varied widely:

San Diego has a 10-page policy detailing things such as when sweeps can take place and how to handle confiscated belongings.
Stockton uses policies from its police department, which vaguely says officers should “use reasonable care” and avoid destroying an unhoused person’s property.
Santa Cruz and Monterey counties are just now writing their first encampment policies, after Gov. Gavin Newsom pushed for more uniform rules in May.
Mendocino County has no encampment policy.

So why is it important that these rules be more cohesive?
Some cities and counties are reluctant to draft encampment management rules if they know there’s a chance they may not follow it later, such as promising a shelter bed on paper when none are actually available.
But sweeping an encampment is a fraught ordeal that can further displace and traumatize people who have already undergone significant distress. Giving unhoused people a heads up about what they can expect, instead of vague guidelines, can help make it a less traumatizing:

Alex Visotzky, senior California policy fellow for the National Alliance to End Homelessness: “Folks need to know when that trash truck is coming. Folks need to know how long they have to be able to move. And when there’s nothing in place at all and folks are just flying by the seat of their pants … that leads to more chaos.”

Forcing local governments — through litigation in particular — to lay out policies clearly can also provide vital protections for unhoused people, such as requiring municipalities to give people with disabilities extra time to pack their belongings, or prohibiting workers from mishandling personal property.

Democrats torn on gerrymandering ethics

Though Republicans are generally united against Newsom’s mid-cycle redistricting proposal, the same can’t be said for California Democrats, writes CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang.
While many state- and congressional-level Democrats have endorsed allowing Californians to vote on redrawn congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterms as a way to counteract Texas Republicans’ own redistricting plan, others have had qualms about temporarily sidestepping the state’s independent redistricting commission.
Approved by voters in 2008, the commission redraws the state’s electoral boundaries every 10 years in a nonpartisan process that maintains competitive districts. A poll by Politico published last week found that voters favor independent redistricting.
During a Tuesday hearing, some former members of the commission, including some who are Democrats, came out to oppose Newsom’s plan.

Connie Archbold Robinson, an independent and former commission member: “If we gut the great work that we have been doing there, then not only do we lose our credibility, those efforts actually get stalled and get reversed.”

Ramirez seeks 40th District seat

Ever since California’s 40th District was redrawn from a left-leaning district to a competitive swing district after the 2020 census, Democrats have been gunning to oust Republican Rep. Young Kim from her seat. On Wednesday, immigration attorney Lisa Ramirez entered the fray as the latest congressional candidate to attempt to represent Orange County. 
As CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller explains, Ramirez is perhaps best known as the attorney who helped free a detained migrant father of three U.S. Marine sons. She told Maya that her reasons to run in the 2026 race included the wave of mass detentions, the lack of due process and the disregard for court orders under the Trump administration.
But Ramirez has her work cut out for her: Kim has defeated her opponents by near double digits, and her warchest includes $4 million cash on hand. If voters approved Newsom’s redistricting plans at the Nov. 4 special election, the 40th District would also become an even redder seat.

That puts California Republicans in a bind as they contest Gov. Gavin Newsom's redistricting.,"In summary
Texas and President Donald Trump struck first in a gerrymandering battle that could tilt the 2026 midterms. That puts California Republicans in a bind as they contest Gov. Gavin Newsom’s redistricting.


California Republicans have a simple rebuttal when Democrats blame Texas for starting the congressional gerrymandering arms race: two wrongs don’t make a right. 
That means they have to acknowledge both wrongs — a move that puts them at odds with their party leader, President Donald Trump, who wants the GOP to redraw congressional districts in red states to bolster its chances of retaining a majority in Congress next fall.
In Texas, Trump has said he’s “entitled” to five additional GOP House seats. Those maneuvers sparked California’s retaliatory effort, which Democratic lawmakers today are expected to place on the ballot for a special election in November. 
The California maps, backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, would offset the Texas map by tilting five Republican-held congressional districts toward Democrats.
“I haven’t heard a single Republican in the state of California, who’s in office in the state Legislature, defend Texas,” said Assemblyman Carl DeMaio, Republican of San Diego and an unabashed Trump supporter. “Gerrymandering is wrong no matter who’s doing it, whether it’s done by a red state or a blue state. Politicians manipulating the lines of their districts, it’s wrong.”
DeMaio, along with Assembly Minority Leader James Gallagher, on Monday introduced a resolution calling on Congress to propose a constitutional amendment requiring all states to use a nonpartisan commission for redistricting, as California’s constitution has required since voters passed a ballot measure creating that process in 2010. All GOP Assemblymembers have signed on. 
“When does it stop?” said Sen. Tony Strickland, a Huntington Beach Republican, who warned that a gerrymandering race to the bottom would result in a “destructive country” and “chaos” by encouraging redistricting every two years. Instead, he said all states should adopt California’s model, where maps are drawn every 10 years by an independent citizens redistricting commission. 
“What we have currently right now should be the model and the gold standard for the rest of the country to follow,” he said.
He was among several California Republicans who this week sued the state over Newsom’s rush to put his ballot measure before voters. The California Supreme Court late Wednesday rejected their complaint. 
The independently drawn districts, which resulted in Democrats winning 43 of the state’s 52 seats, have also drawn criticism from Trump and Vice President JD Vance, who have said the maps are unfairly tilted against Republicans. 
Researchers have found the maps give Democrats a slight advantage by some measures but are competitive on other ones.
What Republicans in Congress say
Several California Republicans in Congress have also called for an end to the redistricting wars. Their motivations include preserving voter representation, as well as keeping their seats.
Rep. Kevin Kiley, a Rocklin Republican, introduced a bill in Congress that would ban mid-decade redistricting nationwide — effectively a detente among the states. Kiley’s sprawling 3rd congressional district, which stretches nearly 500 miles through the conservative-leaning eastern Sierra region, would become a much smaller one that includes more liberal suburbs of Sacramento under the Democrats’ plan.
On Tuesday, when House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, criticized Newsom’s map efforts, Kiley wrote on social media demanding his bill be brought to the floor – a long shot at best. It would mean undoing Trump’s plans for Texas and weakening the Republicans’ chance of holding on to power in Congress.
“Mr. Speaker, these are nice words but we need action,” Kiley said. 
Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley would be at a disadvantage if California voters approve Gov. Gavin Newsom’s proposal to redraw the state’s congressional districts. Here, he speaks at a press conference in Sacramento on  Aug. 24, 2021. Photo by Anne Wernikoff, CalMatters
Republican Reps. Doug LaMalfa of Oroville and Rep. Jay Obernolte of Big Bear Lake have also spoken against mid-decade redistricting in California and other states, saying the practice creates voter distrust.
Matt Rexroad, a GOP consultant and redistricting specialist, said California Republicans are right to push for independent redistricting nationwide and to oppose gerrymandering in both blue and red states. He called the redistricting wars “a horrible idea for everyone,” for both principled reasons and raw numerical ones. 
Newsom’s map would not only draw out five Republican seats but also eliminate three competitive districts held by Democrats in Southern California. Rexroad isn’t convinced Republicans can win the seats in Texas under their new maps. 
“In addition to the reasons (for independent redistricting), I think it’s a bad trade,” he said. 
Other Republicans in California have been more cautious to openly criticize the Trump-backed efforts in Texas. A spokesperson for Rep. Young Kim said the Orange County congresswoman viewed Newsom’s plan as an “unconstitutional power grab” and believed he should “focus on addressing crises facing Californians instead of disenfranchising voters and positioning himself for a presidential run.”
Spokespeople for Republican Reps. Tom McClintock, David Valadao, Darrell Issa, Ken Calvert and Vince Fong did not respond to questions from CalMatters in time for publication. 
Newsom vs. Trump
Some GOP state lawmakers have demurred when asked if they would call on Trump directly to back down from redistricting in Texas — a move that California Democrats have said would prompt them to abandon their gerrymandering effort — or deflected blame in Texas to civil rights groups that sued over the current map, which gives Republicans 25 safe seats and two competitive ones, and Democrats 11 safe seats. 
As that case wound its way through the federal courts, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon wrote Texas in July saying it needed to redraw its congressional maps — giving Gov. Greg Abbott justification to convene a special legislative session for that purpose.
“I haven’t been a part of those conversations,” state Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones, a San Diego Republican, said when asked if Trump should also back down from new maps in Texas. “I’m not an expert on Texas law or the Texas constitution or their legislature. I’m concentrating on California.”

“What I meant was, let’s don’t become the bad ones or part of the bad actors, if you are condemning them,” he said. “I didn’t criticize or evaluate (Texans’) actions.”
Whether bipartisan criticism on California Republicans’ part will help or hurt them may well be moot. The campaign over the GOP seats, Rexroad said, will ultimately come down to a more basic question.

,California,2025-08-21 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Los Angeles now has to appease Trump’s ego as prep for the Olympics continues,Jim Newton,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/08/los-angeles-appease-trump-olympics/,Los Angeles still faces formidable challenges as the region prepares for the 2028 Games. President Trump recently launched a task force and thrust himself into the center of things.,"The 2028 Olympics will open in Los Angeles in exactly three years, and the planning for the Games is racing alongside their politics. 
The planning is going better, but the politics are getting harder.
The executive board of the International Olympic Committee checked off on Los Angeles’ sweeping venue plan in April, giving its stamp of approval to an effort that will unfold across the region: surfing in San Clemente, skateboarding and BMX racing in the San Fernando Valley, cricket in Pomona and baseball, of course, in Dodger Stadium. The host committee is clearly plowing forward, tackling a full range of planning issues, from venues to transportation and security.
Some pieces remain. The transportation challenge, for one, is formidable, and the plans as unveiled so far are incomplete, with early promises of a “car-free” games morphing into something less ambitious but more achievable — public transit options that will make the games accessible.
There is progress to note on this front, too: The long-missing connector between the region’s rail system and its airport is at last coming to completion. Other L.A. Metro services are coming into play as well. 
IOC officials visited Los Angeles this summer and complimented the work being done, especially after early concerns about a slow start. “We have seen significant progress,” an IOC spokesperson said, adding that the “leadership was in place” and “detailed planning was advancing.” 
There is plenty left to do but also time to do it, with the city, state and organizing committee all taking on responsibilities. It helps that these will be the third Summer Olympics hosted by Los Angeles, so no major venues need to be built.
That’s a challenge, but a rational one. 
The politics? Not so much. President Donald Trump sees the Olympics less as a chance to telegraph unity and pride and more as one to flex his political muscle.
Earlier this month, Trump questioned the capability of local officials and positioned himself at the center of a rescue operation that no one asked for. He announced a federal task force and appointed himself as its chair. 
The president even used the occasion to rehash his two-pronged falsehood that the devastation wrought by the January fires was the result of insufficient water flowing to the region from the “Pacific Northwest,” which is not true, and that he had opened up the flow of water to Los Angeles, which also is not true.
So far, it’s unclear what this task force can offer, aside from surfacing tired culture-war issues. Typical of his meandering public speeches, he took a moment to assure people that “the United States will not let men steal trophies from women at the 2028 Olympics.”

Trump also vowed that the federal government would be there to ensure safety, a promise he could not make without needling L.A. Mayor Karen Bass. 
“We’ll do anything necessary to keep the Olympics safe, including using our National Guard or military,” Trump said. “Obviously, you have a mayor that is not very competent.”
We’ve seen this before, of course. In June, Trump unleashed federal forces in Los Angeles to round up noncitizens. That inflamed communities where masked federal agents started grabbing people off the street, and protests erupted Downtown. The protests were briefly violent but well within the capacity of the Los Angeles Police Department to control.
A night of clashes settled by morning, and then Trump called in the National Guard — and later the Marines — to “restore order” where there was no disorder. The effect was to stir up trouble, then claim credit when local authorities did their jobs.
The same gambit is now underway in Washington, D.C., where the president declared an emergency and dispatched the guard even though no objective measure suggests any such emergency exists or such a response is needed. In that sense, the president’s ego-driven resort to force is animated more by a desire to change the channel from his refusal to release the Epstein files or his disappointing summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, rather than any real danger in Washington.
And so it will be with the Olympics, as Trump insists on turning every event into an opportunity to aggrandize himself. For L.A. officials, the task is to align the region’s interests with the president’s ego — no small feat. But you can feel them trying.
When confronted with Trump’s criticisms of her, Bass, who only will get the chance to host the Olympics if she is reelected, gently deflected.
“There have been presidents that were very visible during the opening and closing ceremony,” she told Fox LA reporter Elex Michaelson. “I am sure that he will be here, and I am sure that he will have a big presence. But is he going to run the Olympics? No.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/072884_Olympics-LA_GETTY_CM_01-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C676&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-21 08:56:54.183579
,California,2025-08-21 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,California cities lack unified response on homeless encampments,Marisa Kendall,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/homelessness/2025/08/homeless-encampment-sweep-policies/,"When it comes to clearing homeless encampments, California cities are governed by a patchwork of very different policies.","In summary
When it comes to clearing homeless encampments, California cities are governed by a patchwork of very different policies.


Clearing an encampment is one of the most complicated and fraught tasks any California city can take on when responding to homelessness. 
How they handle that challenge varies widely. 
CalMatters asked nearly three-dozen cities and counties throughout California for copies of their encampment management policies. Responses spanned a wide range, highlighting the lack of a unified strategy to address street homelessness across the state, even as Gov. Gavin Newsom is pushing for more cohesive rules. 
San Diego, for example, has a 10-page policy that spells out everything from when removals can take place (during daylight hours and not if there is a 50% chance of rain) to how much advance warning the city must give camp residents (at least 24 hours) and how to handle personal belongings confiscated during the removal (items must be photographed, logged and stored for 90 days). 
But some smaller cities and counties have no rules, or only bare-bones guidelines. Mendocino County has no encampment management policy. The sheriff’s office’s 861-page manual includes a little more than two pages on how deputies should interact with homeless individuals. Deputies are “encouraged” to consider referring them to shelter and counseling instead of arresting them for minor crimes. Mendocino County also does not track encampment removals. 
Dismantling an encampment can be devastating for the people who call the camp home, many of whom already have experienced significant trauma while living on the streets. At the same time, cities say they have an obligation to remove camps that are dangerous, unsanitary, pose fire risks or are blocking traffic. 
Having a policy in place, so that people living in an encampment know what to expect, can make the process easier on everyone, said Alex Visotzky, senior California policy fellow for the National Alliance to End Homelessness.
“Folks need to know when that trash truck is coming,” he said. “Folks need to know how long they have to be able to move. And when there’s nothing in place at all and folks are just flying by the seat of their pants, that leads to more harm. That leads to more chaos.”
How cities and counties remove camps has become especially important recently, as many places are increasing enforcement after the U.S. Supreme Court last year gave them more leeway to do so. Cities across the state have passed new laws banning encampments, which may or may not include provisions that require the city to give advance warning before clearing a camp, or store people’s possessions.
Some counties, including Santa Cruz and Monterey, are just now writing encampment policies for the first time, spurred by a recent push from Newsom’s administration. In May, he called on cities to make it illegal to camp for more than three days in one place, while also encouraging them to give people a 48-hour notice before clearing a camp and to store belongings confiscated during a clearing so that their owners can claim them. 
The latest application for state homelessness funding requires cities and counties to submit a link to their encampment policy. If they have no such policy, they are supposed to commit to following the state’s guidance on addressing camps. 
Both the governor’s office and the Legislature have signalled that the next round of funding — which won’t come until the 2026-27 budget year — will require cities and counties to adopt encampment policies in order to qualify. 
“The Governor cannot mandate cities and local jurisdictions to adopt a specific plan or ordinance,” Tara Gallegos, a spokesperson for the governor’s office, said in an email. “That said, the Governor has shared a model ordinance and called on every local government to adopt and implement local policies without delay, backed by billions in state funding and authority affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court last year.”
Santa Cruz County recently drafted a policy to govern encampment removals in unincorporated parts of the county (nearly 600 square miles), which is set to go before the board of supervisors next month. Monterey County passed a new policy earlier this year.
The current process for clearing an encampment in unincorporated Santa Cruz County can be “chaotic,” said Robert Ratner, director of Santa Cruz County Housing for Health. It’s not always clear which agencies should be making the difficult decisions about which camps to clear, when and how. 
Typically the sheriff’s office makes those calls, Ratner said, but there are many relevant factors that the agency might not know — such as how many shelter beds are available, or whether the camp is polluting a nearby waterway. The new policy puts the county’s executive office in charge of those tough decisions, and gives guidance on how long to store confiscated property (for at least 90 days) and how to conduct outreach (make a list of all camp residents and record details about their situation that will help connect them with housing and other services).
“Unfortunately, it’s not easy,” Ratner said. “And I think this is where the guide is helpful. Because we’re bringing it to the board and they’re agreeing to the principles and then giving that direction to all the staff, so staff aren’t left guessing.”
But cities and counties, including Santa Cruz, tend to be reluctant to write strict rules they may have trouble following later; It’s hard to promise a shelter bed when you don’t know if one will be available, for example. As a result, many policies offer vague guidelines rather than enforceable decrees. The U.S. Supreme Court last year ruled local governments can ban encampments even if no shelter is available. While some local encampment policies state that cities and counties should try to offer a shelter bed before destroying a camp, few go so far as to require it. 
There is one thing that tends to make encampment policies more binding: when they’re written in court. That often happens after a group of homeless residents sues a city, as happened in San Diego and San Bernardino. When the two sides settle, they may agree on new rules to govern encampment removals in that city, and the city is legally bound to follow them.
But that can also lead to drawn-out courtroom battles. Chico has been fighting for the past year to get out from under a settlement reached after eight homeless residents sued the city in 2021, claiming its enforcement of anti-camping laws was unconstitutional.
The settlement set out strict new rules Chico now has to follow before it can clear a homeless encampment. The city must make sure it has enough shelter beds available for everyone who will be displaced from the camp, provide written notice to the plaintiffs’ lawyers more than two weeks ahead of the clearing, provide a seven-day warning to the camp residents, and then give another 72-hour warning. 
“Folks need to know when that trash truck is coming.”Alex Visotzky, senior California policy fellow, National Alliance to End Homelessness
Advocates for unhoused communities say those rules, which are stricter than in many other California cities, provide crucial protections for people on the street who are just trying to survive. The city, on the other hand, says following that “multi-week, burdensome” process before enforcing its camping ordinances is getting in the way of its duty to clear camps in areas prone to wildfires.
“The City of Chico is prevented from exercising reasonable actions to protect public health and safety (including the transient encampments themselves) from fire danger,” City Manager Mark Sorensen said in an email. “The city is held hostage by the seven remaining plaintiffs and (their lawyers, Legal Services of Northern California).”
The city tried last year to get out of the settlement, after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that cities can make camping illegal even if they don’t have shelter beds available, and was shot down. Now, the city is trying again. The parties are expected back in court later this fall. 
Legal battles can also influence how cities handle personal belongings taken from a homeless encampment. San Bernardino, which last year settled a lawsuit related to the destruction of unhoused people’s property, must provide camp residents with different-colored bags to differentiate between their property and trash, and give people with disabilities extra time to pack up their belongings. 
Stockton, which cleared more than 200 encampments last year, instead abides by a police department policy that vaguely states officers should “use reasonable care” with a homeless resident’s property, and avoid destroying it. If the property owner can’t pack it up, “measures should be taken” to secure the items. 
Most jurisdictions lack the resources to respond to all the encampments on their streets, so some have drafted policies that help them prioritize which camps to clear first. Fresno has a detailed metric that ranks encampments based on various risk factors. A camp gets two points if the fire department has had to come out, four points if it’s been the location of a violent crime, and one point if a policy maker has asked the city to clear the camp.
Having such a patchwork of policies across the state makes it harder to solve the problem of homelessness, Ratner said. And while Newsom’s efforts to get cities on the same page seem to be having some effect, tying those rules to state funding is far from a perfect solution, he said. Smaller cities that don’t receive homelessness funds directly from the state have no incentive to adopt rules, he said.
“It creates significant inconsistencies,” Ratner said, “and more drama between the jurisdictions.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/080724_Santa-Cruz-Sweeps_MO_CM_20.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-21 08:56:54.183579

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)It’s been almost two months since congressional Republicans passed their budget bill, nicknamed the “big, beautiful bill,” which had sweeping impacts on grants and funding for state programs. 
Now, Utah officials are starting to see those impacts. 
On Wednesday, officials from Utah’s departments of environmental quality, oil gas and mining, agriculture and food, and energy development spoke to lawmakers during a Natural Resources, Agriculture and Environment interim committee about the negative and positive impacts on their state agencies. 
Among the impacts are the elimination of grants helping mitigate radon, more funding for programs that help farmers during market downturns, scaling back credits for renewable energy, and boosting oil and gas production. 
Department of Environmental Quality 
President Donald Trump’s initial request would have slashed nearly 55% of the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget, which would have had serious implications for state and tribal assistance grants. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
That’s according to Tim Davis, director of the Utah Department of Environmental Quality, who told lawmakers Wednesday he worked with the state’s congressional delegation to preserve some of the funds that stem from the Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water acts. 
Still, Congress ended up cutting some programs from the Inflation Reduction Act, passed during the Biden administration — that includes a $1 million grant that Utah was receiving for radon mitigation in rural homes. Radon is an odorless radioactive gas commonly found in Utah homes that can increase risk of lung cancer. 
Davis said he’s appealing that cancellation. 
Funding that goes to the Utah Division of Water Quality, by way of the federal Clean Water Act, for rangeland and cropland improvement projects was also impacted. That funding helps staff five employees with the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food — on Wednesday, the department said it’s working to restore those funds. 
Utah Division of Agriculture and Food 
Connor Peterson, director of legislative and government affairs for the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food, touted a number of provisions in the bill on Wednesday aimed at helping the state’s farmers.
Consider this: 

A total of $66 billion will go toward programs described as the “farm safety net” — that includes commodity programs that help with loss, risk coverage or unpredictable dairy margins. “It helps producers, farmers and ranchers during market downturns,” said Peterson. 
An increase will be made in the estate and gift tax exemption, nicknamed the “death tax,” that Peterson said will “help farms to stay in families, to pass down from generation to generation.” The exemption will increase from $5.5 million per person, or $11 million per couple, to $15 million per person or $30 million per couple. 
An annual block grant for specialty crops will grow from $350,000 to $1.5 million in Utah. 
Payments to farmers whose animals are killed by predators will increase, now compensating them for 100% of the losses, and compensating them for any unborn livestock. Previously, the program covered 75% of losses. 

Utah Office of Energy Development
Jake Garfield, the deputy director of the Utah Office of Energy Development, told lawmakers Wednesday that the bill will have widespread impacts on the state’s energy industry, ramping up funding for traditional, extractive energy sources, while cutting grants and incentives for renewable energy. The bill does the following:

Creates a $1 billion loan program from the U.S. Department of Energy for “traditional energy sources, as well as critical minerals,” Garfield said, telling lawmakers the office is hoping Utah will get a share of those funds. 
Phases out tax credits for renewable energy — mostly solar and wind — including both production and investment credits. Garfield said projects that began in June and will be completed in four years, or current projects that will be completed by 2027 will still be eligible, which could lead to a “rush to either start of complete solar or wind projects that were already in the works.”
Designates China, Russia, Iran and North Korea as “foreign entities of concern,” which means energy projects that get materials from these countries will have to look for new sources and possibly incur higher costs. That could likely impact solar and energy storage projects that get materials from China, and nuclear projects that get uranium from Russia. 
Eliminates clean energy tax credits and loan programs from the Biden administration — that includes a greenhouse gas reduction program that funded solar projects. Utah was hoping to receive $62 million from that program. 
Phases out electric vehicle and electric vehicle charging incentives, which Garfield said will change current state projections for how many electric vehicles the state expects to see in the future. 

Utah Division of Oil, Gas and Mining
Mick Thomas, the director of the Utah Division of Oil, Gas and Mining, said that the budget bill “indicates a shift in federal policy toward a pro-energy, growth mindset,” including a “renewed focus on domestic onshore oil and gas production.”
That includes:

A reduction in the royalty fees paid by oil and gas operators 
Increasing the leases available for onshore oil and gas projects
Resuming quarterly lease sales

Coal leases on federal land will also see a decrease in royalty rates.

Tommy Tuberville said Wednesday that if elected governor he would encourage some students to go into technical training after completing 10th grade as a means of building the workforce. 
“I believe our education system, that I was in for 35 years, is inadequate. I’m not talking about the grades that they make. I’m talking about the procedure of how we go through K through 12, and then we send our kids off to these four year universities like Auburn, like Alabama, like Troy, which a lot of those kids don’t need to go to a four year school,” said Tuberville, speaking to a meeting of the Assocation of County Commissions of Alabama (ACCA). “So we need to change our plan on educating in the state of Alabama.”
Tuberville announced his candidacy in May and has been widely viewed as the frontrunner for the GOP nomination.

“If and when we win, and I’m there for everybody, and we’re going to work with the Legislature,” he said. “We’re going to put a team together that’s going to run the state. You can’t do it by yourself. And we’re going to have a plan that is going to work again.”
The senator said Wednesday that plan includes teaching students as they are now until 10th grade, then teaching a technical skill in the last two years of high school. That way, he said, those students can get into the workforce faster after continuing their education in welding, plumbing and other trades. He did not say if it would be mandatory.
“It’s going to, obviously, cost money, but the future is in educating our kids to be able to do things that other people across the country don’t do,” he said. “Teach them electricity, teach them welding, teach them plumbing, teach them nursing at the high school level, and then have them go to another level, to where they can go for a year, and then they’re out.”
Tuberville also pledged to get people back to work when he is governor. According to the Alabama Department of Labor, 3% of Alabamians were unemployed in July, and according to the U.S. Census Bureau, 15.6% of Alabamians lived in poverty in 2023, a number that Tuberville called “embarrassing” but also appeared to blame on those in poverty. 
“It’s going to cost us more tax money,” Tuberville said. “It’s going to cost us a lot of different things. That’s not going to be helpful to the state of Alabama. Now I will tell you this, a lot of that is because of their own choice. When I become governor, that’s going to change. We’ve got to get people back to work.”
Gov. Kay Ivey also spoke at the convention Wednesday, praising the Alabama Department of Workforce, run by former Sen. Greg Reed, R-Jasper, and highlighting the improvement in workforce participation in the state since she took office in 2017.
“His goal is to increase Alabama worker participation. And after only seven months of Secretary Reid’s oversight, we have seen signs of improvement in the number of workers reentering the workforce,” Ivey said. “Automatic job reports indicate the state’s workforce participant rate is nearly 58%.”
Tuberville, who was the head football coach at Auburn University from 1999-2008, said being governor is like being head coach: mistakes and problems in the state will fall to him.
“If it don’t work, you get in trouble. And I’m fine with that. I lost a lot of games,” he said.
Under the Alabama Constitution, the Legislature holds most of the effective power in state government. The governor has a weak veto that can be overridden by a majority vote of both chambers.
Tuberville also said he would plan to continue Ivey’s infrastructure efforts and increase energy production in the state. Ivey highlighted the infrastructure progress in the state in her eight years of service, namely a new state route connecting Mobile and Tuscaloosa.
“Since the enactment in 2019, the Rebuild Alabama Act has generated over $1 billion in new construction revenue, literally paving the way for countless road and bridge projects in all 67 counties,” she said. “Dozens of rural communities and at least seven counties will be better polished for economic growth.”
The gubernatorial election is on Nov. 3, 2026, and Tuberville promised to remain in “Senate mode” until the election. He updated the attendants of the convention on President Donald Trump’s agenda as it has made its way through Congress. 
Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) got cut through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). Tuberville said that Alabama will not be hit as hard as other states by the Medicaid cuts because the provider tax, which helps pay for the health care program, was not increased for Alabama. Federal cuts to SNAP, however, will impact Alabamians on the program.
“We were going to spend $1.2 trillion on food stamps. We can’t afford it,” he said. “We want to take care of people. We want to take care of single moms. We want to take care of kids. We want to take people that can’t take care of themselves. We want to take care of our elders. We want to take care of our infants, but we can’t take care of everybody.”
According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 752,200 Alabamians were enrolled in the program during fiscal year 2024. Tuberville claimed there are people enrolled that do not need the assistance, largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the Food and Research Action Center, 667,043 Alabamians were enrolled in the program in fiscal year 2018.
Tuberville vowed to reduce SNAP enrollment so that the program will not cost the state when he hopes to be governor in 2027.
“It’s going to cost us $200 million my year of starting in terms of paying for SNAP. That’s not going to happen. We’re going to get that down,” he said. 
Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall closed the program, updating the thinned-out crowd on ongoing litigation, but focussing on unity.
“All of us have our unique perspectives coming in. And sometimes, if you read too much in the paper or look at too much on social media, it always talks about the things that divide us,” Marshall said. “I want to do it a little differently today, and think about things that we can all come together on, regardless of what those differences may be.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0255-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-21 08:56:54.183579

(Reeg photo: David Becker/Getty Images for Caesars Entertainment; Horbuckle photo: Ethan Miller, Getty Images)A new report criticizes gaming giants Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts International for investing more in their CEOs and corporate investors than in supporting the tens of thousands of workers who keep their casinos operating.
The Institute for Policy Studies and Inequality.org each year analyze the 100 S&P 500 corporations with the lowest median worker pay. They’ve dubbed these corporations the Low Wage 100 and highlight the growing disparities between those average workers’ pay and their CEOs.
Only three S&P 500 companies, all gaming giants, are headquartered in Nevada. All three fall within the Low Wage 100.
Caesars CEO Thomas Reeg was compensated $18.4 million in 2024 while the median worker earned $43,880. That translates to a CEO-to-worker pay ratio of 419-to-1.
Put another way: For every $1 the median worker earned, Reeg made $419.
According to their SEC filing, Caesars calculated that median (half make more, half make less) worker salary from its 48,261 full-time, part-time, and seasonal employees, all based in the U.S. Less than 5% of their total workforce is located outside of the U.S. and were excluded from the ratio.
Meanwhile, MGM Resorts CEO William Hornbuckle was compensated $15.8 million last year while the median worker earned $47,607. That translates to a CEO-to-worker pay ratio of 332-to-1.
According to their SEC filing, MGM Resorts employed 76,527 last year, including 13,063 as MGM China. Those figures include full-time, part-time, seasonal, and temporary employees.
Since 2019, Caesars CEO compensation rose 106.4% while its median worker pay rose 40.8%. Reeg has been CEO that entire time. Meanwhile, MGM Resorts CEO compensation rose 20.3% while median worker pay rose 22.2%. Hornbuckle has been CEO for most of that time, securing the corporation’s top spot in July 2020.
Caesars and MGM Resorts are both major employers in Nevada.
The third Nevada-based S&P 500 company, Las Vegas Sands, no longer operates casinos within the state, but its majority shareholder, billionaire Miriam Adelson, remains a powerful figure. Las Vegas Sands paid CEO Robert Goldstein $21.9 million last year and their median worker $42,426.
Adelson is one of at least 32 billionaires who owes their wealth to a Low Wage 100 company, according to the report.
The “Executive Excess” report also compared what each corporation spent on stock buybacks with what was spent on capital expenditures, arguing that the former “creates huge short-term windfalls for executives and shareholders at the expense of workers and long-term productive investments.” Stock buybacks were illegal until 1982.
MGM Resorts last year spent $9.565 billion on stock buybacks, more than double the $4.349 billion it spent on capital expenditures.
Meanwhile, Caesars and Las Vegas Sands spent more on capital expenditures than stock buybacks. Caesars last year spent $4.77 billion in capital expenditures and $191 million on stock buybacks. Las Vegas Sands spent $6.95 billion on capital expenditures and $3 billion on stock buybacks.
Excluding Amazon, whose spending on expansion is an outlier and dwarfs all others on the list, the Low Wage 100 companies collectively spent more on stock buybacks between 2019 and 2025 than they did on capital expenditures.
Across all of the Low Wage 100, average CEO compensation rose 34.7% between 2019 and 2024 while average median worker pay rose 16.3%. Inflation was 22.6% over that same period.
The average CEO total compensation for these companies in 2024 was $17.2 million while average median worker pay was $35,570. That’s a CEO-to-worker pay ratio of 632-to-1.
The report notes that, if the analysis is expanded to all S&P 100 corporations, the CEO-to-worker ratio lowers to 285-to-1. If you go back six decades, to 1965, CEO-to-worker pay was 25 to 1.
Since 2019, Caesars’ CEO pay ratio has expanded 47% and MGM’s has decreased minimally by 1.5%.
“America’s largest low-wage employers continue to fixate on enriching their CEOs at the expense of both their workers and their corporate prospects for long-term growth,” concludes the report.
 Non-S&P gaming companies

The “Executive Excess” report only evaluated the largest 500 corporations in the United States. So how do the gaming corporations that fall outside of the S&P 500 fare?
Here are their 2024 CEO pay ratios, as reported on their SEC filings:

Bally’s Corp: 54-to-1. CEO Robeson Reeves made $2.3 million; the median worker made $41,912.
Red Rock Resorts, parent company of Station Casinos: 78-to-1. CEO Frank Fertitta made $3.3 million; the median worker made $42,864.
Golden Entertainment: 155-to-1. CEO Blake Sartini made $5.4 million; the median worker made $34,783.
Boyd Gaming Corp: 304-to-1. CEO Keith Smith made $11.5 million; the median worker made $37,755.
Penn Entertainment: 734-to-1. CEO Jay Snowden made $26.6 million; the median worker made $36,322.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Image-8-20-25-at-1.36 PM-1024x665.jpeg,,,2025-08-21 08:56:54.183579
,California,2025-08-21 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s politicians overlook potential pitfalls in their zeal for new laws,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/08/california-politicians-overlook-potential-pitfalls/,Someone could — and should — write a book about the seemingly countless incidents of adverse consequences in the decrees issued by California legislators and governors.,"Sociologist Robert Merton coined the term “unintended consequences” in a 1936 essay, exploring how people take actions they believe will have positive outcomes, but later learn they have negative impacts. Someone could — and should — write a book about the seemingly countless incidents of adverse consequences from the decrees issued by California legislators and governors.
Perhaps the most spectacular example is the ill-named “deregulation” of California’s electrical power system 29 years ago, embraced by legislators of both parties and then-Gov. Pete Wilson. Advocates hailed the overhaul as a bold act that would assure ample power supplies while reducing consumers’ utility bills.
However, it was an unmitigated disaster that invited manipulation of the electricity market and drove up costs. It plunged Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy and pushed Southern California Edison to the brink of insolvency.
Oddly, it did not curb the urge of California politicians to tamper with how their constituents obtain and pay for electricity. This year’s example is Senate Bill 540, a controversial measure which would, if enacted, have California join a regional power consortium with unpredictable consequences.
There are other major examples of legislation that backfired and is worth noting.
One is Assembly Bill 218, a 2019 bill that temporarily suspended the statute of limitations on sexual abuse lawsuits. Proponents said it would allow victims to finally receive justice, brushing aside criticism that it would be a bonanza for lawyers. Hundreds of suits against local governments and school systems have been filed, resulting in multibillion-dollar settlements, including a $4 billion payout by Los Angeles County to settle 6,800 claims from former foster children and formerly incarcerated minors.
The spate of abuse suits has also distorted the ability of public entities to acquire liability insurance. The bill’s author, former Assemblymember Lorena Gonzalez, has called for changes.
“When I authored AB 218 my priority was to protect kids from sex abuse & ensure victims could have some justice,” Gonzalez, now head of the California Federation of Labor Unions, said in social media post. “Now, some unscrupulous attorneys are treating it like feeding frenzy. I support reforms to cap attorneys’ fees or other measures to reel the costs in for public entities.”
There also are many other current examples of potentially harmful consequences, including the late-blooming effort by Gov. Gavin Newsom and Democratic legislators to alter — temporarily, they say — California’s 52 congressional districts to produce more Democratic members and offset a Republican-sponsored gerrymander in Texas.
The electric power and gerrymandering measures are not the only pieces of pending litigation with potentially negative consequences. Two of them involve school operations.
One is Assembly Bill 1264, aimed at removing ultra-processed foods from the millions of meals public schools serve to their students.
Advocates say such foods adversely affect children’s health, which is certainly a legitimate issue if proven. However, critics say that the legislation, which tasks defining such foods to a state agency, could ban foods that Californians commonly consume and result in a flood of lawsuits, not unlike what happened after Gonzalez’s child abuse law was enacted.
The other is Assembly Bill 495, which would expand the list of people who could take charge of public school students in the absence of their parents or designated caregivers. It’s aimed at protecting children of parents who have been swept up in the federal government’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants. However, critics say just about anyone could claim to be a substitute caregiver under the legislation’s loose definition, thereby potentially endangering children rather than protecting them.
As Merton pointed out in his essay, advocates of new policies or programs always stress their positive intentions, while downplaying or ignoring downside risks. It’s a dangerous syndrome, as California politicians should have learned by now.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/042924-State-Capitol-Session-MG-20.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-21 08:56:54.183579

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)A Birmingham-based community organizing group is organizing in the Black Belt amid fears the current presidential administration will not prioritize the ongoing sewage issues plaguing the region.
Faith in Action hosted two events in the past two months in Lowndes County, ground-zero for the wastewater crisis. A July meeting informed attendees about the problem and how the Trump administration terminated an agreement with Alabama to address the problem. The second, held last week, was a workshop to engage elected officials to solve the problem.
“We raised awareness, but now we have to be engaging public stakeholders so we can get to a resolution,” said Daniel Schwartz, executive director of Faith in Action Alabama, in an interview last week. “We will be having more public events, which is also important, but we also have these planning meetings to engage public officials.”

The workshop outlined a set of action items to execute an action plan that mobilized community members from the march and rally in July.
Several Black Belt communities have been plagued by a persistent raw sewage problem for years due to poverty, low population and a clay soil that can make septic systems ineffective.
Many homes have pipes that transport the waste into areas nearby, which can breed microbes and other parasites. Following a civil rights investigation, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Alabama Department of Public Health reached an agreement in 2023 to install sanitary systems.
DOJ at the time said ADPH had acted “in a consistent pattern of inaction and/or neglect concerning the health risks associated with raw sewage” and had threatened residents who could not afford proper sewer systems with prosecution under sanitation laws.
“Despite ADPH’s awareness of the issues and the disproportionate burden and impact placed on Black residents in Lowndes County, it failed to take meaningful actions to remedy these conditions,” the DOJ said in a statement at the time.
ADPH was directed to suspend criminal penalties and liens on property for households who could not afford to resolve their wastewater issue. It was also ordered to research the public health risk of the sanitation problem in Lowndes County; create a public awareness campaign, assess septic and wastewater management systems and develop a plan for improving the infrastructure.
“That is the part of the agreement that was really integral to pushing the installation of functioning, onsite septic systems in the area where there are these persistent issues with failing onsite septic systems,” said Chandra Taylor-Sawyer, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC), who researches environmental issues, in an interview this month.
However, the Justice Department under Trump terminated the agreement, citing an executive order that attacked diversity, equity and inclusion efforts by the federal government.
“The DOJ will no longer push ‘environmental justice’ as viewed through a distorting, DEI lens,” said Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division in the news release. “President Trump made it clear: Americans deserve a government committed to serving every individual with dignity and respect, and to expending taxpayer resources in accordance with the national interest, not arbitrary criteria.”
The march and rally organized in July was meant to draw attention to not only the ongoing raw sewage crisis but also highlight how the current administration is potentially scaling back efforts to address raw sewage by terminating the agreement.
“The short term consequences will relate back to how motivated the state of Alabama is to seek additional funding for the installation of onsite septic systems who need them and cannot afford them,” Taylor-Sawyer said.  “The pressure that was created from the agreement is no longer there.”
The state had already allocated some funding to address sewage issues in Lowndes County through the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA). However, it was not enough to provide wastewater systems for all residents.
“The state can continue to use the information that was collected to take care of the residents in the state of Alabama when they know that so much harm is happening,” Taylor-Sawyer said.
Last week’s meeting built on the march and rally in July designed to keep the conversation about the problem ongoing.
“The people who have the problem don’t want to talk about it, and the people who don’t have the problem don’t want to talk about it,” said Letitia Watford, a resident of the Black Belt who attended the event in July. “And we all just wish it would go away, but it won’t go away without a lot of money. And we need to beat the drum until we get that money.”
Sen. Robert Stewart, D-Selma, who attended the rally in July, testified before Congress about the issue earlier this summer.
“I painted a picture of how the people of Lowndes County toil for justice, and they still have yet to receive the justice en mass of what they deserve, the environmental justice, the educational justice, the health care justice, and how all of this is related. We have gone from a war on poverty to a war on the poor, and we cannot take this lightly,” he said at the July event.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250726_091324-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-21 08:56:54.183579

Children and adults who receive health insurance through Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program will now be subject to immigration or citizenship status checks, according to a new initiative announced this week by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who oversees Medicaid as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. (Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)This week, the Trump administration’s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced an effort to check the immigration status of people who get their health insurance through Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.
Medicaid is the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. For families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford private insurance, CHIP is a public program that provides low-cost health coverage for their children.
The feds will begin sending states monthly enrollment reports that identify people with Medicaid or CHIP whose immigration or citizenship status can’t be confirmed through federal databases. States are then responsible for verifying the citizenship or immigration status of individuals in those reports. States are expected to take “appropriate actions when necessary, including adjusting coverage or enforcing non-citizen eligibility rules,” according to a CMS press release.

“We are tightening oversight of enrollment to safeguard taxpayer dollars and guarantee that these vital programs serve only those who are truly eligible under the law,” Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who oversees CMS as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said in a press release announcing the new program.
As of April, roughly 71 million adults and children nationwide have Medicaid coverage, while another 7 million children have insurance through CHIP. Immigrants under age 65 are less likely to be covered by Medicaid than U.S.-born citizens, according to an analysis from health research organization KFF.
Immigrants who are in the country illegally aren’t eligible for federally funded Medicaid and CHIP. Only citizens and certain lawfully present immigrants — green card holders and refugees, for example — can qualify.
But some states have chosen to expand Medicaid coverage for immigrants with their own funds. Twenty-three states offer pregnancy-related care regardless of citizenship or immigration status, according to KFF. Fourteen states provide coverage for children in low-income families regardless of immigration status, while seven states offer coverage to some adults regardless of status.
The tax and spending package President Donald Trump last month cuts federal spending on Medicaid by more than $1 trillion, leaving states to either make up the difference with their own funds or reduce coverage. But the new law also includes restrictions on coverage for certain immigrants, including stripping eligibility from refugees and asylum-seekers.

DemasAs Michigan’s budget stalemate continues in the weeks leading up to Labor Day, one area of consternation between the Democratic-led state Senate and the Republican-controlled state House is how to pay for road repair and maintenance in perpetuity as existing bond funding and projects lapse.
A clear outlook for road funding has been deemed critical for the current budget process to finally wrap, with both the House and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer emphasizing that no budget for the coming fiscal year would be complete without a negotiated plan for roads. 
The lack of a plan from the Senate has jammed up the process, at least as far as the House is concerned.
Entering the next fiscal year and beyond without a smoothly paved funding path has other dire consequences for Michigan aside from the political machinations of the Legislature.
In a statement released Tuesday, the Michigan Department of Transportation said the department was reviewing critical unfunded infrastructure needs across the state, which it said includes more than 100 state trunkline bridges at risk of closure by 2035 if lawmakers don’t act soon to fund road repairs and rebuilds. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
MDOT said the potential for bridge closures statewide would have a daily impact on more than 1.8 million drivers and the roadways they serve.
“As MDOT works to continue addressing declining road and bridge conditions, securing a comprehensive road funding package is becoming more critical,” the department said Tuesday. “Following the conclusion of the Rebuilding Michigan bond funding program, MDOT will see a decrease of more than half the annual reconstruction budget, bringing the yearly investment for rebuilding roads from $495 million per year to just $222 million per year, and supporting about 2,800 fewer construction jobs in 2026.”
MDOT Director Brad Wieferich added that, “at this rate, by decade’s end, nearly 50 percent of state routes, which carry 53 percent of total traffic and 80 percent of commercial traffic, will be in poor condition.”
“Without additional investment, those projections will get worse,” Wieferich said.
The predictions should cause concern for the Legislature and motivate it to get moving on roads, whether it completes that plan before the whole budget or along with it before the constitutional deadline of Sept. 30.
Democratic lawmakers say federal budget cuts will hurt Michigan efforts at road funding plan 

Both Whitmer and House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) have put forward plans to fund Michigan’s roads, but the Senate has yet to do so.
In a news conference held Wednesday to castigate House Republicans for not completing their full budget as the clock winds down, the onus was put back on the Senate for its own inaction on road funding.
Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) was asked about MDOT’s new predictions, and when the state might see the Senate’s plan.
Brinks said the chamber continues to have conversations about its plan and that it can’t get a good grip on roads without a responsible budget passed in both chambers, which the Senate has done while the House drags its feet. 
The majority leader said the key factor was consideration for other areas impacted by the budget, such as K-12 funding, if that money is pooled to pay for roads.
“We continue to work on that, and we are committed to that,” Brinks said. “I refuse to make the choice between funding schools and funding roads. The people of Michigan should be able to expect us to fund all of the fundamental things that the state government is responsible for.”
Brinks was asked how many more conversations needed to be had given that it was already eight months into the calendar year without a Senate plan in play.
State Sen. Sam Singh (D-East Lansing) jumped in to answer that one, saying people needed to be in the room to negotiate, and to possibly understand the frustrations the Senate was facing.
Senate Democrats hold off on specific road funding plan, cite need for bipartisan agreement

“Obviously, the speaker’s plan, we haven’t seen how he actually funds that plan, because he hasn’t shown us the budget,” Singh said. “We are willing to have the negotiations. I know our leader has been in those rooms, having those conversations with the governor and others. And we can take a look. There’s some elements of the governor plan we like. There’s some elements that we don’t like, but you have to have everyone in the room to do the negotiation.”
Singh added that the Legislature doesn’t need five or six competing plans to start negotiations, calling each existing plan more of a framework.
“We have to do this within the context of the budget, and that’s what we’re seeing,” Singh said. “By not having people in the room having that conversation, not having a full budget, you can’t talk about all these pieces.”
Brinks and company were also asked if they were willing to take drastic measures on roads with a plan containing cuts to either Whitmer or Hall’s plans just to get things moving.
Brinks said she and the Senate were “entertaining every possible means to get a responsible budget passed.”
In response to the Senate’s press conference and the roads issue at large, Hall told Michigan Advance that the Senate’s refusal to pass a plan came as both he and Whitmer called for the chamber to include it in the larger budget talks.
Hall also accused the Senate budget that was passed in May as being short by more than $1 billion and “illegally unbalanced, but they refuse to fix it.”
“And they refuse to vote on our bigger and better school budget, which has been stuck in their chamber for months,” Hall said. “At every step of the process, they’re holding up the budget and dragging things out.”
While the school funding plan passed by the House in June included one of the largest increases to per-pupil funding for public schools in years, Democrats and education advocates argue that the GOP plan would result in many key costs for school meal and at-risk programs either needing to be reduced or eliminated or otherwise paid for with dollars meant for classrooms.
Regardless, Hall said he believed Senate Democrats needed to either step up to the plate and embrace the existing road plans, or let Whitmer pinch hit for them in the negotiating process.
“She would actually do a good job,” Hall said of Whitmer in that scenario. “This standoff between the radical wing of the [Democratic] Party and the reasonable Democrats is delaying everything.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_4520-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-21 07:58:09.561232

Research from the Bipartisan Policy Center shows turnover among election workers reached a new high in 2024. (Photo by Spenser Heaps/Utah News Dispatch)Election officials turned over at the highest rate in at least a quarter century during the last presidential election, according to new research from the Bipartisan Policy Center.
An analysis of shifts in election officials published Tuesday found nearly 41% of election officials administering the 2024 election were different than those in 2020. Turnover has accelerated over the past two decades, rising from about 28% in 2004 to 40.9% last year.
The growing percentage of departing election officials comes after years of challenges. They navigated the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as well as harassment and false conspiracy theories surrounding stolen elections that persist today.
The analysis released by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based group that seeks to foster policy cooperation across party lines, represents an updated version of a report that previously examined turnover from 2004 to 2022. The new research, which extends the data through 2024, shows the turnover rate continued to climb.

The change means that, over time, election officials have less experience. The research found that the share of chief local election officials with six or more years in their role has dropped from 60% in 2006 to 47% in 2024.
But last year, 60% of election officials had previously overseen the administration of a presidential election in their jurisdiction.
“Despite increasing turnover and loss of experience, the majority of chief election officials still have experience running at least one presidential election cycle,” the analysis said. “This is important because presidential elections typically see the highest turnout and are the most visible elections administered.”
The analysis found that over the long term, election official turnover rates have been rising gradually in small jurisdictions, defined as areas with fewer than 100,000 voting-age residents. But large jurisdictions have experienced a more sudden jump in turnover.
Small jurisdictions had a 27% turnover rate in 2004 that had risen to 40% in 2024. But large jurisdictions enjoyed a turnover rate as low as 31% in 2018 before climbing rapidly to nearly 46% last year.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/110524_election-day_31-1024x6831754914039-1.jpg,,,2025-08-21 08:56:54.183579

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rep. Monique Priestley: A response to Vermont’s SNAP data disclosure.","This commentary is by Monique Priestley of Bradford. She is a Vermont state representative for Orange-2.


I share Vermonters’ anger and deep concern over the Scott administration’s decision to release sensitive SNAP data to the Trump administration. This action was not legally necessary, ethically defensible nor protective of the privacy and dignity of our neighbors.
Gov. Phil Scott’s administration stated that Vermont had no choice but to comply. Meanwhile, national privacy and legal experts — including the Center for Democracy & Technology, Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) and Protect Democracy — made clear in their detailed May 2025 analysis that the USDA’s request violated several federal laws, specifically the Privacy Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act and the E-Government Act. 
USDA failed to meet legally required steps before requesting Vermonters’ personal data, including publishing notices for public comment, creating a privacy impact assessment and establishing a system of records.

Attorney General Charity Clark recognized this clearly and was prepared to challenge the legality of this request. Instead, the Scott administration chose to comply without meaningful resistance, despite the fact that at least 20 other states refused on solid legal grounds. Vermont chose compliance over protecting Vermonters’ privacy and civil rights.
The damage this disclosure causes is real and immediate. Vermonters’ personal data — including Social Security numbers, addresses, income and household information — is now unnecessarily exposed. Such data can be misused in decisions regarding housing, employment, education, healthcare, insurance, loans and immigration. It threatens Vermont families with discrimination, surveillance and loss of critical support programs. Most troubling, it undermines trust, discouraging people from seeking the assistance they need for fear their information will be used against them.
I have spent the past several years leading efforts in the Legislature to strengthen Vermont’s data privacy protections. Many fellow legislators joined this tripartisan fight and supported comprehensive privacy laws, only to face a veto from Gov. Scott in 2024 and significant industry opposition again in 2025. We could have acted sooner to prevent this exact situation. Some politicians now speaking out publicly failed to step up when it mattered most: when we were in the trenches, crafting meaningful legislation to protect Vermonters’ privacy.
Leadership is not speaking up only when headlines break. It requires showing up every day, pushing back against powerful lobbyists and taking tough, principled stands when no one is watching. Vermonters deserve genuine, consistent advocacy, not opportunistic statements issued after the fact.
Today, I urge Vermonters across all political parties to unite behind strong data privacy protections. Privacy is a fundamental issue that transcends partisan divides. Democrats, Republicans, Progressives and Independents alike share core values of freedom, dignity and protection from unjust surveillance. We must turn our collective concern into sustained action and demand that our elected officials fully commit to passing strong privacy laws.
I believe we have an obligation to lead proactively on these issues. Privacy rights affect us all, and protecting Vermonters’ dignity and personal freedom must remain central to our shared mission.
Vermont can lead again by enacting enforceable privacy protections that respect and safeguard every resident’s personal information. I will continue fighting for these critical rights, and I ask Vermonters everywhere to join me in holding all elected officials accountable.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sen. Joe Major: Gov. Phil Scott’s “measured approach” is the wrong approach for Vermont.","Dear Editor,


In recent weeks, Gov. Phil Scott has once again made it clear that he is unwilling to fully confront the Trump administration. When pressed on the matter, Gov. Scott maintained that he wouldn’t “sign on to every single lawsuit on everything the Trump administration does,” saying such a strategy wouldn’t be “beneficial” and would make for “a long three and a half years” under President Trump.
What Scott fails to acknowledge is that — beneficial or not — it is going to be a long three and a half years, regardless. That’s not a reason to hold back. It’s a reason to dig in. Here in Vermont, we pride ourselves on standing up for what’s right. We don’t sit on the sidelines when our values, our communities, and our democracy are under threat. We fight.
Back in February 2025, amid nationwide protests against the Trump administration’s policies and rhetoric, Gov. Scott said Vermont would take a “measured approach” and couldn’t “be outraged at every single thing that happens.” But that time is over. The scope and speed of this administration’s attacks on civil liberties, environmental protections and democratic norms leave no room for half-measures. Silence and selective engagement send the wrong message — to Vermonters and to the rest of the country.
It is unfortunate that Gov. Scott does not see this. His cautious stance may be politically convenient, but it is not morally sufficient. The numbers speak for themselves: Trump’s approval rating here in Vermont stands at just 26 percent, the lowest in the nation. That means an overwhelming majority of Vermonters want us — not just to “measure” our responses—but to lead the resistance.
The citizens of this state expect their leaders to do more than issue carefully worded statements. They want us to stand shoulder to shoulder with other states fighting in the courts, in Congress and in our communities to protect our rights and values. They want us to act — not out of partisan reflex — but out of moral responsibility.
I wish Gov. Scott could see that. Vermont has never been a state that waits for others to take the first step. It’s time for our governor to join the fight.

But a top Republican said Wednesday that she’s been unable to get a look at it.
Jennifer Bukowsky of Columbia, vice chair of the Republican State Committee, said she expects a special session of the Legislature to be called after there is agreement between the Trump White House and the Republican National Committee on how to revise current boundaries.
President Donald Trump and his political advisers are pushing Missouri to join Texas in redrawing districts to favor the GOP. Any proposal is likely to split the 5th District, which is mainly in Kansas City, by adding Republican voters in sufficient numbers to take it away from incumbent U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver.
That would give Republicans seven of the state’s eight seats in the U.S. House instead of the current six.
“I’ve tried to get a hold of the map that I’ve heard about,” Bukowsky said. “I guess I’m not important enough to be consulted.”
 Missouri Congressional districts (Missouri Secretary of State’s Office).
The push for redistricting in Republican-led states is an effort to shore up the thin Republican majority in Congress. With a 219-212 majority — four seats are vacant, including three previously held by Democrats — Republicans are worried that a small shift in voter sentiment could put them again in the minority.
Redistricting is usually done in the first legislative session after census data is released and the districts remain in place for 10 years. 
Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Gov. Mike Kehoe said the biggest consideration for him is maintaining the Republican majority in Congress.
“Our goal, if we move forward — and there’s no decision to move forward — is to make sure Missouri’s values are reflected in Washington, D.C.,” Kehoe said. “And I’ve said many times that I think our current speaker does a very good job of matching the values of Missourians.”
Republican members of the Missouri House have been told there will be two caucus meetings scheduled to coincide with the annual veto session, which starts Sept. 10, state Rep. Barry Hovis, a Republican from Cape Girardeau said Wednesday in an interview with The Independent.
One meeting, he said, is presumably to discuss whether there are any vetoes the House wants to override. In the other, Hovis expects an in-depth discussion of redistricting.
For Hovis, one consideration on whether to redraw Missouri’s map will be if Democratic states  California, Illinois or New York revise their maps in response to the action in Texas. Gerrymandered districts that give one party far more representation than their share of the overall vote can be seen in every state dominated by a single party, he said. Illinois has a district that looks like a snake, he said, while Massachusetts — where Republicans get about the same share of the vote as Democrats in Missouri — has no GOP congressional seats.
Democrats will complain they are being denied representation, Hovis said.
“If they’re going to bring (Texas) up, I’m going to say, well, ‘we’re just doing what you guys taught us to do’,” Hovis said.
Until Kehoe makes the call, Hovis said, the whole discussion is speculation.
“For me to tell you that I know exactly what we’re going to do here, I truly don’t,” he said.
Missouri’s current congressional map was approved by lawmakers in 2022 after a bitter GOP factional dispute that centered on efforts to draw seven Republican-controlled districts. And with Democrats promising to filibuster any redistricting bill in the Senate, getting a new map approved will also be difficult.
The biggest challenge for Republicans, Hovis said, will be to draw a map that doesn’t put districts the party currently holds at risk with large numbers of new Democratic votes. 
“If we go to the Kansas City model, the one that I saw when we did this several years ago, we’re going to have some districts that could be more purple than red, and we could end up being 5-3, real easy, or worst case scenario, 4-4.”
The people most interested in redistricting, Bukowsky said, are incumbents. They want a map that retains the voters who have come to know their name, while potential opponents want a map that includes voters who share their ideology.
“Whenever they’re doing redistricting,” Bukowsky said, “it’s like the two parties are incumbents and challengers.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092623_mocapitol1-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-08-21 07:58:09.561232

(Getty Images)Hoosier employers want to work with students and adult learners seeking on-the-job training, according to a recent survey, but few take advantage because they don’t have the time, capacity or funds. 
The newly released results from a summertime survey conducted by Chamberlin/Dunn, LLC on behalf of the Indiana Fiscal Policy Institute, included 348 employers across 62 counties and 17 industries. Both Ivy Tech Community College and the Indiana Chamber Research Foundation supported the study, which had both small employers with less than 50 employees and larger employers with over 1,000 employees.
Indiana secures $6.25 million to advance apprenticeships

“We know that employer demand for workers continues to outpace Indiana’s supply of Hoosiers looking for work, leading to policy makers in the state to create robust youth and adult work-based learning and other talent development programming,” said Stephanie Wells, the president of IFPI. “This research was conducted, in part, to determine if that employer demand for talent translates into a willingness on the part of employers to participate in these programs.”
Eight-five percent of employers were families with youth and adult training opportunities, but just 67% had trained a youth employee compared to 73% for adults. Smaller employers were less likely to have attempted either type of work-based learning.
And while liability concerns and logistics for youth played a factor, especially for those under the age of 18, the top barrier to participation was staff capacity. 
“Staff availability to manage trainees was the only listed barrier selected by more than half of respondents,” according to the accompanying report, with 56% of employers opting for that survey choice.
Staff workload ranked higher than legal or liability issues, compliance concerns, financial burden and buy-in. 
For those that could support such work-based learning, most employers reported a capacity to serve between one to five students or trainees per year, regardless of their industry or company size. Only very large employers, with over 1,000 employees, reported being able to host more than 11 such workers. 
Indiana’s demand for apprenticeship is rising after education officials approved a massive high school diploma redesign last year. The new graduation plan includes more personalized learning pathways and experiences, including taking college courses while in high school and work-based learning opportunities and apprenticeships.
 More report details

Widening their talent pipelines was also a key concern for employers, with most saying that identifying workers was a “moderate challenge.” One-quarter said it was a “major challenge.” 
Though smaller companies selected finances as a challenge more than large employers, over half of all respondents selected wage subsidies, direct grants or reimbursements as “the most impactful” to removing barriers. For adults, employers estimated they would need an incentive between $1,000 and $5,000 per trainee — compared to $500-$2,499 for youth. Construction industries estimated needing more costs offset when compared to educational or health care industries.

Construction companies were also more likely to feel like their share of costs for such employees should be less than half, with the state helping to subsidize that education. At the other end, utilities and health care or social assistance employers said employers should cover most of the costs. 
With fewer barriers, 80% of employers said they would participate more in work-based learning opportunities for both student and adult learners. 
The 26-page report concluded with eight policy considerations as stakeholders consider work-based learning opportunities — and hurdles.
Policy options include: 

Targeting funding and technical assistance for small and mid-sized businesses
Creating or expanding intermediary organizations
Identifying training models such as remote or project-based learning and job shadowing
Establishing incentive programs based on industry and organization size
Investing in employer talent development programming
Encouraging employers to review legal and compliance policies specifically for youth work-based learning
Setting realistic benchmarks for employer participation
Leveraging local and regional chambers, economic development initiatives and workforce organizations to support talent development

“We are committed to contributing to the conversation around workforce and education policy by providing nonpartisan research that policy makers and community leaders can use while making critical decisions that impact Hoosier learners and businesses,” Wells said.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)Summer heat is bearing down on U.S. prisons, where temperatures in uncooled cells can climb well into the triple digits.
Facing growing pressure from advocacy groups, lawsuits and climate projections that show hotter days ahead, some state prison systems are moving to install air conditioning and expand cooling measures — though many facilities remain years away from significant upgrades.
But in other states, such efforts have stalled or failed. That may lead to more lawsuits in the future, experts say, even as judges may raise the bar for such cases.
An emphasis on being “tough on crime” and prioritizing other public safety measures may have contributed to less attention on prison conditions in some states. In others, slowing revenue growth and pressure to rein in corrections spending could be making new investments a harder sell.
At least two states this year, Virginia and Texas, considered legislation addressing excessive heat in prisons but neither measure became law. The Texas bill would have required the state Department of Criminal Justice to purchase and install climate control systems in all of its facilities by the end of 2032. About two-thirds of the state’s correctional facilities have only partial or no air conditioning.
The measure passed the House but did not advance in the Senate before the legislature adjourned in June.
In Virginia, lawmakers approved a bill that would have required the state corrections department to install heat and air conditioning in its prisons and to ensure cell temperatures not exceed 80 degrees. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed it, citing the cost of installation and operational burdens. Youngkin also wrote that existing state corrections data “does not substantiate the claims of extreme temperatures or health risks.”
But in Delaware, the fiscal year 2026 capital budget approved last month includes $2 million in funding to install air conditioning at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center.
These changes mark the latest actions in a long-running debate over how correctional systems respond to rising summer temperatures — an issue that affects both incarcerated people and staff. Some of the policy debates and facility updates this year follow years of advocacy and litigation over the health, safety and operational challenges posed by heat in correctional settings.

The problem of excessive heat in prisons has persisted for decades and has unfolded alongside other challenges, including chronic understaffing and overcrowding. In some cases, these problems have led to extended facility lockdowns, even during the summer months.
“There are people working in prisons and they have the right to work in climates that are comfortable,” said Nancy La Vigne, a criminal justice researcher and dean of the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University. “When they’re not, there’s retention issues, and it’s hard to replace staff. And when you don’t replace staff, then you have challenges in maintaining the safety and security of the facility.”
In New York, for example, correctional officers staged a three-week strike earlier this year and many didn’t return to work. Some facilities now are operating with 30%-60% fewer guards than needed, resulting in some incarcerated people getting only an hour or two outside of their cells each day.
A 2023 study published in the peer-reviewed PLOS One journal found that mortality in state and private prisons rose during periods of extreme heat, with deaths increasing 3.5% on extreme heat days and up to 7.4% during three-day heat waves. Between 2001 and 2019, nearly 13,000 people died in prison during the summer months, almost half of them in the South, though the study did not determine how many of those deaths were directly attributable to heat.
Climate change is fueling longer, more intense periods of extreme heat. Exposure to extreme heat can worsen conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and asthma, and has also been linked to worsening mental health and higher suicide rates among incarcerated people.
“Average temperatures are rising, and you’re going to have more and more states around the country where incarcerated people are held in conditions that are not livable because they’re too hot,” said Sharon Dolovich, a law professor and director of the Prison Law and Policy Program at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Some upgrades
At least 44 states lack universal air conditioning within their prison facilities, even in regions known for sweltering summer temperatures, according to a 2022 USA Today analysis. A recent Reuters investigation also found that nearly half of state prisons across 29 states have partial or no air conditioning in housing units.
But some states are investing millions to update their prison facilities.
In North Carolina, corrections officials are working toward their goal of installing air conditioning in all 54 state prisons by 2026. To date, 33 facilities are fully air-conditioned, 17 are partially air-conditioned, and four have no air conditioning, according to its dashboard.
In California, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, which operates 31 adult prisons, has spent $246 million in the past five years on cooling improvements at five prisons, according to a department spokesperson.
Lawmakers this year also approved funding for the Air Cooling Pilot Program at three facilities, with $17.6 million allocated for fiscal years 2025-26 and $20 million for fiscal years 2026-27. It will evaluate the effectiveness of two alternatives prior to a statewide plan to address high indoor temperatures across the California prison system.

The Texas Department of Criminal Justice, as of Aug. 1, is building 12,827 “cool beds,” or prison cells in air-conditioned units, and is in the process of procuring an additional 7,162, according to its dashboard.
Texas is one of the states most closely associated with heat-related deaths in prison. A 2022 study estimated that, on average, 14 deaths per year in Texas prisons are associated with heat. And a Texas Tribune analysis found that at least 41 incarcerated people died during a record-breaking heat wave in 2023.
In March, a federal judge ruled the extreme heat in Texas prisons is “plainly unconstitutional,” but declined to order immediate air conditioning, saying the work could not be completed within the court order’s 90-day window and temporary systems might delay a permanent fix.
‘More miserable’ 
Sweltering summer heat can turn prisons into pressure cookers. People inside already may have health conditions, limited access to cooling, or take medications that make it harder for their bodies to handle the heat. And research suggests that high temperatures can heighten irritability and aggression, sometimes fueling more conflicts between incarcerated people or with staff.
“It makes you more miserable. … If you to the point of even thinking about suicide, that’s just going to add to it,” said Ronald McKeithen, who spent 37 years incarcerated in Alabama prisons and is now the director of second chances at the Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice. McKeithen recalls feeling “on edge” due to tension among other incarcerated people on hot days.
At the Oshkosh Correctional Institution in Wisconsin, Devin Skrzypchak said the heat worsens his bladder condition, and he often can’t get the incontinence briefs he needs. The heat forces him to drink more water, and on days when ice isn’t available, he’s left drenched in sweat.
“At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating,” Skrzypchak wrote in a message to Stateline through the facility’s messaging platform.



At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating.


– Devin Skrzypchak, who is incarcerated at Oshkosh Correctional Institution in Wisconsin



D’Angelo Lee Komanekin — who has spent about 25 years in and out of different Wisconsin corrections facilities — said prison architecture plays a major role in why temperatures inside climb so high.
“The planet is getting hotter and hotter,” said Komanekin, who relies on a small plastic fan to stay cool. Komanekin also is incarcerated at the Oshkosh Correctional Institution. “They’re doing nothing about the architecture. Some institutions’ windows open, some don’t, but most of the doors have steel doors with trap doors.”
Older prison designs that rely heavily on steel and concrete building materials often trap heat, making it difficult to keep temperatures down in the summer. Aging facilities also are less likely to be equipped for the installation of central air conditioning.
Some state prison systems, including Alabama’s and Wisconsin’s, are adding air-conditioning or air-tempering systems to new prison construction and major renovation projects.
Future legal battles 
Legal experts say the issue of excessive heat in prisons is likely to become more pressing as climate change drives longer and hotter summers.
Extreme heat in correctional facilities has already been the subject of litigation in dozens of states, with plaintiffs arguing that high temperatures constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Court rulings in these cases have varied, but some experts say even more lawsuits are likely if facilities do not adapt.
“The conditions are going to worsen. [Incarcerated people are] going to be looking for every possible avenue for assistance they can,” Dolovich, the UCLA law professor, told Stateline.

One of the latest cases comes from Missouri, where the nonprofit law firm MacArthur Justice Center filed a class-action lawsuit in May on behalf of six incarcerated people at Algoa Correctional Center.
The lawsuit alleges that the conditions violate their constitutional rights under the Eighth Amendment. It seeks to require the Missouri Department of Corrections to work with experts to develop a heat mitigation plan that keeps housing unit temperatures between 65 and 85 degrees. If the department cannot meet that standard, the plaintiffs are asking for the release of three of the incarcerated people who have less than a year remaining on their sentences.
Lawsuits such as the Missouri case often focus on claims that extreme heat worsens existing medical problems. To proceed, they must meet two legal requirements: proving the heat poses a serious health or safety risk, and showing prison officials knew about the danger but failed to address it, according to Dolovich, whose work has focused on the Eighth Amendment and prison conditions.
Courts may also raise the bar for proving such claims if judges echo decisions in cases with similar Eight Amendment arguments related to the death penalty and homelessness, Dolovich said. Judges have shifted, she said, toward a “superadding terror, pain and disgrace” standard under the Eighth Amendment — a higher threshold requiring proof that conditions were created with the intent to cause unnecessary suffering.
Dolovich added that some recent court decisions have provided only narrow remedies, such as ordering ice and fans instead of installing air conditioning.
“Prison officials have a moral and a constitutional responsibility to respond to changing conditions. In this case, it means air conditioning. … Anything less than that, to me, is indefensible.” she said.

(Legislative Support Services)Washington state lawmakers long resisted routinely taking testimony from those not seated in a committee hearing room.
But when forced by the pandemic to operate remotely for two sessions, their minds changed and it is reshaping public involvement in the legislative process.
Thousands signed up to testify remotely this past legislative session. They took part from their homes, their offices and their cars.
Thousands more, sometimes tens of thousands, who did not want to speak still went online to register support or opposition to pending legislation. Organizations pressing to pass or defeat bills sometimes cited the numbers to bolster their arguments. 
When crowds did pack hearings on controversial bills, lawmakers wanted to know how many had taken a stand via the online option, as another barometer of public opinion.
“It’s encouraging to see more people engaging — testifying in committee, sharing comments on legislation, and emailing lawmakers,” said House Speaker Laurie Jinkins, D-Tacoma. “We’ve worked to expand these options so that people across the state, including those far from Olympia, can participate.”
House committees held 326 meetings with public hearings this past session. For those, 11,768 people signed up to testify in person or remotely and 8,963, or 76%, did get to say their piece, according to tallies provided by legislative staff. Another 585,378 people signed in with a viewpoint but did not wish to testify.
In the Senate, there were 302 committee sessions with hearings and 10,037 people sought to speak. There were 615,023 people who weighed in without testifying in the course of the 105-day session, three times as many as the shorter 2024 session.
“It’s a good thing. It means more public engagement. Now they have a way to express their opinion on a deeply unpopular bill,” said Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia. “That’s good for democracy.
Braun points to what transpired with Democrat-sponsored legislation to repeal a voter-approved limit on property tax growth. Republicans fought the bill in both chambers, rallying residents to state their opposition at public hearings.
On March 31, when the Senate version reached the Senate Ways and Means Committee, 308 people signed in to speak, with 288 opposed. Of the 45,174 not wishing to testify, 42,865 signed in as opposed, based on sign-in logs posted online.

A similar scenario unfolded April 3 in the House Finance Committee for a hearing on the original House bill to hike the cap on the annual property tax growth factor. This time, 16,027 people who did not testify signed in opposed, versus 2,183 in support. Eventually, the controversial provision was stripped from this bill.
“Providing the option of remote testimony helps open the door to the state capital and allows more voices to be heard before laws are passed affecting the daily lives of citizens and businesses,” said Jason Mercier, who lobbied hard for allowing remote testimony a decade ago while working at the Washington Policy Center.
Mercier recalled testifying remotely for the first time in May 2013 at a hearing chaired by Republican Mike Padden, the former Spokane state senator who embraced the idea early on as a way for his constituents to participate without having to travel to Olympia.
Six years later, the Senate committed to making remote testimony a permanent option and the House leaned into doing it on a trial basis with several of its panels.
This allowed Washington’s Legislature to hit the ground running during the pandemic, said Mercier, now vice president and director of research for Mountain States Policy Center in Idaho.
COVID-19 arrived in early 2020, worsening after that year’s short legislative session. Lawmakers worked entirely from home in 2021 and only a handful could be on the floor at any one time in 2022.
Since returning in-person, they’ve made it routine to participate from outside Olympia.
“It took time and effort, but Washington state is now the model for other states across the country for remote testimony,” Mercier said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/senate-chambers-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-08-21 07:58:09.561232

(Photo courtesy of Minnesota Department of Corrections).When the Department of Corrections announced in May that it will close the Stillwater prison, reactions from state government were largely positive. 
“I think we owe [incarcerated people] 2025 conditions,” said state Rep. Paul Novotny, R-Elk River. 
Even before the announcement, the Minnesota Office of the Ombudsman for Corrections had put out a report saying conditions were so bad “that closing the facility must be seriously considered.”
The problem is, nobody asked us — the prisoners, the people who will be most affected by the closure — what we think. 
The answer is complicated. 
As state legislators rightly pointed out, Stillwater is an outdated prison. The sewer pipes are so rusted that the water coming out of our faucets is brown. The windows are broken. There is no air conditioning. It feels like we lose five pounds a day during the summer from sweating in the extreme heat.
But some prisoners have lived here for decades. For some of us, Stillwater is the place we have lived the longest. Over that time, we have built long-term friendships, we have gotten comfortable with our social circles, we have come to feel a sense of belonging. 
At times, the dynamics are so strong that the community feels like a family. 
The long-term prisoners offer insight to the new prisoners on how to gain a routine and do their time. On a regular day, we see a group of people working out together, another cooking together, others playing cards, another group studying together. Everywhere you look, we see people educating and helping one another. 
There is no question, serving time in Stillwater, as in any prison, is brutal and dehumanizing. But for now, we call this place home, proof that we can create an identity, even in this oppressive environment.
It’s not just the relationships we have here, though. 
Stillwater has programs, college, religious groups — our third spaces where people have come together and created guidance for each other. It takes time and vulnerability to gain a sense of security and comfort where we as people can truly grow with each other. 
When we get transferred to another facility, there is no guarantee that we will have access to those programs, programs that are supposed to help us with our rehabilitation. 
But there is a guarantee that these circles that we have cultivated will be divided. 
There’s a possibility that even the students, who have worked hard to get to college, may be forced to give up their educational status.
There’s something else, too, though: We are human beings. 
Some may say we broke the law and that we deserve to be punished. 
But we are also people — people with ideas, people with feelings, people with families and social ties. 
It has taken some time, self-reflection and genuine truth for us to realize that our actions that got us incarcerated had a ripple effect. 
They impacted our families, friends and communities tremendously. 
It has also taken some more time and effort to repair these relationships. 
The Department of Corrections needs to understand that the closure of Stillwater will also have a ripple effect. 
It’s a fact that the Stillwater facility is the closest to the Twin Cities; therefore, no matter where we go, the commute for our loved ones to come visit us will likely be longer, ultimately making it tougher for them to come visit us. 
And, who knows what other unforeseen barriers will arise at the other facilities?
Commissioner, administration and whomever else that made these decisions: All we ask is that we would like to have a moment of your attention to give you our perspective.
We fully understand that we are prisoners, and are considered property of the state of Minnesota. 
But we also have a voice, and our voice collectively deserves to be heard. A little bit of dialogue and communication is all we seek. A little bit of human interaction should not be too much to ask for.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)With another fire season upon us several news articles have appeared about the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation wildfire suppression cost audit that indicates on average taxpayers have paid $30+ million in wildfire costs per year.  An audit was done of these costs (though it is unclear if this was done by the state or contracted out to a private entity) and indicated that rural private forest landowners are the main beneficiaries and essentially their rural lifestyles and homes are “subsidized” by state funding because they are the main beneficiaries of wildfire suppression.  
The audit concluded that rural forest owners ought to pay the bulk of state agency wildfire suppression costs.  Nothing could be more misleading and misguided, and the real question that needs answering is how much did the state pay for this so-called audit, who conducted it, and why was there no actual scientific review of the audit before being published?    
As a forestry professional, scientist, and rural forest landowner, I have worked with rural forest landowners across both Idaho and Montana for more than 40 years.  The vast majority of landowners invested most of their income, work and free time into their properties during their lifetime with the main goal of protecting and conserving a piece of nature.   No exotic vacations to Hawaii, just work on their land in their spare time.  They are ranchers, farmers, forest workers, mechanics, shopkeepers and mill workers that were willing to endure living remotely because prior to COVID, that was where they could afford to buy affordable land and build a house. Most of them enrolled in evening classes (that I have taught for over 40 years) to learn about their forest, practice good conservation for wildlife habitat, forest health, water quality and above all, minimize wildfire risks on their properties.  And their efforts have paid off for the benefit of all Montanans.
The egregious fantasy portrayed by the DNRC wildfire cost audit is that the biggest cost associated with wildfire suppression is protecting rural houses.  I would expect such a conclusion to be drawn by a bunch of statisticians whose understanding of forested landscapes comes from watching Disney’s Lorax.  This is why “who did the audit” and “who reviewed it” before it was published is important.  The bottom line is that wildfires are landscape phenomenon driven by fuels, weather and topography.  If allowed to burn, they can cover millions of acres like the big blowup of 1910 where more than 3 million acres burned in over a week.  There are numerous other examples including the Great Oregon fire of 1845, Peshtigo fire in 1871, Yellowstone fires of 1988, and many more recent forest fires here at home including the Valley Complex in 2000 that burned across the southern Bitterroot, and the Lolo Peak fire in the northern Bitterroot of 2017.  Across our modern West, wildfires are expected phenomenon that need to be contained and controlled at some point on the landscape, or they will burn across towns and kill people.  This is well demonstrated by the more recent California fires such as the 2018 Camp fire that destroyed the town of Paradise, killed many, and burned an estimated 19,000 structures.  Likewise, this years’ Palisades-Los Angeles fires that destroyed more than 15,467 homes and killed more people.  But it is a big mistake to conflate recent California fires with those of Montana. 
I have reviewed almost every forest wildfire that has burned across Montana forested landscapes during the past 30 years based on how and why it burned, and the damage left behind.  
The majority of the fires were contained and controlled when they burned onto private forested lands by the excellent work of our fire crews.  This is where the statisticians make their horribly wrong main assumption, believing that wildfire fires are only contained in the wildland urban interface in order to protect homes.  Clearly home protection is an important goal.  But, the majority of wildfires are contained in the WUI because they can be due to the fuels reduction that private landowners have accomplished, often at their own cost.  Plus, private forest lands mostly have easy road access where fire crews and equipment like water tankers and dozers, and fire suppression crews conducting burnouts can be very effective and safe at containing a fire.  
So imagine you are a rural forest landowner who has done the work needed to help suppress wildfires, especially if your land borders federal lands where forest fuels reduction work has been hamstrung with endless litigation.  Containing wildfires in overgrown dense and dead trees is not possible, especially if you want to keep fire fighters alive.  Thus, you contain fires where fuel breaks or fuels reduction has occurred.  There are many rural landowners whose property was used to contain wildfires regardless of how and why they started without any compensation for the losses brought about by fire containment tactics such as fire-line construction, “burnouts” or backburns.  And now an “official” audit comes out indicating that these same private forest property owners should pay for the wildland fire suppression costs that protect all communities, including urban towns and infrastructure across Montana.  This is like charging the good Samaritan who stops to help a car crash victim for the cost of the ambulance.  
All Montana citizens benefit from wildland fire protection because we all can suffer the consequences, even in well-established towns.  If we do not control wildfires in the wildland urban interface, we will lose entire towns like those in California where landowners in the WUI have been prevented from practicing forest density reduction and other vegetation control due to state-mandated over-concern for “native habitat” and no concern for the rural residents that live there.

Their resolve to remain is being tested as never before as Israeli military forces slaughter and starve the people of Gaza. Their perseverance and humanity merit expanded global activism, particularly by the public domestically since the United States is Israel’s chief enabler. 
Bob Suberi of St. Louis is among the millions of people protesting in solidarity with the Palestinians. 
Suberi is the son of Jewish-Palestinian immigrants to the United States, a Vietnam veteran and president of the local Veterans for Peace chapter. Last month, he was part of the 21-member international crew of the Handala, the latest vessel that sailed attempting to break Israel’s blockade of Gaza and deliver medicine, baby formula and other humanitarian supplies. 
Israeli naval commandos intercepted the ship in international waters on July 27 and abducted its crew, as others had done in response to nearly all the other 36 vessels launched by the Gaza Freedom Flotilla and allied groups since 2008. Only five ships have reached Gaza’s shores. 
All the journeys were protesting Israel’s blockadeimposed 18 years ago that controls all movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza by land, air and sea. Israeli officials released Suberi and the other members of the Handala‘s crew over the next few days, deporting most to their home countries. 
Suberi, a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen, instead travelled to the West Bank to continue “doing protective-presence” work he says he has done since 2019 with Palestinians targeted by Jewish settlers and Israeli soldiers. 
It’s heart-breaking to fathom the horrors Palestinians have endured, particularly in Gaza. 
Since October 2023, Israeli forces have killed more than 60,000 people, including 18,000 children; wounded more than 100,000 individuals; killed at least 184 journalists and media workers; destroyed all 12 of Gaza’s universities; destroyed about 70% of its infrastructure; and damaged or razed 16 cemeteries.
The famine threatens the lives of approximately two million Palestinians in Gaza. As of Aug. 12, health officials report that at least 227 Palestinians, including 100 children, have starved to death due to the continuing blockade. 
While 6,000 trucks are waiting at the border to enter Gaza, the United Nations reports, Israel on average has allowed just 85 in each day. Aid groups insist at least 600 trucks should enter daily to meet the peoples’ needs and halt the burgeoning catastrophe. 
Israel has been able to behave with criminal impunity particularly due to bipartisan U.S. backing and diplomatic cover. 
Israel received over $174 billion in U.S. assistance since its founding in 1948, more than any other nation. Our government, furthermore, provided at least $23 billion more in military aid to Israel from October 2023 to last September. In June, the U.S. cast the lone “no” vote, vetoing a UN Security Council resolution demanding an Israel-Hamas ceasefire. It marked the 50th time our country vetoed a Council measure on Israel. 
“If Israel’s genocide against Palestinians is going to be stopped,” Suberi said in a recent phone interview from the West Bank, “it will be by civil society.”
Trump signaled his acceptance of the war’s expansion, responding to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s announcement on Aug. 7 that the Israeli military would force the evacuation of a million Palestinians from Gaza City despite adamant international opposition. 
Months ago, the Trump administration embraced Israel’s proposed U.S.-financed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation to replace the effective UN network of 400 food-distribution sites across the Gaza Strip shut down by Israel. Instead, it opened just four militarized collection sites where Israeli soldiers and U.S. mercenaries have killed more than 1,800 Palestinians trying to collect food.
Suberi has traveled annually, since 2019, to Masafer Yatta, an area of villages in the West Bank. Hours after he was released from Israeli custody last month, Suberi received what proved to be a haunting call from Awdah al-Hathaleen, a friend who was instrumental in the making of “No Other Land,” the Academy-Award-winning documentary, 
“Come tonight,” Suberi recalls al-Hathaleen urging him. 
Too tired and hungry to travel immediately to visit his friend’s home in the village of Um al-Kheir, Suberi said he’d journey there the next day. Their reunion never occurred, however. 
The following day, al-Hathaleen, a peace activist and father of three, was documenting Jewish settlers expanding their nearby settlement (all approximately 150 are recognized internationally as being illegal). A notorious settler Yinon Levi was overseeing the unwelcome excavation of ground near a village structure. Brandishing a pistol, Levi fatally shot al-Hathaleen, who was filming the encounter. The Israeli human-rights group B’Tselem recently released a recording and report of the shooting.
Levi was initially detained by Israeli officials, put on house arrest and then set free. He was charged with no crime. Two days later he returned to the crime scene, overseeing more excavating. Levin also pointed out to soldiers seven Palestinians he claimed had threatened settlers, leading to their arrests. All were released days later after posting bail.  
Suberi considers himself a “recovered Zionist.” Until 15 years ago, he believed the central tenet of Zionism, that “God gave Jews the land” for a greater Israel where Palestinians had no right to dwell. 
Then he traveled to the West Bank and began to realize the humanity of the Palestinian people and the injustices they experience. 
May enough people of conscience in Missouri and beyond both recognize the right of Palestinians to exist and exercise steadfastness of their own to nonviolently compel our government to publicly condemn and end the bipartisan, uncritical support for Israel, and consequently, its genocide of our Palestinian kin.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2557.jpg,,,2025-08-21 06:56:46.372962

(Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)This week, the Trump administration’s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced an effort to check the immigration status of people who get their health insurance through Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.
Medicaid is the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. For families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford private insurance, CHIP is a public program that provides low-cost health coverage for their children.
The feds will begin sending states monthly enrollment reports that identify people with Medicaid or CHIP whose immigration or citizenship status can’t be confirmed through federal databases. States are then responsible for verifying the citizenship or immigration status of individuals in those reports. States are expected to take “appropriate actions when necessary, including adjusting coverage or enforcing non-citizen eligibility rules,” according to a CMS press release.

“We are tightening oversight of enrollment to safeguard taxpayer dollars and guarantee that these vital programs serve only those who are truly eligible under the law,” Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who oversees CMS as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said in a press release announcing the new program.
As of April, roughly 71 million adults and children nationwide have Medicaid coverage, while another 7 million children have insurance through CHIP. Immigrants under age 65 are less likely to be covered by Medicaid than U.S.-born citizens, according to an analysis from health research organization KFF.
Immigrants who are in the country illegally aren’t eligible for federally funded Medicaid and CHIP. Only citizens and certain lawfully present immigrants — green card holders and refugees, for example — can qualify.
But some states have chosen to expand Medicaid coverage for immigrants with their own funds. Twenty-three states offer pregnancy-related care regardless of citizenship or immigration status, according to KFF. Fourteen states provide coverage for children in low-income families regardless of immigration status, while seven states offer coverage to some adults regardless of status.
The tax and spending package President Donald Trump last month cuts federal spending on Medicaid by more than $1 trillion, leaving states to either make up the difference with their own funds or reduce coverage. But the new law also includes restrictions on coverage for certain immigrants, including stripping eligibility from refugees and asylum-seekers.

StebbinsAugust 29 may be the last chance for Michigan residents to weigh in on Enbridge Energy’s proposed Line 5 tunnel underneath the Straits of Mackinac. On that date, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy will stop accepting public comments on Enbridge’s permit application for the project, which seeks to encase the 72-year old pipeline in a concrete tunnel.
Brian O’Mara, a 30-year veteran of the geotechnical consulting industry and a tunneling expert, has used the public comment period to warn state regulators and the public about what he calls “serious safety and environmental risks that have not been addressed adequately” by Enbridge. 
A Michigan Technological University graduate who has worked on pipeline and tunnel projects in nine states, O’Mara writes in his comments that Enbridge’s geological testing process falls far short of industry standards.
Before beginning any tunnel project O’Mara says it is necessary to conduct an analysis of the project site by collecting “core samples” of the rock and drilling “boreholes” to expose important geological features. While these tests can take months or years depending on the project, he says they are necessary for identifying hazards such as voids and faults in the rock, as well as soft materials like limestone, or deposits of combustible methane.

Failing to identify these risks can lead to a total collapse of the tunnel. Reviewing all of Enbridge’s environmental and geological reports published since 2017, O’Mara says there is an astonishing lack of critical rock borings and core samples.
“Tunnel geotechnical investigations are always done in a phased manner. However, Enbridge only did one phase of work. They did not complete secondary or tertiary studies to address data gaps and concerns,” O’Mara told Michigan Advance.
According to O’Mara and other tunnel experts, the industry standard is to dig “exploratory boreholes” totalling at least 1.5 times the length of the proposed tunnel. By that rule of thumb, Enbridge should drill 28,500 feet of boreholes at a minimum before safety of the project can be guaranteed. As it stands, they have drilled only 4,500 feet, or roughly 20% of what experts recommend, and they are only weeks away from being awarded a permit necessary to begin construction.

“Speaking as a citizen of Michigan, and a proud Michigander, we are losing sight of protecting our waters. This project would affect groundwater, surface water, wetlands, and not to mention the habitats and lives of protected species,” Mary Nuznov stated in a comment she left on the federal impact statement issued this spring.
O’Mara also notes that there is a complete lack of rock samples taken from the northern terminus of the proposed tunnel, near St. Ignace, making it difficult if not impossible to predict how tunnel construction would affect wetlands on the north shore. That’s a concern raised by environmental advocates in previous environmental impact statement comments.
When reached for comment, Enbridge spokesman Ryan Duffy said “tunneling experts retained by the Mackinac Straits Corridor Authority have confirmed the ground conditions are adequate for tunneling,” and that the company is “planning additional geotechnical investigations at the north side of the straits,” although he did not describe what kind of tests might be conducted. 
Under the industry standards described by O’Mara, these kinds of investigations should have been completed before applying for and receiving a permit.
O’Mara also says the few rock samples that have been taken are alarming on their own. 
“I was surprised at how poor the rock quality appeared in most of the cores and frankly I’ve never seen worse cores for a tunnel project,” O’Mara wrote, referring to 19 core samples taken from the bedrock beneath the Straits.

Per the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ own reports, the proposed Line 5 tunnel could be under nearly 17 atmospheres of pressure, which would be the highest pressure conditions of any pipeline in the country. 
O’Mara’s call for further geotechnical testing to meet basic industry safety standards has been echoed by experts at For Love of Water, also known as FLOW, and Earthjustice, two public interest groups that will also be submitting comments to EGLE this month.
When reached for comment about the need for further geological testing, a representative of EGLE stated that “Part 303 or 325 permit review criteria do not include tunneling operations beneath the lakebed,” suggesting that the agency will not be considering any potential consequences of tunneling in their review of Enbridge’s permit because the current application is technically related to surface facilities supplementing the tunnel, but not the tunnel itself.
The legality of this approach is hotly contested by attorneys at both For Love of Water and Earthjustice. Their opinion, shared by O’Mara, is that if this permit can potentially greenlight a tunnel operation, then any environmental risks associated with that tunnel must be considered in the first permit review.
“Oil spills must be considered under the Michigan Environmental Protection Act,” said Earthjustice attorney Debbie Chizewer.
Putting aside the concerning lack of geotechnical data, O’Mara points out that Enbridge’s permit application could be dead on arrival for another reason, noting that the company can’t seem to stick to one consistent tunnel design. 
Enbridge’s tunnel proposal relies on data from a 2017 report conducted by Dynamic Risk Assessment Systems, a pipeline consultancy. The tunnel promised in the 8-year old report differs significantly in design from the one Enbridge is describing now in 2025.
“In my opinion, this is reason enough for EGLE to reject the Enbridge Line 5 permit applications,” O’Mara says.
Regardless, Duffy maintains that some of the best tunneling experts in the world have “carefully and safely designed the Great Lakes Tunnel Project,” for Enbridge.
“Environmental safety and compliance drive everything we do on this project, and we have great confidence in our industry leading tunnel experts,” Duffy stated.
Enbridge requires both federal permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as well as state permits from EGLE before beginning construction. However, last winter the Trump administration called on the Corps to expedite the review process of the project, citing a “national energy emergency” that has been contested by environmental advocates. 
If the federal review of the tunnel is being hand-waved by federal environmental authorities, then the stakes are raised for the state-level review conducted by EGLE.
The Trump administration’s decision, which tribal advocates say is an outright denial of treaty rights and consultation practices required by the National Environmental Policy Act, led to six Michigan tribal nations backing out of federal Line 5 negotiations in various capacities. 
  Line 5 | National Wildlife Federation
“You could say it was the last straw,” Chizewer, the Earthjustice attorney representing the Bay Mills Indian Community in this public comment process, said.
The policy act requires that federal environmental authorities consider “indigenous knowledge” and “traditional ecological knowledge” when assessing the environmental impact of energy projects like Line 5. Indigenous ecological knowledge can have major legal implications for fossil fuel projects when it is given fair consideration by environmental authorities. 
Chizewer raises the example of the Gateway Pacific Terminal in Washington in 2016. The Seattle District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers denied a permit to construct a $665 million coal export terminal after the Lummi Nation of American Indians demonstrated the threats posed by the project to tribal water and fishing rights.
With just over a week until EGLE’s public comment period closes, Chizewer calls upon the public to voice their objections to what she and others view as the catastrophic environmental threat posed by Line 5 while they still can.
“I’m a citizen of the Sault Tribe, but Mackinac band Ojibwe. Enbridge is trespassing on our ancestral land which is the bottom lands of the Straits of Mackinac. This is cultural genocide, racial genocide, and environmental genocide,” Monica Cady commented on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ draft impact statement this spring.
“This is one of the last chances to prevent destruction to a really important place for Michiganders. It has the benefits of providing drinking water, and it’s a place of recreation that’s valued. It’s important for decision makers to hear from the public about their concerns,” Chizewer said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DSC_0486-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-21 06:56:46.372962

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle) In a new filing, Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita rejected a second disciplinary complaint against him and denied that he contradicted sworn statements to the state supreme court.
The dispute centers around a news release issued by Rokita in November 2023 following an earlier professional conduct investigation that stemmed from comments he made during a 2022 interview with Fox News commentator Jesse Watters.
After Indiana’s high court justices found that he had violated two of the Rules of Professional Conduct for lawyers — and issued a public reprimand — Rokita called the dispute a “failed attempt to derail our work.” He said he had “evidence and explanation” for what he said on air, but chose not to fight the complaint any further to save “taxpayer money and distraction.”
The Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission filed a new round of charges against him earlier this year, alleging he wasn’t being truthful when he told the court he was accepting responsibility for his actions.
Story continues below.
Rokita answer-to-complaint 0815
 
In a 24-page response filed Aug. 15 with the Indiana Supreme Court, Rokita’s attorneys wrote that his November 2023 press release about the prior reprimand “was consistent with the conditional agreement and affidavit he signed to resolve the prior disciplinary matter” and that his statements “did not contradict the conditional agreement or affidavit.”
Rokita additionally argued that the complaint itself oversteps legal bounds. His lawyers added that he “vehemently disputes” the disciplinary commission’s charges against him.
“… the disciplinary commission’s Complaint infringes on Attorney General Rokita’s First Amendment free speech rights, violates Indiana’s separation of powers principles, and violates Indiana’s anti-SLAPP statutes,” Rokita’s legal team wrote.
Ongoing disciplinary dispute
The ongoing complaint stems from Rokita’s nationally televised comments in June 2022 about Indianapolis OB-GYN Dr. Caitlin Bernard, who oversaw a medication abortion for a 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio that summer.
In an interview with Fox News commentator Jesse Watters, Rokita called Bernard an “activist acting as a doctor” and suggested that she violated patient privacy and state reporting laws. He said his office was investigating her conduct and would be “looking at her licensure.”
The Indiana Medical Licensing Board ultimately found that Bernard had violated patient privacy laws — resulting in a reprimand and a fine — but she was cleared of failing to report the abortion.
Indiana taxpayers pay nearly $500K for Attorney General Todd Rokita’s disciplinary defense

Rokita’s office settled an initial complaint about his comments in November 2023. In a sworn affidavit, Rokita admitted to violating two professional conduct rules in exchange for a public reprimand. A third count was dismissed.
Although he agreed not to contest the charges, the commission found that Rokita recanted almost immediately, suggesting in a public press release — issued just hours after the reprimand — that he had done nothing wrong.
The commission said Rokita acted with “a deliberate or reckless disregard for the truth” and has since opposed his request to dismiss the new charges.
But the attorney general has consistently maintained the professional conduct proceedings are the result of a politically charged and unaccountable disciplinary process.
Public records show taxpayers have already spent nearly $500,000 on Rokita’s legal defense in the matter.
Rokita flatly denied each allegation in his latest response and claimed the commission created “widespread confusion in the media” by pursuing charges it had already agreed to dismiss.
His lawyers also cast the complaints against him as partisan attacks, maintaining that, “Democrat activists filed complaints against him for politically motivated reasons” and insisted that Rokita “denies ethical misconduct or that he was dishonest with the Court”.
What comes next
Rokita’s attorneys asked the Indiana Supreme Court to dismiss the case and order the disciplinary commission to pay his costs.
The case could move forward to a hearing, or the sides could attempt to resolve it through a negotiated settlement. 
Any sanction would ultimately be decided by the Indiana Supreme Court.
The court has not yet scheduled arguments or issued a timeline for resolving the complaint.
Rokita earlier sought to throw out the complaint, arguing it was unlawful. In his motion, he called the commission’s action “an impermissible attempt to restrain an elected official and candidate’s political speech” and said it was retaliation for reforms he proposed to the disciplinary process.
Justices unanimously rejected the dismissal request once but granted Rokita’s petition to have a three-judge panel — rather than the usual single hearing officer — oversee the case if it advances. 
The court also urged the parties to meet and explore a possible settlement, the same way the first complaint against Rokita was resolved.

He pointed his remarks at state Superintendent Ryan Walters, whose fiery brand of politics has been built on attacking perceived “left-wing indoctrination” in schools, and at Gov. Kevin Stitt, who initially endorsed Walters’ rise to statewide office.
An anti-left message similar to Walters’ is prevalent in the platforms of former House Speaker Charles McCall and former state Sen. Mike Mazzei, Drummond’s highest-fundraising Republican opponents. Both McCall and Mazzei have focused much of their campaign messaging on defeating alleged liberal influence in schools and elsewhere in deep-red Oklahoma.
Walters, himself, has been suggested in statewide polling as a potential candidate to succeed Stitt, who is term limited as governor. Walters hasn’t yet announced a campaign for higher office nor for reelection as superintendent.

Drummond, a native of Hominy, said he hopes to see Walters join the gubernatorial race.
“That’s one way of term-limiting him,” Drummond told reporters after his speech. “So, we can get a new opportunity for new leadership in (the state Department of Education) to where the next superintendent works with educators, not against them.”
Like his GOP colleagues, Drummond voiced support for empowering parents’ role in their children’s schooling and improving Oklahoma’s poor academic outcomes, particularly in early elementary reading.
Only 23% of fourth graders and 20% of eighth graders in Oklahoma performed at a proficient level in reading last year on the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a test administered every two years in all 50 states.
Drummond, like many Oklahomans in recent weeks, also referenced a survey by the website WalletHub that ranked Oklahoma 50th in the nation for education.
“I’ve met with scores and scores of teachers throughout the state of Oklahoma that simply want leadership from Oklahoma City that acknowledges their worth, their devotion and dedication to our young people,” he said. “And then, together let’s encircle that profession, lift it up, empowering our parents to be engaged and providing a path forward for our young people to be successful.”

It’s unclear whether Drummond’s emphasis on elevating educators would include a teacher pay raise. He said the answer to Oklahoma’s teacher shortage isn’t “just throwing money at it,” but he included “competitive pay” in his plan for recruiting and retaining educators, as well as teacher mentorship and streamlining certification.
Mazzei, of Tulsa, said he would put $200 million into reading education, a plan that includes paying tutors to help struggling students catch up to their grade level.
“School principals and superintendents need to have direct oversight of these kids and be held responsible for the lack of significant improvement,” he wrote in his campaign platform.
Mazzei said Oklahoma should reframe the standards and criteria to become a superintendent “to weed out those who adhere to the woke tenets of liberalism which has undermined and destroyed public education in this state.” 
He pledged to move school board elections to November and to get personally involved in school board races to help elect conservative candidates.
McCall, of Atoka, hasn’t released a formal education platform, but when announcing his run for governor, he pointed to “the left and outside forces” that he said are “waging war” on Oklahomans’ way of life, including by radicalizing schools. 
He highlighted school policies the Legislature passed during his tenure as House speaker, a time when Republicans “beat the radical left every step of the way.”
That included new laws requiring individuals to use school bathrooms that align with their biological sex, banning transgender girls from participating in women’s sports and offering tax credits to families with children in private schools. The Legislature also poured hundreds of millions of dollars into increasing public-school funding and teacher salaries.
McCall voiced support for President Donald Trump’s plan to close the U.S. Department of Education and give more control of public schools to the states.

He joined Trump’s secretary of education, Linda McMahon, and Stitt on Tuesday for a charter school tour in Warr Acres. He later posted on social media that Oklahoma’s education rating is “unacceptable” and he looks forward to working with McMahon to “strengthen opportunity and better education for every Oklahoma student.”
Former state Sen. Jake Merrick, of Tuttle, said Oklahoma should redirect school funds from “bloated administration” to classrooms. 
Leisa Mitchell Haynes, a Republican candidate from Choctaw, would prioritize prayer in schools, teacher support and leadership programs for high school seniors, according to her website.
House Minority Leader Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City, is the only non-Republican in the race for governor. Munson said she would push to raise education funding over the regional average, increase salaries of teachers and school staff, and eliminate tax credits that benefit private schools.

Oklahoma is behind all six of its bordering states in per-pupil spending, a key metric in determining school funding, according to the Oklahoma State School Boards Association. Recent teacher pay raises have bumped Oklahoma up to fourth in the seven-state region for average teacher compensation.
“You hear the governor continue to say, ‘We can be a top 10 state in X,Y,Z category,” Munson said while speaking with reporters on May 16 during the legislative session. “He has said that for seven years. Education (in Oklahoma) is still last in the nation. We are still behind when it comes to teacher pay and per-pupil spending.”

Joy Goeben (R-Hobart) and Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) was releas[...],"The Fox River empties into Lake Michigan in Green Bay, where city officials have proposed a resolution acknowledging that local bodies of water have a right to be protected. (Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources)Two Republican legislators have proposed legislation that would prevent local governments from enacting “rights of nature” ordinances — laws that grant natural entities legal rights — claiming that such ordinances are “incompatible with America’s founding principles.” 
The proposal from Rep. Joy Goeben (R-Hobart) and Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) was released after the Green Bay City Council voted unanimously last month to direct the city’s sustainability council to begin drafting a “rights of nature” resolution. 
The concept of granting natural entities legal rights is relatively new in American government, but countries around the world have enshrined legal rights for nature into their constitutions. In Wisconsin, the Menominee and Ho-Chunk Nations have written rights of nature provisions into their tribal constitutions. Two years ago, the Milwaukee County Board enacted its own rights of nature resolution that promises to protect the health of the Menominee, Milwaukee and Fox rivers and Lake Michigan. 
The Center for Democratic and Environmental Rights has been working for years to track and support the passage of rights of nature laws around the world. The organization’s executive director Mari Margill says these laws are meant to help protect the environment.
“As environmental crises deepen, supporters of the bill are trying to make it harder to protect the environment,” Margill says of the Goeben and Nass proposal. 
While the Republican legislation, if it manages to pass the Legislature, is unlikely to be signed into law by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, critics say the proposal is an example of kneejerk Republican opposition to pro-environment ideas and another instance of Republicans from northeast Wisconsin attempting to meddle in Green Bay city politics. 
A co-sponsorship memo supporting the legislation states that these types of ordinances threaten the integrity of the legal system and property rights. 
“Allowing and promoting this ideology represents a dangerous shift in legal precedent,” the memo states. “It would allow nonhuman entities to sue in court, threatening property rights, stalling development, and burdening the judicial system.” 
Goeben did not respond to a request for comment. 
Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee), who helped write Milwaukee County’s resolution as a member of the county board in 2023, tells the Wisconsin Examiner the idea of granting bodies of water legal rights isn’t so different from corporations having legal “personhood.” In 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in its Citizens United decision that corporations have the right to free speech. 
“It is wholly disingenuous to say only real tangible people have rights and then fight explicitly for those rights for corporations,” Clancy says. “It’s frankly frustrating to see Republicans take these really popular measures, these are broadly popular things, and rather than engaging with us in dialog, just trying to block these things through process. It’s a disingenuous way to go about it. Let’s talk about the things that necessitate these pieces of legislation.” 
He adds that legislators have the power to do more than just write legislation. Goeben’s district is in the Green Bay suburbs but doesn’t include any of the city, but, Clancy argues that she could go to city council meetings and speak with people about these ideas instead of trying to blanket ban them without any dialog. 
“It would be a much more earnest process to show up in Green Bay and go to those meetings and voice your concerns there,” he says.” We have bully pulpits, I show up at the city council, county board, school board meetings, both in my capacity as a legislator and as a parent and community member. Make your case there rather than trying to ban it.” 
A number of Green Bay area officials expressed frustration at Republicans again involving themselves in Green Bay city politics. Earlier this year, Green Bay-area Republicans Rep. David Steffen (R-Howard) and Sen. Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto) proposed a bill that would limit the types of flags allowed to be flown at government buildings. Many Green Bay residents saw the bill as an effort to weigh in on a local debate over the flying of LGBTQ Pride flags. 
“Given the challenges our communities are facing, from our housing crisis to fully funding our public schools, I am always surprised by elected officials who don’t represent this city wasting time on policies that don’t solve real problems or fund actual solutions,” Rep. Amaad Rivera-Wagner (D-Green Bay) says. 
Joey Prestley, the Green Bay city council member who has led the local rights of nature effort, says the resolution — which hasn’t been drafted yet — is meant to serve as a non-binding advisory statement that city government will consider the environmental effects of its decisions throughout the development process. 
“Historically, the human actors have been the ones who have had the rights and the natural features have not been able to have people speaking for them,” he says. 
Prestley says the idea for the resolution started after a group of residents objected late in the process to a new housing development. The development would be near the Niagara escarpment, a geological feature residents want to protect, but didn’t hit the thresholds that would instigate involvement from the federal Environmental Protection Agency or state Department of Natural Resources. 
“My hope with a resolution would be maybe we consider these — all environmental features — but especially these ones that are important to our region, earlier in the process, and more thoroughly in the process, so we don’t have people coming up in the 11th Hour and saying, ‘wait a second, you can’t build this housing development,’” Prestley says. 
He adds that if that consideration and discussion of the environmental effects came earlier, it could have been a more constructive discussion rather than turning into a heated local debate that had the potential to kill a housing project in a city that, like much of Wisconsin, is in dire need of more housing. The Green Bay city council approved the 160-unit project in April 
“If it had been earlier in our process, it could have been more collaborative, and it could have been neighbors and environmental advocates working together with the developer and the city to make sure it’s a plan that benefits everybody, everybody who engages with the environment, everybody who relies on the environment, everybody who appreciates the environment,” he says.
In proposing a resolution, he adds, the objective is  “not trying to compel anyone, but really trying to adapt as a philosophy for the city that we want to consider nature as the original inhabitants of the land did before we were here.”
Prestley says it’s easy to spin the rights of nature discussion as “the work of a crazy person” who wants “to get trees to sue the city,” but actually he says he’s trying to make sure the city considers the potentially damaging environmental effects of its actions after decades of managing the harmful contamination of the Fox River. 
“There was not enough people speaking up for the damage that was happening to the river back then, and it created something that affected the whole community,” Prestley says. “People used to swim in the river. Nobody touches the river now. Maybe we should consider the environment. That’s not a radical idea, that is a sensible idea, considering what we’ve done in the past in this community, and thinking about how we want to move forward.” 
Prestley says the proposed legislation seems “silly” and notes a number of city actions, such as wetland reconstruction, that have benefited the environment. He says that if the Legislature isn’t going to help, it should get out of the way. 
“I think we’re trying to do good things in Green Bay for the environment,” he says. “And I think the state’s responsibility should be to help with the good things, or to do their own thing.”
The lawmakers proposing the bill, “they’re not helping us,” Prestley says. “They’re not helping the people, they’re just opposing things, and I don’t know why.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Fox-R-mouth-2019-1.jpg,,,2025-08-21 06:56:46.372962
,WyoFile,2025-08-21 10:30:00+00:00,WyoFile,How Wyoming got tasked with returning $270M to crypto customers around the world,CJ Baker,,,,,https://wyofile.com/how-wyoming-got-tasked-with-returning-270m-to-crypto-customers-around-the-world/,"

Crypto-giant Coinbase took assets from upwards of 200,000 international customers and sent the proceeds to Wyoming’s Unclaimed Property Division, which was swamped by a rush of claims from  investors seeking their money.
The post How Wyoming got tasked with returning $270M to crypto customers around the world appeared first on WyoFile .","A dire warning landed in the inboxes of many international Coinbase customers last year: Unless they “immediately” removed their assets from the cryptocurrency trading platform, the company would sell off their holdings and turn the proceeds over to the state of Wyoming.
“At that point,” the email advised, “your sole recourse to reclaim your liquidated assets will be to contact that government agency and file a claim for the property.”
The message appeared to have come from Coinbase itself. But in a crypto space that’s rife with scammers, the idea that customers in places like Venezuela, South Africa and Kazakhstan were at risk of having their assets sent to “the U.S. State of Wyoming’s Unclaimed Property Administration” was met with skepticism.
When one of the message’s recipients turned to Reddit for advice in April 2024, a couple commenters suggested they were being played.
“It actually looks like you received a spoof email. Don’t reply,” advised one Redditor.
Another wondered aloud if the whole thread was “FUD,” or negative misinformation, that a rival exchange had planted to sway customers away from Coinbase.
The cryptocurrency giant was itself accused of giving mixed messages, too. One frustrated customer later complained that, when they asked a member of Coinbase’s support team about the looming sell-off and transfer to Wyoming, the representative “assured me that the email was a scam” and that “they had never heard of such a situation.”
But, in fact, the message was real.

Not long after issuing those final warnings in the spring of 2024, Coinbase closed perhaps a quarter-million customer accounts across 139 different countries and sold off the bitcoin and various other cryptocurrencies those users had stored on the platform. Then, acting through a newly formed Wyoming corporation, the company took the roughly $270 million worth of proceeds and sent them to the state government.
“You think you’ve seen it all,” said Jeff Robertson who leads the State Treasurer’s Office’s Unclaimed Property Division, “and then all of a sudden, something new comes along.”
The state’s unclaimed property fund “basically tripled overnight” as a result of the foreign cash from Coinbase, Robertson said. The division’s workload ballooned, too, as it became the state’s responsibility to hold the cash and return it to Coinbase’s former customers. Queries and claims poured in from around the globe, swamping the seven-person office, slowing processing times and putting outreach efforts to Wyomingites on hold.
Over a year later, “we are working our way back to quote-unquote ‘normalcy,’” Robertson said. 
Meanwhile, upwards of $230 million from Coinbase continues to sit in the state’s unclaimed property fund, waiting for the rightful owners or heirs to step forward and prove their claim. The state government can never spend the money, but it can use the interest generated by the cash. And given how much money has not been and likely will never be claimed, Wyoming stands to make tens of millions of dollars over the coming years.
In a December discussion with state lawmakers, Treasurer Curt Meier cited the potential profits as evidence that accepting the money from Coinbase was a good decision. But some lawmakers and others have expressed concern about the challenges and liability the state may have accepted alongside the international customers’ cash.
“I don’t envy the position that Wyoming is in at all,” said Jennifer Borden, a Boston-based attorney who specializes in unclaimed property issues. “… I think you get there with the best of intentions, but end up with quite a bit of a problem on your hands.”
The ‘inherent conflict’ of unclaimed property
Coinbase runs the largest U.S.-based platform for buying and selling cryptocurrencies and operates in scores of countries. It currently holds some $425 billion worth of assets and previously claimed to have over 100 million “verified users.”
Coinbase’s communications team didn’t respond to emailed questions for this story, leaving it unclear as to what exactly prompted the company to purge some international customers in 2023 and early 2024. However, company messages and personal anecdotes shared online indicate Coinbase targeted customers who hadn’t sufficiently proven their identities. The company’s standard notice said it was “discontinuing all services to accounts that no longer meet our updated requirements.”
The accounts in question fell under the umbrella of a foreign subsidiary, Coinbase Kenya Ascending Markets, Ltd. Coinbase then, according to messages received by customers and posted to social media, moved to close that Nairobi-based company, sell off the impacted customers’ crypto holdings and “escheat” the proceeds — that is, to turn all of the cash over to a U.S. state as abandoned/unclaimed property.

Coinbase and other crypto companies came under intense scrutiny during the Biden administration, and Borden noted there’s been “so much uncertainty” as to how the Securities and Exchange Commission will regulate the space. “So maybe it seemed like the better course of action was … ‘When in doubt, escheat,’” she said.
Unclaimed property programs offer citizens a streamlined way to reclaim items like long forgotten utility deposits or retirement accounts, but they also help companies clear stagnant accounts off their books and provide states with another source of revenue.
Some states take the assets for themselves after a certain period of time and spend the money on government projects. Ohio, for example, plans to spend $600 million worth of unclaimed property to build a new football stadium for the Cleveland Browns.
That Wyoming only uses the interest from its holdings “is actually very admirable,” Borden said. She notes there’s an “inherent conflict” within unclaimed property programs when they serve as a source of state revenue.
“You get the property in as a safe keeper, but now all of a sudden you have an incentive to get more of it in and maybe to get less of it out,” Borden said, “because the more you have in, the more you have to play with.”
In this case, however, there was some apparent unease about taking on Coinbase’s foreign crypto proceeds and the task of finding the out-of-country owners.
“Many states were intimidated by the amount of money — you know, concerned about the ability to process that amount of claims, that sort of thing,” Deputy Treasurer Dawn Williams later told the Wyoming Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee.
From chatting with unclaimed property administrators in other states, Borden said her impression is that when it comes to crypto, “people realized there was a lot at stake and so much unknown that it might make sense to proceed with caution.”
Searching for a landing spot 
Coinbase is domiciled in Delaware, a state that’s accustomed to receiving large amounts of abandoned property from the more than 2 million entities incorporated in the state. In the past fiscal year, Delaware received $654.4 million in cash alone, said State Escheator Brenda Mayrack.
Unlike other states, Delaware immediately plugs that money into its budget as revenue — with the caveat that the state remains on the hook for paying any owners who come forward in the future. The state paid out nearly 16,000 claims and almost $200 million in the 2024-25 fiscal year, Mayrack said, and still netted several hundred million dollars.
Despite having a reputation for aggressively pursuing unclaimed property, Delaware declined to take the cash from Coinbase Kenya. When asked why the office turned the company away, Mayrack said confidentiality provisions in the Delaware Code prevented her from responding. 
As Coinbase prepared to sell off the assets, Mayrack recommended a series of changes to the state’s unclaimed property law, including some that may have hinted at the office’s concerns. For example, the legislation increased the requirements a company must meet before turning over foreign assets and clarified that the escheator can refuse to accept any property that’s reported “early” — that is, before it’s legally considered to be abandoned. Those changes and others within the “housekeeping bill” seemingly applied to the situation with Coinbase Kenya.

Meanwhile, with Delaware out of the picture, Coinbase’s legal representatives approached the Wyoming State Treasurer’s Office about accepting the assets instead.
Wyoming is the second-most popular place to incorporate behind Delaware. It has no corporate income tax and has long worked to become a digital asset hub, drawing the praise of Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. But it’s unclear what led the company to consider Wyoming as an alternative landing spot for the millions of dollars worth of crypto.
“Basically, they just checked with us to verify that, if they did this [transfer], we wouldn’t deny it,” Robertson said.
The treasurer’s office and its legal counsel reviewed the law and past precedent and concluded there was no reason to turn away Coinbase, Robertson said. 
“It’s just how we’ve always treated all businesses,” he said.
Wyoming’s rules say a customer’s property generally must be dormant for at least five years before their cash or virtual currencies can be designated as abandoned property. However, the law also provides the treasurer’s office with the flexibility to accept property sooner.
“Any time a business closes its doors, goes out of business, we pretty much always allow them to report early,” Robertson said, as it’s simpler to let a defunct company close out their books.

Given that Coinbase was shuttering its subsidiary and reported doing its due diligence in notifying the impacted customers, “we gave them permission to report and send everything to Wyoming early,” Robertson said. The state directs holders to liquidate cryptocurrencies — that is, convert them to cash — before reporting the property to the state, he added.
Coinbase sold off the impacted customers’ crypto in May 2024, apparently paying a tax to the Kenyan government along the way. The proceeds wound up with a newly formed affiliate in Wyoming, Crypto Services, Inc., which then transferred hundreds of millions of dollars to the state.
‘I JUST WANT TO ACCESS MY ACCOUNT’
Users’ experiences varied, but for one American customer in the United Arab Emirates, the sell-off capped a frustrating, six-month-long “nightmare.”
The customer, who asked that WyoFile not publish his name due to privacy concerns, said he set up his account in 2017 after moving to Dubai. Believing Coinbase to be a more trustworthy exchange, he eventually stashed thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin, ether and other cryptocurrencies on the platform.
In November 2023, however, he received an email from another subsidiary, Coinbase Bermuda Services Limited, that said the company was shuttering his account for not meeting its “updated requirements.”
After receiving the notice, the man tried transferring his assets, but found a change in phone numbers had left him unable to log in. He reached out to Coinbase support for help, but kept getting looped through the same steps, emails he shared with WyoFile show. At the company’s request, he provided multiple copies of his identification documents from the U.S. and U.A.E., forwarded bank and utility statements, and took live selfies via a webcam to verify his identity.
None of it worked.
“I JUST WANT TO ACCESS MY ACCOUNT AND MY MONEY. THAT IS IT,” the man wrote in a late March 2024 message. He called the situation “insane and bordering on illegal,” noting he had a slew of documents to prove who he was.
He was still in contact with Coinbase and trying to get into his account when the company notified him that his account had been closed and his assets sent to Wyoming. The closure, Coinbase asserted in its boilerplate notice, was due in part to “Your failure to respond to Coinbase’s numerous recent communications concerning your account …”

Crypto companies like Coinbase hold themselves out as more inclusive alternatives to traditional financial institutions. But following his experience with Coinbase, the American said he’d never trust crypto over a bank again.
Others on social media said that they, too, had been actively checking their accounts or trying to meet Coinbase’s updated verification requirements when their assets were liquidated.
Over on Reddit, one customer in India acknowledged that Coinbase “repeatedly” sent emails telling him to remove his crypto from the platform and he hadn’t done it.
“So I made a very stupid mistake,” he wrote.
However, others said they assumed the messages were a scam, that the emails went into spam folders or that they’d received no notice.
One X user wrote that he “logged in as usual to suddenly having $0 funds. No email, no notification, nothing.” He called it “criminal.”
On the Coinbase subreddit, company representatives responded to complaints, but generally directed their former customers to the state of Wyoming.
“Please note, for any questions or issues, you’ll need to speak directly with the Wyoming Unclaimed Property Division,” read one response to an unhappy customer, “as we at Coinbase are unable to assist further with these funds.”
Speaking directly with Wyoming
On a typical Monday morning, Robertson would come into the office and find 15 to 20 emails in the unclaimed property division’s inbox. The messages would generally be from Wyomingites looking to reclaim property that had slipped through the cracks.
But when Robertson returned from one weekend in May 2024, he found about 550 emails awaiting a response. Some people were upset and some didn’t understand why their assets were being sent to Wyoming. They all were seeking answers about their money.
International callers also filled up the division’s phone lines and went to voicemail, which was a problem, because the office was unable to return international calls. Robertson said they stressed email as much as possible.
Though the pace later slowed, “I would say the first three to six months … my whole Monday [morning] was basically set going through, sorting through emails,” he recalled, “not just myself, but pretty much all of our [claims] staff.”

Staff members initially copied and pasted the non-English messages into Google Translate, wrote a response, then translated their replies into the sender’s native language. But that proved too laborious.
The division quickly worked with a vendor to modify the site’s chatbot, WYO-Erp (a play on Western lawman Wyatt Earp and Wyoming Unclaimed Property) so it could answer questions in other languages. That lifted some of the burden.
In a bit of good fortune, the division had just received legislative permission to add a seventh staffer. 
The amount of property turned over to the state has been on the rise for some time — from $9.46 million received in fiscal year 2020 to $16.3 million in 2023 — and the office planned to have the new hire proactively seek out Wyomingites and reunite them with their assets. But thanks to the massive transfer from Coinbase, the staffer who came on board in late July 2024 was immediately consumed by those claims.
Things have since returned to what Robertson describes as “a manageable level,” with the office having paid out roughly $35 million to former Coinbase customers. But at its peak, the office had somewhere between 2,500 and 3,500 pending claims, he said, which is close to triple what the division would see in a typical surge of activity. Without the additional staffer, he said the backlog “would have been even worse.”
The division had prided itself on a two- to three-week turnaround time, but the claims process started taking months. Those with more run-of-the-mill claims got buried in the queue, so the office periodically took breaks from the Coinbase customers to make sure Wyomingites got help, too.
“You know, we are a state agency,” Robertson said. “We’re supposed to serve the people of the state.”
“I don’t envy the position that Wyoming is in at all … I think you get there with the best of intentions, but end up with quite a bit of a problem on your hands.”Attorney Jennifer Borden
Coinbase ultimately transferred over 1 million individual properties, which nearly equaled how many the office had on hand at the time. Each property represented a different type of cryptocurrency or digital asset a customer owned at the time of the sell-off. Amounts ranged from a few cents to fortunes, with 22 customers owed over $1 million, Robertson said.
There’s no easy way to suss out the exact number of customers from the massive dataset, but Robertson believes there were “easily” 200,000 people. All of the users were supposed to be international, though in going through the data provided by Coinbase, he said the office has identified a small number of claimants — less than 1% of the total — that appear to have been in the United States.
Only one has been located in Wyoming.
Complex legal questions
The unclaimed property division has a $1.9 million budget for the state’s current biennium, or two-year budget cycle, funded entirely by the interest generated from the abandoned cash.
In December, the division requested an additional $300,000, including $7,200 to add more languages to the WYO-Erp chatbot and $40,000 for a new fraud-detection system specifically tailored to foreign claims.
The bulk of the division’s supplemental budget request — around $228,000 — was to add its own attorney, and Deputy Treasurer Williams emphasized that it was not tied to the influx of funds from Coinbase. Legal issues related to unclaimed property had been “overwhelming” the treasurer’s general counsel for some time, Williams told lawmakers, as locating and verifying the rightful owners and preventing fraud can involve complex legal work. 
The Wyoming Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee included all of the additional funding in the supplemental budget bill, but the entire funding package ultimately failed last winter. Robertson said the treasurer’s office plans to resubmit the requests for the upcoming biennium.

The office does have a multi-part vetting process in place, and some Coinbase-related claims have been denied because of “too many things that don’t add up,” he said.
The FBI reached out with concerns about one individual who had roughly $50,000 worth of crypto on Coinbase’s platform, Robertson said, but so far, the bureau hasn’t moved to seize the money, and the person of interest hasn’t tried to claim it.
During the December discussion, several appropriations committee members wondered what costs and liabilities might accompany the cash from Coinbase.
Sen. Mike Gierau, D-Jackson, questioned how accepting the dollars fit into the office’s statutory role. He said it sounded like, “we saw an opportunity where we could get an investment vehicle while we parse this money.”
“We did look into whether or not this was allowed, what the liability would be …,” Williams responded, “and [we] determined that we were within our statutory authority to accept the funds.”
Unclaimed property disputes can lead to litigation — not only from property owners but other governments. Williams noted that Delaware got caught up in a decade-long legal battle over cash it received from MoneyGram.
The payment service company, which is incorporated in Delaware, had been giving that state all of its unclaimed money orders. However, Pennsylvania, Wyoming and 28 other states asserted the cash should go where the orders were purchased. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed in 2023, prompting Delaware to transfer $102 million from its coffers to the prevailing states.
The MoneyGram situation, Williams said, is “an example of how a company will say, ‘We’d rather just put this in one place than have to figure out which state all of this money belongs to.’
“So that’s kind of what happened with Coinbase,” she said.
When Delaware revised its abandoned property laws last year, it specified that holders must make a reasonable effort to comply with the applicable laws of any foreign jurisdictions before turning the property over to the state.
Additionally, Senate Bill 267 says Delaware can decline to take property that might “expose the state to a risk of litigation” and can refuse to indemnify companies that report early. Escheator Mayrack told lawmakers that the overall package of changes would “clarify and confirm” existing practices, improve efficiency “and reduce the state’s litigation risk and expenses.”
Borden, the unclaimed property attorney, said she’s glad some states are “tapping the brakes” when it comes to accepting foreign property.
“I wish they would put them on full stop, and let’s make sure we get this right before we do anything else,” she said. “I think there’s some people on Reddit who would agree with that.”
Wyoming’s decades-old law
The treasurer’s office has been urging the Wyoming Legislature to update the state’s unclaimed property law since well before the situation with Coinbase. Staff have made the case that the decades-old act needs to be modernized to address assets like cryptocurrencies, video game content and HSAs, simplify processes for owners and heirs and better protect confidentiality and security.
“There’s a number of things that would be nice to get updated and provide some clarity,” Robertson said. “But if that doesn’t happen, or until it happens, we can continue working business as usual.”
The Legislature hasn’t tackled the subject since the 2022 interim, when the corporations committee took up the topic but took no action. At the time, committee members expressed unease about endorsing a 138-page rewrite that was completed just days before the panel’s final meeting of the year.
Though some state officials may look at unclaimed property as a revenue source, “I think you’ve got potential constitutional issues; I think you’ve got potential traps for the unwary,” Sen. Charles Scott, R-Casper, said at the October 2022 hearing.
Sen. Cale Case, R-Lander, also expressed concern that owners or heirs who claim their property years later miss out on the interest payments or gains they would have received if they’d had it the entire time.
“That’s always bothered me about the unclaimed property program — is that people always give up the earnings or any accumulation [of value] and the state is earning money off of this,” Case said.

It can be a particular concern with stocks and volatile cryptocurrencies; the price of a bitcoin, for example, has risen from around $60,000 at the time of Coinbase’s sell-off to over $120,000 this month.
However, Sen. Ogden Driskill, R-Devils Tower, offered a different perspective at the 2022 meeting, sharing how pleased he’d been to recover property that belonged to his late mother.
“I wouldn’t dare ask for interest,” Driskill said. “I was just happy to have anything back.”
Among the Coinbase claimants, Robertson said his office has heard variations of both perspectives — those angered by the ordeal and those happy to have their cash back.
Mistiming the market
The former Coinbase customer in Dubai said he was able to reclaim his money from the state without any hiccups. But he remains deeply frustrated with Coinbase, in part because he’d planned to hold his crypto for the long term.
“When you see what the price of bitcoin is — at least right now, right? — it’s a bit maddening,” the man said. He added that, “If I could take them [Coinbase] to court, I would just love to do that.” 
Borden said most states have amended their laws to clarify that owners can only get back whatever value was turned over to the state and that holders — i.e. companies like Coinbase — remain liable for legal claims related to lost gains. She also believes it’s better for states to take custody of the actual property, like the crypto tokens, rather than converting them to cash.
Borden is currently representing a former Microsoft employee in South Africa whose company shares were deemed to be abandoned and then sold off by the state of Delaware in 2015. In her pending suit against the state, Colette Barff alleges she never abandoned her shares and that they shouldn’t have been turned over to or sold by Delaware officials. According to reporting by Spotlight Delaware, Barff contends the state should return her shares — currently worth nearly $2.2 million — rather than the roughly $200,000 they netted a decade ago.
It remains to be seen whether a judge will agree.
Borden said complying with unclear property statutes becomes “really complicated,” especially when dealing with assets that fluctuate in value and owners in other countries. Foreigners, she added, are generally unfamiliar with unclaimed property laws and may have unreliable mail service and/or spotty cell service.
In Borden’s view, “It’s like, if we can’t do a better job giving it back, then we just shouldn’t be taking it.”

Some former Coinbase customers have complained about Wyoming’s process.
“Frankly, it feels like they’re just putting me in a loop to avoid returning my investment,” one user wrote on the Coinbase subreddit in November.
However, Robertson said most claimants have been able to assemble the information they need to reclaim their cash.
In the early goings, “there were some challenges,” he acknowledged, but “I feel like we’ve progressed to a point where, for the most part, we can turn those [claims] around in a relatively reasonable timeframe.”
It’s been a learning experience, Robertson added, as the office went from handling five or 10 foreign claims in a year to fielding that many within a matter of hours. They’ve updated their procedures as they’ve learned, including by adding foreign wire payments (for a $6 fee) as an alternative to mailing out a check to claimants.
There’s some irony in the hurdles that the state faces in sending cash to former crypto owners, as one of the primary uses for blockchain technology is to enable cheaper, faster and more secure payments across the globe. Treasurer Meier has floated the possibility of offering payouts with the state’s new stable token — effectively a crypto-like digital dollar — but for now, that’s just an idea.
Millions staying with Wyoming
The unclaimed property division returned a significant chunk of the cash in the recently concluded fiscal year. In total, the office returned a record $42 million to 16,000 claimants, and Robertson estimates that more than 80% of those payouts were to former Coinbase customers. However, he noted that property is generally less likely to be claimed as time passes.
The bank fees and hassle of filing a claim mean the small dollar properties — of which there are many — are likely to stay with the state. And tens of millions of dollars came to the state with unidentifiable owners, Williams said last year, “so the chances of us being able to find those people are going to be slim-to-none as well.”
If half of the $270 million is ever paid out, “I would be surprised,” Robertson said.
The onus remains on Coinbase’s former customers to step forward and prove their claims, as the treasurer’s office isn’t planning any proactive outreach to foreign owners.
“We have enough owners within the state of Wyoming or former residents of Wyoming that we can’t do enough outreach with …,” Robertson said, noting the office still holds over $100 million that’s owed to current or former Wyomingites.

After generally being occupied with Coinbase-related claims over the past year, he expects the division will be able to resume its efforts to proactively seek out Wyoming owners in the coming months.
Overall, the Coinbase experience has made the office more efficient at reuniting rightful owners with their property, Robertson said, while the cash stands to yield revenue for the state.
Meier predicted last year that the state would wind up with somewhere around $130 million of the Coinbase cash earning interest in perpetuity. At a rate of 4%, that would yield about $5.2 million a year — a significant jump from the roughly $600,000 surplus that the division had recently been providing to the state. It wasn’t long ago, Robertson added, that the interest earnings were barely covering the division’s expenses.
“If I had the option of just going through this again, obviously some things we’d do a little bit differently,” he said, “but, you know, I’d have welcomed it with open arms again, too.”To search for unclaimed property in Wyoming, visit mycash.wyo.gov.

Pandering is alluring, but voters should resist the temptation to fall for it if they want to keep Wyoming on a productive path, columnist Khale Lenhart writes.
The post Wyoming’s future depends on real leadership appeared first on WyoFile .","The difference between successful and unsuccessful organizations frequently lies in leadership. Resources are important, opportunities are important, but the quality of leadership is often the deciding factor between whether an entity thrives or struggles. There are few bigger organizations than a state, and whether Wyoming thrives or struggles likely depends on the quality of its leadership.

Opinion

Historically, our state has had very strong leadership. Our governors have tended to be problem-solvers and, while all have been members of a political party, those in the modern era have valued ideas and solutions more than partisan affiliation. Our Legislature has also tended to have strong leadership, leading by example by bringing stakeholders together to gather information before making big decisions. We have sent multiple senators and representatives to Washington, D.C. who have been a credit to our state and leaders on a national scale. Some have certainly been better than others, but our state has historically been blessed with strong leadership.
However, we are always just one election away from undoing the good work of those who came before us. We must always be looking to the future, and we need strong leaders, with clear and long-range visions, to ensure our state meets whatever challenges are likely to arise in our changing world.
It is important to remember that leadership is different from merely holding — or seeking — an office. There are many public officials who are not leaders. They are seat-warmers or opportunistic “ladder climbers” motivated more by external validation or a thirst for power than by improving our state. You can recognize them by their lack of principle and their unfailing parroting of what they believe the public wants to hear. Pandering is the hallmark of a lack of leadership. True leaders must speak the truth, even when it is unpopular. 
Unfortunately, Wyoming has seen a lot of pandering lately. Promises of tax cuts without consequences are an obvious example, but any unprincipled position based on currying public favor fits the description. Secretary of State Chuck Gray’s crusade to call into question election security, despite no evidence of any actual insecurity or exposure, is a particularly ham-fisted example. 
The problem with pandering is that it is so alluring. Its entire purpose is to appeal to the public, so our natural inclination is to believe it. However, a critical eye and ear can recognize it for what it is: just another attempt to manipulate us. Pandering is dangerous because it is a comfortable lie that blinds us to the real state of affairs, preventing us from making clear-headed decisions. It sacrifices the well-being of the group for the benefit of the panderer, preying on our pre-existing beliefs.
In the political sphere, there are many self-serving politicians masquerading as leaders. We should all beware the candidate who cannot tell us what motivates them in seeking office. Too many see an election as their chance to achieve their own measure of fame, glory or influence, and that is an end in itself. I much prefer the politician who is motivated by a vision of what their state, county or community can look like in the future. We need those who seek to build us up, not those who seek only to increase their own image.
Fortunately, we still have quality leaders in our state. There are many public servants, both in office and in professional positions, who dedicate their time to making our state better, even when the answers go against conventional wisdom. The mark of a leader is that they are inspired by service. It is counterintuitive, but genuine leadership requires the leader to diminish themselves in pursuit of the greater good. It requires humility, honesty and the willingness to sacrifice one’s own interests in favor of the interests of the community. That is not to say that it should not be bold, but it must be bold in pursuit of truth and the greater welfare, not individual interests.
When a true leader emerges, people take notice. Even though they are human, with human flaws, a leader’s true nature shines through. The easiest way to identify a leader is by their commitment to a cause greater than themselves. In government, this usually means building something that will last beyond their own time in office. Typically, leaders do not care who gets the credit, as long as the goal is accomplished. They are focused on the cause, not self-aggrandizing.
Over the next year, we will see many candidates for many important positions. It is a solemn responsibility for us as voters to try to find the leaders and discard the rest. Our votes matter, and whether we choose leaders or mere opportunists will matter a lot toward what our future looks like. Let’s hope we choose wisely.

Besides this fame, the town of 10,000 or so also shares a lot with other small towns in the Midwest. Drive around the city’s courthouse square and you’ll see the offices of local lawyers, some banks and a few bars.

One thing that sets Monroe apart is the area’s relatively recent influx of immigrants.
According to the Applied Population Lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Green County, where Monroe is located, has experienced a 229% increase in Latinos from 2000 to 2019. That growth has not been accompanied by a surge in murders, robberies, pet-eatings or any other crimes that the current administration has leveled against migrants. Instead Monroe has seen a rise in the number of Mexican restaurants and bilingual masses at the local Catholic church, as well as hardworking community members hoping to make a better life for themselves. 
Which makes the recent events at Monroe’s W&W milk processing plant especially infuriating. Dairy Farmers of America (DFA) acquired W&W earlier this month , and workers describe an  ownership philosophy vastly different from the positive work environment and commitment to employees they experienced under  the previous owners. Short of formally firing the workers employed there, DFA instituted the E-Verify system as part of their management plan, possibly to avoid the Trump administration’s destructive crackdowns. While this system allows employers to confirm the employment authorization of new hires, employees taking part in the walkout say that in contrast to the previous owners, DFA is requiring verification of all employees, even those who have been there 10-plus years. Not surprisingly, DFA’s decision has triggered a strike and the formation of a legal assistance fund for workers who most likely will lose their jobs after years at the plant.
Across rural America
It’s not an isolated instance; immigrants are being unjustly targeted in similar ways elsewhere in rural America. In Long Prairie, Minnesota, a town much like Monroe, meat processing workers, many of whom received legal status to work with the humanitarian parole program that the Biden administration created for people experiencing potential violence or harm in Cuba, Haiti, Venezuela, or Haiti, had their permits revoked by Trump. Hundreds of workers also lost the legal right to work in the United States at a JBS pork production facility in Ottumwa, Iowa, as the current government ended their Temporary Protection Status (TPS). Like humanitarian parole, TPS, which began in 1990, grants people from certain countries work permits who flee disasters like hurricanes or wars.
Throughout the Midwest, milk processing and meat packing firms in rural areas constitute an agro-industrial archipelago where workers, many of whom are immigrants, play a key role in making our food system operate. But instead of being rewarded for years of hard work, immigrants face persecution. Insisting on programs like E-Verify — a voluntary system with documented shortcomings — and removing legal protections terrorize hardworking people. Immigrants and their families deserve better, including legal pathways to remain and work in the country.
In a nutshell, revoking legal protections unfairly turns workers into criminals by making them ineligible to work here. More to the point, these tactics are par for the course when it comes to the current administration’s cruel, underhanded and racist approach to enforcing our country’s outdated immigration system.
This toxic mix of cruelty and racial profiling is on display when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrest immigrants at courthouses after their asylum cases are dismissed, making them vulnerable for deportation. The racial profiling is even more blatant when migrants are stopped outside schools or at Home Depot parking lots because of how they look and where they are. Some get thrown to the ground and handcuffed just because they question the reason they are being detained.
An endless vicious cycle
The problem with such tactics — aside from the ethical and legal problems of encouraging government agents to trample on people’s constitutional rights — is efficiency. Immigration hardliners and Trump loyalists like White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller made it a goal for ICE to fill the for-profit deportation complex with 3,000 arrests per day, having no qualms separating families, arresting children or people who have been model citizens for decades.
  Supporters express solidarity with immigrant workers who have walked off the job at a cheese plant in Monroe, Wisconsin. (Photo by Bryan Pfeifer/Wisconsin Bailout the People Movement)
ICE has a sordid history of workplace enforcement actions in the past that have proven widely unpopular and non-productive.
We can go back to the Bush administration’s mass raids in places like Worthington, Minnesota, and Postville, Iowa, to show how ICE agents’ large-scale enforcement actions in rural communities tear families apart and leave communities with a long process to heal culturally and economically. What we know over a decade later is that arresting and deporting hundreds of people in such ways does not lead to U.S. citizen workers taking the positions formerly  held by immigrants, but the deported people being replaced by, well, another round of immigrants.
But for Trump 2.0, plans for the agro-industrial archipelago are different. Instead of staging mass actions to arrest workers, the government is doing this work digitally. Put otherwise, a faceless bureaucracy revokes programs and permits, giving a contrived legal pretext for ICE to enter communities and arrest people.
Let’s be clear — immigrant workers at these places were trying to “do it the right way.” But this government effectively took the legal carpet from under them as they were trying to scrape a living together for themselves and their families. To threaten these people with deportation is the ultimate in punching down, terrorizing hardworking and community-building people we should be welcoming instead of demonizing.
Real immigration policy reform does not underhandedly manufacture undocumented people, or target people who contribute to the economy, but involves doing the hard work of creating fair, workable policy in Congress. Nor should immigrants be welcomed on a whim of the administration as was the case when white South Africans were given refugee status while suspending protections for thousands of others. Why this special treatment? Most people seeking refugee status are people of color — the South Africans are white.
There are various serious initiatives currently in Congress that could actually improve the lives of immigrants. The bipartisan Dignity Act provides a pathway for citizenship for DREAMers (youth who came to the U.S. without authorization and either attend college or plan to do so) and a work permit system for all other undocumented people. The Farm Workforce Modernization Act puts farm workers and their families on a pathway to legalization. California U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla’s more sweeping Renewing Immigration Provisions of the Immigration Act of 1929 grants lawful permanent resident status —  green cards — to people who have lived in the U.S. continuously for at least seven years and  do not have a criminal record.
Immigrants come to this country for a variety of reasons, including suffering the effects of flawed trade deals, as well as experiencing war and famine. Many continue to suffer here, working jobs that are ill-paid and dangerous in places like Monroe and Long Prairie. Our current government oppresses them further with draconian and dishonest tactics, scoring cheap political points instead of engaging in actual law enforcement. 
Those among us who really care about public security should think long and hard on how this government is entrapping immigrants instead of reforming and enforcing the law.

Gen. Craig Strong at left and Nebraska Department of Correctional Services Director Rob Jeffreys as the state announces a new ICE facility. Aug 19. 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — State lawmakers are “learning on the go” about Nebraska’s plan to transform its McCook-based Work Ethic Camp from a rehabilitative center to a migrant detention facility over the next couple of months.
Among major still-unanswered questions: What will the immediate impacts be of shoehorning more inmates from the McCook center into other placements in an already overcrowded prison system?
Confirmed information from Nebraska Department of Correctional Services Rob Jeffreys includes comments Tuesday to reporters that his department would continue to ensure safety and provide care to anyone housed in state facilities. The repurposed Work Ethic Camp would still be state-owned and operated — “because homeland security starts at home.”
“We’re in the business of corrections, so it’s just another population for us to manage,” Jeffreys said. “We provide the services. We provide adequate, humane care.”

Jeffreys has indicated that the 186 Nebraskans currently housed at the McCook facility will be moved over roughly the next 45 to 60 days to other prisons. The specifics have not been ironed out. 
The federal government would fully reimburse Nebraska to house federal low-to-medium-risk detainees at the revamped Work Ethic Camp with plans to grow to accommodate up to 300 detainees at a facility designed to hold about 200, which would mean repurposing existing spaces used for meetings and other programming.
A ‘Midwest hub’ for ICE?
The Work Ethic Camp, legislatively approved 41-1 at the request of McCook native and then-Gov. Ben Nelson in April 1997 and opened four years later, seeks to reduce prison crowding through rehabilitative programming to low-risk offenders, making space for more violent offenders elsewhere. 
The facility has served adult men convicted of felonies who need substance use treatment or cognitive restructuring, according to budget documents from September 2024. It had an annual state budget of $9.5 million during the most recent fiscal year, 56% of which was for security. The facility has about 85 staff.
Nebraska’s ICE facility ‘symbolic’ of state’s support for immigration enforcement push

The Examiner contacted Correctional Services, the Office of Gov. Jim Pillen, all eight members of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee and other officials to learn more about next steps after officials announced multiple state-federal partnerships to ramp up immigration enforcement.
Perspectives among responding officials differed largely along ideological lines, including in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, the only statehouse where lawmakers are not formally elected by or organized around party affiliation.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is rebranding the repurposed Work Ethic Camp facility as the “Cornhusker Clink,” according to Pillen and U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem.
Jeffreys said he wants it to be the “Midwest hub” for immigration enforcement.
‘Humanitarian viewpoint’
State Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue, one of two Democratic lawmakers representing legislative districts that President Donald Trump won in 2024, said his immediate concerns were about managing the state’s existing prison population. That includes how Correctional Services is retooling after an August windstorm tore the roof off two Nebraska State Penitentiary housing units in Lincoln.

A total of 387 inmates were displaced to temporary housing, with 137 sent to other facilities in Omaha or Tecumseh. Some have since been moved back into normal housing.
Inmates are expected to be able to safely return to State Pen housing by the end of September.
Rountree said the moniker “Nebraska, the Good Life” is now paired with immigration enforcement efforts that he said differ from Trump’s promises to go after criminals. He said other migrants with no criminal backgrounds have been swept up, causing “a disruption to the people of our community.”
The freshman lawmaker said he approaches his purple district from a “humanitarian viewpoint” and as a 30-year military veteran who understands the impact of law.
“There’s a place for the rule of law to exist along with humanitarian effort,” Rountree said.

State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North Omaha, who has served on the Judiciary Committee for five years, said he strongly opposes the repurposed McCook facility.
“Our prisons are already poorly managed, overcrowded and plagued by substandard living conditions,” McKinney said Tuesday in a Facebook post. “No one should be subjected to such inhumane treatment.”
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, a former director of the ACLU of Nebraska, a Democrat and a former Appropriations Committee member, questioned Pillen’s legal authority to create the new ICE facility under the Nebraska Constitution’s Article IV, Section 19.
Since 1875, the Nebraska Constitution has given the Legislature exclusive authority in the “general management, control and government of all state charitable, mental, reformatory and penal institutions.”
‘Well thought out’
State Sens. Tanya Storer of Whitman and Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse, Republican freshman members of the Judiciary Committee, said they were more confident in the federal direction.
“I think if Nebraska is in a position to help be part of that effort in a positive way, that’s a good thing,” Storer said.

Storer said she had a briefing on the plan to repurpose the Work Ethic Camp about an hour before it was made public. She said she learned the project could bring additional federal dollars to Nebraska without any additional state taxes.
State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Legislature’s budget-writing Appropriations Committee, said he was told reimbursements would lead to cost savings, the extent of which is not yet clear.
Hallstrom said he is still “learning on the go” but highlighted Pillen’s pledge that safety and protection of citizens would be a “primary goal and objective.”
Storer said she doesn’t think the repurposing would hinder legislative or department efforts to reduce recidivism, address overcrowding or boost the chances for successful societal reentry for inmates.
“We were assured that there is space available within our system to individuals without creating any hiccups,” Storer said. “It appears that this has been well thought out.”

Hallstrom said he also raised questions about space initially but is so far satisfied. He said he hopes the rehabilitative objective from McCook stays, such as Jeffreys engaging business leaders to do so. He added he hopes any ICE detainees will be treated humanely.
“I certainly trust and hope that that will be the case with whatever’s rolled out here over the next however long it takes to get things put together,” Hallstrom said.
State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln, a former prosecutor and chair of the Judiciary Committee, told the Examiner: “I’m still learning about the WEC situation, so it’s premature for me to comment on the plan.”
What comes next
The contract between Nebraska and the federal government is still ongoing, with Jeffreys saying Tuesday it could be an initial one-year commitment or longer, possibly three years. He said he didn’t “want to get baked into a timeline with them before we take care of our own house,” acknowledging that the August windstorm put the department behind.
Jeffreys said “the timeline got ahead of us” for announcing the state-federal partnership, with Correctional Services staff finding out as the public did of the transition. He pledged to remain transparent with his team moving forward.
As the McCook offenders move into other facilities, Jeffreys said Nebraska inmates are involved in programming “like it’s never been done before,” so he’s not worried about violence. He said the prison system remains committed to ensuring fair treatment, programming and that Nebraskans are ready to reenter society.
If the ICE facility remains under Correctional Services’ control, it would likely be subject to legislative oversight, including complaints through the Ombudsman’s Office or the Office of Inspector General for Corrections.
‘Press pause’
Conrad, the longest-serving current member of the Legislature, said lawmakers share a Pillen-Trump goal of addressing public safety and a “broken” immigration system. But she said the “political stunt” Pillen is doing to “curry favor” with an “autocratic” president isn’t the way.
“We know that the way to solve those problems is through sensible, comprehensive immigration reform, where we respect human rights and we meet our country’s economic needs, and we don’t conflate those who are seeking a better life for them and their families or are fleeing persecution with true threats to public safety or national security,” Conrad said Wednesday.

Conrad said it remains to be seen if there will be any savings to Nebraska or if rehabilitation and second chances will still be afforded to rehoused Work Ethic Camp inmates, if they are moved into facilities “bulging at the seams.”
A corrections spokesperson told the Examiner “a robust offering of rehabilitative opportunities” is available at all NDCS facilities. She also noted the department will add 96 beds to its Reception and Treatment Center in Lincoln this fall.
Pillen has said he is stepping up to answer Trump’s call for governors and states to do their part to enforce immigration laws and fulfill the “highest calling” of government: public safety. A Pillen spokesperson said the alternative is “failed Biden-era open border policies.”
Conrad encouraged Pillen to “pray deeply” on his decision and visit with faith, business and ag leaders and embrace a past willingness to change course when met with new perspectives.
“It’s never too late to press pause,” Conrad said, “and to come forward with a more serious, thoughtful proposal that’s grounded in the law and our Nebraska values.”



How the McCook Work Ethic Camp will become what ICE calls the ‘Cornhusker Clink’

State senators approved the Work Ethic Camp by 41-1 at the request of former Gov. Ben Nelson in April 1997. It opened four years later in April 2001.
The Nebraska-federal “mutual agreement” to repurpose the McCook Work Ethic Camp came partially because of its proximity to other states. State officials hope it can be a “Midwest hub” for ICE. It is right next to the McCook Ben Nelson Regional Airport.
The current southwest Nebraska prison serves adult men serving felony convictions with rehabilitative opportunities, including local work in a dormitory-style setting, as a means to free up housing for more violent offenders at higher-security state facilities. 
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is rebranding the revamped facility the “Cornhusker Clink,” following “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida and the “Speedway Slammer” in Indiana.
Low-to-medium-risk detainees would be housed and provided services between deportation or other legal proceedings at the repurposed Work Ethic Camp in McCook. 
It’s unclear if the facility would remain all male or whether women, children or families would be detained there. Gov. Jim Pillen at a Tuesday news conference in McCook said, “I’ll be honest, I’m not a politician. I’ve not thought about that. I’ve not asked that question.”
There are 11 lawyers with active licenses in Red Willow County (McCook is the county seat), according to the Nebraska State Bar Association.
State officials estimate that they will move the current McCook inmates to other state facilities over the next 45-60 days. Housing placements have not yet been decided.
Parole board hearings and reviews will continue as normal for state inmates at McCook.
Whether corrections employees offering job and other counseling programs would remain in McCook, or be transferred to other state facilities, will depend on contract negotiations. Pillen has said many would remain.
The federal government would reimburse Nebraska for the use of the McCook facility, which would remain state-owned and operated. The contract is still in progress but would be for at least one year.
An early August windstorm tore the roof off of two housing units at the Nebraska State Penitentiary in Lincoln, displacing 387 inmates. Of those, 137 were sent to temporary housing at agency facilities in Omaha and Tecumseh. Some have returned to normal housing. The damaged housing units are expected to be usable by late September. 
State officials say they are not concerned with overcrowding, noting nearly 100 new beds will open up at the Reception and Treatment Center in Lincoln this fall.

Kennedy Jr., who oversees Medicaid as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. (Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)This week, the Trump administration’s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services announced an effort to check the immigration status of people who get their health insurance through Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.
Medicaid is the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. For families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford private insurance, CHIP is a public program that provides low-cost health coverage for their children.
The feds will begin sending states monthly enrollment reports that identify people with Medicaid or CHIP whose immigration or citizenship status can’t be confirmed through federal databases. States are then responsible for verifying the citizenship or immigration status of individuals in those reports. States are expected to take “appropriate actions when necessary, including adjusting coverage or enforcing non-citizen eligibility rules,” according to a CMS press release.
Before the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Idaho braced for federal Medicaid cuts. But not this change.

“We are tightening oversight of enrollment to safeguard taxpayer dollars and guarantee that these vital programs serve only those who are truly eligible under the law,” Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who oversees CMS as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said in a press release announcing the new program.
As of April, roughly 71 million adults and children nationwide have Medicaid coverage, while another 7 million children have insurance through CHIP. Immigrants under age 65 are less likely to be covered by Medicaid than U.S.-born citizens, according to an analysis from health research organization KFF.
Immigrants who are in the country illegally aren’t eligible for federally funded Medicaid and CHIP. Only citizens and certain lawfully present immigrants — green card holders and refugees, for example — can qualify.
But some states have chosen to expand Medicaid coverage for immigrants with their own funds. Twenty-three states offer pregnancy-related care regardless of citizenship or immigration status, according to KFF. Fourteen states provide coverage for children in low-income families regardless of immigration status, while seven states offer coverage to some adults regardless of status.
The tax and spending package President Donald Trump last month cuts federal spending on Medicaid by more than $1 trillion, leaving states to either make up the difference with their own funds or reduce coverage. But the new law also includes restrictions on coverage for certain immigrants, including stripping eligibility from refugees and asylum-seekers.

(Photo: John Partipilo)After two years of corporate tax breaks, Tennessee saw business revenue plummet in 2024-25, putting more pressure on the state’s sales tax to support the budget.
The legislature reduced franchise and excise taxes dramatically in 2023 and 2024, causing corporate tax collections for the fiscal year ending in July to fall off by 15.8%, a decrease of $721.5 million from the previous year.
In contrast, sales tax collections jumped 4.2%, $596 million, during that time frame, according to recently released state figures. 
Total tax revenues for the year came in nearly 1% higher than projected, $206.5 million, but they were $75.2 million below the previous year’s collections. The state’s budget is $59.8 billion.
Despite the drop-off, Finance and Administration Commissioner Jim Bryson said “the outlook remains strong” since revenue exceeded the state’s estimates. 
Facing dismal returns at mid-year following the corporate tax cut, Tennessee’s funding board reduced growth projections to negative numbers, giving the state a better chance to balance its budget.

Senate Finance Committee Chairman Bo Watson is pleased with the results.
“We have essentially a consumer-based tax system … does it put more pressure on it? It puts pressure for us to be productive and grow our economy for sure and to keep more money in consumers’ pockets so they can spend it, which is why you keep your taxes low in the first place,” said Watson, a Hixson Republican.
Tennessee lawmakers eliminated a portion of the state’s business tax in 2024, a year after making several reductions to the same tax, along with approving a three-year refund, estimated to cost a total of $7.4 billion. The moves came even though Tennessee has one of the nation’s most regressive tax systems, generating more than 60% of $25 billion in revenue from sales taxes. The nonpartisan group, ThinkTennessee, found the state has one of the nation’s lowest tax burdens but that “low-income families face a higher effective tax rate than wealthier families and businesses.”
Lawmakers axed the property portion of the franchise tax in 2024, costing $4 billion over the next decade, and gave a corporate refund totaling $1.55 billion. 
Gov. Bill Lee’s administration pushed the tax reduction and refund last year, claiming it needed to be done because of a potential legal challenge. No companies sued the state, but more than 80 requested refunds when lawmakers debated the issue last year, according to the Department of Revenue. The state wound up giving about 70,000 rebates this spring.
While some lawmakers talked about the consequences of legal challenges over the state’s business taxes, others supported the reduction by saying it was good policy. 
Democrats who criticized the reductions called them a “massive windfall for corporations,” hurting state revenue for schools, roads and public safety.










We had a chance to eliminate the state tax on groceries and bring down costs for everyday people, but Republicans chose to reward CEOs and big business instead.


– Sen. Charlane Oliver, D-Nashville


Democratic Sen. Charlane Oliver and Rep. Aftyn Behn, both of Nashville, sponsored legislation to end the state’s sales tax on groceries, roughly 4%. Their bill, which failed to advance, would offset the loss of revenue by requiring companies that shelter money in offshore accounts to pay their share of taxes.
Oliver issued a statement saying after 15 years of Republican control, Tennessee has one of the highest grocery tax rates in America – and one some of the lowest tax rates on big corporations.

“That’s not a coincidence. That’s a choice,” she said, adding Lee and Republicans “gave a bailout to big corporations instead of our families. We had a chance to eliminate the state tax on groceries and bring down costs for everyday people, but Republicans chose to reward CEOs and big business instead.”
As a result, Oliver said, people such as nurses, truck drivers and construction workers are paying a higher effective tax rate than their employers.
The legislature approved only a weekend sales tax holiday this year, after giving motorists a break on wheel tags two years ago and an extended sales tax holiday in 2024.
State officials recognized problems with revenue growth in the middle of the last fiscal year, adjusting projections for this fiscal year by setting ranges at negative-1.68% to negative-1.34% for total taxes.
The federal government poured money into states during the COVID pandemic, but those funds are drying up. Simultaneously, the state expects federal funding reductions in the coming year as a result of cutbacks ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency run by Elon Musk at the outset of Trump’s administration.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson/Tennessee Lookout)Organizers and West Tennessee residents marched to the Fayette County Justice Complex on Aug. 14 in protest of what they say is an ongoing pattern of “racist and discriminatory practices” in the county’s government and school board.
Several protestors gathered at the former site of Tent City — where Black residents lived in tents after white landowners evicted them from sharecropper housing for registering to vote in the 1960s — and walked together to the justice center, where the Fayette County Public Schools board held its August meeting.
The Commission on Religion and Race of Fayette County (CORR) and Fayette County Teachers for Justice organized the march in response to “actions they believe continue a legacy of systemic racism, echoing the injustices of the Tent City era,” according to a CORR news release.
About a dozen people participated in the march and several more joined them on the steps of the justice building before the meeting began.

Some carried signs from CORR calling for a boycott of spending in Fayette County starting on Aug. 15 at noon. The boycott urges residents to “withhold spending at all Fayette County businesses including big box stores, corner stores, gas stations, restaurants and hardware stores. Housing, utilities, insurance, medicine and vehicle payments are exempt, according to the group.
Other signs listed demands, including the resignations of School Board Chair Warner Speakman and Eddie Keel, who previously served as the district’s interim superintendent and chief of staff and was recently named deputy superintendent. Demands also include the “reinstatement of all demoted or terminated teachers to their original positions without retaliation,” training for the Fayette County mayor on “fair governance and equal treatment of citizens” and “redrawing of district maps to restore the original configuration and ensure equitable representation.”
The Fayette County Commission redrew its district maps in late June to include three majority-Black, single member districts after being sued by the U.S. Department of Justice and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. The lawsuits were dropped following the maps’ adoption, and the new maps will be used in 2026 elections.
Potential staff reductions were a point of contention between community members and the board during the district’s budgeting process this summer, which concluded under Keel’s leadership as interim superintendent. 
Joseph Jordan, a pastor at Springhill CME Church in Somerville, said he joined the march to support teachers who were demoted or fired after the last school year, including the daughter of one of his congregation members. Some members at his church work for the district and have children there, he said.
Fayette Co. Schools seeks end to desegregation case; Black constituents say they’re being ignored

“If we keep being quiet, nothing’s going to happen,” Jordan said. “We’re showing action that we want things to change. Our children deserve things to change.”
The demonstration came amid calls for more transparency from the school board regarding its position on dissolving the consent order that has held the district accountable to federal oversight for integrating schools since 1965. 
Board members have stated that the order is no longer necessary and is sapping money from the district’s already anemic budget.
Tennessee uses a student-based funding formula to determine how much money to allocate to districts.
Fayette County Public Schools has seen a decrease in enrollment for almost all years since 1989, according to Superintendent Don McPherson. Last year, about 2,600 students enrolled in a district school. This year, it’s around 2,250. McPherson said he intends to deliver a report to the board on where students opted to go instead of remaining in the district.

Speakman announced the board’s monthly meeting would be held at the justice center in August “due to published information” after Tennessee Lookout published a letter penned by Fayette County Public Schools board member David Reeves to U.S. Rep. David Kustoff, asking the congressman to urge the Department of Justice to help end the consent order.
During the public comment period at the Aug. 14 school board meeting, community member Charles Watkins called on the board to host an information session on the consent order and its pros or cons.
“You owe it to the community to at least have a serious forum over and above the public meetings and hearings that is supposed to be there … where a professional from the school board who understands truly the desegregation order will actually sit down and have a conversation with someone from the community … about what it is, the history of it … and why you believe it somehow impedes progress of the Fayette County school system,” Watkins said.
Informational meetings for parents required under the consent order are scheduled for Sept. 18 and Sept. 22 at 7 p.m.

(Natalie Behring/Getty Images)As conservative lawmakers work to restrict online access to abortion medication, a new report shows how popular it has become for women who live in states that have outlawed abortion.
Researchers from the University of Texas at Austin led a team that analyzed 15 months of prescription data from Aid Access, one of the largest online abortion telemedicine providers.
They found 84% of Aid Access’s more than 118,000 online prescriptions went to patients living in abortion-ban states.
The South and Midwest had the highest rates of patients accessing telemedicine abortion. Rates were also greater in high-poverty areas or where people would have to travel more than 100 miles to reach an abortion clinic, according to the report, which published this month.
Aid Access is able to mail abortion medications to residents in all 50 states — even those in states with abortion bans — thanks to shield laws in Democratic-led states. Shield laws are designed to minimize the legal risks for people who provide or access abortions across state lines.
Currently, 22 states and Washington, D.C., have reproductive care shield laws, either through legislation or by executive order, according to a report from University of California, Los Angeles School of Law.
Eight of those states — California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington — specifically protect telehealth abortion providers regardless of where their patient is located.
Shield laws, along with difficulty accessing in-person abortion services in abortion-ban states, have contributed to a rise in medication and telehealth abortions since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion in 2022, clearing the way for state bans. With telehealth abortion, patients have a virtual appointment with a clinician who can prescribe abortion medication, which is then filled by a licensed pharmacy and mailed to the patient.
Research has shown telehealth medication abortion is effective and safe, and comparable to in-person medication abortion.
Medication abortion accounted for nearly two-thirds of all clinician-provided abortions in states without bans in 2023, the most recent data available from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on advancing reproductive rights.
But as abortion medication use rises, so have conservative efforts to ban it.
This year, more than a dozen states introduced bills to bar access to medication abortion by criminalizing its sale, purchase or distribution, according to Guttmacher.
One such bill in Texas, which could have been a blueprint for medication abortion restriction in other states, was specifically aimed at groups like Aid Access. It would have allowed private citizens to sue for at least $100,000 anyone who provided abortion pills in Texas. The bill passed the Texas Senate but died in the House in May.
Earlier this year, the state of Louisiana criminally charged a New York physician under its abortion ban law for allegedly providing abortion pills to a Louisiana teen via telehealth. New York, which passed a shield law in 2023, refused Louisiana’s request to extradite the doctor.
Last month marked the first federal test of shield laws, when a Texas man sued a California doctor for allegedly mailing abortion pills to his partner.
This week, a Texas woman filed a federal lawsuit against Aid Access and against a man who she said impregnated her, then spiked her drink with abortion pills. She is also suing the Dutch doctor who founded Aid Access, alleging Aid Access and its founder mailed abortion-inducing drugs in violation of Texas and federal law.

(Photo by Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Colorado state lawmakers begin work today in a special session to address a $1.2 billion revenue shortfall and revise the state’s budget following changes to the federal tax code.
The session — the third special session called in as many years — will likely last until early next week as legislators find solutions to plug a budget hole for the current fiscal year.
“Our revenue has gone down,” Sen. Jeff Bridges, a Greenwood Village Democrat, said in a call with reporters on Monday afternoon. “It means that we have to balance about $750 million out of our existing budget, that as of July 1 was balanced and now is out of balance. That is why we’re coming back — no other reason, no matter what anyone says.”

Colorado’s state tax code is closely linked to federal law, making state revenue susceptible to changes made through the federal spending and tax cut bill signed by President Donald Trump in July. That’s the law that will have huge impacts on Medicaid and food assistance program spending in a few years, but provisions to extend and expand tax breaks for companies and individuals will have an impact during the state’s current fiscal year, which began July 1.
The governor’s office predicts a decline in corporate revenue income of about $950 million, then about $460 million less in individual income tax revenue. The true budget impact is estimated to be between $680 million and $783 million. The state was originally projected to collect more revenue than allowed under the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights, the constitutional cap determined by population and inflation. That excess money is wiped out with the revenue hit.
Democrats and Republicans have clashed over the cause of the budget hole. Republican lawmakers have been adamant that Democratic overspending and a ballooning state budget is to blame.
“This is not a revenue crisis. It is a spending and priorities crisis,” Rep. Carlos Barron, a Fort Lupton Republican, said in a statement after the special session was called. “Instead of asking state agencies to find savings or eliminate waste, the governor is demanding a blank check from taxpayers.”










President Trump and Congress are to blame for this.


– Colorado House Speaker Julie McCluskie


Democrats have pushed back hard against that messaging.
“We were $300 million over the (TABOR) spending cap, and then with all of the corporate tax breaks that have gone to wealthy companies and individuals, we are now $1.2 billion short. It is a dramatic impact that was caused by one single moment with the pen. President Trump and Congress are to blame for this,” House Speaker Julie McCluskie, a Dillon Democrat, said.
The Democratic majority plans to pass a series of bills to close tax loopholes, cut program spending and dip into the state’s budgetary reserves.
The planned bill package includes legislation to repeal a corporate tax break for insurance companies that have at least 2.5% of their workforce in Colorado. In 2024, the revenue impact from that tax break was about $72 million, according to a March audit.
Another bill would further decouple a federal tax deduction for business owners on so-called pass-through businesses like partnerships, S corporations and real estate investment trusts. Colorado temporarily decoupled that deduction in 2020 and 2021 for business owners who make more than $500,000 per year and a special session bill would make that policy permanent.
Other tax-related bills would add additional countries that the state considers tax havens, allow companies to pay some taxes early at a discount, and get rid of a state tax break for companies that keep assets like patents, software and trademarks in the United States.
“I don’t think that this is a sudden, overnight realization that our tax code can be made more fair to benefit working families and to ensure that wealthy individuals and corporations are paying their fair share. That’s not new,” Rep. Emily Sirota, a Denver Democrat, said. “But we clearly are in a state of concern and crisis now, given (that we have) a billion dollar gap to close. And so these are the very logical next steps to take.”
Another bill will change the process of how the governor suspends services during a revenue shortfall like the one created by the federal law. The governor currently has authority through executive order to cut spending. A bill from legislative leadership and members of the Joint Budget Committee would require the governor to meet with the JBC for advice on those discretionary spending reductions.
“Existing law already gives the governor all the authority in the world to say ‘We don’t have enough money. I’m cutting these things through executive order and no consultation with the Legislature,’” Bridges said. “So the bill that we are running actually increases the role of the Legislature in a process where we have to cut a lot of money outside of a session.”
Republicans will also run bills during the special session, but without bipartisan sponsorship it is unlikely any will make it to the floor for debate and votes. Democrats hold a 43-22 majority in the House and a 23-12 majority in the Senate.
One Republican bill would eliminate state health care subsidies for immigrants without proper legal status. Another bill would require the governor to formulate a spending reduction plan if they use an executive order to suspend services for longer than three months.
In addition to considering bills to fix the budget deficit, lawmakers will also be able to pass legislation on health insurance premiums and artificial intelligence, which will likely involve another intense debate as lawmakers introduce competing bills on the issue.

Part One described the emergency effort to rescue Washington state’s last population of Snake River spring and summer Chinook salmon, in the Tucannon River. Part Two explored salmon and steelhead extinction threshold science, showing the Pacific Northwest is entering extinction momentum that will be very difficult to escape.
For Northwest salmon people, grim news and hope seem always intermingled. My previous article held grim news – extinction science, and extinction in motion in the Grande Ronde River. In Part Three, I wish to give the Grande Ronde’s hope its due.  
Salmon and steelhead extinction threshold science, and the ocean fish of northeast Oregon

Everyone I spoke with in northeast Oregon, native and non-, raised, and praised, the systematic river and watershed restoration underway in the Grande Ronde and Imnaha since the mid-1990s. More such work has been completed, and is underway, in the Grande Ronde/Imnaha than any other salmon landscape in the Snake River Basin.  
The good done reaches well beyond healthier streams. 
 Tribal restoration projects are many and often large

	  
“All of it is a big source of hope for me,” Bobby Fossek says. “My own project is what I’d call small scale, but I see the connections right up to the biggest ones. At Bird Track Springs, for example, the whole atmosphere of the place is charged now. I can see and feel it, and it’s just beginning.”
Bird Track Springs is the site of a completed project that is now completing itself in the river, restoring sinuosity, vital winter and summer habitat, and freer passage to a pinched and degraded 1.9 mile section of the Upper Grande Ronde River. The Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (CTUIR) sponsored and led the work, with nine co-sponsors, including the cooperating landowner, Jordan Creek Ranch. The cost was $2.5 million.
Bird Track Springs is on Highway 244, just a few miles off the freeway at the Hilgard exit above La Grande. It is signed. The Tribes’ scene-setting and description, on the short walk to the river and an overlook, is very good, with tribal, historical, and river/salmon context in map, image, art and word.  
“I’ve seen the project; it looks good,” John Appleton told me. “It’s going to create cooler water and deeper pools.” 
With so few salmon in the Upper Grande Ronde now, no hatchery nearby, and little fishing pressure, Appleton says the upper river could almost be called an informal salmon sanctuary for the few salmon that still manage to get there.   
The Confederated Umatilla Tribes lead many other restoration projects in the Upper Grande Ronde and Catherine Creek. Rick George calls the Tribes’ McCoy Creek project “a phenomenal success.”  
The Tribes also acquired the Southern Cross Ranch, three miles southeast of Union, on ¾-mile of Catherine Creek with 68 acres of historic floodplain.  It is now being restored for channel function, sinuosity, riparian health, floodplain connectivity, and the benefit of Three First Foods – water, salmon and deer.

In Wallowa Country and the Imnaha, the Nez Perce Tribe leads on similar projects. Emmit Taylor Jr., director of the Nez Perce Tribe’s Department of Fisheries’ Resources’ Watershed Division, offered a quick list.
“There’s the Wallowa River work at Tamkaliks, where we put in side channels and revegetated,” he said. “There’s a half-mile project on the Lostine River, at the town of Lostine. It was straight and constrained, most of the habitat gone. We removed levees, re-meandered, and put in side channels. This year we’re planting thousands of trees. It is our goal to see salmon spawn there again.”  
A larger project is getting close to going in Chesnimnus Creek, tributary to Joseph Creek.

“This is 11 to 15 miles of stream, and a very big deal for fish,” Taylor said. “The listed steelhead above it have never been supplemented. We’re working with many landowners, and the Forest Service, on many actions – cattle exclusions, riparian plantings, stream reconstruction, putting wood in the streams, and others. Design is underway, we hope to start work in a year or so. Joseph Creek is steep and largely inaccessible; that’s why it’s a steelhead stronghold. But where it is accessible this work will really improve stream conditions and fisheries habitat.”
Taylor and his team are also part of the Tribe’s long effort, with Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and others, to secure fish passage at Wallowa Lake Dam. That is the only large dam in the Grande Ronde and Imnaha basins.
In addition to Tamkaliks, the Tribe has acquired or been gifted other properties – for example, 140 acres near Joseph, at what Mr. Taylor calls the Place of Boulders. From its Joseph office, Nez Perce Fisheries staff work across Wallowa Country to keep water in streams, repair habitats, restore fish passage and rebuild Nez Perce use of these homelands.  
 A restoration and a journey at Ascension School Camp and Conference Center

Bobby Fossek’s project at Ascension School is small in comparison, yet large on its terms.  
Ascension School Camp and Conference Center, in Cove, Oregon, is the spiritual center of the Episcopal Diocese of Eastern Oregon. The diocese includes 19 churches in eastern, central and southern Oregon.
Salmon extinction in motion in Washington’s and Oregon’s Snake River

“Ascension’s mission is to be a place apart, to connect with God’s sacred mystery,” said Amy Jayne, a priest, who serves as the center’s director.  “Our principles are human dignity, creation care and spirituality. Our summer camp for children is 100 years old. We are a full-service outdoor facility, a retreat and conference center, and a community center to serve Cove.”  
Three Catherine Creek tributaries – Duncan, Hulick and Mill creeks – roughly bound the School’s 100 acres. Eighty acres are being restored.  
“Ascension sits on an old village site called Wiweeletitpe, Place of Many Streams,” Fossek said. “It has been farmed since the mid-1800s, much of the native flora and fauna removed, and the anadromous fish streams straightened and diverted into irrigation ditches. We are working to restore many of the First Foods, Medicines and Materials that historically grew here and that our people have a deep relationship with. Along with it, we are revitalizing skills and lifeways that are part of this landscape, with tribal cultural skills camps on the site.”

 Camas Camp, for example, immerses young native people in gathering, cooking, and sharing camas. A public nature trail also now ribbons the site.
Fossek attended Ascension Camp as a boy and was maintenance man when Amy Jayne became its director six years ago.  
“Bobby led us to see we can’t heal the land without assisting the healing of its original caretakers,” Jayne said.  
This led to a relationship with Caretakers of the Land, which Fossek and Brosnan Spencer founded “to steward and strengthen the lifeways, languages, habitats, and traditional ecological knowledge of the Blue Mountain bioregion …”

“We provide Caretakers administrative support, but they have considerable autonomy,” Jayne says. “They have a deep relationship with the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, and those Tribes have events here. There’s a three-day CTUIR symposium this year. The Nez Perce have had an event here too, through Caretakers. I hope the elders and others visiting will recognize Ascension as a shared space. We want to help native people live again in their seasonal rounds.” 
For the diocese, it is a journey. In 2022, at its annual convention, the Episcopal Diocese of Eastern Oregon formally repudiated the “doctrine of discovery,” the religious and legal basis upon which the Grande Ronde and Wallowa Country, including Ascension Camp’s 100 acres, were taken from tribal people by the United States and its citizens.
“There is wonderful support here,” Jayne says. “But there is also pushback.  Absolutely nothing is settled in this work. The past systems are massive and in place. It takes a lot of work so people understand what we’re doing, and so we understand them. We forge ahead, and go slowly.”  
I asked Fossek if it is fair to see his work, including the Ascension restoration, in three parts: restoring health to ecosystems, building relations with neighbors and communities, and restoring tribal presence and use:  “Yes. They are branches from the same tree – the web of life in this valley.”

 A small project gives young fish a place to ‘rest and grow’

David Baum’s little project on Catherine Creek is the first restoration I heard about. Mr. Baum is a retired lawyer, fisherman and kayaker.

He vividly remembers salmon coming steadily through his grandmother’s place on Catherine Creek in the 1950s. A decade ago, he did a five-acre restoration on the creek, at a different property he owned. 
“I worked with Grande Ronde Model Watershed to put in a side channel,” Baum says. “I wanted to build some habitat where overwintering juvenile salmon can rest and grow. It’s still there.”
Bonneville Power Administration ratepayers contributed $117,000 of the project cost, and Baum $3,000, says the project description on the Grande Ronde Model Watershed website. 


LEARN MORE
To get a feel for all the restoration work done and underway across 3.1 million acres of land and water over three decades, visit the Grande Ronde Model Watershed website: www.grmw.org.  


In Catherine Creek alone, 38 separate projects, including Baum’s, are listed on the Grande Ronde Model Watershed website from 1995 through 2021. The Confederated Umatilla Tribes are a frequent lead and partner on Catherine Creek, as is the Union County Soil and Water District. 
Projects include restored fish passage, restored seasonal flows, riparian habitat re-creation, re-meandered channels, restored pools, better irrigation systems, bridging/fencing/culverting and more. 
Kyle Bratcher’s agency is active as well.  
“In my Wallowa and Imnaha territory, the main restoration practitioners are Grande Ronde Model Watershed, the Nez Perce Tribe, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, and Trout Unlimited,” he said. “We were a lead on the McDaniel Ranch project, as of course was Doug McDaniel, who did so much for restoration in Wallowa Country.”  
McDaniel helped begin Wallowa Resources, which is also active in land and water restoration; Joe McCormack serves on its board.
“Trout Unlimited has done a lot of work in the upper Grande Ronde,” says Noel March, who grew up in La Grande and now works for the group. “In Sheep Creek, for example, about an hour upstream of La Grande, we’ve reversed a lot of historical damage.

“Among current projects, we’re in Chesnimnus Creek too, just above the Nez Perce project, working with the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest. In six miles of stream, we’re removing levees, returning those spawning gravels to the stream, and depositing large wood. It will give beaver a leg up.”  
Together, says March, the Nez Perce and Trout Unlimited projects “will soon be a large, connected corridor of high-quality steelhead habitat.”  March gives particular credit to the many landowners working with the Nez Perce, and to Mr. Taylor’s field staff. 
Land and canal owners are often, like Mr. Baum, project sponsors.  
“It is real,” says Rick George, “how many landowners are now giving permission to restore waters on their lands, and are supportive of salmon.  They want to reconnect land and water. There are still gaping wounds on this landscape; nothing can turn around all the water conversion and draining in the valleys anytime soon. But there is also change.”      
The Grande Ronde Model Watershed calls itself “the primary entity coordinating habitat restoration on private and public lands within the Grande Ronde Basin.” It was created in 1992-3, when the Northwest Power and Conservation Council chose the Grande Ronde as Oregon’s “model watershed” for spawning and rearing habitat restoration. 
Bonneville Power Administration ratepayers were starting then to extensively finance such work. Grande Ronde Model Watershed has been a conduit for millions of Bonneville ratepayer dollars to repair Grande Ronde and Imnaha watersheds, while developing funding from other sources too.

The CTUIR and Nez Perce Tribe each have seats on the Grande Ronde Model Watershed board. Joe McCormack represents the Nez Perce.
“In the early to mid-2000s, GRMW studied all the streams,” he said. “The Upper Grande Ronde and Catherine Creek were in the worst shape, and needed habitat work the most then.”  
Kyle Bratcher says: “ODFW helped develop the restoration atlases that prioritize watersheds and places. The Model Watershed holds monthly meetings of the implementors. It is a very big group and a very collaborative effort.”  
The Model Watershed also engages students, volunteers and organizations in citizen science. 
Ascension School students are in the program. It helps that one week of outdoor school is a fifth grade requirement in Oregon. Kyle Bratcher’s wife, Emily, organizes and teaches youth science education, separately but overlapping with the Model Watershed’s program.  
“She takes kids to the projects,” he said. “It’s a great way to teach them about fish and rivers, and spark their interest. They see fish spawning.”  Confed
Altogether, an impressively broad local network – tribes and tribal people, agencies local state and federal, ranchers and other landowners, fishers and the conservation-minded, churches, schools, businesses and nonprofits – is restoring waters and lands, public and private, at scales small to large, in the Grande Ronde and Imnaha watersheds. (The Powder River Basin Watershed Council, does similar work with far less resources in the Snake River watershed adjacent on the south. The Powder is without salmon, thanks to impassable dams constructed in Hells Canyon 60 years ago.)
 How to restore both salmon habitats, and salmon 

Salmon have this quality: People come to them by many paths, and are hooked. 
If, as seems likely, federal investments in northeast Oregon now shrivel for a time, it is plain the local restoration work will continue even if slowed. The tribal, community and economic investment is too rooted, and the local good being done too substantial.    
But the extinction threshold analyses make a second plain fact plainer.  Watershed repair and renewal in the Grande Ronde and Imnaha will restore natal salmon habitats, but under current conditions in migratory habitats outside the Grande Ronde, it will not restore salmon. 











It is real how many landowners are now giving permission to restore waters on their lands, and are supportive of salmon. They want to reconnect land and water. There are still gaping wounds on this landscape; nothing can turn around all the water conversion and draining in the valleys anytime soon. But there is also change.


– Rick George



	 
The riches salmon once gave the Grande Ronde and its people, Rick George’s ocean nutrient freight train, are close to disappearing despite three decades of sustained local river restorations. If all this good work is to achieve its harvest, and community goals for salmon in the Grande Ronde, off-site restoration of equally vital habitat – in this case, over-dammed migratory habitat – must occur soon.        
Here I believe the Nez Perce Tribe and Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife have the right three-part response. 
They are leading in extinction science and its applications for salmon and steelhead populations at extinction’s door.  
They are leaders to responsibly restore 140 miles of the lower Snake River and its habitats, by removing the earthen sections of its four dams, within an inclusive and phased Columbia Basin-wide approach developed by the “Six Sovereigns”: the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, Nez Perce Tribe and Oregon, plus the Yakama Nation, Confederated Warm Springs Tribes, and Washington.    
And they are active co-collaborators restoring health and habitats in the Grande Ronde and Imnaha watersheds. 
Editor’s note: Part four of this four-part series will be published by the Idaho Capital Sun on Friday. It will show how public and political awareness of the fishes’ dire condition is not optional if the Snake River is to be restored.

(Photo by Alex Peña/Getty Images)Two Louisiana mothers who were deported to Honduras along with their citizen children in April have now sued the Trump administration, arguing that their removals lacked due process in violation of federal law.
In a lawsuit filed at the end of July in federal court in Baton Rouge, attorneys for the families allege that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement illegally deported the two mothers – who are identified only as Julia and Rosario, without last names, in court documents – and their children, three of whom are U.S. citizens. The deported children range in age from 2 to 11 years old, and one — a 4-year-old — has stage-four kidney cancer, according to the lawsuit.
The complaint alleges that ICE officers, contrary to their own policies, denied the families due process when agents took the two mothers and their U.S. citizen children into custody during routine check-ins, keeping them at undisclosed locations and repeatedly denying them access to legal counsel and other U.S.-based family members. Those actions effectively kept the mothers from securing childcare for their children, plaintiffs argue.
“ICE has a policy for what they’re supposed to do in these instances, and they most certainly did not follow that policy,” said Stephanie Alvarez-Jones, one of the plaintiffs’ lawyers, in an interview.

The complaint names as defendants the Department of Homeland Security, its sub-agency ICE, the Department of Justice, and several individuals in their official capacities – including leadership in the regional ICE office in New Orleans, which carried out the deportations.
“ICE is like any other law enforcement agency, state or federal,” said Matt Vogel, supervising attorney at the National Immigration Project and lead counsel in the case.  “It has to abide by the law, and here, it just threw the law out the window, and it totally ran roughshod over the due process rights of all of these individuals.”
DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin called claims that the federal government is deporting U.S. citizen children “false.”In an emailed statement, McLaughlin said that “DHS takes its responsibility to protect children seriously.”
The deportations, which made headlines in the spring and drew criticism from a Trump-appointed federal judge in Louisiana, came as the Trump administration was facing intense criticism from civil rights groups over its aggressive approach to immigration enforcement. In March, DHS removed more than 200 people to a notorious high-security prison in El Salvador, including a Salvadoran man who had a court order protecting him against deportation for safety reasons.

The plaintiffs in the Louisiana case include Rosario, a 25-year old Honduran citizen who lived near New Orleans with two American-born children, Ruby, 7, and Romeo, 4, the latter of whom has stage-four kidney cancer. The other family in the lawsuit includes Julia, a 30-year-old Honduran citizen who lived near Baton Rouge with two daughters, Janelle, 11, a citizen of Honduras and Jade, 2, a U.S. citizen, and her partner Jacob, the children’s father.
ICE agents took the mothers and children of both families into custody in late April, deporting them within days of their arrests, according to the suit.
“I thought I was just going to an appointment, but I was lied to,” Julia said in a statement. “I never imagined they would send me and my children to Honduras.”
Both sets of mothers and children were taken into custody during routine check-ins in April as part of a supervision program run by ICE and contracted out to surveillance technology company BI Incorporated, a subsidiary of publicly traded private prison operator GEO Group.
The check-ins took place at the offices of an ICE contractor in St. Rose, a suburb of New Orleans. According to the complaint, when the families arrived at their individual check-ins, they were taken to a room where plainclothes ICE agents were waiting. Rosario’s attorney, who accompanied her and her kids to the appointment, was not allowed to join the family.
The complaint alleges that agents confiscated their belongings, including jewelry, cell phones, and passports and presented them with documents. The families were then taken to undisclosed locations and denied access to speak with their attorneys and family members, according to the lawsuit.
The complaint states that Rosario refused to sign documents that agents presented to her without an opportunity to consult her attorney. Julia agreed to write a note stating that she would take Jade with her to Honduras only after agents allegedly said the 2-year-old would be placed into foster care if she remained in the United States. Neither mother was granted the opportunity to find childcare for their U.S. citizen children, the complaint alleges.
Vogel called this a “pure exercise of force,” arguing that ICE was trying to “deliberately and consciously and intentionally” thwart people’s due process rights.
According to a 2022 ICE directive, agents should allow arrestees to arrange care for their children and document the parent’s choice to place their kids in another guardian’s care.
After being taken into custody, Julia, Rosario and their respective children were driven three hours away from the check-in site to Alexandria, according to the suit, where they were detained in an undisclosed hotel.
Julia tried several times to communicate with both her attorney and partner, Jacob, plaintiffs claim, adding that Jacob was attempting to get physical custody of his youngest daughter. But, the suit alleges, ICE officers made communication difficult by refusing calls, cutting calls short, and saying they would also detain and deport Jacob, who is a Louisiana resident and also a plaintiff in the case.
Julia, Rosario and the children were apprehended and deported during a moment when arrests and deportations were on the rise under Trump’s effort to control borders and ramp up deportations.
‘The Light Switch,’ Episode 17: Inside ICE’s Louisiana detention centers

The details of the case — the alleged ruse followed by an arrest and quick deportation — are similar to others around the country since Trump took office. That includes a January arrest in the New Orleans area, in which an immigrant family of three said they were taken into custody at a routine ICE check-in, flown to Texas and deported the following day.
McLaughlin denied that ICE deports U.S. citizen children unless complying with the wishes of their parents.
“ICE asked the mothers if they wanted to be removed with their children or if they wanted ICE to place the children with someone safe the parent designates. The parents in this instance made the determination to take their children with them back to Honduras,” McLaughlin said.
Julia and Rosario’s attorneys deny that the mothers decided to take the children back with them. They said that Rosario refused to sign any document consenting to have her children sent to Honduras, and Julia only signed under threat of her daughter being sent to foster care.
“Counsel repeatedly requested the opportunity to talk to them in order to make other arrangements for the children, and ICE specifically and explicitly refused every time,” said Vogel in response to the DHS statement.
The families’ lawyers also say that the federal government failed to arrange cancer treatment in Honduras for 4-year-old Romeo. The complaint states that his mother, Rosario, has had to arrange for Romeo and his sister Ruby to travel with guardians back to the United States to receive cancer treatment.
“These recent appointments marked the first time Romeo ever had to undergo any part of his cancer treatment without his mother,” the complaint said.
McLaughlin said that ICE makes sure treatment is available “in the country to which the illegal alien is being removed.”
“The implication that ICE would deny a child the medical care they need is flatly false, and it is an insult to the men and women of federal law enforcement,” she said.
The complaint said the mental health of all four children is suffering as a result of the arrest and deportation.
The plaintiffs are asking Judge Brian Jackson to declare the removals of the two families unconstitutional and to order mothers and their children returned to the United States. The plaintiffs also want the judge to compel ICE to then follow the agency’s rules to allow the mothers to make childcare arrangements.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — Nebraska immigrant advocates and elected officials are among those criticizing the state’s decision to host a federal detention center for migrants — and the flippant nickname the Trump administration gave the facility.
“The so-called ‘Cornhusker Clink’ — if that name doesn’t demonstrate the dystopian nightmare in which we now find ourselves, I don’t know what does,” says Kevin Abourezk, a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe who was among protestors outside of Gov. Jim Pillen’s Office when details were announced.
“It’s meant to be funny, but in this context it is actually terrifying,” said the longtime Lincoln-based journalist. “It’s like they’re not human to them.”
Roger Garcia, the Democratic chairman of the Douglas County Board, which governs the most populous county in the state, took to social media to express concern.

“They create cute names for their pursuit of furthering their aggressive, callous efforts,” Garcia said of the federal nickname for the McCook Work Ethic Camp that is to be converted into a 300-bed immigration detention center. He referred also to the “Alligator Alcatraz” name Republicans gave the detention center in the Florida Everglades.
“But woe to you who laugh now and to those who use your power to harm instead of nurture harmony and compassion in our society,” said Garcia.
Garcia had a relative apprehended in an Omaha worksite raid in June and has been a vocal critic of ICE detaining “parents working to feed their children, community members that have been here for decades.”
 Pillen not worried 

A spokesperson for Pillen on Wednesday defended the Cornhusker Clink nickname and Pillen’s broader approach of supporting President Donald Trump in his campaign pledge to execute the largest deportation operation in American history.
Pillen told Fox News on Wednesday, “The bottom line is: We’re not worried about names. We’re worried about supporting and doing our fair share.”
  Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen. Dec. 10, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
He talked about how he and other Republican governors have heard “loud and clear” Trump’s call to “step up.” He said he was “really, really proud” to empower the state’s National Guard, State Patrol and Department of Correctional Services to become a part of Trump’s deportation mission.
Many Republican state senators in the officially nonpartisan Nebraska Legislature have expressed support for the governor’s stance, including State Sen. Rob Clements, chair of the Legislature’s budget-writing Appropriations Committee. 
State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha posted on social media site X that “using ‘Cornhusker’ to brand an ICE detention camp is a disgrace” — and called for action by the University of Nebraska.
“The University of Nebraska enforces its trademark all the time,” she said. “Why not now?”
 ‘Symbol of pride’

Hunt, a progressive nonpartisan who has clashed before with Pillen on immigration, wrote that NU had built its reputation around “Cornhusker,” which she described as “a symbol of pride, community and the hardworking spirit” of Nebraska. 
She said the term belongs to Nebraskans, not to ICE, Pillen or a detention facility that she said would “separate families and harm our immigrant neighbors.”
  State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha. March 31, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
“Cornhusker should never be associated with incarceration, cruelty or state-sanctioned violence,” Hunt wrote. “To remain silent is to allow Nebraska’s most cherished identity to be co-opted for purposes that betray our values.”
The NU Board of Regents owns the trademark to the plural version of “Cornhuskers” and other related terms largely around Huskers athletics at the flagship Lincoln campus, like “Go Big Red.” Pillen previously served as an elected member of the regents and played defensive back for the Huskers.
The Nebraska Legislature dubbed Nebraska “The Cornhusker State” in 1945. 
An NU spokesperson told the Examiner on Wednesday that while NU has certain legal protections, including for any use of phrases that would imply an NU endorsement or connection, the State of Nebraska can use the term for official state business. She also noted that many Nebraskans have informally used the “Cornhusker” label to describe themselves and their heritage.
The spokesperson added: “The University of Nebraska has had no role in the planning, naming or future operation of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility at the McCook Work Ethic Camp and learned of it only through the federal announcement.”

Marty Ramirez, co-founder of the statewide immigrant advocacy group Las Voces, took issue with State Patrol and National Guard resources aimed at immigrants. But he says he believes “messing with the Cornhusker” name will backfire in prompting community backlash beyond immigration advocates.
“Nebraska — the good life — now equals militarized and politicized,” he said.
Ramirez and others noted how state officials say that criminals will be housed in the detention facility. He pointed out that many people in ICE custody today face civil administrative charges, not criminal.
For example, the June 10 ICE-led immigration raid at Omaha’s Glenn Valley Foods plant led to the detention of 75 to 80 undocumented workers at a North Platte facility. ICE officials said the worksite operation stemmed from a federal criminal search warrant looking for more than 100 individuals believed to have worked using stolen U.S. identities.
But according to available federal court records, it appears only one of the detained workers has been criminally charged for using the Social Security number of a U.S. citizen. Immigration judges who granted bond to several of the workers noted they had no criminal past.

 Who decides? 

Abourezk said the use and definition of the term criminal appears to be expanding by the day.
For that matter, he asked, “Who decides who is an immigrant? We live in a nation of immigrants except for our indigenous people. This administration seems to focus only on the brown ones.”
The Center for Immigrant and Refugee Advancement also evoked the ‘Good Life’ theme.
“Detaining our neighbors in our own backyard doesn’t make Nebraska safer,” said Roxana Cortes-Mills, legal director of the nonprofit that provides attorneys for ICE detainees. “We’ve seen the damage detention causes when families are separated, people are cut off from their lawyer and children are left wondering when their parents will come home.”
The Nebraska Commission on Latino-Americans, whose nine members are appointed by the governor, said in a statement Wednesday it also was concerned with the message the decision to host the detention facility sends locally and nationally.
“It is profoundly disappointing to consider that Nebraska may increasingly be viewed as a ‘Midwest hub of incarceration,’” said the statement issued by executive director Maria Arriaga for the commission. “Such an association risks diminishing the values of openness and justice that many Nebraskans hold dear.”
The commission urged elected officials and decision makers to reflect on the long-term impact and “prioritize solutions that honor human dignity and social cohesion.”

(Lexi Browning | West Virginia Watch)While students across the Mountain State are going back to school to advance to the next grade, many parents and most of the politicians seemed to be held back in the same spots with the same education arguments of the last few years.
News headlines and social media stories come one at a time on the as-needed basis as events and the business model dictate. But separate news items and viral debates over school choice, school funding, school vaccination requirements, school closings, school performance, and school staffing are variations on one theme: What is education, and who should control it?
That basic “who/what” question of intent and control is not unique to education issues. All political stories when reduced to their essences are stories about power and money. Education has become more and more a political endeavour, because of inherently involved power and money. As such, the rules of discerning politics apply far more than the traditional policy ideas and learning philosophies of what information goes into a student and how to evaluate the information coming out of a student. Add in the culture warring elements fueled by the modern marriage of news media and social media, and you have an environment that is heavy on the vibes and light on vocation.
The COVID-19 crisis is justifiably noted to be an inflection point in the push-pull world of policy and politics in general and education specifically. COVID — or more specifically the reaction by the people involved in running the institutions of American society from schools, to government, to health care, to social order — revealed the pre-existing flaws with a stress test that most everyone failed to one degree or another. While the high-minded ideals of learning, education and bettering the next generation were still recited as if the words themselves would magically manifest such things into malleable minds, reality told a different story.
Schools were closed, opened, closed again, re-opened with restrictions and not-ready-for-prime-time hybrid and online learning. Exceptions and standards had to be adjusted on the fly. Parents and the government had a tug-of-war over who could better understand an unprecedented crisis in public health and public trust with in-classroom teachers and their students as the rope.
The generation of students who lived through it heard all the buzzwords and platitudes, but weighed them against their lived experience, and found them wanting. Words said education matters, students matter, learning matters. Actions told them the priority of the education system was to be a giant jobs and funding program first, a daycare for parents second, and once that was all satisfied, perhaps you might learn something while being taught to pass a test to show what you learned.
Post-COVID, plenty of parents and politicians seem unable to let go of the tug-of-war rope. While the individual debates over issues like the vaccine exemptions, the ballooning cost of the Hope Scholarship, and debates over what should and shouldn’t be included in curriculum continue, perspective is badly needed that all these threads form the one cord of systematically educating students. The in-classroom teachers and students are on a treadmill that starts every August and keeps going until the following June. Education in the United States of America in the Year of Our Lord 2025 is very much a machine that does not stop.
The ever-entwined socio-political news and social media coverage of education runs at variable speeds, mostly parallel to the actual in-classroom education system. When the news narratives and social media attention does cross over into the real world education system, chaos and confusion are usually the result. Regardless of the chaos or the reason du jour, the in-classroom teachers have to press ahead with the students. While the algorithms and consultants keep us entertained, the pressure on an already overworked, underfunded and constantly criticized in-classroom environment is doing no one any favors.
Not that there ever was an era of magnanimous politics, but even with cellphones being banned from classrooms the rising generations of students have more information on current events than ever before. Those students aren’t just learning the curriculum; they are learning what the adults — teachers, parents, government officials, administrators — really think about them and their place in the education and political machines that drive America. And they are going to believe us.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)MASON COUNTY  — Tim Grosser drove his truck across a pasture toward cattle he raises with his son Andy on the farm he’s owned for more than 30 years. “It’s peaceful,” Grosser said, mentioning the smell of fresh mown hay. 
“We just cut it and let it cure and rake it, roll it up, and then we store all the rolls to feed the cows in wintertime.”
Neither of the Grossers grew up farming. Tim is a doctor and Andy an engineer at the nearby Mitsubishi Electric factory. Their 250 acres about three miles from the Ohio River is where they’ve slowly learned how to farm. Where Tim’s grandson travels from hours away to hunt deer and turkey. Where Andy built a house.
Their attachment to this place plays a large role in why the 75-year-old and his son have rejected repeated attempts from their county judge-executive and the local economic development director to reserve their land for a potential future purchase. The last offer they heard in March from local officials was $35,000 an acre, meaning a payout of millions of dollars. His neighbors have also been approached, Grosser said, some agreeing to sign purchase options. 
“I don’t want some government people coming in here and telling me that I have to sell my place for anything,” Grosser said. 
  Tim Grosser originally bought his land in Mason County to hunt on. He eventually learned how to raise cattle with his son on these rolling pastures. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)
The reason for the land acquisition, as described by local officials: A “Fortune 100” company is considering Mason County as the site for a more than $1 billion investment in a “technology campus” for data centers featuring office space, parking and green space. 
The potential project is part of what could be a boom in “hyperscale” data centers in Kentucky.
The state’s largest utility recently told lawmakers it’s working on 20 data center projects. To meet the prospective demand for electricity, Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities is seeking to build billions of dollars in new natural gas-fired power plants. 
The state has expanded tax breaks to data centers and state lawmakers are eager to provide more. Supporters in Kentucky welcome the potential for new jobs and tax revenue driven by fast-growing artificial intelligence services. 
But the industry’s tremendous demand for electricity and water also raises concerns, including warnings that Kentucky residents and businesses could be burdened with higher electricity costs if the prospects don’t materialize.  
In Mason County, another source of concern is the secrecy surrounding the project. 
The land being considered is next to both power and water: Just miles away is the Ohio River and East Kentucky Power Cooperative’s Hugh L. Spurlock Generating Station, a coal-fired power plant that’s being converted to also burn natural gas.

Secrecy and uncertainty
The identity of the company that would build and operate the data center has remained a secret. Local officials have signed non-disclosure agreements, which generally require the signee to not reveal specific information. Tim and Andy Grosser said officials tried to get them to sign such an agreement, but they refused. 
The way Mason County Judge-Executive Owen McNeill sees it, non-disclosure agreements are common in the economic development world. Especially with “global, top 10 companies.” 
“They have hundreds of thousands of employees. They have immeasurable stock prices,” McNeill told the Lantern. “Without a willingness to do a non-disclosure agreement, you don’t even get to talk.”

McNeill and other officials in recent county government meetings have touted the potential benefits they say the data center project could bring: Needed upgrades to drinking water infrastructure. New programs and support for local schools. A boost in property tax revenue so large that the project could generate more annual tax revenue than many of the county’s largest taxpayers combined. Hundreds of jobs badging into the facility with nearly double the normal base salary in the county. 
McNeill worked in economic development for decades as a consultant and as the economic development director for Mason County and the county seat of Maysville before being appointed to his county’s top elected position in 2021 by Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear.
Having been elected to a full four-year term in 2022, he sees himself as a conduit “to work with potential investors, to see if a project even will fit here, to see if there’s even a possibility.” 
His hope is that a data center project could reverse the trend of population decline in Mason County, providing well-paying jobs that support the broader economy similar to how the former Browning Manufacturing plant in Maysville supported families in the 20th century. 
“Having the jobs that people can build their lives around to then be able to enjoy the additional amenities that Maysville, Mason County and northeast Kentucky has to offer is kind of one of those core anchors that keeps people here,” McNeill said. 
Pat Garofalo, the director of state and local policy at the think tank American Economic Liberties Project, said tech companies, especially Amazon and Google, have expanded the use of non-disclosure agreements in economic development deals. But he said it’s not in the best interest of communities.

Garofalo, who co-wrote a short report criticizing the use of non-disclosure agreements, says the agreements give companies an unfair advantage in negotiations with communities by eliminating the possibility of competition from other companies that might come in with a better offer. 
In the case of a data center, that offer could pertain to using less water, paying more of its electricity costs or other benefits for the community.
“An open auction is in the best interests of the public and the taxpayer. A closed, secretive process is in the best interest of the corporation,” Garofalo said. “The ultimate result is a race to the bottom if this all stays behind closed doors and in the dark, and the different communities don’t even know what they’re negotiating on against each other.” 
He also pointed out job promises associated with data centers haven’t always materialized. He said the data center construction boom comes amid speculation there could be a “bubble” of investment into data center-backed artificial intelligence. 
When asked about criticism of non-disclosure agreements, McNeill said he didn’t see the “merit” in such an argument because no competitor to the potential data center developer would “come in with more jobs, more alignment with our educational system.” 
“I don’t think there’s anyone better to be quite honest with you,” McNeill said, referencing the data center developer. 
Organizing around lingering questions
The secrecy surrounding the project was on the minds of the 30-plus people who gathered Sunday at a Mason County church. The group, which has been organizing for months, was joined by some newcomers hoping to learn more about the project. 
“We demand right now two things: transparency and regulation. That’s what we demand right now of our elected officials,” said group president Max Moran.

Moran, who serves as a commissioner for the city of Germantown and its almost 150 people along the Mason County line, is  part of the loose coalition raising questions about the potential data center: Where would it get its water? How far could its noise carry? How will the environment be protected? How would property values be impacted near the data center?
Moran referenced a recent New York Times report that water usage from a Georgia data center built by Meta, the parent company of Facebook, caused a nearby home’s water well to run dry and the local county to face a potential water shortage.
“We don’t want that to happen here. Not even a chance of that happening,” Moran told the Lantern. “You’re supposed to learn from your mistakes.” 
Some members of the group, called We Are Mason County, pointed to reporting from hotspots for data centers around the country, such as Northern Virginia, where residents have pleaded with their local officials over complaints of data centers’ noise and large land use.
Tyler McHugh, the executive director of the Maysville-Mason County Industrial Development Authority, said he believes a lot of the concerns brought by local residents come from “speculative” data center developers that try to build without having an end user. Data center hotspots such as Virginia, he said, have centers “stacked on top of each other.” 
McHugh said the Mason County developer, in contrast, is a “major technology company that is extremely, extremely focused on community benefit and being a good neighbor.” 
“I’m not a fly-by-night economic developer. I plan on living the rest of my life and raising my family in Mason County,” said McHugh, who graduated from Mason County High School and moved back to the county. “I wouldn’t bring in someone that’s going to cause a complete mess for the county.”

If the project comes to Mason County, McHugh and McNeill in separate interviews told the Lantern, they have commitments or “guarantees” of measures to mitigate noise, pull “the bulk” of the project’s water from the Ohio River and cover infrastructure costs including roads, water, sewer and fiber internet connection. 
McNeill said in about a month or two, the developer could come before local planning and zoning officials — without revealing the name of the company — to present more specific plans for the development. 
Such assurances fall short for Tim and Andy Grosser and other members of We Are Mason County. 
Anthony Chamblin, who does marketing for the group, said some locals are afraid because data centers are “new technology,” but the main sentiment is “anger at the lack of transparency.” 
He wants to know who the developer is and what the full scale of the development will be, especially as some of his family worry about the value of their homes which are near the area being optioned for development. 
“What is going to happen to our resources? What’s going to happen to the resale value of people around it?” said Chamblin. “There’s a huge list.”

The Colorado Latino Policy Agenda report for 2025 polled 1,700 registered and non-registered Latino voters across the state between July 10 and Aug. 6 to provide insight on Latino political and social priorities, with heavier sample sizes in rural congressional districts. The project is a collaboration between Voces Unidas and the Colorado Organization for Latina Opportunity and Reproductive Rights. Surveys were conducted in English and Spanish.
The top three issues survey respondents selected at both the state and federal levels related to economic and affordability concerns. At the federal level, 33% of respondents selected high cost of living and inflation as their top concern; 33% selected improving wages and income; and 25% selected lowering health care costs. At the state level, 36% of respondents selected improving wages and income as their top concern; 35% selected high cost of living and inflation; and 26% selected lowering health care costs.

“Just as we’ve seen over the last several years of polling, economic concerns are the top priority for Latino voters,” Gabriel Sanchez from BSP Research said in a media call previewing the poll results Wednesday. “All three of the top issues when isolated individually are tied to the economy and personal finances, and I think again reflects the strain that a lot of Latinos unfortunately in our communities are continuing to feel economically.” 
Economic concerns are the most consistent trend in the poll’s five years in existence, Sanchez said, and even though the state “has done a lot to try and address rising inflation” and housing costs, the Latino population still sees room for improvement. 
A third of survey respondents each said their financial situation has improved, stayed the same, or worsened over the last year. Sanchez said every year the survey has asked this question, roughly a third of the Latino community “has continued to lose ground financially and indicated things have gotten worse,” and that the gap between those doing well and those struggling economically is growing.
“It’s folks that make under $40,000 a year, have less than a college education that tend to be the folks that are unfortunately, every year, falling further and further behind and not being able to keep up with inflation,” Sanchez said. “I think that sends a strong message that Latinos overall want to see more done to address these financial concerns.”
About a third of the survey respondents are covered by Medicaid, and 40% said they would not be able to afford life saving medication or would skip or delay regular medical visits if they lost health insurance coverage. That dynamic is concerning, Sanchez said, and will be problematic not just for individuals and families, but the entire health care system. Alex Sánchez, president and CEO of Voces Unidas, said Latinos are more likely to be uninsured and to face chronic illness with lower access to health care services, so it is important to monitor how health policy decisions at the national, state and local level affect Latinos’ ability to receive care. 










It's folks that make under $40,000 a year, have less than a college education that tend to be the folks that are unfortunately, every year, falling further and further behind and not being able to keep up with inflation ... I think that sends a strong message that Latinos overall want to see more done to address these financial concerns.


– Gabriel Sanchez from BSP Research


Respondents had higher approval of Democrats in Colorado and in Congress compared to Republicans as well as President Donald Trump. Of those who think the country is moving in the right direction, 50% of respondents said that is because of Trump, while 66% of those who think the country is moving in the wrong direction blame Trump. 
The poll also found that Latino voters generally have favorable views of statewide elected officials including Attorney General Phil Weiser, Secretary of State Jena Griswold, and U.S. Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper — all Democrats running for a statewide office in 2026. Hickenlooper has the highest favorability at 52%, followed by Bennet at 49%.Weiser and Griswold both have 43% favorability. 
In Colorado’s 8th Congressional District, which has the largest Latino population in the state, the poll asked about approval of the district’s current representative, Gabe Evans, a Fort Lupton Republican, compared to its first, Yadira Caraveo, a Thornton Democrat. Caraveo had slightly higher favorability in the poll at 53% compared to 44% for Evans. Caraveo is among the Democrats running to unseat Evans in 2026.
Over 400 of those interviewed for the poll live in the 3rd Congressional District, which covers most of the Western Slope, and just under 300 live in the 8th District, which runs along the Front Range north of Denver to Greeley. The district with the third highest participation is the Denver-based 1st Congressional District with 277 participants. 
Immigration-specific questions
The fourth highest concern respondents had at the federal level is immigrant rights and immigration reform. The poll asked specific questions related to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement enforcement and collaboration. 
The majority of respondents, 66%, said they were against sharing Medicaid data about immigrants with the Trump administration and ICE, compared to 34% in favor. Most respondents, 61%, were also against sharing identifiable data about immigrant children with the Trump administration and ICE, compared to 39% in favor. 
“At the end of the day, Latinos overall oppose local officials collaborating with ICE and the Trump administration, specifically as it pertains to Medicaid data, and obviously our most vulnerable segment of the population: children” Sanchez said.
The vast majority of respondents, 84%, said all law enforcement officers in Colorado should identify themselves, wear body cameras, drive clearly marked vehicles, and treat everyone with dignity and respect. 
The survey also asked if ICE agents should be allowed to stop anyone they suspect of being undocumented, which 62% of respondents opposed and 38% supported. 
The full report will be released to the public on Sept. 23, and the organizations behind the Colorado Latino Policy Agenda are working on a study of how responses have changed over the five years they have conducted the statewide survey.

(Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)This week, the Trump administration’s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced an effort to check the immigration status of people who get their health insurance through Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.
Medicaid is the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. For families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford private insurance, CHIP is a public program that provides low-cost health coverage for their children.
The feds will begin sending states monthly enrollment reports that identify people with Medicaid or CHIP whose immigration or citizenship status can’t be confirmed through federal databases. States are then responsible for verifying the citizenship or immigration status of individuals in those reports. States are expected to take “appropriate actions when necessary, including adjusting coverage or enforcing non-citizen eligibility rules,” according to a CMS press release.
“We are tightening oversight of enrollment to safeguard taxpayer dollars and guarantee that these vital programs serve only those who are truly eligible under the law,” Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who oversees CMS as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said in a press release announcing the new program.
As of April, roughly 71 million adults and children nationwide have Medicaid coverage, while another 7 million children have insurance through CHIP. Immigrants under age 65 are less likely to be covered by Medicaid than U.S.-born citizens, according to an analysis from health research organization KFF.
Immigrants who are in the country illegally aren’t eligible for federally funded Medicaid and CHIP. Only citizens and certain lawfully present immigrants — green card holders and refugees, for example — can qualify.
But some states have chosen to expand Medicaid coverage for immigrants with their own funds. Twenty-three states offer pregnancy-related care regardless of citizenship or immigration status, according to KFF. Fourteen states provide coverage for children in low-income families regardless of immigration status, while seven states offer coverage to some adults regardless of status.
The tax and spending package President Donald Trump signed last month cuts federal spending on Medicaid by more than $1 trillion, leaving states to either make up the difference with their own funds or reduce coverage. But the new law also includes restrictions on coverage for certain immigrants, including stripping eligibility from refugees and asylum-seekers.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline) Rarely is the path from point A to point B so clear as with the journey the Colorado state budget took from balanced to unbalanced.
Here’s how it went. Colorado lawmakers, as they’re required to do by the state constitution, passed a balanced budget in April during their regular session. In the following weeks, President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress pushed through H.R. 1, known by the MAGA faithful as the “big, beautiful bill.” Because of Colorado’s unusual reliance on the federal tax code for its own tax rates, H.R. 1 stripped an estimated $1.2 billion in revenue from the state and left an $800 million hole in the budget. That’s why Gov. Jared Polis called the Legislature into a special session that begins Thursday.
Pretty straightforward — unless you’re trying to follow Republicans.
According to Republican state lawmakers, the congressional megabill had nothing to do with the state’s budget hole. Rather, it was caused by Democratic “mismanagement.”
Make it make sense.

At least this up-is-down perspective aligns with GOP denialism around other aspects of H.R. 1. For example, the measure guts Medicaid, yet Republicans like U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans of Fort Lupton insist it’s “protecting Medicaid.” Evans has denied the new law favors the rich, calling any claim it does “patently false,” even though economists say it resulted in the largest transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich in U.S. history.
On the surface it might appear that state Republicans are conflating one issue (the state budget hole) with another (state budget priorities). After all, they do consistently object to spending decisions by the Democratic majority at the Colorado Capitol.
Let’s assume, then, that their charge of mismanagement is misplaced but made in good faith. Would different budget decisions have better shielded the state from a hit like H.R. 1?
Yes. Tax revenue collection and spending is capped by the state Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights. The cap represents a maximum, but lawmakers do not have to spend every dollar they’re statutorily permitted to. They could choose not to establish new services. They could refrain from expanding programs. They could cease spending on certain existing items. They could instead write surpluses into annual budgets and develop structural buffers beyond the required reserve fund so that unforeseen emergencies, such as a recession or Trumpist recklessness, are blips rather than bombs.
Nothing in principle is wrong with this approach. But if lawmakers advocate it, they must specify which government services should go. This is where the Republican position gets murky.
Much of what state Republicans publicly say they want to eliminate from the state budget involves access to health care, particularly for residents who lack permanent legal status.
The top Republican in the state House, Minority Leader Rose Pugliese, during a radio appearance last month said the expansion of Medicaid in Colorado should be “rolled back.” Medicaid ensures basic health care coverage for many of the state’s most vulnerable residents. Pugliese also advocated the elimination of OmniSalud, a state program that helps tens of thousands of people regardless of immigration status obtain and pay for health coverage.
Among the special session bills Republicans have filed so far, one would require the state to prioritize “documented residents” in state-subsidized health care coverage, and another would simply disqualify anyone without lawful immigration status from receiving state money for health care coverage.
The irony is that government subsidies for health care for residents without legal status are calculated to save money for everyone in the long run. When residents, whatever their status, forgo preventive care or early treatment, they typically end up seeking expensive emergency care when their condition becomes grave. This can raise costs throughout the health care system.
Beyond stripping health care from people, state Republicans are cagey about what else they’d strike from the state budget. They could offer more details and try to win a legislative majority on the strength of their proposals.
But, so far, their position on budget cuts is no more straightforward than their message on why the state has been forced into a special session.

(Photo by Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)One of the notable features of Gov. Sarah Sanders’ first two years in office has been that when she asks Republican legislators to jump, their usual response is “how high?”
So it’s all the more striking that the Arkansas Legislative Council has quietly pulled from consideration a $57 million contract to design the 3,000-bed mega-prison she wants to build in Franklin County — a strong indication that she didn’t have the votes to push it through.
She’s also seen one of her usual allies in the legislature, Sen. Gary Stubblefield, R-Branch, denounce as “extortion” threats made to recalcitrant lawmakers to pull funding for projects in their districts if they don’t support the prison — a tactic that isn’t rare but isn’t usually discussed out loud in such blunt language.
And in another sign of potential trouble ahead for Sanders’ prison plans, the legislature’s Joint Performance Review Committee has scheduled a Sept. 9 hearing that will allow lawmakers to ask administration officials uncomfortable questions about a project characterized by mystifying choices, unnecessary secrecy and political tone-deafness.
Chief among those questions: How are you going to supply the prison with water?
Test wells drilled in August at the proposed prison site north of Charleston produced meager quantities of water, a development that could prove fatal to the project after officials in both Fort Smith and Ozark said they don’t have enough capacity to supply the prison via pipeline.
Remarkably, the state paid nearly $3 million for the prison site without thoroughly investigating whether it could be supplied with water, and has now come up practically bone dry. 
Sanders made the new prison the centerpiece of her criminal justice platform, insisting that more prison capacity is urgently needed to address a backlog of state prisoners in county jails. Her incarceration-forward approach, in a state that already locks up more people than all but two other states, is also expected to increase the prison population by 25% over the next decade. 
The irony is that while her policy choices are fueling the need for ever more prison space, lack of due diligence by her own people could force her to start all over with a new prison site, pushing out the timeline for getting the prison online by a year or more.
She could also head into her re-election campaign next year with nothing to show for the political capital she’s spent trying to get this project approved, including ticking off nearly everyone in ruby red Franklin County.
This debacle also raises questions about the role played by Joe Profiri, her hand-picked corrections secretary who was fired by the Board of Corrections and then hired as a senior aide in the governor’s office, with vaguely defined duties and a $184,000 salary.
The selection of the Franklin County site — rural, remote, with no water or sewer capacity, inadequate roads and no readily available local labor force — didn’t make sense when Sanders sprung it on area residents last Halloween and has never been adequately explained.
State officials fixated on the property once they learned it was on the market in July 2024, and, operating in secrecy, closed on it in less than a month, even though it didn’t meet many of the preferred criteria set out as the site selection process began.
Those criteria included a county population of at least 30,000 to secure an adequate workforce, a location within two miles of an interstate or federal highway, and water and sewer infrastructure to meet a demand of 300,000 to 500,000 gallons a day.
The two test wells dug on the property produced a mere 3,100 gallons per day, confirming what critics of the project have said all along — that lack of water makes the prison unfeasible at the chosen location.
“At the end of the day, the facts haven’t changed since day one,” said Adam Watson, one of the organizers of a grassroots campaign to stop the prison, who says the site’s flaws were so obvious and unresolvable that “I think we honestly could have just sat on our hands and not said a thing.”
And Watson notes that water supply is just the first of many obstacles for the project, given the site’s inherent inadequacies: “I think we’re going to face similar issues every step of the way.”
The Joint Performance Review Committee, which has subpoena power, called the hearing after opponents of the prison presented a petition with more than 1,200 signatures asking members to look into the project. Watson said opponents of the prison have asked legislators to call both Profiri and Sanders to testify.
Just how hard the committee will press is an open question. None of the Republican legislators who have been outspoken in their opposition to the prison serve on it, although they could testify, and the panel contains a number of Sanders allies who have vocally supported the project. But the hearing should at least force administration officials to answer questions and respond to concerns in a public forum, with critics from Franklin County in the room.
The committee will also have to decide whether to question officials from Vanir Construction Management, the California firm that has so far been paid $400,000 of a $16.7 million contract to oversee the project.
  Sen. Bryan King, R-Green Forest, speaks during a press conference regarding the planned prison for Franklin County on Jan. 14, 2025. (Photo by Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)
Stubblefield and Sen. Bryan King,  R-Green Forest, have criticized Vanir for lack of candor and cooperation, and the company was chastised by state auditors for billing the state for first-class air travel, alcohol and pricey hotel stays.
Vanir was also paid $50,000 to dig the test wells at the prison site and provided legislators with water flow data that was contradicted by a state report, although even Vanir’s higher estimates fell woefully short of the amount of water the prison would need.
Given the lack of water at the selected site, and a price tag that is almost certain to exceed $1 billion, Watson says opponents of the prison are cautiously optimistic that the project won’t go forward as planned, although they’re bracing for the possibility that Sanders will try to get Ozark or Fort Smith to change their minds or advance plans for a smaller prison on the same site.
However, unless or until Sanders changes course, prudence dictates that any optimism be tempered by her demonstrated reluctance to admit mistakes or change course, and a legislature still full of Republicans happy to say “how high?”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/P1145169-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-21 05:56:47.100576

(Photo by Cris Ritchie/Getty Images)Central Appalachia — and Eastern Kentucky in particular — is running out of time to turn a century of decline into a future worth staying for. Population loss is now the coalfields’ defining trend, and in some counties it’s accelerating toward collapse.
Data from the Kentucky State Data Center’s “Kentucky: By the Numbers” series shows that Kentucky’s coal counties — including Letcher, Knott, Perry and Harlan — are among the fastest-shrinking in Appalachia.
 By 2050, Harlan is projected to lose nearly half its people (-44.6%), with Breathitt (-39.4%), Martin (-33.0%), Floyd (-30.5%), and Leslie (-29.5%) not far behind. 
The pattern stretches across both coal and non-coal counties in Eastern Kentucky: Pike (-26.3%), Knott (-25.6%), Bell (-23.2%), Perry (-22.0%), Whitley (-17.2%), Owsley (-16.4%), Letcher (-14.4%), Lee (-13.9%), Johnson (-12.5%), Knox (-8.9%), Magoffin (-7.6%), Lawrence (-6.2%) — with Wolfe a rare outlier projected to grow slightly (+3.0%).
All the data are from 2010–2050 projections. We are 15 years along now and the economic and social conditions in these counties have only grown more dire as flooding becomes more frequent and more damaging and the Trump administration makes cuts in health care, FEMA and development programs like the Appalachian Regional Commission.
We’re not just losing numbers — we’re losing the critical mass that keeps communities alive. Shrinking tax bases strain schools and clinics. Volunteer fire and rescue squads struggle to replace aging equipment. Local businesses close earlier, then for good. And after every flood, more families ask if it’s sustainable to rebuild at the bottom of a hollow while idle acreage sits on benches and ridgelines above town.
Floods made the land problem impossible to ignore.

The 2022 Eastern Kentucky floods killed 45 people, destroyed hundreds of homes, and forced many survivors into a wrenching choice: rebuild in the same floodplain or leave the region altogether.  As one flood victim said, “I can stay and face the next flood, or I can leave the county my family’s been in for 200 years.”
Gov. Andy Beshear’s answer has been bold and right: build high-ground neighborhoods. His administration is creating eight such communities across Breathitt, Floyd, Knott, Letcher and Perry counties, with more than $8 million allocated to Perry County alone. 
Eastern Kentucky’s ‘higher ground’ homes are being built. The builders see the need for much more.

This pioneering effort is the seed from which a much more comprehensive vision of change for Eastern Kentucky and Central Appalachia can emerge.  The model works — but scaling it up runs straight into a century-old barrier: who owns the land. We’ve tried everything but changing who holds the deed.
Corporate control keeps safe ground off limits in much of Eastern Kentucky; coal and timber companies still control huge tracts of the high, safe ground needed for climate-resilient rebuilding. Where companies don’t hold title, heirs’ property disputes and clouded deeds make assembling parcels nearly impossible.
That’s why I’ve spent nearly a decade arguing for an Appalachian Homestead Act — and why the version we need now must do more than hand out parcels. This was my argument nine years ago: “A Homestead Act for Appalachia” in The Daily Yonder. I’ve recently updated the concept with more detail in a new Daily Yonder article: “A Revised Appalachian Homestead Act – Reclaiming Land and Restoring Hope.” 
 The act should combine two proven tools:

Community land trusts (CLTs) are nonprofits that hold land permanently for community benefit, leasing it for housing, farming and local businesses. CLTs keep housing affordable, ensure local control and prevent speculative resale. Tennessee’s Woodland CLT, created after the 1977 flood, has secured hundreds of acres for housing and community use.
Land banks  are public entities that acquire problem properties — tax-delinquent, abandoned or distressed — clear the title, and transfer them to CLTs or other community-controlled groups. Kentucky’s successful Louisville Landbank Authority demonstrates scalable models for rural applications.

Financing a modern Appalachian Homestead Act should begin with funds already on the table. The federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) has committed billions to environmental remediation, mine land reclamation, broadband expansion and resilient housing. Much of that money is flowing piecemeal through existing agencies, but a Homestead Act would braid those streams together, targeting them to high-ground relocation, land acquisition, and community land trusts.
 The Act wouldn’t require a wholly new appropriation so much as a coordinated strategy to direct IIJA funds, Appalachian Regional Commission investments, and USDA rural development programs toward a single end: putting safe, usable land back into community hands.
Private and philanthropic capital can multiply the impact. Foundations already funding climate adaptation, rural development, and land conservation could partner with land banks and community land trusts seeded by federal dollars. 
States could provide tax abatements and bond financing for infrastructure in high-ground communities. Local ownership of renewable energy projects on reclaimed mine lands can generate lease income that is recycled back into housing and job creation.
 In short, the Homestead Act’s financing rests on a federal spine of infrastructure funds, reinforced by state incentives and private capital, making it both feasible and scalable without requiring a massive new federal bureaucracy.
Linking cleanup to new uses
The biggest challenge to reusing former mine lands is environmental liability. Federal law allows “bona fide prospective purchasers” to acquire contaminated sites without becoming liable for the original pollution — but only if they follow strict cleanup and monitoring rules. A Homestead Act should fund that cleanup before land is transferred to communities, and pair it with environmental insurance for added security.
Once land is remediated and held in trust, it can become the base for a diversified local economy:

Sustainable agriculture to rebuild Eastern Kentucky’s historic orchards and vegetable production.
Renewable energy on reclaimed mine lands, generating lease income and skilled jobs.
Outdoor recreation on trust-owned trail networks that attract tourism without displacing locals.

Rebuilding in the same flood-prone hollows is not resilience; it’s roulette.  Much of the coal, timber and land company property in the mountains remains undisturbed with gorgeous vistas, clean water, and good land for agriculture, housing, and business ventures.  Will those companies sell?  It’s time to ask, checks in hand.  The original purpose of assembling the 1.3 million acres coal companies own in Eastern Kentucky — coal — has little or no future.
Kentucky can lead, but it needs help
The Appalachian Homestead Act I’m calling for would:

Fund and expand Kentucky’s land banks to acquire and clear safe, high-ground parcels.
Transfer those parcels to CLTs with strong community governance.
Provide relocation grants, tax abatements and broadband for homesteaders.
Link land reuse to job training in sustainable agriculture, renewable energy and cooperative business.

Skeptics may call such proposals unrealistic. But history offers precedent: Before the Tennessee Valley Authority became law in Franklin D. Roosevelt’s famous first 100 days of 1933, U.S. Sen. George Norris of Nebraska — who had no direct political stake in the TVA region — introduced or supported 19 different bills over 12 years to address flooding and navigation on the Tennessee River. Persistence paid off.
Why US should not abandon its debt to Appalachia

A 21st century Homestead Act offers compelling advantages for political leaders across the spectrum. For conservatives, it emphasizes individual responsibility, property ownership and free market solutions while reducing long-term government dependency. For progressives, it addresses inequality, environmental restoration and climate adaptation while empowering marginalized communities. Few things are more American than homesteading.  For those who insist the poverty wars and heavily diluted development funding for agencies like the ARC have done little to change the prospects for the region, a homestead act is a bold new vision from which to learn from past failures.
A chance to reverse the tide
For too long, Eastern Kentucky’s wealth — coal, timber, gas — has flowed out of the mountains while the damage stayed behind. Now, as climate change makes other regions hotter, drier and less livable, we have a chance to make our hills and hollows a place people come to, not leave. Over half of America’s fruits and vegetables are grown in California and trucked east at a time when the Colorado River is shrinking. That makes no sense when the mountains can prosper with traditional and vertical farming and plentiful water. For those who argue farming is impossible in the mountains, I suggest a visit to all the farmers markets in the region. To those who say farming on steep slopes is impossible, I suggest a trip to Asia where it is common.
If we don’t secure the land and put it in community hands, we’ll watch more floods take more homes and more young people take the road out.
A Homestead Act for Appalachia — starting in Kentucky — could turn safe ground into a foundation for a new economy. It could keep the young ones here, beckon “come home” to the mountain diaspora, welcome newcomers and rebuild communities that can survive the next hundred years, not just the next storm. Eastern Kentucky doesn’t need another study or another handout — it needs its land back, its voice restored, and partners willing to work as hard as mountain people do to build a future worthy of these hills

(Photo by Getty Images)Virginia’s long-delayed path toward a legal cannabis marketplace took another step forward Wednesday as the state’s new bipartisan commission convened for its second meeting at the Capitol, listening to hours of presentations on taxation, equity, and the role of small businesses in shaping what could become a billion-dollar industry.
The joint commission — created this year by lawmakers after Gov. Glenn Youngkin once again vetoed legislation establishing a retail system — is charged with building consensus around a plan to launch sales by 2026. On Wednesday, it heard from national experts, equity advocates, fiscal analysts, and small business owners whose livelihoods may hinge on the rules Virginia adopts.
The political stakes remain high in an election year when three statewide offices and all 100 seats in the House of Delegates are on the ballot.  
In a stark contrast to Youngkin, former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor, has already signaled she would sign cannabis retail legislation if it reaches her desk. 
“I support a legal marketplace for cannabis,” she told The Mercury in an interview earlier this month. “I want to ensure that it is fully regulated, people know what they’re buying, and revenues go towards education.”
 A stalled start

Virginia first made headlines in 2021 when lawmakers voted to legalize possession and home cultivation of small amounts of marijuana, making it the first Southern state to do so. But while residents can grow plants at home, retail sales were never authorized.
Lawmakers attempted to fix that earlier this year with a bipartisan proposal to create a regulated market starting in 2026, complete with microbusiness licenses, a seed-to-sale tracking system, and projected revenues of $87.8 million annually by 2031. 
The bill would have steered 40% of tax revenue to early childhood education, 30% to equity reinvestment, 25% to substance use treatment, and 5% to public health.
Youngkin vetoed the plan, warning it would endanger public safety and expose children to harm. He also struck down companion measures to expunge old marijuana convictions and shield parents from custody challenges based on legal cannabis use. Advocates blasted his vetoes as shortsighted.
In response, lawmakers created the Joint Commission on the Future of Cannabis Sales through House Joint Resolution 497 — a move that did not require the governor’s signature. The body will operate through 2028 as a venue for public input and legislative planning.
Its first meeting in July was mostly organizational. Wednesday’s session — its second — was the first chance to dig into the policy choices facing Virginia.
 Lessons from other states

Andrea Jimenez, a policy specialist with the National Conference of State Legislatures, opened the meeting with a survey of how 23 states have structured their cannabis markets. Taxation, she explained, varies widely — by percentage of price, product weight, or even potency.
Jimenez pointed to Maryland, which recently raised its marijuana tax from 9% to 12%, directing most revenue to the general fund and the Community Reinvestment and Repair Fund. Colorado, by contrast, splits its 15% excise and 15% sales taxes between schools, local governments, and general funds.
New York and Connecticut have experimented with potency-based taxes and earmarked large shares of revenue for equity programs. But even states with established markets have faced challenges.
“There’s just simply too much product for the amount of demand that exists,” Jimenez warned, noting falling marijuana prices in California, Colorado, and Michigan that have depressed  revenues.
 Reparative justice and fiscal trade-offs

Equity was a recurring theme throughout the meeting. Chelsea Higgs Wise, executive director of Marijuana Justice, reminded lawmakers that legalization in Virginia was driven not only by economics but by racial justice.
“In 2020, JLARC confirmed what many Virginians knew — that Black folks in Virginia were being arrested 3.5 times more and received marijuana convictions 3.9 times the rate of white Virginians,” Wise said, referring to a study by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee published that year.
That disproportionate enforcement inspired lawmakers to pass the 2021 law ending criminalization.
Wise urged the commission to uphold the commitments made then, including the Cannabis Equity Reinvestment Program and Loan Fund. 
“An adequate investment in a strategic rollout that considers these issues will give us the best chance that we have for a successful, long-term market,” she said.
Projected revenue under Virginia’s current framework — about $74 million to $94 million annually — could fund scholarships, workforce training, and community reinvestment. But Wise cautioned that opt-out referendums could allow localities to ban sales until 2026, weakening both revenues and equity goals.
Rodrigo Soto of The Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis offered a broader fiscal context. 
His group modeled how cannabis revenues stack up against other revenue options the legislature might consider in 2026, from income tax changes to corporate levies.
Creating a retail cannabis market could bring in about $61.5 million under the current bill, Soto said. But if taxed at 20% to 25%, as JLARC recommended, revenues could range from $122 million to $254 million annually by the market’s fifth year.
“The design choices really matter,” Soto told the panel. Distribution decisions — such as how much goes to pre-K, substance use programs, or public health — will ultimately shape the impact on Virginians.
 The small business dilemma

Perhaps the most passionate testimony came from small business owners who fear being shut out of the new market.
Barbara Biddle, founder of District Hemp Botanicals, recounted how her company grew from a $2,000 investment and a six-foot table into three storefronts and nearly $2 million in revenue. But after lawmakers passed a 2023 bill restricting hemp-derived products, she lost half her business overnight.
“The bill did far more than just outlaw Delta 8,” Biddle said, referring to Delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol, a psychoactive substance found in the cannabis sativa plant. “It knocked out 90% of the market, including non-intoxicating CBD products my customers came to rely on.”
Biddle warned the panel to avoid mistakes that favored large corporations at the expense of local entrepreneurs. 
“Doing so will not only promote safety, but also preserve fair competition and prevent consumers from bearing the burden of artificially high prices,” she said.
Her colleague, Eric Spanbauer of the East Coast Collective, echoed those concerns. 
“These are not faceless corporations,” he said. “They’re your neighbors, your local employers, and your community partners.”
Spanbauer urged the state to lower application fees, expand license caps, and offer micro-licenses and training for small operators. 
“If we repeat the same pattern, writing rules that only billion-dollar corporations can comply with, we risk destroying the very foundation of what could be a thriving, inclusive Virginia-based marijuana industry,” he said.
Wednesday’s presentations underscored the delicate balance facing lawmakers: generating revenue, ensuring equity, supporting small businesses, and satisfying a wary public.
Most Republicans, led by Youngkin, remain skeptical. The governor has consistently argued legalization will not eliminate the black market and could worsen youth drug use. His veto message earlier this year cited risks of “increased gang activity” and “adverse effects on children’s and adolescents’ health.”
Democrats, meanwhile, are betting the politics will shift with a new governor. Spanberger has leaned into her support for legalization, framing it as a matter of regulation and education funding. “Consumer knowledge, heavily regulated, heavily taxed, with revenues mostly going towards education,” she said in the interview with The Mercury.
The commission will continue meeting, with the goal of crafting legislation for introduction in 2026. Members stressed that public input and stakeholder testimony will guide the process.
For now, cannabis in the commonwealth remains in limbo: it’s legal to possess, illegal to buy.

(Photo by Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury) A new statewide survey finds housing one of Virginians’ top concerns — and that a strong majority want lawmakers to act on it. 
Most respondents said they support policies to make it easier to build more and smaller types of homes, reduce regulatory requirements, and push local governments to streamline home construction. 
Concerns over housing costs weren’t limited to urban or suburban areas. Half of rural respondents also expressed worry. Overall, 73% of those surveyed  agreed that the state lacks enough affordable homes to rent or buy.
The survey was conducted online last month by YouGov for the Commonwealth Housing Coalition, a consortium of housing nonprofits and advocacy groups. 
Laura Dobbs, policy director at Housing Opportunities Made Equal, said in an interview that the findings reinforce what some Virginia lawmakers have already tried to address in recent legislative sessions. 
Before answering housing-specific questions, respondents were asked about their top  concern. Thirty-seven percent listed housing costs,  followed by inflation and healthcare. 
Even among those who didn’t list housing as their top worry, 84% still agreed state lawmakers should address Virginia’s housing shortage and costs. 
Survey participants also weighed in on proposals that lawmakers have previously introduced, each earning at least 65% approval and less than 25% of opposition. 
Examples included laws to prevent landlords of older properties from raising rents beyond certain limits without upgrades; incentives to build apartments near business and shopping districts; allowing faith-based organizations to develop housing on their land; and efforts to encourage local governments to loosen zoning for more housing options. 
Some of those efforts failed this year but are expected to return. One example is a bipartisan proposal from Sens. Saddam Salim, D-Fairfax, and Bill Stanley, R- Franklin, to encourage local zoning that permits Accessory Dwelling Units — such as carriage houses or in-law suites. 
Meanwhile, the mixed-use developments in places like Libby Mill or Short Pump in Henrico County are the kind of model that Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico,wanted to replicate statewide in a failed bill. His proposal would have required localities to adopt by-right zoning for multifamily housing near commercial districts. 
Likewise, a proposal from Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, would have given the state authority to intervene  when local governments fail to act on affordable housing. VanValkenburg also had a version, but Helmer’s passed the House of Delegates before falling in the Senate. 
“We’ve been relying on localities to do this for long enough, and they just aren’t going far enough or not keeping up with the demand,” Dobbs said. 
She added that buy-in from survey respondents shows appetite for statewide action. 
Because Virginia is a Dillon Rule state, local governments only have the powers the state grants them. While that division of authority allows local tailoring of laws, it also creates tension. 
At the time, VanValkenburg described his bill as a “give and take” between preserving local control and addressing a statewide housing shortage.
Glenn Sturtevant, R-Chesterfield had cautioned it would be an “erosion” of local authority. 
Despite being at odds over that bill, both men had legislation this year to block large investment firms from buying properties in Virginia. Those bills failed this year, but Sturtevant discussed the issue with the Virginia Housing Commission this week. 
The goal is to prevent hedge funds and other large firms from out-bidding first-time homebuyers. He also noted how they purchase mobile home parks, which often leads to resident displacement. 
“This is only going after the biggest of the big entities,” Sturtevant told the commission Tuesday. “This totally protects your mom and pop landlords and small businesses.” 
Similar proposals have surfaced in Congress and other states, but Sturtevant wants Virginia to pursue its own version.  
He acknowledged the idea isn’t a “silver bullet” for the housing crisis but said it could address a troubling  trend. Axios reported earlier this year that 20% of Richmond’s apartments are owned by private equity firms. Some of his Chesterfield constituents, he added, have struggled to buy  their first home. 
“The last time Wall Street was using the housing market like a stock portfolio, we had the 2008 housing crisis,” he said. “Homes are for people.”
Dobbs noted that  even when such firms do rent out properties, tenants often find it harder to resolve maintenance issues. 
She emphasized that first-time buyers, including clients at HOME of Virginia, can’t compete with firms that can “drop cash” offers or skip inspections, adding that she’s “on board with Sturtevant that we should really do something about it.”
The housing commission, on which Dobbs serves, raised  questions about how such a bill would be enforced and suggested tweaking it ahead of the 2026 legislative session. 
Another area state lawmakers may consider for addressing housing supply and affordability is boosting the Virginia Housing Trust Fund.
An analysis by the Virginia Housing Alliance, presented to the Housing Commission, highlighted that  the fund has helped create more than 19,000 affordable units across the state and invested $66 million in homeless reduction grants. 
VHA Policy Director Isabel McLain noted that while Virginia is not among the states with the lowest level of investments in such funds, “we are definitely not leading the pack.”

(Photo by Charles Paullin/Inside Climate News)Bren Pointe residents in Fairfax County are closer to seeing steel transmission towers rise just outside their townhomes after Virginia’s regulators approved a new electricity line to serve a single planned commercial data center.
On Aug. 8, the State Corporation Commission (SCC), which regulates Virginia’s utilities, approved Dominion Energy’s request to erect the “Edsall Substation,” a short walk from the Bren Pointe community in Alexandria. The project includes eight 120-foot towers and 230-kilovolt charged cables to serve a lone 176-megawatt hyperscale data center in Northern Virginia.
Dominion mapping shows the substation as 100 feet—about the length of a basketball court—from Bren Pointe residents. The Bren Pointe Homeowners Association contends the towers and station will be 60 feet from some homes.
The developer of the data center is Starwood Capital, a private investment firm located in Miami. The data center is planned as a two-story 460,000-square-foot complex.
“The Commission finds that the public convenience and necessity requires the construction of the Project,” the three commissioners wrote in their decision. Dominion’s proposal aims for the Edsall project to be built by October 2027. The SCC held three hearings and received dozens of written comments, many critical of the project, since December 2024.
The proposed substation now will be reviewed by Fairfax County as part of its land use oversight process, expected to conclude between July 2026 and February 2027. In Virginia, the costs for infrastructure improvements from utilities are all recovered from ratepayers. The Fairfax County project, one of about 200 transmission projects that Dominion plans over the next 15 years, is estimated to cost about $23 million.
The Edsall proposal drew attention from policymakers as a chapter in the nationwide saga on the development of data centers, the warehouse-like facilities that shelter artificial intelligence and internet computer processors. Virginia is home to the largest concentration of data centers in the world, and industry demand for electricity is forecast to triple through 2040, barring constraints or delays to build new transmission lines, according to a state research commission that advises regulators.

The Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) issued a report in December 2024 about the data industry’s development—about the same time that the data center near Bren Pointe moved ahead. The data center proposal was in line with existing zoning ordinances at the time and did not require public hearings or planning commission review. The county has since instituted stricter ordinances and reviews.
Overall, the JLARC report found, “the data center industry is estimated to contribute 74,000 jobs, $5.5 billion in labor income, and $9.1 billion in GDP to Virginia’s economy annually.” It also raised some concerns that “data centers’ increased energy demand will likely increase system costs for all customers, including non-data center customers.” The report also found that the “industrial scale of data centers makes them largely incompatible with residential uses.”
Notably, the report provided a map of the proposed data center in Fairfax County and specifically said the planned center was “too close” to the residential area known as Bren Mar. The Bren Pointe community is part of the Bren Mar neighborhood.
Residents of Bren Pointe pointed to the JLARC’s report to bolster their efforts to stop the Edsall substation.
Residents said they were dismayed by the SCC decision. In public hearings and written submissions, they said the transmission lines and substation were closer to their homes than Dominion had admitted and that electricity demand from the proposed data center would likely increase their home electric bills. Bren Pointe, with about 100 townhomes, is located near Alexandria’s Old Town as well as Reagan National Airport.

Homeowners also asked in their pleadings: Who would pay for upgrades to the grid? Who should bear the cost of increasing electricity demands from the center?
“In our mind, it makes it even more important for the General Assembly of Virginia to really take action,” Tyler Ray, president of the Bren Pointe Homeowners Association, which includes residents of the community west of Landmark Mall and off of Edsall Road, said in an interview. “It’s clear under the current statute that residents are at risk.”
Ray said he wants the county to deny the land use request as not being consistent with the locality’s comprehensive plan.
Ray’s group argued Dominion could adjust its plan with alternatives including, broader use of the existing Van Dorn power substation in Fairfax County or constructing the high-powered cables underground. Dominion rejected the homeowners’ proposal as costly.
The homeowners’ association also raised a legal point over potential rate hikes: it said that a provision in the state code that obligates a utility’s “duty to serve” shouldn’t outweigh harm to residents in this case. That duty, Ray said, comes with a need for “reasonable and just rates to any person,” and should not be interpreted to allow a rate adjustment for a community that does not need the transmission line and is certain to see electricity grid demands rise.
Any enterprise that wants a new transmission line should take on the costs for grid upgrades, Ray said, because that would help to mitigate the harm to residents.
The commission rejected Ray’s arguments. The case was about a request for a transmission line, the commission ordered, and “the project as approved herein meets the statutory standards.” The commission added that the case was not about “the duty to serve.”
The commission said it was not the proper venue, with this particular Dominion proposal, for a review of cost allocations. However, Commissioner Kelsey Bagot, in a separate statement within the SCC decision, noted that she wanted to address that “800-pound gorilla” question of “who pays?”
“I believe the time is ripe for a thorough examination of the prevailing approach to transmission cost allocation,” Bagot said. Bagot agreed with SCC’s decision to approve the Edsall substation.
Dominion, which provides electricity to 3.6 million homes and businesses in Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina, faces a separate broader rate review with regulators that seeks to assign more costs to the data center industry. The SCC has scheduled a hearing for Sept. 2.
The SCC recently approved a $2.10 monthly bill increase for Dominion customers to cover existing and new transmission services, and upgrades through the regional grid operator PJM Interconnection.
New transmission infrastructure can improve reliability and help to add renewable energy sources to the grid by allowing more hookups in circuit areas.
Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who has repeatedly vetoed clean energy policy while supporting data center development over siting protections, said last week that clean technology “puts a strain” on the grid. He also said that upgrade needs are “not just driven by data centers.”
“The data center community has said loud and clear, ‘We will pay our way,’” Youngkin said, responding to questions after an unrelated budget presentation in Richmond. “They are willing to pay for the transmission extensions, they are willing to pay for the power generation footprint,” and have their own power generation for use.

Critics of the data center industry have raised concerns about rising commercial demands and the effect that data center growth will have on communities.
Over the past couple of months, Amazon withdrew a proposal for data centers near one of Dominion’s traditional nuclear plants in Louisa County in Central Virginia, and a judge revoked the rezoning of land for the Prince William Digital Gateway, a planned development that would have created 37 data centers on 1,700 acres near Manassas National Battlefield Park.
Prince William County Circuit Court Judge Kimberly Irving ruled earlier this month in favor of the Oak Valley Homeowners’ Association and other homeowners and found that the Prince William Board of County Supervisors’ decision to rezone the acreage was “void” because the board failed to comply with state and local notice requirements.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)As some Ohio women’s health facilities square with federal budget cuts and a new effort to cut funds at the state level, anti-abortion pregnancy resource centers are receiving million in state grants.
Even in a state with a constitutional amendment that protects the right to abortion, the difference between the facilities receiving boosts in funding and those facing further cuts is largely their stance on abortion.
A new Ohio bill introduced by Republican state Reps. Jean Schmidt and Adam Mathews seeks to bar Medicaid funds from going to any entities that provide abortion other than when the abortion is a result of rape or incest, or when the life of the pregnant person is endangered.
The bill bases its language on the federal budget reconciliation bill passed and signed into law by President Donald Trump in July.
The federal budget language was criticized for specifically impacting Planned Parenthood, which could lose hundreds of facilities if the loss of funding, on top of other budget cuts, goes through.
The national Planned Parenthood Federation of America is suing to stop the cuts from being enforced. A federal judge temporarily stopped the cuts in July as the lawsuit continues.
Meanwhile, Gov. Mike DeWine and Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel announced nearly $20 million in grants over the next two years, distributed through the Ohio Parenting and Pregnancy Program. The grants were announced as funding boosts to help improve Ohio’s infant health outcomes.
The awards were provided to entities for “prenatal education, parenting classes, case management, referrals and material assistance tailored to the needs of their local communities.”
“These efforts are part of the DeWine-Tressel Administration’s broader mission to reduce infant mortality and ensure every child in Ohio has the opportunity to live up to their God-given potential,” a release on the grant funding stated.
Ohio budget makes abortion reporting changes and reductions in infant, maternal funding

The grant program is distributed by the Ohio Department of Children and Youth, which saw its own cuts in the most recent state operating budget, including millions of dollars cut from line items for “infant vitality.”
The state department reported an infant mortality rate of 6.5 per 1,000 live births in 2024, a slight decrease from the year before.
The annual March of Dimes Report Card for 2024 noted the decrease, but still gave Ohio a D+ for its preterm birth rate, ranking the state 32nd in the country. The report card also noted the infant mortality rate for Black individuals was 1.9 times higher than the overall state rate.
Among the 21 recipients of the grantees are several religiously affiliated groups, including Heartbeat of Lima County, Inc., Elizabeth’s New Life Center, Inc., and the Family Life Center of Auglaize County.
Grant recipients also included several pregnancy resource centers, a sector of services that are controversial and criticized for not being required to have the same medical license requirements as facilities like Planned Parenthood, and for providing medically debunked and inaccurate information to patients.
‘Crisis Pregnancy Centers’ stack deck against abortion clinics, do so with state support

The application details for the grants  noted that the awards would only go to entities who promote “childbirth, parenting and alternatives to abortion.”
State law establishing the Ohio Parenting and Pregnancy Program further specifies entities supported by the program can not be “involved in or associated with any abortion activities, including providing abortion counseling or referrals to abortion clinics, performing abortion-related medical procedures or engaging in pro-abortion advertising.”
 Funding future
In the federal budget bill, the women’s health clinic funding prohibition targeted at abortion providers lasts for one year, but leaders of Ohio clinics say the state measure could mean more longterm cuts.
The state-level Medicaid ban being proposed by conservative, anti-abortion legislators, along with federal-level cuts, would cut funds that don’t go toward abortion services in the first place.
“By introducing all of these bills to cut Planned Parenthood out of Medicaid, it does not impact abortion at all, it impacts every other service that keeps people healthy,” said Erica Wilson-Domer, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio.
Wilson-Domer said more than 40% of her affiliate’s patients are covered by Medicaid, and the “vast majority” of the services provided to those patients are office services. Those services include well visits, contraception services and infection checks, among other non-abortion care.
Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio has already announced staffing reductions after “mounting attacks from the Trump administration, including the loss of Title X funding and Medicaid defunding through the federal reconciliation bill.”
In announcing the reduction in force, the greater Ohio affiliate said the federal funding losses represent a $10 million drop in annual funds.
“Without a reduction in force, PPGOH could cease to exist, leaving over 50,000 patients without access to birth control, gender affirming care, abortion and a myriad of other essential health care services,” Wilson-Domer said in the announcement on Aug. 4.
Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region also announced changes because of federal funding cuts, including the closure of a clinic in Springfield and another in Hamilton. Neither of the closed facilities provided abortion services.
Ohio Planned Parenthoods will remain closed, despite federal success in ongoing lawsuit

Wilson-Domer and her fellow Planned Parenthood affiliate leader Nan Whaley in Southwest Ohio both said federal funds have never paid for abortion services. But the services they do provide to low-income and underinsured patients make them “uniquely positioned to have a better impact on maternal and infant mortality,” Wilson-Domer said.
“To take us out of Medicaid is just completely taking away any women’s health care options for those communities, and it will completely exacerbate this crisis,” Wilson-Domer said.
Republicans who sponsor and support anti-abortion measures are missing the point of the care, and taking away other services while they attempt to stifle abortion services, according to abortion rights advocates in Ohio.
“Our policies are not promotion of abortion, our policy is to make sure every person has bodily autonomy,” Wilson-Domer said. “We will do what we need to do to help you with whatever decision you’ve made.”
Abortion rights advocacy group Abortion Forward said budget cuts on the state and federal level don’t show the prioritization of children, and in fact could create more infant and maternal mortality problems.
The group’s deputy director, Jaime Miracle, said the state’s time would be better spent supporting all facilities who are working to address the problem, rather than cutting them down.
“These actions speak louder than his words when (DeWine) continues to fund unproven, deceptive programs instead of real providers with a track record of success,” Miracle told the Capital Journal. “To really help families in our state, Ohio must invest in improvements to prenatal care, home visiting programs with a proven track record of success, and respect and support people seeking abortion care.”

Authorities in the West African nation threw him in prison because of his sexual orientation, he said. After his release, he feared that if he stayed in the country, he would be killed.
B., who is now 39 and who asked that he be identified only by his initial because he still has family in Cameroon, arrived in the United States with practically nothing. Since he was granted asylum last year, he has been able to use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, to help him get by.
But now most refugees and asylees, who entered the country legally, including B., are no longer eligible for food stamps. The change is part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the giant federal domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4.
“I think it’s unfair. I understand that there are some people who abuse the system,” B. told Stateline. “There are also people who are in need. And cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.”
SNAP, which is funded by the federal government but administered by the states, helps families and individuals with lower incomes supplement their grocery budgets. The program serves an average of 42 million people a month.
New work rules could deny food stamps to thousands of veterans

Supporters of the change note that refugees and asylees can get permits to work, and that they have other sources of support.
“It’s not like they have been dropped off in this country with no support system,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that backs stricter immigration rules.
“They have sponsoring organizations that are helping them get settled and they have work authorization. So they really should be moving forward towards self-sufficiency with support right out of the starting gate. And they should be moving ahead to obtain green cards,” she added, referring to the cards that signify permanent residency.
Vaughan cited a federal grant program that reimburses states and nonprofit organizations for financial aid and health care coverage they provide to refugees.
But critics argue that asylees and refugees, who are extensively vetted and have a legitimate path to citizenship, can wait years for a green card, which entitles them to a wider array of benefits.
They also say community organizations that provide aid to asylees and refugees are stretched thin. Without food stamps, they say, many refugees and their families would not have enough to eat.











Cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.


– B., a Cameroonian asylee



“SNAP is an incredibly fundamental program for this population that comes to the United States, really, with very little, if anything,” said Nicolas Palazzo, a policy counsel at the global humanitarian and refugee advocacy organization HIAS. “These are people who literally had to flee — many times overnight — with nothing, but, you know, a pair of clothes in a backpack.”
Palazzo also said SNAP is not a “handout” to refugees or asylees. Rather, he said, it’s a “smart and moral investment” that protects all communities and strengthens the economy, offering people a foundation for self-sufficiency.
“Stripping critical food assistance forces refugees and asylees into the shadows of informal work, labor exploitation and hunger that weakens our workforce and denigrates our moral obligations,” Palazzo said.
‘Nowhere else to go’
B. said he applied immediately for asylum when he arrived in the U.S. in 2016, but that he had to wait months for a work permit. He survived by doing odd jobs, such as cleaning homes and delivering food, and got by on very little. It wasn’t until late 2024, when he finally won his asylum case, that he was eligible to get any public benefits, including food stamps.
Eligibility for food stamps came at a critical time for B., as a car accident had prevented him from making food deliveries.
“While not having income, it was very helpful,” B. said. “I’m somebody who if I can work, I will work. The only reason I went over there to ask is because I had nowhere else to go.”
According to a November 2024 report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, a total of 60,050 people were newly admitted to the United States as refugees in 2023, many from unstable countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Syria and Afghanistan.
In 2023, the nation received at least 747,000 applications for people seeking asylum from countries including Venezuela, Cuba and Colombia, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration research group. It’s a tremendous increase from the 68,000 applications received in 2013.
The new domestic policy law specifies that food stamps are still available to Cubans and Haitians who might be refugees and asylees.

As of July 2025, more than 2.2 million immigrants in the U.S. are awaiting asylum hearings or decisions after formally applying for asylum, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, an organization at Syracuse University that tracks immigration cases.
“Getting through the system was difficult,” B. said. “I had to find money. I had to find an attorney who would help me apply for my asylum case. The asylum case itself took a long time.
“I still know people who have been here for more than 10 years and never had an interview.”
‘Already stretched’
According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, half of all admitted refugees in 2023 were resettled across just 10 states: Texas, New York, California, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan and Washington.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 41,000 people in the state are getting SNAP benefits while not being lawful permanent residents. She says that group includes refugees and asylees.
“The concerning part there is that these are individuals who were … lawfully admitted to the country, have previously been eligible for SNAP when they need it, and now, simply because of their status, will no longer be able to receive SNAP benefits,” Guinn told Stateline. “There’s nothing we’re going to be able to do to make them eligible.”
Another change under the new law is that for the first time, states will have to pay for a portion of their food stamp programs. States will have to cover between 5% and 15% of their SNAP costs beginning in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they dole out benefits to people eligible for the program.
Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, pointed out that states that want to continue to provide SNAP benefits to refugees and asylees are free to do so — as long as they pay for it.
“If New York state doesn’t want to cut these people off, they can continue to give them something like food stamps. They just have to do it with New York state money right now,” Rector said.
GOP cuts to food assistance would hit rural America especially hard

But Guinn said that will be difficult. New York does offer asylum-seekers cash assistance of $180 a month through its Safety Net Assistance Program, but typically recipients must be working.
In Texas, officials at the state’s health and human services agency said that as of last month, roughly 24,600 of the state’s 3.5 million SNAP recipients were refugees or asylees. A spokesperson for Maryland’s human services agency wrote in an email that the state’s SNAP program last year supported more than 10,000 refugees and asylees.
The California Department of Social Services could not provide the number of refugees and asylees receiving food stamps, but projected that a total of 74,000 noncitizens — including lawfully permanent residents, refugees and asylees — would lose eligibility under the new law.
Sherri Laigle, the director of social services at HIAS, said food banks will not be able to make up for refugees’ and asylees’ loss of SNAP benefits.
“They’re already stretched, and now we’re going to see tens of thousands of people also needing to continue to rely on these programs. Of course, there’s limited access to them. You have to have transportation. You have to be able to get there.”
B. said he would apply for food stamps again if he could, because he’s earning too little income to get by.
“There are people who are in need. I think ignoring that — it’s not human.”

Among other […],"(Getty Images)Plaintiffs in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Arkansas’ LEARNS Act argued in federal court filings this week that they have standing in the case and asked a judge to reject a motion to dismiss the suit.
The LEARNS Act is a 2023 law that made sweeping changes to Arkansas’ K-12 education system. Among other things, the law raised the state’s minimum teacher salary to $50,000 and created a school voucher program called the Educational Freedom Account program, which allows state funds to be used for allowable education expenses such as private school tuition. 
In a lawsuit filed June 13 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, four parents and legal guardians of public school children argue the EFA program violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment because “it aids in the establishment of religions” by providing state funding to private schools operated by religious organizations. 
The program also violates the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it discriminates against low-income families who cannot afford private school costs, families in rural areas where there are fewer private schools and students with disabilities because private schools are exempt from the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, according to the complaint. The program is also discriminatory because private schools are not held to the same standards as public schools, the complaint states. 
Additionally, the plaintiffs argue the EFA program violates the Arkansas Constitution because it requires taxpayers to contribute to religious private schools. The complaint asks the court to declare the EFA program unconstitutional and issue an injunction blocking its implementation.
Lawsuit challenges constitutionality of Arkansas school voucher program

Plaintiffs in the case, Gwen Faulkenberry, Special Renee Sanders, Anika Whitfield and Kimberly Crutchfield, are also plaintiffs in a separate but similar lawsuit filed last summer in Pulaski County Circuit Court. 
Defendants in the federal case include the Arkansas Department of Education, Education Secretary Jacob Oliva, the Arkansas State Board of Education, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration and DFA Secretary Jim Hudson. 
The Arkansas attorney general’s office on July 28 filed a motion to dismiss the case, arguing that plaintiffs lacked standing and failed to state claims. The AG’s office also argued that plaintiffs’ claims against the governor should be dismissed because of sovereign immunity, a legal doctrine that the state cannot be sued in its own courts. 
In a brief in support of the motion to dismiss, Attorney General Tim Griffin argues that plaintiffs fail to allege an injury for their equal protection claim because they don’t state they are “able and ready” to apply for the program if it weren’t for the alleged discriminatory policy. 
The plaintiffs lack standing, Griffin asserts, because the alleged injury of not having a private school in their community, being unable to gain admission to that private school or being unable to afford the tuition would be traceable to school owners and not the defendants.
Griffin also argues that “Plaintiffs do not understand what the federal Establishment Clause prohibits,” noting that parents direct state funds to pay for private-school tuition, homeschooling and other expenses. 
“Yet they believe that because some parents decide to direct those funds to religious schools (of all stripes), the LEARNS Act furthers a religious purpose, ‘fosters an excessive government entanglement with religion,’ and violates the Establishment Clause,” Griffin writes. 
Additionally, Griffin states that plaintiffs disregard a “long line of Supreme Court cases” holding that private individuals directing government funds to religious institutions doesn’t violate the Establishment Clause. 
The attorney general also rejected the plaintiffs’ claims that the EFA program violates the Arkansas Constitution by directing state funds to private schools because the money can go to religious schools tied to a variety of denominations as well as secular schools.

Plaintiffs argue in their response brief filed Monday that they do not lack standing because they are parents of children attending public schools and taxpayers whose taxes contribute to the EFA program that is the subject of the lawsuit. 
They rebut the state’s contention that the plaintiffs have not suffered injury, noting that Special Renee Sanders is the mother of a student with a disability who would be reluctant to apply for the EFA program because it requires her to waive the rights she and her child have under the federal IDEA law. 
“Therefore, states are offering an educational program that has unequal access for students with disabilities, raising constitutional concerns when access is not impeded in the same way for students without disabilities,” the brief states. 
The plaintiffs call parents’ ability to direct the EFA funding to a chosen school “a misguided attempt to circumvent the restrictions in the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and Article 2, Section 24 of the Arkansas Constitution.” 
Because the majority of the schools participating in the program are religious, plaintiffs argue “it is impossible to separate the benefit to the sectarian school from the benefit to the student, and that those schools — not the students, who are merely instruments in enabling the schools to obtain the money — are the primary beneficiaries of the LEARNS Act Voucher Program.”
Plaintiffs called on the court to deny the motion to dismiss on all counts, and issue a scheduling order that allows “reasonable time for discovery, motions and a final hearing.”

Gov Burt Jones speaks with voters at a Butts County campaign event for Congressman Mike Collins. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderDo you believe in democracy, or do you believe in Donald Trump?
That’s the question you’ll have to ask yourself when you go into the voting booth to elect Georgia’s next governor.
If you’re a true believer in Donald Trump, if you see him as The Man Sent By God Himself to rescue America from the clutches of evil, then the candidate that you want as the next governor of Georgia is Lt. Gov. Burt Jones.
For everyone else, maybe not so much.
Had Jones been our governor during the election crisis of 2020, when Trump lost the election here in Georgia, the General Assembly would have been called into emergency session to overturn those results. If Jones had gotten his way, if he held the power then that he seeks today, the votes of almost 5 million Georgia voters might have been tossed aside as meaningless, and 235 years of self-government would have been ended by those who believe that they know better than the people.
Back then, Jones was a lowly state senator with high ambitions. His demand for a special session was ignored by wiser, more thoughtful Georgia leaders who understood that it would lead to the unraveling of the American system of government, and who figured that was too high a price to pay. 
So, foiled in his demand for a special session, Jones tried other courses of action. He tried to join a lawsuit filed by the state of Texas, which alleged that his home state of Georgia was too incompetent and corrupt to be trusted to run an election, and demanded that the U.S. Supreme Court strip Georgia of its electoral votes. 
The amicus brief submitted to the high court by Jones and others on behalf of Texas, and in betrayal of Georgia, made a variety of claims so ridiculous as to be absurd. Among other things, it alleged that 66,247 kids under 18 had been allowed to vote in Georgia, and that somehow thousands of others had voted without ever having registered. There was never any proof of those allegations, and remains so now.
When the Supreme Court refused to hear the Texas case, Jones and his co-conspirators then led a third effort, claiming themselves to be the true and rightful electors for the state of Georgia and pressuring Vice President Mike Pence and the Republican-controlled Congress to overthrow the millions of votes cast by Jones’ fellow Georgians. That effort contributed directly to the tragedy that was January 6.
In the upcoming campaign, Jones won’t remind voters that he believed that re-installing Trump as president was more important than preserving American democracy. That’s in part because he doesn’t want to remind general election voters of his role in that debacle, and in part because GOP primary voters need no such reminders. Trump’s recent endorsement of his campaign has already checked that box nicely. 
Jones’ only announced opponent in the GOP primary, Chris Carr, also won’t make it an issue. As attorney general, Carr was one of those state leaders who understood what was really at stake in 2020, and who worked to frustrate that attack on our democracy. For example, Carr strongly opposed the effort by Texas to nullify the election here in Georgia, arguing to the Supreme Court that “The novel and far-reaching claims that Texas asserts, and the breathtaking remedies it seeks, are impossible to ground in legal principles and unmanageable.”
Carr’s actions were honorable and correct, but bragging about taking an honorable and correct stance in defense of democracy, but in defiance of Trump, is not exactly a winning strategy in a Republican primary these days. 
The same would be true for a potential third candidate in the GOP gubernatorial primary. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger played a crucial role in ensuring that the decision of Georgia voters was respected in 2020, even if he personally disagreed with that choice. Should Raffensperger announce what would be a doomed run for governor, he and Carr would split whatever Trump-skeptic vote remains in the Georgia GOP, clearing the way for Jones to win the nomination.
That primary is scheduled for May 19, and I expect the months between now and then to be a stern test of the American voters’ tolerance for chaos on a scale that we have not yet experienced.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)A new law seeks to expand the rights of the terminally ill to receive experimental treatments and to make New Hampshire a destination for biomedical researchers.
Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed House Bill 701 into law during a ceremony Wednesday, which expands the previously enacted Right To Try Act. The original law is based on a legal framework that has been enacted in 41 states and federally in 2018, according to the Goldwater Institute, an Arizona-based think tank that pushed the legislation. It allows patients with terminal illnesses to undergo treatments that have completed the first phase of clinical trials but are not yet approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
The newly expanded law in New Hampshire goes even further.
It allows patients who have life-threatening illnesses that FDA-approved medicine is unable to treat effectively to consent to having their ability to sue limited. The idea is that the fear of malpractice and civil lawsuits make manufacturers and care providers too wary to provide experimental treatments. Proponents say patients will have access to more treatments if they waive their rights to sue. However, some critics opposed giving pharmaceutical companies special exemptions and argued providers were not allowing access to treatments for financial reasons, not fear of liability.
The law also makes New Hampshire the first state, lawmakers said, to allow patients and doctors present in the state to conduct a remote prescreening via telehealth. It also allows patients to sign consent forms remotely.
Patients and providers will also be allowed to seek injunctive relief from a court for these treatments under the law. That means patients and providers can ask a court before they undergo treatment to prevent future litigation over the treatment. Proponents say the current system, where providers can invoke the Right to Try Act to defend themselves in court only after performing the treatment, makes providers too fearful to take on the risk of treatment.
At the ceremony Wednesday, people with terminal illnesses and family members of people with terminal illnesses came to celebrate the signing.
“This is going to allow people to get the treatment they need,” John Lewicke, a former state representative who testified in favor of the bill this year as a private citizen, said Wednesday. “And unfortunately I’m one of them.”
Lewicke had previously told state lawmakers he was diagnosed with an incurable disease four years prior.
“All they had to offer was palliative care,” he told a Senate committee in April. “I’m here four years later because I was willing to take risks.”
Lewicke said he underwent an unapproved treatment at an ICU two years ago.
“I thought I had a 25% chance of dying,” he said. “My daughter, who is an MD, said it was closer to 50%. However, I’m here and quite healthy presently as a result of doing things that were outside of the norm.”
Lewicke was able to receive this care because of the original Right To Try Act. He said he would’ve been able to try many more treatments if he could find willing providers. This new law is designed to foster that.
“I’m not risk averse,” he said. “I’m willing to take a chance if it has a potential high rate of return.”
On Wednesday, Ayotte argued the law is necessary: “Unfortunately, the way it works is that with the FDA — just the time it takes to get life-saving or new treatments done on the drug or even a medical device — it takes too long if you’re facing a life-threatening disease. And time is not on their side, and so we should give people the choice and the decision in consultation with their doctors to have access to treatments that you know are getting results. It’s just that they haven’t gotten through the full trial process of the FDA.”
Lawmakers and Ayotte hope the bill will attract the biomedical industry to New Hampshire by creating a more friendly regulatory environment.
“Please, if you’re working on a life-saving therapy, if you’re working on a life-saving medical device, come here,” Ayotte said. “Come here to New Hampshire.”
Lisa Mazur, who sponsored the bill, said Wednesday she did it for a friend and former colleague, Michael Yakubovich, who has stage-four cancer with a 5% five-year survival rate. Yakubovich was unable to come Wednesday because he was ill, but his wife attended the ceremony.
“Her husband, the honorable Michael Yakubovich,” Mazur said. “He’s on a hard journey, but he was at every hearing for this bill, and he is a huge proponent of it. And if this were in place already, he’d be getting the treatment that he needs. So this is just huge for him, and I know he’s watching.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ayottesigning-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-21 05:56:47.100576
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-21 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT’s coffers are swelling, but towns are feeling the pinch",Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/21/ct-municipal-aid/,"Once inflation is taken into account, Connecticut municipalities are down almost $370 million, or 10%, in state funding since 2016.","With Connecticut’s new fiscal year less than two months old and state aid beginning to pour into cities and towns, local leaders are learning that dollars from the Capitol don’t buy as much as they once did.
The $3.2 billion in major statutory grants Connecticut will award this year, at first glance, is up a modest 21% from where they stood in 2016, the last year before lawmakers adopted a series of budget caps that have siphoned billions of dollars away from core programs.
But inflation has grown one-and-a-half times that pace, and once inflation is taken into account, municipalities are down almost $370 million, or 10%.
Even the state’s $221 million special education grant program, which received a $40 million bump last fiscal year and $30 million this year, is down $48 million from 2016 levels, based on inflation. And local school districts, though grateful for the extra funds, say they still face a gap in special education costs versus resources.
While legislators and Gov. Ned Lamont give with one hand — say, boosting grants for K-12 education — they take with the other, depriving one out of four communities its share of gaming revenues from tribal casinos.
The pressure to trim municipal aid is growing, with new federal budget cuts expected to cost Connecticut hundreds of millions annually and with billions of dollars in emergency pandemic aid nearly exhausted.
Legislators must soon decide whether to maintain savings programs that continue to generate historic surpluses or scale back and allow more dollars to trickle back to their home districts.
As cities and towns increasingly boost property taxes or watch property revaluations shift greater burdens from businesses to homeowners, legislators tout their accomplishments very selectively, said Joe DeLong, executive director of the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities.
CCM: ‘The gimmickry they do to get around the spending cap’
When legislators hear constituents complain about rising local property taxes, it’s easy to say, “That was the mayors. We’re still looking good over here, holding the line” with state income and sales taxes, DeLong said. “It’s all part of the gimmickry they do to get around the spending cap.”
Lawmakers will hail overall growth in town aid without mentioning how many communities lost out, he noted.
For example, the 1993 legislature dedicated most of Connecticut’s share of tribal casino revenues — about $88 million out of $113 million — to cities and towns. By 2002, the local share had risen to $135 million. Funds were distributed based partly on wealth and partly on how much tax-exempt property was within a community, but every community got something.
By 2013, municipalities were sharing just $62 million in casino revenues as state government fell on hard times.
And since the budget controls were adopted in 2017, $62 million has fallen to $52.5 million — but only 124 out of 169 towns share the funds.
Some of the towns that lost casino funds, like Westport and Greenwich in Fairfield County, are among Connecticut’s wealthiest. Others, such as Tolland and South Windsor — rural farm communities in northeastern and north-central Connecticut — are not. They simply lack an overabundance of tax-exempt property, one of the criteria set for distributing casino revenues decades ago.
“These are not towns don’t have a lot of resources to draw on when they’re faced with cuts,” said Betsy Gara, executive director of the Connecticut Council of Small Towns. “It doesn’t seem to make a lot of sense.”
The cutbacks in casino revenue sharing were taking place at the same time legislators were committing to a major expansion of the Education Cost Sharing system, the single-largest operating grant awarded local school districts.
Aid to cities and towns would be even more limited now if Lamont and the General Assembly hadn’t become more willing to use the state’s credit card.
Connecticut borrowed about $145 million nine years ago, chiefly to fund grants that support basic road maintenance and small-scale capital projects and equipment purchases. That borrowing now stands at $275 million.
Ultimately, it means state taxpayers must cover tens of millions of dollars of interest on a year’s worth of local aid.
State’s coffers swell as locals plead for more aid
At the same time towns say grants from the Capitol have been shrinking, the state’s coffers have swelled to record proportions.
Aggressive spending controls have generated more than $12 billion in budget surpluses since 2017. The annual average has been about $1.8 billion, which represents 8% of the General Fund.
And for the fiscal year that just ended June 30, the estimated black ink approaches $2.5 billion, or almost 11%.
Critics say these aren’t nonessential “surplus” dollars but represent hundreds of millions drained from municipal aid, education, health care, social services and other core programs to accelerate paying down Connecticut’s massive pension debt.
The state has dedicated $8.6 billion in surplus toward that effort since 2020, and most of the $2.5 billion windfall from last fiscal year will go toward pension debt as well.
But Connecticut’s pension debt, which stood at $35 billion entering last fiscal year, was amassed over more than seven decades prior to 2011. And even with the extra spending, analysts project the unfunded liability won’t be wiped out until the mid-2040s.
In other words, critics say, this pace will do great damage to cities and towns, and to many state programs, long before it pension debt is wiped out 20 years from now.
Lamont and legislators were able to mask the pain of this savings program between 2021 and 2025 thanks to billions of dollars in emergency pandemic grants from Washington. Those dollars could be used, outside of budget cap rules, to bolster various programs that lost more traditional state funds due to savings programs.
But that aid largely was exhausted last fiscal year, and President Donald Trump and Congress have ordered cuts expected to shrink Medicaid and other federal funding for Connecticut by hundreds of millions of dollars annually.
Osten: The problem can be fixed
The co-chairwoman of the legislature’s Appropriations Committee, Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, says there’s an easy solution, and it doesn’t involve raising state taxes.
“What we took away from the towns, we now have a capacity to replenish,” she said.
Rather than insisting on saving close to an average of $2 billion per year, and channeling those funds into the pensions, Connecticut could agree to save less at the state level, share more with towns, and help ease local property tax rates, she said.
Osten, who district includes many southeastern Connecticut communities near the Foxwoods Resorts and Mohegan Sun casinos, says many of her towns receive less gaming revenues than they did in 2017.
“I see this as an inequity,” she said. “We took money away from the towns when we were having hard fiscal times. And we say to them, ‘We don’t understand why you’re having a hard time’?”
CCM launched an ad campaign last March attacking Lamont, one of the chief defenders of the current package of state budget controls, arguing it effectively has shifted hundreds of millions of dollars in state tax burdens onto municipal budgets.
Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney of New Haven says it’s unfortunate when grants to any community are eliminated or don’t keep pace with inflation. But if aid must be cut because officials won’t allow more spending, then it is better to take from wealthy communities than from poor ones.
Looney, a progressive Democrat, has lobbied throughout his career for a more graduated state income tax system that imposes higher rates on Connecticut’s wealthiest households. He also favors restoring a pre-2017 spending cap rule that exempts aid to the poorest communities from cap limits.
Moderate Democrats, including Lamont, and nearly all Republicans in the legislature’s minority have opposed major changes to budget caps and to a more progressive income tax system. Looney notes CCM also has pushed for more aid but not for fairer income tax rates.
“What we’ve heard is, ‘Give us more [town aid]. Take it away from someone else,’” Looney said.
Could CT boost town aid by trimming spending elsewhere?
But others counter that both municipalities and state government need to do a better job trimming spending.
If towns were to regionalize services more, they might be able to survive with fewer grant dollars as the state tries to pay off its huge legacy pension debt.
“Gov. Lamont has introduced legislation to enable regional collective bargaining and continues to encourage towns to collaborate and, where appropriate, share services to bring down costs and save taxpayers money,” said Chris Collibee, the governor’s budget spokesman.
DeLong says towns have tried to do so but cannot make much progress because Lamont and the Democratic-controlled legislature are reluctant to ease collective bargaining rules to make such mergers cost-efficient.
Republican legislative leaders say before there are any talks of raising state taxes or easing budget controls, state officials first must try to cut costs in other areas and re-direct those dollars to cities and towns.
In recent years, House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, has pushed for lawmakers to explore cuts to Medicaid, higher education, transportation, and raises and overtime for state employees.
Democrats, Candelora said, only want to discuss impending cuts in federal aid, with no talk of reducing a state budget that exceeds $27 billion per year.
“You can’t keep overspending and talking about the pressures on the horizon,” he said.
Rep. Tammy Nuccio of Tolland, ranking House Republican on the Appropriations Committee, said lawmakers need to reconsider millions of dollars of “earmarks,” small pools of nondescript funds in the budget for pet projects in majority Democrats’ home districts.
“Why is there not a process?” Nuccio said, adding that if funds are given to communities, there should be rules, transparency and accountability. “It is irresponsible use of taxpayer money.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0224_SR_HouseVote_051-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-21 05:56:47.100576

Susan Collins on Aug. 19, 2026. (Photo courtesy of Graham for Senate)A largely unknown oysterman and military veteran, Graham Platner garnered widespread attention this week when he launched a U.S. Senate campaign to try to unseat longtime Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins.
Most of the candidates running against Collins so far are political newcomers like Graham, but his splashy campaign launch in the The New York Times and team of progressive strategists with records of successfully running against establishment Democrats has set him apart.
While running on progressive ideas — universal health care, raising the minimum wage,  strengthening unions — Platner is clearly trying to appeal to Maine’s independent thinking, rejecting the label of liberal while embracing a working man’s pitch to appeal to supporters of President Donald Trump.
It’s also unclear what his candidacy now means for national Democrats’ efforts to convince Gov. Janet Mills to run.
The governor, who is termed out next year, gained a national profile after she told Trump in February “see you in court” over Maine’s law that allows transgender athletes to compete on girls’ sports teams. Now, some are hoping she’ll run for federal office, but she hasn’t decided yet.
Earlier this month, Mills, known locally as a moderate Democrat, said she was “assessing everything” and “would think seriously about it.” According to CNN, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York has personally spoken with Mills about the race.
Without an explicit answer, some other potential Democratic candidates for U.S. Senate are holding out on entering the race, including Speaker of the Maine House Ryan Fecteau and the owner of Maine Brewing Company, Dan Kleban.
Not all Democrats are waiting. Six lesser-known names filed to run before Platner — including Jordan Wood, a progressive former congressional aide, and David Costello, who unsuccessfully tried to unseat Maine’s other U.S. senator, independent Angus King, in 2024.
“All of the other higher profile Democrats have, at least so far, decided, ‘Well, we’re going to run for the open governor’s [seat],’” said Mark Brewer, chair of the political science department at the University of Maine. The 2026 gubernatorial race has received far greater action with 18 official candidates already and others contemplating bids.
“Part of that is Mills freezing the field, so to speak,” Brewer said. “But it’s not just that.”
Democrats thought they had Collins last time, Brewer pointed out. Her Democratic opponent, Sara Gideon, then-Speaker of the Maine House, far outspent Collins and polls had Gideon leading. Then Collins won by almost 9%. Brewer said he thinks the fact that prominent Maine Democrats opted for gubernatorial bids rather than Collins’ seat “speaks to the fact that she’s going to be tough to take down.”
Collins told Maine Morning Star in the spring she intends to run for reelection in 2026. Although she has yet to officially launch a campaign, she raised $2.4 million to close the quarter with more than $5 million on hand.
When asked in the spring why she thinks she remains the best person to represent the state, Collins highlighted her record of delivering for Maine, primarily financially. That ability has been increasingly tested and upended during Trump’s second term.
As for a primary challenge, Maine Republicans and Trump have rejected the idea, though someone familiar with the conversation told Politico recently that the president would love to see a “better option.” Brewer said, in his view, “it’s hard to envision another Republican winning statewide in a two-person race besides Collins.”
So far, two little-known Republicans are running. One independent candidate has also thrown his hat in the ring.
The candidate field
With 15 months until the election, Democrats in the running for Collins’ seat include Platner, Wood, Costello, Tucker Favreau, Andrea LaFlamme, Natasha Alcala, and Daira Rodriguez, according to Federal Election Commission filings.
Platner was born in Blue Hill and raised in Ellsworth and Sullivan, where he launched his campaign on Tuesday. He enlisted in the Marine Corps after high school and served three deployments to Iraq. After attending George Washington University on the G.I. Bill, he then enrolled in the Army National Guard and served in Afghanistan.
Following his service, he started working on an oyster farm on Frenchman Bay, which he now runs. He is also chair of the planning board and harbormaster in Sullivan.
Platner wasted no time critiquing Collins during his campaign launch. In his video announcement, which was produced by Morris Katz, a top admaker for New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani, he said, “I’m not afraid to name an enemy. And the enemy is the oligarchy. It’s the billionaires who pay for it and the politicians who sell us out. And yeah, that means politicians like Susan Collins.”
Other candidates have also made similar pitches about Collins, including Wood, who said the senator “hasn’t fixed the system — she’s become part of it,” in a statement last month in which he announced his fundraising totals so far. Aside from Collins, he’s raised the most — $1.6 million as of June 30. He’s had the most public campaign presence so far, hosting town halls across the state.
Wood, a Bristol resident, previously told Maine Morning Star his top priorities will be anti-corruption reform and getting big money out of politics.
Wood spent about a decade working in politics in Washington, D.C, including as chief of staff to former Democratic U.S. Rep. Katie Porter of California. He helped lead democracyFIRST, an organization aimed to combat threats to free and fair elections, and End Citizens United, a political action committee working to reverse the U.S. Supreme Court decision that enabled corporations and other outside groups to spend unlimited money on elections.
The sole independent candidate, Rench of Waterboro, has raised the next most, just over $54,000.
Rench owns Ossipee Hill Farm and Observatory. He was a former senior engineer at Elon Musk’s SpaceX, though he told Maine Morning Star he now has no association with Musk or the company aside from stocks he was awarded as an employee. He returned to Maine in 2020 to raise his children and build a produce farm. He also sat on the board for the Maine Space Corporation from June 2023 until June 2025.
Other candidates have raised little to no funds so far, in part because their recent announcements fell close to the end of the quarter.
Costello, who announced his bid in June and has no contributions filed with the FEC so far, is a familiar face in past U.S. Senate candidate pools.
He unsuccessfully ran for independent Sen Angus King’s seat in 2024. He was active in state and federal government campaigns before spending several years working for the U.S. government abroad through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which Trump dismantled earlier this year.
Favreau, who also filed to run in June, has raised $4,724 in contributions so far. Born in Brunswick, Favreau enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2009 after high school and eventually commissioned as an officer in the recently established cyber branch. Since moving back to Maine following the end of his service in 2021, he has continued to work in cybersecurity at Cisco Talos.
LaFlamme of Bangor is the chapter president for adjunct faculty of Maine’s Community Colleges with the Maine Service Employees Association, Local 1989 of the Service Employees International Union, and an adjunct professor at the University of Maine, teaching courses in Women’s Studies, particularly Women’s Health and the Environment and Reproductive Health.
Alcala of Madawaska is a fashion designer who moved to Maine from California about four years ago. She has degrees in international relations and criminal justice and is a U.S. Navy veteran. Alcala previously filed to run against U.S. Sen. Angus King in 2024 but withdrew before the primary.
Little is known about Rodriguez, who just filed with the FEC on Aug. 15 and lists an address of a Washington, D.C. PO Box.
LaFlamme, Alcala, and Rodriguez all have zero contributions filed with the FEC so far. That’s also the case for the two Republicans who have filed to run.
Calabrese of Kennebunkport moved to Maine five years ago from Florida and is a driver for Walmart and former small business owner. Smeriglio of Frenchville runs the rightwing Voice of the People USA radio and activist group. He is a U.S. Army veteran and former police officer, according to his website.

Several economists said last week that it’s difficult at this point to predict their impact on the economies of Ohio and other states.
But they did say that the tariffs will raise prices for consumers. 
They added that the unpredictability created as Trump threatens, delays, and imposes tariffs makes it all but impossible for businesses to engage in the complex planning necessary to make major investments. 
They also said that the promised result of the tariffs — bringing back sectors like Ohio’s diminished manufacturing — is a far more complicated proposition than imposing tariffs on a few commodities such as aluminum and steel. 
While he has threatened far higher tariffs on some countries without following through, the ones Trump has imposed so far have been historic.

“Tariffs are as high as they’ve ever been,” said Christopher Meissner, a University of California at Davis economist who focuses on global trade. “They are now about 18%, that’s the average tariff. That’s as high as they were during the infamous rise in the Great Depression in the 1930s with the Smoot Hawley Tariff. They’re about 10 times higher than they were just last year. They’re at historical highs. Not only that, they are coming with great amounts of uncertainty. Nobody knows what to predict in the short run, or even the medium run at this point.”
Meissner was speaking last week during a virtual press conference on tariffs hosted by SciLine, a service for journalists and scientists offered by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. 
Negative impacts of the Trump tariffs appear to be manifesting. Core inflation surged last month, the job market was weak, and estimates for the two previous months were lowered. 
The nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimates that over the long run, the Trump tariffs and the retaliatory measures they provoke will sap 1% in gross domestic product, cost nearly 1 million jobs, and cost the average household $1,500 next year. On the other hand, they’re expected to generate $2.3 trillion more in government revenue over the coming decade. 
Meissner and the other panelists said that there are still many uncertainties — including how the unprecedented wave of tariffs will reshape the economy. But they said it’s certain they’ll be painful for consumers.
“The general lesson is that consumers are going to pay higher prices ultimately for imported stuff — and it will raise prices generally because of less competition,” Meissner said. “Tariffs generally just lead to higher prices for consumers.” 
He explained how.
“Tariffs are taxes,” Meissner said. “They’re taxes on imports. But tariffs are taxes on exports, too. So when we put tariffs up, it doesn’t just reduce our imports, it’s going to inhibit our exports, so stay tuned for that.”
Jason Grant, an economist who focuses on agriculture at Virginia Tech, said that unlike the first Trump administration, countries being hit with tariffs have been slower to retaliate this time around. 
Perhaps they’re hoping to work a better deal with Trump, Grant said. But if agricultural products are struck by retaliatory tariffs and other measures, it will be a big problem for Ohio farmers, he said.
“In terms of agriculture, Ohio is dependent on exports,” he said. “The risk is if these countries choose to retaliate… Our exports are dependent on foreign demand. If that foreign demand retaliates against U.S. products, that’s when Ohio farmers, Indiana farmers, Illinois farmers, all the way across to California — whatever form that retaliation takes, tariff or non-tariff — that’s what trickles back to lower cash to the farmers.”
Vidya Mani, who studies the economics of supply chains at the University of Virginia, said that new tariffs disrupt supply chains, which adds to inflation. Severe supply chain disruptions during the coronavirus pandemic have been blamed in large part for the rapid inflation that occurred starting in 2021.
“Tariffs are a shock,” Mani said. “Think of a railroad track that’s moving seamlessly from the West Coast to the East Coast, and then suddenly you put in stops. You add extra checks. The more stops you put in, the more it’s going to create delays.”
She added that because of the erratic nature of Trump’s tariff policy, businesses can’t plan strategically.
“If you have demand seesaw like this, and prices — one day they’re protected and they go up and the next day they’re not and they go down by a magnitude — no industry can survive a planned production based on those fluctuations,” Mani said.
For those reasons, and because it’s difficult to turn back the clock, the economists said it’s very unlikely that Trump will be able to use tariffs to restore sectors such as Ohio manufacturing to their earlier glory. 
Meissner explained the complexity of the matter. Aluminum and steel tariffs might help companies that make those commodities. But they hurt all others that use them by making their inputs more expensive, he said.
“Because of the potential for uncertainty, for backtracking, it’s unlikely companies are going to pour investment into those sectors, and we wouldn’t necessarily be competitive in those sectors,” he said. “I think the idea that these tariffs are going to bring back or revitalize the economy in the way it was decades ago, I think that’s probably a non-starter.”

Just in the November 2024 general election, 1.1 million Ohioans voted by mail.
“I like voting because I believe that our democracy works best when we’re all participating,” Jen Miller with the League of Women Voters of Ohio said.
It’s proven to be safe, secure and effective for each party, Miller said.
Data from the 2024 general election shows that the main demographic utilizing absentee ballots is voters above the age of 65 by a significant amount. That age group returned about 520,000 ballots by mail, while the second closest was 55-64 with about 205,000 returned.

Unaffiliated voters led the pack. Registered Republicans came in second, with Democratic voters following. Ohioans do not need to register with a party to vote in the election, only in primaries, which the majority of registered voters do not participate in.

“It’s particularly important for older adults, military members, rural Ohioans, voters with disabilities, and students,” Miller said about voting by mail.
Republican Ohio Secretary of State Frank Larose has done audits of all elections he has presided over. Not one has shown evidence of widespread voter fraud.
Yet, Trump wants to stop that method of voting.
“Mail-in ballots are corrupt,” Trump claimed Monday. “Mail-in ballots, you can never have a real democracy with mail-in ballots.”
The President said his team was drafting an executive order to ban the use of not just mail-in ballots, but also voting machines and tabulators, which allow Ohio boards of elections to get results out on election night.
“Massive fraud all over the place,” Trump claimed.
Case Western Reserve University nonpartisan elections law professor Atiba Ellis said that Trump’s plan won’t work.
“Trump does not have the power to do this,” Ellis said. “At best, it’s in the hands of Congress to dictate how federal elections work and therefore he cannot simply, by executive order, change how American democracy has worked — and worked safely for centuries.”
LaRose touts Ohio as the “gold standard” of elections. We sent him a list of questions about Trump’s comments.
“We look forward to reviewing the details of what the President is proposing,” LaRose spokesperson Ben Kindel said. “Changes to Ohio’s voting process require a vote of the General Assembly, so I’m sure we’ll be talking with them as well.”
We also reached out with questions to both major declared candidates for secretary of state, Republican Treasurer Robert Sprague and Democratic doctor Bryan Hambley.
“We share many of President Trump’s concerns over election integrity. We look forward to seeing his Executive Order and working with the Administration to ensure that Ohio elections remain fair and honest,” Sprague’s campaign spokesperson Dalton Throckmorton said.
After asking, the campaign declined to say which concerns they shared with Trump. Hambley was outright against it.
“Both of these proposals are bad ideas. There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud, and Ohio’s current Secretary of State has stated that our elections are secure. Cutting access to vote by mail would make it harder for folks in every corner of Ohio to vote. It would disproportionately harm folks in rural communities and our service members overseas. Removing voting machines and requiring counties to count ballots manually would be a much slower process, and would ultimately cost taxpayers much more because of the hours of labor needed. Ohioans deserve a democracy where it is easy and fair for every Ohio citizen to vote,” Hambley responded.
The state’s perspective is essential to the debate, Ellis said.
“States get to make the rules, including allowing different forms of voting,” Ellis added.
Miller has consistently fought against Ohio Republicans’ efforts to impose more restrictions on voting, including requiring a photo ID and limiting ballot drop box access — both of which went into law. She worries Trump’s rhetoric will cause the state to look for even more ways to make it harder to vote.
“If we do have those drastic overhauls, it’s likely going to mean more work for boards of elections, more expense for taxpayers, less access for voters, and overall, an election system that does not run as well,” Miller said.
Voting rights groups say they are ready to file a lawsuit against any federal executive order attempting to change the way Ohio currently votes.

It’s over. Well, partly.


As of last week, customers of regulated utilities in Ohio will no longer pay subsidies for two old coal plants — but the saga of the coal and nuclear bailout law at the heart of Ohio’s largest public-corruption scandal continues.


Six years ago, FirstEnergy and others used dark money — funds given to groups whose ultimate source for political spending can’t be publicly traced — to route roughly $60 million in bribes to public officials and alleged coconspirators in exchange for their help passing and protecting House Bill 6. That legislation mandated the coal plant subsidies plus more than $1 billion in ratepayer charges for two nuclear power plants. Ohio lawmakers repealed the nuclear subsidies back in 2021.


Here are new developments from the last two months:
Power corrupts


Ohio’s HB 6 conspiracy takes center stage in a new book, ​“Power Corrupts: Cleaning Up America’s Biggest Industry.”


While the FirstEnergy case involves massive amounts of money, utility corruption isn’t unique to Ohio, said author Richard Munson, former director of Midwest clean energy for the Environmental Defense Fund. Besides undermining democracy and raising electric bills, corruption interferes with competitive markets, he told Canary Media.


Basically, bailouts for fossil fuels and nuclear power impose a disadvantage on cheaper, clean sources like wind and solar. ​“If the outmoded is being subsidized, that innovation will not be able to advance,” Munson said.


For now, it’s unclear whether Ohio’s Public Utilities Commission, or PUCO, will impose meaningful consequences on FirstEnergy’s utilities for alleged regulatory violations. Also in doubt is what will happen with the commission’s reviews of charges already paid by customers for the coal plants, which managers often ran even when doing so increased the facilities’ financial losses.


“Ohio PUCO unfortunately appears to be an example of what were supposed to be guard dogs becoming lap dogs,” Munson said.

 Coal plant charges end


House Bill 15, passed in May, ends HB 6’s ratepayer subsidies to two 1950s-era coal plants as of today, Aug. 14. Customers of AEP Ohio, Duke Energy Ohio, AES Ohio, and FirstEnergy’s three Ohio utilities have already paid more than half a billion dollars since HB 6’s subsidies began in January 2020, according to the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel.


Regulatory cases and an Ohio Supreme Court case continue. Among the issues is whether the PUCO improperly pressured an independent auditor to tone down conclusions about the plants’ decision to run even when it was clear they would lose money.

 Regulatory violations


Another half billion dollars or more in potential penalties is at stake in three of the PUCO’s four HB 6 cases, in which briefing wrapped up Aug. 4. FirstEnergy’s utilities claim they should pay far less.


One case asks whether the utilities violated an Ohio law requiring the separation of regulated utilities and their unregulated affiliates that produce electricity. The other two deal with alleged improper spending of money collected for two bill riders, which are extra charges that can only be used for specified purposes.

HB 6 regulatory cases weigh what FirstEnergy’s Ohio utilities should pay (Canary Media)


 Ratemaking and the rate of return
Briefing also wrapped up this month in the rate case for FirstEnergy’s three Ohio utilities — their first full rate case since 2007.


FirstEnergy wants the PUCO to approve roughly $183 million more per year in rate charges for Ohio Edison, Toledo Edison, and the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co. (CEI). In contrast, the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel and other challengers argue FirstEnergy’s customers, as a group, should pay $132 million less per year.


Much of the difference hinges on the rate of return on equity. FirstEnergy wants regulators to set that rate at 10.8%. The utility commission’s staff says the rate should range from 9.13% to 10.13%.


Opponents argue the return on equity should be even lower, with The Ohio Manufacturers’ Association Energy Group, the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel, and others calling for a cut of half a percentage point to reflect the poor management that enabled the HB 6 scandal. The consumers’ counsel also noted the company’s prior efforts to delay the rate case because executives expected rates would be dropped, creating an ​“Ohio hole.”


If regulators grant FirstEnergy’s request, roughly 70% of the increase will be borne by CEI’s approximately 745,000 customers, who make up only 35% of the three utilities’ 2.1 million customers. FirstEnergy spokesperson Hannah Catlett said the cost for that area is higher because, compared to the other utilities’ areas, ​“the Illuminating Co. service territory generally sees bigger storm impacts.”


The commission is expected to rule on the issues in the coming months.

 Criminal case updates

The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals on July 25 refused to reconsider its unanimous decision this spring upholding the criminal convictions of former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder and lobbyist Matt Borges. Juries found both guilty in March 2023 of violating the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO.


Former FirstEnergy executives Chuck Jones and Michael Dowling continue to face criminal charges in both federal and state court. Judge Susan Baker Ross has set the state court trial for Jan. 26, 2026. Pretrial fact-finding, called discovery, continues in the federal case.

(Getty Images)When I talk to friends or family or acquaintances during this cursed summer of 2025, the conversation inevitably turns to the political landscape. And our exchange goes as follows.
Me: So, things seem bad, right?
Friend/family/acquaintance: Yep, they’re pretty bad. Let me give you a specific example that will make you want to flee across the border to Canada!
Me: I’d hoped to hear better news, actually!
Friend/family/acquaintance: No, I’ve received a memo at work that says everything will be worse next week.
This presents a problem for those of us who write columns. If we’re honest, we want to express our horror at these unprecedented times (federal troops in major cities, war waged on civic institutions, political parties either in thrall to authoritarianism or incapable of action). But we don’t want to, like, bum you out. We don’t want to bum ourselves out. It’s difficult enough being a functional human during good times, let alone while our republic descends into — something else.
I find myself sympathetic to the course that former Kansas Reflector opinion editor C.J. Janovy has taken in retirement. She’s heading off to Portugal to live the expat life. Her recent account of a summer spent waiting for bureaucratic knots to untangle summarizes this vertiginous span of months beautifully.
My family and I are hanging tough, although I don’t judge those who reach different conclusions.
Why? Four years ago this week, I wrote my first column as Kansas Reflector opinion editor, and it addresses this exact topic. You might be justified in calling me a stubborn old cuss, but I think it stands up. It still stands as my statement of purpose.
Those of us calling for a better state, I wrote, shouldn’t have to love it or leave it. We should make our voices heard and call for a better, more honorable Kansas. These days, I would add, that goes for the nation as a whole. Those of us who demand something better, something more of our leaders, come from a long and proud line of Americans who raised their voices during dark times.
That inaugural column quotes columnist Sydney J. Harris:
“Most people who want to change conditions do like it here: they love it here,” the Chicagoan wrote. “They love it so much they cannot stand to see it suffer from its imperfections, and want it to live up to its ideals. It is the people who placidly accept the corruptions and perversions and inequities in our society who do not love America; they love their status, security and special privilege. … Nobody should be faced with the mean choice of accepting conditions as they are or abandoning the place he has grown up in.”
Note the word he uses: nobody. Harris wrote that passage 56 years ago, but it still rings clear and true and bright, like a bell warning ships away from danger on a foggy night.
Later in the column, I wrote that some may leave the state, as some now leave this country.
“But where does that leave everyone else?” I asked. “Where does that leave those Kansans who are transgender? What about those who are immigrants? What about communities of color and women seeking to protect their right to choose? What about the uninsured forced to declare bankruptcy after an illness or hospital stay?”
Again, everyone has to make the right choice for themselves and their families. I feel the fear circulating and sympathize deeply. It also angers me to see the darkest aspects of our national life attempt to snuff out the light. I will be here, and I will do this work for as long as possible. (Don’t put me on a pedestal; I am being paid.) Who knows, a city bus might plow into me tomorrow.
Opinionated Kansans sharing thoughts, aspirations and gripes won’t solve all our nation’s woes. But our voices, repeated and combined with one another, prove that not everyone has resigned themselves to the darkness. Not everyone has decided to capitulate to anger, discrimination and kleptocracy. We can make the future better by working together and listening.
Will it happen tomorrow? Almost certainly not.
Will that better future exist solely in our hearts and minds? Could be!
Yet we try, and we push ahead. I try, and I push ahead, too. Let’s keep this beautiful state, this prairie haven for a free people, forever in our thoughts.

Despite the wide range of geography, politics, and demographics between these four states, they share a specific statewide policy in common: each has a universal prekindergarten system currently in place.
Over the past few decades, interest in prekindergarten enrollment among economists and education researchers has grown. Randomized controlled trials of high-quality prekindergarten programs conducted in the 1960s and 1970s have shown positive long-term outcomes for labor market earnings, health, and criminal justice involvement. 
Researchers like Nobel Prize Winner James Heckman and Leading Economic Development Economist Timothy Bartik have used these findings to estimate the long-term economic benefits of investing in early childhood education, coming to the conclusion that early childhood is one of the best times to invest in education.
According to prekindergarten enrollment data compiled by U.S. News and World Report, Ohio is currently #37 in the country for prekindergarten enrollment, behind states like Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and New Mexico.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In April, my firm Scioto Analysis released a cost-benefit analysis we conducted on universal pre-kindergarten. In this analysis, we used results from a study conducted by the Washington State Institute for Public Policy to estimate what the benefits of a universal prekindergarten program would be for Ohio. 
We estimated that increased lifetime earnings, reductions in criminal justice costs, and savings in special education would produce about $3.80 in benefits for every $1 of costs of the program.
Universal prekindergarten would not be a small investment for the state. According to 2023 American Community Survey data, Ohio has about 650,000 children under age 5. This means expanding prekindergarten to children age 4 would mean offering it to about 130,000 children and expanding it further would mean providing it to even more. Covering everyone would cost more than a billion dollars.
It is easy to get scared off by sticker shock by programs like this, but policymakers should take into account the impact this spending has on local economies. These funds will go toward paying prekindergarten teachers, who then have resources they can spend in the economy. 
They also compare similarly to spending on vouchers for private schools, which often function as a windfall for parents already sending their children to private school rather than an incentive for children to enroll in high-quality programs.
Since the COVID-19 pandemic led to a nationwide reduction in workforce due to early retirements, layoffs, and untimely deaths, workforce has dominated so many of our state and local economic development conversations. 
Investment in early childhood education is a strategy to build today’s education workforce and tomorrow’s broader workforce. As Timothy Bartik shares in his book “Investing in Kids,” high-quality universal early childhood education programs have returns to local wages that are on the scale of high-quality tax incentive programs for businesses.
A state that wants to build its long-term workforce needs to look to training people across all years of life. That means investment in postsecondary and technical education, K-12, but crucially early childhood. 
Tomorrow’s workforce depends on decisions made, or not made, by policymakers today.

Summer heat is bearing down on U.S. prisons, where temperatures in uncooled cells can climb well into the triple digits.
Facing growing pressure from advocacy groups, lawsuits and climate projections that show hotter days ahead, some state prison systems are moving to install air conditioning and expand cooling measures — though many facilities remain years away from significant upgrades.
But in other states, such efforts have stalled or failed. That may lead to more lawsuits in the future, experts say, even as judges may raise the bar for such cases.
An emphasis on being “tough on crime” and prioritizing other public safety measures may have contributed to less attention on prison conditions in some states. In others, slowing revenue growth and pressure to rein in corrections spending could be making new investments a harder sell.
At least two states this year, Virginia and Texas, considered legislation addressing excessive heat in prisons but neither measure became law. The Texas bill would have required the state Department of Criminal Justice to purchase and install climate control systems in all of its facilities by the end of 2032. About two-thirds of the state’s correctional facilities have only partial or no air conditioning.
The measure passed the House but did not advance in the Senate before the legislature adjourned in June.
In Virginia, lawmakers approved a bill that would have required the state corrections department to install heat and air conditioning in its prisons and to ensure cell temperatures not exceed 80 degrees. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed it, citing the cost of installation and operational burdens. Youngkin also wrote that existing state corrections data “does not substantiate the claims of extreme temperatures or health risks.”
But in Delaware, the fiscal year 2026 capital budget approved last month includes $2 million in funding to install air conditioning at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center.
These changes mark the latest actions in a long-running debate over how correctional systems respond to rising summer temperatures — an issue that affects both incarcerated people and staff. Some of the policy debates and facility updates this year follow years of advocacy and litigation over the health, safety and operational challenges posed by heat in correctional settings.
Stifling prison heat used to be just a Southern problem. Not anymore.

The problem of excessive heat in prisons has persisted for decades and has unfolded alongside other challenges, including chronic understaffing and overcrowding. In some cases, these problems have led to extended facility lockdowns, even during the summer months.
“There are people working in prisons and they have the right to work in climates that are comfortable,” said Nancy La Vigne, a criminal justice researcher and dean of the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University. “When they’re not, there’s retention issues, and it’s hard to replace staff. And when you don’t replace staff, then you have challenges in maintaining the safety and security of the facility.”
In New York, for example, correctional officers staged a three-week strike earlier this year and many didn’t return to work. Some facilities now are operating with 30%-60% fewer guards than needed, resulting in some incarcerated people getting only an hour or two outside of their cells each day.
A 2023 study published in the peer-reviewed PLOS One journal found that mortality in state and private prisons rose during periods of extreme heat, with deaths increasing 3.5% on extreme heat days and up to 7.4% during three-day heat waves. Between 2001 and 2019, nearly 13,000 people died in prison during the summer months, almost half of them in the South, though the study did not determine how many of those deaths were directly attributable to heat.
Climate change is fueling longer, more intense periods of extreme heat. Exposure to extreme heat can worsen conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and asthma, and has also been linked to worsening mental health and higher suicide rates among incarcerated people.
“Average temperatures are rising, and you’re going to have more and more states around the country where incarcerated people are held in conditions that are not livable because they’re too hot,” said Sharon Dolovich, a law professor and director of the Prison Law and Policy Program at the University of California, Los Angeles.
 Some upgrades

At least 44 states lack universal air conditioning within their prison facilities, even in regions known for sweltering summer temperatures, according to a 2022 USA Today analysis. A recent Reuters investigation also found that nearly half of state prisons across 29 states have partial or no air conditioning in housing units.
But some states are investing millions to update their prison facilities.
In North Carolina, corrections officials are working toward their goal of installing air conditioning in all 54 state prisons by 2026. To date, 33 facilities are fully air-conditioned, 17 are partially air-conditioned, and four have no air conditioning, according to its dashboard.
In California, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, which operates 31 adult prisons, has spent $246 million in the past five years on cooling improvements at five prisons, according to a department spokesperson.
Lawmakers this year also approved funding for the Air Cooling Pilot Program at three facilities, with $17.6 million allocated for fiscal years 2025-26 and $20 million for fiscal years 2026-27. It will evaluate the effectiveness of two alternatives prior to a statewide plan to address high indoor temperatures across the California prison system.
State prisons turn to extended lockdowns amid staffing shortages, overcrowding

The Texas Department of Criminal Justice, as of Aug. 1, is building 12,827 “cool beds,” or prison cells in air-conditioned units, and is in the process of procuring an additional 7,162, according to its dashboard.
Texas is one of the states most closely associated with heat-related deaths in prison. A 2022 study estimated that, on average, 14 deaths per year in Texas prisons are associated with heat. And a Texas Tribune analysis found that at least 41 incarcerated people died during a record-breaking heat wave in 2023.
In March, a federal judge ruled the extreme heat in Texas prisons is “plainly unconstitutional,” but declined to order immediate air conditioning, saying the work could not be completed within the court order’s 90-day window and temporary systems might delay a permanent fix.
 ‘More miserable’

Sweltering summer heat can turn prisons into pressure cookers. People inside already may have health conditions, limited access to cooling, or take medications that make it harder for their bodies to handle the heat. And research suggests that high temperatures can heighten irritability and aggression, sometimes fueling more conflicts between incarcerated people or with staff.
“It makes you more miserable. … If you to the point of even thinking about suicide, that’s just going to add to it,” said Ronald McKeithen, who spent 37 years incarcerated in Alabama prisons and is now the director of second chances at the Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice. McKeithen recalls feeling “on edge” due to tension among other incarcerated people on hot days.
At the Oshkosh Correctional Institution in Wisconsin, Devin Skrzypchak said the heat worsens his bladder condition, and he often can’t get the incontinence briefs he needs. The heat forces him to drink more water, and on days when ice isn’t available, he’s left drenched in sweat.
“At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating,” Skrzypchak wrote in a message to Stateline through the facility’s messaging platform.

D’Angelo Lee Komanekin — who has spent about 25 years in and out of different Wisconsin corrections facilities — said prison architecture plays a major role in why temperatures inside climb so high.
“The planet is getting hotter and hotter,” said Komanekin, who relies on a small plastic fan to stay cool. Komanekin also is incarcerated at the Oshkosh Correctional Institution. “They’re doing nothing about the architecture. Some institutions’ windows open, some don’t, but most of the doors have steel doors with trap doors.”
Older prison designs that rely heavily on steel and concrete building materials often trap heat, making it difficult to keep temperatures down in the summer. Aging facilities also are less likely to be equipped for the installation of central air conditioning.
Some state prison systems, including Alabama’s and Wisconsin’s, are adding air-conditioning or air-tempering systems to new prison construction and major renovation projects.
 Future legal battles

Legal experts say the issue of excessive heat in prisons is likely to become more pressing as climate change drives longer and hotter summers.
Extreme heat in correctional facilities has already been the subject of litigation in dozens of states, with plaintiffs arguing that high temperatures constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Court rulings in these cases have varied, but some experts say even more lawsuits are likely if facilities do not adapt.
“The conditions are going to worsen. [Incarcerated people are] going to be looking for every possible avenue for assistance they can,” Dolovich, the UCLA law professor, told Stateline.
Prison abuse, deaths and escapes prompt calls for more oversight

One of the latest cases comes from Missouri, where the nonprofit law firm MacArthur Justice Center filed a class-action lawsuit in May on behalf of six incarcerated people at Algoa Correctional Center.
The lawsuit alleges that the conditions violate their constitutional rights under the Eighth Amendment. It seeks to require the Missouri Department of Corrections to work with experts to develop a heat mitigation plan that keeps housing unit temperatures between 65 and 85 degrees. If the department cannot meet that standard, the plaintiffs are asking for the release of three of the incarcerated people who have less than a year remaining on their sentences.
Lawsuits such as the Missouri case often focus on claims that extreme heat worsens existing medical problems. To proceed, they must meet two legal requirements: proving the heat poses a serious health or safety risk, and showing prison officials knew about the danger but failed to address it, according to Dolovich, whose work has focused on the Eighth Amendment and prison conditions.
Courts may also raise the bar for proving such claims if judges echo decisions in cases with similar Eight Amendment arguments related to the death penalty and homelessness, Dolovich said. Judges have shifted, she said, toward a “superadding terror, pain and disgrace” standard under the Eighth Amendment — a higher threshold requiring proof that conditions were created with the intent to cause unnecessary suffering.
Dolovich added that some recent court decisions have provided only narrow remedies, such as ordering ice and fans instead of installing air conditioning.
“Prison officials have a moral and a constitutional responsibility to respond to changing conditions. In this case, it means air conditioning. … Anything less than that, to me, is indefensible.” she said.

Wed Moore (D) in a Democratic primary.","Baltimore businessman Ed Hale Sr. during a campaign event Wednesday in Canton, where said he will switch parties and run for governor next year as a Rebublican. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Ed Hale Sr., a Baltimore businessman, sports team owner and longtime Democrat, ended speculation about his party affiliation and declared Wednesday that he will run for governor as a Republican.
Hale described himself as a moderate, but said his party switch was rooted in political pragmatism more than ideology.
“There’s no way I could win running against Wes Moore with that machine he’s got,” Hale said of the incumbent Democratic governor. “He takes all the money and oxygen out of the room. I can’t do it. I’m a pragmatist and I’m a moderate person. That’s just the way I am.”
Hale made the announcement — one that was expected — in an east Baltimore waterfront park that he once owned and sold to the city. It came after he hired Annapolis pollster Patrick Gonzales to look at a head-to-head race between himself and Moore.
“I don’t believe I had a chance, based on the polling that was done, to beat him,” Hale said of Moore. “I had a chance, but it was not as good as it would be running as a Republican.”
Hale said later that the poll only looked at him against Moore and did not include other Republicans who have filed or announced for governor, or who are the subject of speculation.
Hale, 78, is well-known in the business community but is an unpolished political candidate.

“So, the big thing here is, I like building things.  I like making things. I like hiring people. That’s the way it is,” Hale said. “ What we have right now are these career politicians with smiling faces that really, really don’t give a sh-t. You all know it. I do. I care.”
While Hale was blunt about his reasons for switching, Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore) was equally blunt, casting doubt on Hale’s affiliation switch and portraying him as a political opportunist.
“We’ve built a Republican movement in Maryland that stands for more than just opposition to the far left — it stands for authentic leadership and a clear governing philosophy,” Hershey said in a statement. “Our voters expect more than opportunism — they expect commitment.”
Hershey noted that Hale has “spent decades” supporting Democrats.
In remarks to reporters, Hale noted his relationships with former Baltimore mayor and Maryland Gov. William Donald Schaefer, a Democrat. He also spoke about raising money for Democrats including Dutch Ruppersberger, the former Baltimore County executive and congressman, and former Sens. Ben Cardin and Barbara Mikulski.
“I did it because they were going to win and if you don’t do that, you’re just not very pragmatic or prudent,” Hale said.
But he noted he also voted for Republicans, including former Govs. Larry Hogan and Robert Ehrlich.
“It’s just the way that I am. I want to vote for the winner,” he said.
Hale grew up in Baltimore. He said his record “stands for itself” more than political affiliation.
“If you want to talk about labels, I’m the wrong person,” he said. “You’re born in Baltimore — I’m from east Baltimore not too far from here — and you’re automatically a Democrat. But I stopped thinking about party affiliation except when I voted.”
He described his Democratic affiliation as a business tool.
“If you’re building anything, you have to go with the party that’s in place, so you have someone to call to get a permit,” Hale said. “I can sugarcoat it any way you want, but that’s the tool.”
Hershey, in his statement, questioned Hale’s commitment to core Republican principles.
  Senate Majority Sen. Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore) questioned Ed Hale’s reasons for switching parties to run for governor. (File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters.)
“The Republican nomination for Governor will not be handed out to the highest-profile defector from the left. It must be earned,” Hershey said in his statement. “Maryland Republicans expect their leaders to stand firm on limited government, lower taxes, and personal responsibility.
“We’ll be scrutinizing Ed’s record closely to ensure he genuinely embraces our values, not simply our party label,” Hershey’s statement said.
Hale may also find himself at odds with Republicans aligned with President Donald Trump.
“Now, I am not a Donald Trump guy. I’m going to make that very clear,” Hale said, but added that he would try to work with the president, who is very unpopular in Maryland.
Hale said he would not “poke” Trump as Moore and other Democrats have done.
“You have to have some pragmatism and common sense … so that you know that you’re going to be doing the right thing to make jobs in the state of Maryland,” he said.
Hale laid out a platform of opposing taxes and fees and accused Democrats of misrepresentation as some, including Moore, claimed to have cut taxes.
“I want to attack … what we all know is a problem,” Hale said. “I think we have dishonest people telling us things that are just not true, making us try to try to make us believe that these things are true, that the taxes are not going up. That fees are not going up. We all know it’s not true.”
He said he backs nuclear power as a way to lower energy costs in the state and hinted at a tough-on-crime position, calling for juveniles as young as 14 to be jailed and for parents to be held responsible.
“I think we should lower the date that they could go to jail — the age — down to 14,” Hale said. “If that’s the one stealing the cars and doing that, put them in jail. Find the parents and get judgments against the parents, too. That will begin the parenting.”
Hale joins a growing field of Republicans who have formally filed or announced for governor.

John Myrick, who previously ran an unsuccessful campaign for U.S. Senate, and Carl A. Brunner Jr., a Carroll firearms instructor, have both formally filed for the GOP nomination.
Freshman Del. Christopher Bouchat (R-Frederick and Carroll) said he will run for governor rather than re-election to the House. Carroll County farmer Kurt Wedekind has also said he will seek the Republican nomination. Neither Bouchat nor Wedekind have formally filed their candidacy.
And then there is the ongoing speculation about Hogan mulling a possible return to office. The former two-term governor has used social media to stoke that speculation.
Hale himself raised the possibility of another Republican former governor – Ehrlich — attempting a comeback.
“If Larry Hogan wants to run, if Bob Ehrlich wants to run — I’ve heard that, too – have at it. Let’s have a contest,” he said.
Hale’s announcement Wednesday does not make him a formal candidate. He must change his party registration, something the Talbot County resident said he could do as early as Wednesday.
Hale must also register his campaign committee with the Maryland State Board of Elections, as well as financial disclosure forms. Hale said some of that may also be done as early as Wednesday afternoon.
He cannot file his formal candidacy with the state board until he chooses a running mate.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Thirty people have died so far this summer due to heat-related illness in Maryland, the highest number of heat deaths in the state in more than a decade, according to the latest state data.
And the grim milestone comes with weeks still remaining in this year’s “heat season,” the Maryland Health Department said.
David McCallister, public information officer for the health department, said in a written statement that the agency is reaching out to the departments of Aging and of Human Services to push messaging on heat safety practices, especially as older individuals make up a majority of heat-related fatalities.


Cooling centers
For information on cooling centers in all 23 Maryland counties and Baltimore City, go here.


He said the department is working on “reminding people, especially caregivers, to check on older clients, neighbors and family members on hot days to make sure they are keeping cool and have working air conditioning.”
During the summer, the Maryland Department of Health releases a weekly report called the Heat-Related Illness Surveillance Report, tracking the number of 911 calls, emergency room visits and fatalities that occur during the “heat season” that runs from April through September.
This week’s report, published Wednesday, shows data through Aug. 16, and says that 80% of the 30 heat fatalities this summer were elderly victims.
“As the heat season progressed, we noticed a high proportion of deaths were older adults 65 and over,” McCallister said in the statement. “To this date, 24 out of the 30 deaths reported this season were people aged 65 and over.”
The elderly population in the state is one of the most vulnerable groups affected by heat illness, according to state health officials, along with young children and people facing significant health challenges.
As of this week, the report also features new data to show where those deaths occur – indoors, outdoors or in vehicles. Sixteen of this summer’s heat deaths occurred indoors, nine were in an outdoors setting and the remaining five were inside vehicles.


The only time the number of deaths has been higher was in 2012, according to available historical data, when 46 Maryanders died. That summer, storm-driven power outages left many without air conditioning for days.
Trips to the emergency room due to heat-related illnesses also continue to climb this summer, after reaching a five-year high last month. At least 1,561 people had landed in the emergency room or in urgent care due to heat-related illnesses this summer, compared to 1,206 for all of 2024. While emergency department visits are up, however, the 1,008 emergency medical service calls for heat-related stress so far this year still lag behind the 1,502 recorded in all of last year.
There are still weeks left in the 2025 heat season. Along with checking on elderly neighbors and family members, health officials continue to press heat safety measures in the waning weeks of summer.
The department reminds Marylanders to drink plenty of fluids to help cope with the hot weather and urges folks to avoid alcohol, caffeine and overly sweetened beverages. Officials also encourage people to wear sunscreen and stay in the shade when possible. Those in need of a cool location can contact their local health departments or call 211 to find the nearest cooling center.

Thompson Federal Courthouse in Nashville. (Photo by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE — Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia are asking a federal judge in Tennessee to dismiss human smuggling charges against him, calling the case a clear example of “selective and vindictive prosecution” by the Trump administration.
In a motion filed late Tuesday, just days ahead of Abrego’s expected pretrial release, the attorneys conceded their argument to dismiss the case is “infrequently made and rarely succeeds.”
“But if there has ever been a case for dismissal on those grounds, this is that case,” they wrote. “The government is attempting to use this case — and this Court — to punish Mr. Abrego for successfully fighting his unlawful removal. That is a constitutional violation of the most basic sort.”
The government has not yet filed a legal response. “The United States’ position is set forth in Mr. McGuire’s statements in court and our pleadings,” a spokesperson for Acting U.S. Attorney Robert McGuire said in an email Wednesday.
The 35-page petition seeking to dismiss all charges narrates a chain of events that began with Abrego’s detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in March, while driving with his son in Maryland, through his deportation days later to a Salvadoran prison. Abrego remained for months in the notorious maximum security CECOT prison, despite the admission by a government attorney he had been sent there in error.
Abrego subsequently said he was tortured while in CECOT.
‘A wide-ranging and unprecedented retribution campaign’
Attorneys for Abrego challenged his removal to El Salvador for lack of due process in a separate lawsuit filed in federal court in Maryland, where the 29-year-old sheet metal apprentice had been living with his wife and children.

“The government did not take steps to fix its mistake,” his Tennessee lawyers wrote Tuesday. “Instead, in response to his lawsuit — and to the substantial publicity it received — the government undertook a wide-ranging and unprecedented retribution campaign against Mr. Abrego.”
The human smuggling charges brought against Abrego in Tennessee are part of that campaign, his lawyers argued.
A Tennessee grand jury in June returned the indictments for “conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain” and “unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain.” Prosecutors contend Abrego participated in a national scheme to move immigrants who entered the United States illegally to points around the country. Abrego, as his attorneys refer to him in legal filings, has pleaded not guilty.
The charges are tied to a 2022 traffic stop in Putnam County, Tenn., where Abrego was pulled over for speeding with nine passengers in the back of his car. Abrego was neither ticketed nor arrested in the stop.
A Department of Homeland Security special agent later testified he was not tasked with investigating the Tennessee traffic stop until April 28 of this year. By then, a Maryland federal judge had ordered the government to facilitate Abrego’s return to the U.S. and the Supreme Court had upheld the decision.
The government returned Abrego to Tennessee to face charges on June 6.
Case draws national scrutiny
The case generated widespread public scrutiny of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics during his initial months in office, which were criticized for undermining due process rights guaranteed to both citizens and noncitizens.
Abrego, a Salvadoran national who entered the United States illegally as a teenager, is subject to a 2019 immigration court order that prohibits the government from deporting him to El Salvador, where he says he faces threats of gang violence.
After his wrongful deportation, administration officials, including President Donald Trump, singled out Abrego in their public comments, calling him a “gangbanger,” “monster,” “illegal predator,” “illegal alien terrorist,” “wife beater,” and “human trafficker.”
Abrego’s attorneys accused the administration of a public smear campaign intended to paper over its embarrassment over his wrongful deportation and to retaliate against his legal efforts to assert his due process rights. Abrego has denied gang affiliation.

The administration’s public statements, Abrego’s attorneys argued, bolster their claims that the prosecution against him is retaliatory.
“The unprecedented public pronouncements attacking Mr. Abrego for his successful exercise of constitutional rights by senior cabinet members, leaders of the DOJ, and even the President of the United States, make this the rare case where actual vindictiveness is clear from the record,” they wrote.
Lawyers seek to curb Trump administration comments about the case
Earlier this month, Abrego’s attorneys sought, for a second time, a court order restricting government officials’ remarks about the case as prejudicial and contrary to standard court rules.
In response, U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw, who presides over the Tennessee criminal case, directed all “counsel and those working with counsel” to note in their public communications that Abrego is presumed innocent.
“Our Constitution requires that Abrego is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury,” Crenshaw wrote in his July 31 order.
Separately, in response to Abrego’s attorney’s waiver of the right to a speedy trial, the court set a trial date of Jan. 27.
Abrego remains in the custody of the U.S. Marshals, who have jurisdiction over pretrial detainees in federal cases.
Abrego has already been cleared for release pending trial by a Tennessee magistrate, an order placed on hold at the request of his attorneys amid uncertainty over whether federal immigration officials intend to detain or deport him to a “third country.”
Abrego’s attorneys on Tuesday requested the magistrate move forward with releasing him Friday, the day the hold expires.
The attorneys noted a Maryland federal judge has barred the government from taking Abrego into immigration custody and required immigration officials to provide 72-hours written notice before removing him to a third country.
His Tennessee lawyers, Sean Hecker and Rascoe Dean, also wrote they are “retaining a private security firm that has experience providing court-approved pre-trial transportation and security services in criminal cases to transport Mr. Abrego from Tennessee to Maryland upon release.”
The lawyers requested details about the security arrangements be kept under seal “in order to protect Mr. Abrego’s safety.”
A federal magistrate on Wednesday set a tentative hearing for Friday if prosecutors oppose any of the conditions of Abrego’s release sought by his attorneys.

(Photo by Bryan P.

The law only permits police officers to search the database in furtherance of a legitimate investigation, according to the prosecutor’s office. But charges against Dontae Odom said the patrol officer continually searched individuals in the database with whom he had a personal relationship, who were not the subject of a law enforcement investigation.
Odom, 36, who had served since 2019, resigned from the department on Friday, according to a spokesman.
Documents filed in Cecil County Circuit Court said the searches began in 2024, and Odom was notified that December that he was facing a criminal investigation for his use of the database. But a few of the dozens of unauthorized searches occurred in early 2025, to documents say.
Prosecutors listed seven victims, including Odom’s wife, romantic partners, and relatives of his romantic partners. Odom reportedly searched the database for an employee of an Ocean City hotel he visited with a romantic partner. None of the victims were named in the documents.

	Cecil County Sheriff Scott A. Adams said his department told the state prosecutor about the situation after receiving a complaint.
“We received the initial complaint and upon review, decided that in the spirit of transparency, that an independent investigation would be best served in this case,” Adams said in a statement. “We take our job as public servants very seriously and expect all of our deputies to serve with the utmost integrity and professionalism.”
When Odom was told of the criminal investigation, he was ordered to cease contact with victims, including “Victim 4,” a romantic partner who worked in the same building that he did and who had witnessed the Ocean City search. But Odom continued to contact Victim 4 through social media, texts and emails, according to the court filing, and secretly recorded a conversation in March when they met at a secluded location, leading to a wiretapping charge.
In all, Odom faces 28 counts of misconduct in office, 16 counts of unauthorized access to a computer and one count of unlawful interception of communications. Attorneys listed for Odom in online court records did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderCOLUMBUS, Ga. — For the third consecutive year, efforts to limit lawsuits were on the agenda at the Georgia Chamber of Commerce’s annual congressional luncheon.
The event, which was held this year at the Columbus Georgia Convention and Trade Center in Columbus, drew roughly a thousand attendees from hundreds of companies in Georgia’s business community. Headlining speakers included Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff and Republican Congressmen Buddy Carter and Mike Collins, both of whom are vying for Ossoff’s Senate seat in 2026.
Former University of Tennessee football coach Derek Dooley, the Gov. Brian Kemp-backed candidate for Senate, was also in attendance, though he declined to take questions from the press.
Georgia’s lawsuit reform package could go national
For the past few years, Kemp has used the annual luncheon to highlight the need for what he has termed “tort reform,” or policies overhauling the civil litigation system to make it harder for plaintiffs to file and successfully win lawsuits. The issue was Kemp’s top priority during the 2025 Legislative session, and he signed major lawsuit overhaul legislation into law this past April.
This year, it was Collins who called for the proposal to be adopted on the federal level during a fireside chat with U.S. Rep. Austin Scott and former Congressman Drew Ferguson, both Georgia Republicans.
“Insurance has gone sky high, and until we get true tort reform on the federal level, you’re not going to fix this problem out there,” Collins said.
Collins, who the day before held the official kickoff event for his Senate campaign, sought to cast himself as a candidate who could work with both conservative and moderate wings of the Republican Party.
“They know I’m MAGA, everybody knows,” he said. “But they also know that I can talk to the more moderate Republicans that we have out there.”
Carter calls for loosened pollution regs, mail-in ballot ban

During a separate fireside chat with Public Service Commissioner Fitz Johnson, Carter also touted proposals that would loosen air pollution regulations and increase Georgia’s energy independence, which he claims will help boost businesses in the state.
“I love the environment,” he said. “Georgia is my home, of course I love it. But at the same time, we’ve got to be realistic about the impact we’re having on businesses.”
Carter, who has branded himself a “MAGA warrior” in his Senate campaign, also told reporters he supports Trump’s push to ban the use of mail-in ballots as a method of voting in the U.S., despite the fact that the U.S. Constitution gives states explicit control over voting procedures.
“I quit questioning the realistic views of Donald Trump long ago,” he said. “He has exceeded anything I ever thought could happen.”
Ossoff talks China, foreign aid
Ossoff, Georgia’s lone Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, headlined a fireside chat with Georgia Chamber of Commerce Chair Ed Elkins, discussing workforce development and national security issues, particularly when it comes to China.
“It is very much a jump ball between the U.S. and China right now, and frankly, we are engaged in tremendous self-harm right now in this competition,” Ossoff, who sits on the Senate intelligence committee, told Elkins.
Though he never mentioned Trump by name, Ossoff criticized the Trump administration’s stance on foreign policy, which he said has caused a “brain drain” of workers from the U.S. and frayed relationships with global allies.
“It matters when the United States supports global response to natural disasters,” he said. “It enhances our credibility, our power, our prestige.”
Trump’s move to withdraw most foreign aid has not been taken lightly, Ossoff added.
“Now our allies across the Indo-Pacific take note of that. When you have private conversations with them, they are now questioning our staying power and the credibility of our assurances in the region.”

The three were chosen from six finalists out of field of 36 applicants. Besides serving on the board, Manko works as an education program director at the Abell Foundation in Baltimore.
Quick-McQueen has worked since 2014 as a supervisor of instruction in college and career readiness for St. Mary’s County Public Schools. She’s served since 2022 as part of a statewide Expert Review Team visiting schools to assess growth in academics and professional development for staff, among other educational factors.
New teachers, new policies as students, staff start to head back to school in Maryland

Werner is director of teaching and learning for Talbot County’s public schools. Besides working for the school system since 2008, She also serves on an advisory committee for the college and career readiness pillar of the Blueprint.
Riya Gupta, executive director for Strong Schools Maryland, which focuses on protecting the Blueprint, said in a statement that her group welcomes the three appointee.
“The Blueprint is at a pivotal point, and this moment brings an opportunity to strengthen stewardship and spark the creative, transformative thinking needed to build an education system that truly meets the needs of all students,” said Gupta, whose group plans to hold its third summer community conversation on the Blueprint next Wednesday.
“We’ll be there every step of the way to hold the AIB accountable to its charge and to keep Marylanders engaged as we work together to make the Blueprint’s vision a reality for students and school communities,” Gupta said.
Manko reapplied for his old job, but Werner and Quick-McQueen replace Mara Doss and Laura Stapleton, whose last meeting was June 26.
Stapleton, who chairs the Human Development and Quantitative Methodology Department at the University of Maryland, College Park, chose not to reapply after her term ended July 1. Doss, a former associate vice president for teaching, learning and student success at Prince George’s Community College, resigned with a year left on her term.
The new members join the Blueprint board after tweaks it approved last month to the overall comprehensive plan, which include revisions based on policies adopted this year by the General Assembly.

Alander Rocha/Georgia RecorderThe Georgia Department of Public Health is navigating a period of financial uncertainty due to the Trump administration’s proposed cut federal funding, state leaders said Wednesday. Some view the shift as an opportunity to focus on Georgia-specific priorities, while others raised concerns about the state having to fill in spending gaps down the road.
During the first meeting of the House Study Committee on Evaluating Funding for Public Health, state Health Commissioner Dr. Kathleen Toomey said potential budget cuts to public health provide a chance to prioritize the state’s approach to public health, adding that the current shifts in federal funding are not the first time Georgia has faced such changes. 
The state has a long history of adapting to “episodic” funding adjustments, she said, and the current situation could be a chance to focus on what the state and local communities need most, rather than following a universal federal model.
“As we’re seeing these changes at the federal level, it’s giving us an opportunity to look at what is important for us, because we often apply for grants that may or may not have been relevant,” she said. “They weren’t developed with our state specifically in mind, with our data, and we were following guidelines that were universal across every state,” Toomey said.

She said the Maternal, Infant, and Early Child Hood Home Visiting Program, which provides home visits to expectant and new parents who are at-risk for poor health outcomes, “reflects exactly what public health should be.” The program, which she said was created using data collected by clinicians and epidemiologists in local communities, provides care tailored specifically to each family’s needs, such as addressing issues like transportation barriers.
“[The program is] specific to that community … you will see that it really is quite different from one county to another, one community to another, because it reflects the needs of that community. That’s public health,” Toomey said.
William Bell, the state health department’s chief financial officer, said that the total appropriation for fiscal year 2026 is $922.5 million, with federal funds budgeted at $464.8 million. He said that the most significant impact occurred in March 2025, when 11 federal COVID-19 funding sources were terminated, resulting in a reduction of $323.7 million in unspent funds from an initial $877.6 million awarded.
“DPH is a predominantly federally funded agency, with around half of our FY ‘26 budget comprised of federal funding sources,” he said.
U.S. senators from both parties recently pushed back against Trump’s proposal to cut medical research and health services funding and instead agreed to increase spending for fiscal year 2026, which starts October 1. Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine and chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said that the appropriation bill “prioritizes funding to make Americans healthier.”
Lawmakers on the study committee, while acknowledging the opportunity, expressed some concern about the financial gap.
Swainsboro Republican Rep. Butch Parrish said he didn’t need an immediate answer but asked Toomey what the state will do if the reduced federal funding continues long-term.
“Obviously, we can help some, but I don’t think we can make up all of those dollars,” Parrish said and encouraged Toomey to evaluate programs that aren’t “working as we thought.”
Carolyn Mullen, senior vice president of government affairs at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, who presented a national perspective on impending budget cuts, said that states across the country, regardless of which party is in charge, agree that they need more flexibility with federal funds, as current restrictions make it difficult to allocate money where it is most needed.
“It’s very difficult for many states when the funding is very restrictive, and it prevents the movement of dollars,” Mullen said.
Rep. Dexter Sharper, a Valdosta Democrat, said after the meeting that he believes Georgia has no choice but to find a way to make up for the financial shortfall to ensure citizens do not experience a reduction in services.
“Georgia as a whole has to look for ways to get funding to help subsidize what we’re going to be missing from the federal government,” he said. “We’re also trying to ensure that even at the county levels, they are able to understand that we all got to get this together and make sure we get the funding we need without cutting the services to the people.”
Sharper said this will require a collective effort at both the state and county levels. He said the committee is taking the issue “very seriously” and that they want to avoid cutting any necessary services. In addition to seeking funding from counties, he hopes to work with the governor to secure additional funding for the state health department, particularly for salaries, which he believes will help make the workforce more competitive and ensure the state can retain top talent to continue serving the public.
“The counties more than likely are going to have to contribute a little bit more to what they’re already contributing, and the state is going to have to contribute more than we’ve been contributing to try to catch these shortfalls,” Sharper said.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSC06123-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-08-21 01:57:37.043342

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderOne of Georgia’s largest mass voter cancellations is wrapping up after 40 days, as election officials seek to purge outdated registrations from the state’s voter rolls.
Roughly 478,000 registered but inactive voters had been slated for removal, according to the secretary of state’s office. An additional 218,000 active voters were notified that they risked becoming inactive unless they reached out to their local elections office.
Officials with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger’s office say that the purge is part of a routine maintenance process that states are required to undergo to ensure that voter rolls are accurate. 
“We conduct every phase of the list maintenance process as publicly as possible, and in accordance with State and Federal law, because transparency helps shore up public trust in the accuracy and integrity of the entire election process,” Raffensperger said in a statement.
A resident’s voter registration can be switched to “inactive” status if they do not vote for two consecutive federal elections, and they are eligible to be removed if they do not vote for the next two federal election cycles after that. 
According to Gabriel Sterling, who until recently was the secretary of state’s chief operating officer, the majority of those flagged during the most recent round of voter roll maintenance are believed to be people who have moved out of the state.
“Four thousand have let us know they’re here, another 700 went ahead and pre-canceled themselves,” Sterling said. “So it’s exactly what we think. These people have been gone for 10 to eight years, and they’re going to be off of our voter rolls, which helps us keep the cleanest voter rolls in America.”
Of the active voters who risked being moved to inactive status, Sterling said, “so far, we’ve had about 300 people cancel themselves completely, and another 4,000 who have said, ‘Yes, we’re still here.’”
In recent years, conservative activists have fixated on Georgia’s voter rolls, reiterating unproven claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. Many activists have also taken it upon themselves to challenge voter registrations they find suspicious, sometimes filing tens of thousands of voter registration challenges at a time.
Efforts to preemptively remove inactive voters may quell fears from right-wing activists. However, Raffensperger’s efforts have been opposed by groups like Fair Fight, which say that voter roll purges disproportionately impact Black voters.
“After excluding voters who cast ballots in other states and likely moved, this purge list disproportionately targets Black Georgians who likely still live here,” Fair Fight CEO Lauren Groh-Wargo said in a statement. “Once again, politicians are rushing to remove voters based on unreliable data – and young Black voters are bearing the brunt.”
Sterling also said he was considering launching a campaign for secretary of state in 2026. If he decides to run, he will join a field of candidates that includes state Rep. Tim Fleming, a Covington Republican, and Kelvin King, the husband of State Election Board member Janelle King.

I’m really sorry. In case you haven’t heard, last week the cabal of developers that Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed to “protect” you and Florida’s other wildlife voted to allow people to hunt you with guns, bows and arrows, and even, a year from now, dogs.
There was a ton of opposition to the decision. Of 13,000 online comments, three-quarters came from people against the hunt. This is just like 10 years ago, the last time they voted to hold a hunt despite strong public opposition. That one turned into a colossal disaster, with hunters — in only two days! — killing 304 bears, nearly the entire weeklong quota allowed, including 34 lactating females. I’m betting this one will be just as disastrous.
There’s still a chance the hunt could be halted before it begins in December. An environmental group called Bear Warriors United has filed a legal challenge, seeking to overturn the decision by the Florida Fish and Wildlife “Conservation” Commission.

  Katrina Shadix (Image via screengrab)
“The very agency that’s been entrusted to protect these animals is now in the business of destroying them,” Raquel Levy, the attorney at the Atlantic Law Center who’s handling the case pro bono for Bear Warriors United, told me.
If the name of Levy’s client sounds familiar, it’s probably because Bear Warriors United recently won a huge lawsuit against the Florida Department of Environmental Protection over how that state agency failed to protect manatees from the consequences of water pollution.
“In a state where it’s so hard to ever win anything for the environment in court,” Katrina Shadix, founder of Bear Warriors United, told me at the time, “this is a big victory.”
As for her new suit, Shadix said she hopes it will “shine a bright light to expose the FWC’s culture of corruption, as well as demonstrate the desperate and immediate need for massive agency reform.”
Shadix isn’t guaranteed to win this case, even though she won the last one. But after reading over the suit, I have to tell you bears that I think she’s got a chance at saving your furry hides.
It’s about science and the law — or rather, the lack thereof.
 Flying blind

We humans frequently joke about you bears doing, ummmm, certain things in the woods. We’ve even featured you in a series of ridiculous toilet paper commercials based on that joke.
But the truth is, we don’t really know a lot about what you do in the woods. Our ignorance is so vast, it includes not knowing how many of you there are.
Before the disastrous 2015 Florida bear hunt, scientists estimated there were about 4,300 of you wandering in what was left of our wilderness.
Ten years later, biologists are still working on coming up with an accurate count. But they have produced another estimate. Now they estimate there are 4,050 of you doing your business in the woods.
I’m no wild-haired math wizard like Albert Einstein, but even I can see that’s fewer than we had a decade ago. Yet despite that disparity, the commissioners seemed hell-bent on blowing some of you away.
By the way, I should mention that about 300 of you bears get killed each year by humans — drivers of cars and trucks, mostly, plus a few poachers. (By contrast, the death of an 89-year-old man in Collier County in May marked the first time in recorded history that a Florida bear killed a human being.)
I wish we humans were doing something to prevent that, such as building more wildlife underpasses and overpasses. Instead, a small percentage of us seem bound and determined to kill even more of you.
  Rodney Barreto (image via screen grab)
During the commission meeting last week, Commission Chairman Rodney Barreto — who recently got caught lying under oath to a legislative committee — bragged about the process behind their vote.
“We make decisions based on science,” said Barreto, a wealthy developer.
The lawsuit says just the opposite is true, accusing the FWC of “flying blind as to the black bear population in making decisions.”
 Interpreting the language

I have a theory that we human Florida natives grow up hearing so many bogus sales pitches that we become experts at picking out what’s really being said.
  George Warthen of Fish Wildlife Commission (Image via screen grab)
During last week’s wildlife commission meeting, the FWC’s conservation director, George Warthen, laid out the hunt’s reasons and rules. More than once, he said that a hunt “provides access to the resource.”
When he said that, what I heard was: “All the Elmer Fudd wannabes get to blast away at more wild animals, woo-hoo!”
Warthen also talked about how your population has expanded since 1992, which was nice to hear. But he never mentioned that your population appears to have declined in the last decade.  
Why not? Perhaps because it didn’t fit the narrative that his bosses wanted to hear.
But failing to discuss that sets up the Bear Warriors United lawsuit, which takes aim — oops, sorry! — at the lack of science underlying the vote. It calls the rules of the hunt “woefully vague and unsupported by any current scientific evidence.”
For his presentation, Warthen went through a PowerPoint that included, on a single slide, the date upon which the official bear population estimates were made.
The FWC has divided the state into seven “bear management units,” and for three of them, the date of the most recent population estimate is 2015. A fourth one is from 2014 — before the last hunt. In other words, those numbers are out of date.
Warthen talked about how these population numbers were “good for a generation” but what I think he meant was, “We don’t really have any recent estimate for most of the bear population, but I know y’all are going to do what you want anyway.”
He talked about the amount of habitat occupied by you bears. You’re probably feeling squeezed by all the development going on these days, some of which was done by members of the wildlife commission. While the bear population has declined, the human population has definitely ballooned.
But Warthen told his bosses that you have enough habitat now for the 4,000 or so that live here. Here’s how he spun that:
“While there is enough habitat to support our current bear population, a highly regulated hunt would prevent future negative impacts.”
What I heard was: “If we let hunters kill enough bears now, then the developers who basically run the DeSantis administration can continue destroying even more of their habitat.”
The Floridian interpretation game got really fun when Barreto started bragging about what a great job the commission has been doing.
First he mentioned how alligators have bounced back from the days when they were considered an endangered species. Then he said, “Manatees have been an incredible success story for Florida.”
What he failed to mention is that the comebacks occurred while these species were protected from hunting. In fact, it’s been illegal to kill a manatee in Florida since 1893.  
As of 2019, the FWC estimated that there were about 6,000 manatees swimming around Florida. They’re classified as a threatened species, and yet their population is larger than yours. File that under what Arsenio Hall used to call, “Things that make you go hmmmm.”
Considering the massive manatee die-off caused by the loss of seagrass beds, I don’t think we’ll be seeing the commission declare an open season on sea cows anytime soon. But hey, you never know!
The founding father
The FWC is itself a rare creature. It’s the only state-run wildlife agency in America that’s set up to be an independent commission.
  Clay Henderson via subject
“The idea was to get politics out of wildlife management,” said Clay Henderson, a longtime Florida environmental activist and lawyer.
Henderson is credited with writing the part of the state Constitution that created the wildlife commission. Now, he told me, “I’m the founding father who’s disappointed in his children.”
The state has a Black Bear Management Plan, approved in 2019, that’s intended to govern everything the commission does as it deals with its bear issues, he pointed out. The commission ignored that plan in voting to bring back the hunt, he said.
The Bear Management Plan is supposed to be the blueprint for statewide black bear management until 2027. It emphasizes conflict resolution, habitat protection, and teaching people who move into your habitat how to get along with you, since you were here first.
The Bear Management Plan also encourages the commissioners to use their statutory and constitutional powers to influence land use and development decisions in bear habitat.
Barreto, on the other hand, made a big deal last week about how the commissioners have no control over land-use decisions. He insisted they can’t do anything to protect your habitat from being paved over.
Bowing to a minority
I grew up hunting in the Panhandle, so I’m familiar with the joys of tromping around in the woods to “access the resource” with a Remington 12-gauage.
As a student of Florida history, I also know how important hunters have been in preserving our most important environmental spaces, including the Big Cypress Swamp.
These days, though, hunting is no longer a popular pastime. Only one out of 100 people in Florida owns a hunting license. Yet our public agencies continue acting with extreme deference toward what this small group of people want.
Last December, the FWC staff presented to the commissioners a routine update on the bear management plan. They offered no recommendations for changes.
  Wildlife commissioner Gary Lester, via FWC
But almost as soon as the biologist was done speaking, Commissioner Gary Lester, who works for the developer of The Villages, piped up.
He said he wanted the staff to bring back a proposal for a bear hunt.
There was no preamble, no lengthy discussion, not even a statement of why he wanted it. He just dropped that bombshell and his colleagues voted to make it so.
Lester, by the way, is the person who made the motion last week to approve the unscientific hunting proposal for this year.
When the motion passed, Barreto smirked at the crowd and said, “Anybody surprised?”
Delegating life and death
Here’s the other problem with what the commissioners voted for: It’s unconstitutional.
The item that they voted on specifically calls for holding not just one bear hunt, but bear hunts every year from here on out.
But the commissioners agreed to leave it up to their executive director to pick the dates, set the number of bears to be killed and work out the other details, such as how many hunting licenses to issue. They didn’t even set a specific number of bears to be killed this December. That, too, was left to their executive director.
“They’re delegating these important life-and-death decisions,” Henderson said. “They did this deliberately, so they don’t have to go through the public hearing process every time.”
Considering that nearly 200 people lined up last week to tell the commissioners what they thought of them, you can see why they might want to skip that in 2026, 2027, and so on. But the law says they can’t avoid taking that heat.
Handing off their authority to the executive director is not allowed under the rules for how the commission is set up, said Henderson, who probably knows more about those rules than anyone else.
Thus, the Bear Warriors United lawsuit attacks that weakness as well.
“By removing the bear hunt decision to the ‘executive director or designee,’ the public is denied the due process to be heard concerning the issue and to have the constitutionally appointed officers make the decision,” the lawsuit says.
In a way, though, the ultimate decision on this matter is up to a different public official. I’m talking about the guy who thought it would be a good idea to build golf courses in our state parks and set up a prison camp in the Big Cypress National Preserve.
All seven wildlife commissioners were appointed by Ron DeSantis. One of their number, Gary Nicklaus (yes, the son of the Golden Bear himself, Jack Nicklaus), apparently felt uncomfortable voting for hunting the non-golden variety. He resigned mere days before last week’s meeting.  
  Commissioner Joshua Kellam (Image Fish and Wildlife Commission)
DeSantis — who waited six months to appoint a replacement for his lieutenant governor — fairly leapt to appoint a replacement for Nicklaus ahead of the vote. His pick, who took office two days before the meeting: Joshua Kellam, president of a Palm Beach development and mining company. You can probably guess which way he voted on hunting you poor bears.
My point here is that if the Bear Warriors United lawsuit succeeds in overturning the wildlife commission vote, that’s good for you guys as well as for the value of public opinion in shaping public policy.
But if the Division of Administrative Hearings rules against the Bear Warriors United suit, then it’s time for you bears to act. I can’t tell you what to do, but if you were to show up in large numbers at the governor’s mansion to show him what you normally do in the woods, I think everyone would completely understand.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-21 04:01:01+00:00,CT Mirror,Restorative justice must guide CT’s early childhood investments,Georgia Goldburn,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/21/restorative-justice-must-guide-cts-early-childhood-investments/,CT must adopt a restorative justice  approach in reforming its early childcare education system —one that acknowledges past injustices against Black women.,"Long before “childcare” became a public concern, it was an economic necessity, met by the labor of enslaved and later impoverished Black women. 
Black women cared for white children while being denied the right and opportunity to care for their own. When the government crafted social safety nets under the New Deal, Black women were intentionally excluded from the economic protections that shaped the American middle class. During the New Deal era, landmark labor protections—including Social Security, minimum wage laws, and the right to unionize—excluded domestic and agricultural workers. 
This was no oversight. These were acts of legislative design driven by racial animus and economic convenience; a deliberate compromise with Southern lawmakers seeking to preserve racial hierarchies. These exclusions forced Black women into low-wage, unprotected labor, particularly as caregivers.  As such, America’s childcare system is not broken —it is operating exactly as it was designed: to privatize care, devalue the labor of Black women, and shift costs onto those least able to afford them, producing the fragmented, underfunded, and inequitable system we see today.
This year, Connecticut passed two landmark legislations —House Bill 5003 and Senate Bill 1— that commit over $300 million to early childhood education. These bills aim to establish a permanent funding stream to expand access, stabilize providers, and support families with subsidies and capped co-payments. These are transformative steps in the right direction. 
However, as Connecticut enters a new era of early child care education reform and public investment, we must ask: “What would it mean to repair the harm done to Black women within a reimagined early child care education system?”  I believe Connecticut can offer a model for reparative investments. 
To do so, Connecticut must adopt a restorative justice lens and approach in reforming its early childcare education system —one that explicitly acknowledges past injustices and centers Black women in policy design as leaders and owners, not just as laborers.  Connecticut’s restorative justice measures must encompass more than expanded access, aspirations for equity, and community listening sessions. It must recognize that racialized policies and legislation systematically excluded Black women from wealth-building opportunities and intentionally relegated them to underpaid care work. It must acknowledge that the legacy of these policies has entrenched Black women in low-wage childcare roles while creating barriers to ownership and decision-making. Restorative justice would require nothing less than honoring Black women’s role as America’s first institutional childcare providers, preserving their ownership stake in the system they built, and creating space for them to lead its rebirth.
As Connecticut positions itself to reimagine and reform its early childhood education system, it must resist universal rollout without racial equity safeguards. The risk of not embedding and implementing reparative measures is not only inefficiency, but also the perpetuation of the very inequities this funding seeks to address. Restorative justice demands that implementation be oriented towards those historically harmed, and who continue to be most affected by the legacy of racialized legislation. That success is measured not just by the number of slots created within and for communities of color, but by who benefits and how they benefit. 
While this may be controversial, especially in the age of President Trump, this is not about preference or “DEI” (the way it’s prejoratively and erroneously used) —instead, it’s rooted in the principle of repair.  Far from being a novel or fringe concept, restorative justice is already embedded in Connecticut’s public policy.  The state’s marijuana legalization framework embedded restorative justice by expunging certain low-level past cannabis convictions, reserving half of all new licenses for social equity applicants, and steering tax revenue into communities harmed by the War on Drugs through its Social Equity Fund.
A similar approach would seek to center Black women as leaders, designers, and owners within Connecticut’s reimagined early childhood education system, which is not just restorative—it is imperative. The childcare industry in Connecticut stands on the brink of significant expansion, presenting what I believe is a generational transfer of opportunity.  Yet without intentional policies, legislation, or pathways to leadership and ownership for Black women, we risk replicating the injustice of the past—this time masked as progress.
Connecticut has an opportunity to develop an early childhood education system that reflects our highest values. A system that does more than serve children and families. One that repairs, restores, and reckons with its origins.  Restorative justice means that Black women, who built the early childhood education system through sacrifice and exclusion, are now recognized as its rightful leaders and stewards. For centuries, Black women have been entrusted with the care of America’s children. It is time to entrust them with the resources, respect, and power to lead this industry.
Restorative justice is not just a moral imperative—it is a policy necessity. Because a society that repairs what it has broken can truly nurture every child.  In Connecticut and across the nation, we must deign to build not only a better early childhood education system, but a reparative and just one.

The Nez Perce Tribe and its collaborators will try to eke out a few more years’ survival for Tucannon River Chinook.
“But,” Jay Hesse says, “we also had to ask: What about all the other populations? So in 2021, we started modeling quasi-extinction for all the Snake River spring/summer Chinook and steelhead populations listed under the Endangered Species Act. The results are giving us a better picture of real conditions, and a stronger case for the urgency of action.”

	Mr. Hesse is the director of Biological Services for the Nez Perce Department of Fisheries Resources Management.
Some years ago, federal scientists at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries developed the “quasi-extinction threshold,” which the NOAA uses in planning.
For Snake River Chinook salmon and steelhead, the threshold is fewer than 50 adult fish in a population returning from the ocean for four consecutive years. Below that floor, the population’s continued existence can no longer be scientifically assumed or predicted. It is an emergency signal, flashing red and near black.
The Nez Perce Tribe is applying this science to management of populations below or near the extinction threshold, as well as to public education and long-term science.
Nez Perce Fisheries provided me two maps from its upcoming extinction threshold report for Snake River spring/summer Chinook, and steelhead, updated through 2024 fish returns. These maps show some of the findings, but much else in it will deserve attention.

  Hesse, J.A. and Kinzer, R.N., 2025. Snake River Anadromous Fish Status: Quasi-Extinction Threshold Analysis. Department of Fisheries Resources Management. Version: 09 June, 2025.


	The quasi-extinction threshold results are mapped in four colors:  populations at or below the 50-fish extinction threshold four consecutive years; those at or below the 50-fish threshold in the most recent year; those predicted, on current trend, to be at the 50-fish line within five years; and those predicted to be above that threshold five years from now.

  Hesse, J.A. and Kinzer, R.N., 2025. Snake River Anadromous Fish Status: Quasi-Extinction Threshold Analysis. Department of Fisheries Resources Management. Version: 09 June, 2025.


	Together, the first three categories, all in red-orange shades, are what I call the critical list: populations at dire, perhaps irreversible risk now, and those on their way to that same status within five years at current rates of decline.
Lump those red-orange shades together as you look at the maps. With a little imagination, you will see the near-term extinction trajectory for Snake River salmon and steelhead in geographic motion.
As updated through 2024 fish returns, the report shows six Snake River steelhead populations, 27% of the species’ total number, are on the critical list, below the extinction threshold or heading there soon. Ten Snake River spring/summer Chinook salmon populations, 29% of  that species’ total, are on the critical list. The maps show their locations.

Populations colored yellowish are all those predicted to be above the 50 fish threshold in 2029. These are in motion too. Current rates of decline, if continued, will put a next batch on the critical list soon. The data underlying the maps suggests which and where those will be.
It is not scientific news that Snake River salmon and steelhead are going extinct. These findings further confirm the fact, by newly estimating the current rate and trend of decline at population level.
What’s new, for me, is how extinction threshold analysis, as mapped and made public yearly, allows fish managers, all stripes of salmon people, interested reporters, and Northwest governors and members of Congress to observe Snake River salmon extinction in motion.
The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife also conducts an extinction threshold analysis for these same Snake River populations, with some differences in methodology and data.
“ODFW’s quasi-extinction approach is a little more conservative than the Nez Perce Tribe’s,” says Tucker Jones, the agency’s Columbia River program manager. “Our two results so far are slightly different, but both analyses have arrived at largely the same conclusions and same trend.  When you take different approaches, but come to nearly the same conclusions, that provides more certainty we’re on the right track.”
The department also plans to update its analysis this year.
The extinction threshold findings can be annually volatile, as one somewhat better bad return re-sets its stringent clock. Thus the main story is the trends, for individual populations and the aggregate species.
The 2024 Nez Perce Fisheries’ analysis estimates a 6% per-year decline is occurring across the Snake’s spring-summer Chinook populations, and 11% per-year decline across steelhead populations. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife’s trend estimates will be known soon.

Snake River salmon and steelhead extinction is in motion
Two distinctions between this scientific work, and my use of it here, should be made.
First, extinction in motion is my phrase, not Hesse’s or his Nez Perce Fisheries’ co-author Ryan Kinzer’s.
They are conducting a careful, annually-updated estimate, employing both raw fish counts and modeling, of the rates at which extirpation of individual populations are currently proceeding (or not, should the data show that), and thus extinction of the species continues to approach (or not).
The focus on rates of decline toward extirpation and extinction is a main value this science has now, as salmon scarcity and Tucannon River-like dilemmas multiply. The same science will track the pace and places of salmon recovery, should the actions necessary to produce recovery be taken.
My phrase combines two facts.

	Snake River salmon and steelhead extinction is in motion because current numbers are very low, current distribution badly amputated, and decline is the steady year after year, decade after decade, trend, with a few blips up that were not sustained. And, the Nez Perce Tribe’s quasi-extinction threshold maps allow us to watch this motion, place by place, across years.
Second, except when quoting, I say extinction threshold, without the word quasi. This will not change the Nez Perce Tribe’s, Oregon’s or the NOAA Fisheries’ use of the full phrase in scientific, management and legal contexts where it is a defined, necessary term.
But for most of us that word just gets in the way. Good scientists have developed a last gasp check-point – 50 or fewer fish returning, four years in a row – to mark the entry, by a steelhead or salmon population, into an extinction momentum that will be very difficult to escape.
It is an extinction threshold. For the salmon, rivers, watersheds, communities and salmon people facing it, there is nothing quasi about it.
Salmon risks multiply when numbers plunge so low
Please look again at the maps.
Most of these geographies hold from 50 to 150 miles of identified habitat for one or both fish. Thus, at the official 50 fish extinction threshold, one female or male Chinook, out of 25, must find a partner, also out of 25, in 50 to 150 miles of water.
“That is just a terribly low number of salmon in so much river,” Jay Hesse says.
A landslide or flood scour could destroy a few salmon redds (nests) and their overwintering eggs, when a few are all that exist. Some eagles, bears and humans will find some returning fish before the fish find each other to spawn.
Such local events, of little harm to healthy populations, are major risks to those so near extinction. More destructive are recurring large-scale events – poor ocean conditions, low flows through reservoirs and dams, extended hot water during their long, obstructed upstream migration – that do outsized damage to populations already scraped so low.
The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, and NOAA Fisheries, both make the main scientific point.
The department: The 50 fish or less threshold “is not a milestone on a linear path to extinction.” It is “a tipping point into accelerated extinction risk,” with a “higher likelihood populations will no longer be able to respond favorably to improved conditions.”
The NOAA: “Quasi-Extinction Thresholds represent tipping points for population collapse, where the actual extinction potential may not be predictable or, in some cases, avoidable … The result can be an extinction vortex …”
An extinction vortex operates something like your sink’s drain operates on the last remaining water. It’s too late.
Returning salmon drive the ecology
Hesse always reminds his audiences of the contexts for this extinction analysis.
“Keep in mind that salmon ecology is based on abundance,” he says. “Numbers of returning salmon are not just about salmon. Salmon drive the whole ecology of that population’s geographic area. Fifty or fewer fish signals a total break in that watershed’s ecology, with effects that go well beyond the fish.”
Some breakage is visible to us; many fewer bears, eagles and people hunt the rivers and creeks in season. Much is still invisible to most of us, though nutrient loss is being documented. Salmon nutrition for the waters, lands and life of the territories on the maps above has been close to nothing for 60 years.
“And the harvest cycle, the cultural cycle, which is based on abundance, is also broken,” Hesse says. “That is important to all salmon people, but particularly to tribes that cultural connection is absolutely necessary.”
Hesse and Kinzer use another map to add more context: past extirpations.

  Hesse, J.A. and Kinzer, R.N., 2025. Snake River Anadromous Fish Status: Quasi-Extinction Threshold Analysis. Department of Fisheries Resources Management. Version: 09 June, 2025.


	The colored area is the maps just described. The gray area, north and especially south, is the vast geography, in Oregon, Idaho and Nevada, from which Chinook salmon have already been extirpated, mainly by dams.
Of an estimated 70 abundant populations of Snake River spring/summer Chinook prior to invasion and settlement, 30 are now extirpated. Of 40 steelhead populations pre-settlement, 16 are now extirpated.
The scales of what once was, and what now remains, are so disparate it is hard to put both on one graph or graphic.
In his presentations to public and agency audiences, Hesse experiments with visual ways to relate that not-so-long-ago abundance with today’s plunge to extinction. (Two to six million salmon and steelhead annually is one pre-Caucasian estimate for the Snake River alone.) His most effective way so far is a 16-ounce Starbucks’ Grande cup – the past salmon abundance when filled, today a couple disconnected damp spots on the  bottom of the cup.
“We cannot lose sight that salmon abundance is our goal,” Hesse says.   
Salmon, steelhead and people in northeast Oregon
Eastern Oregon’s tributary watersheds to the Snake River are too varied and distinctive for this stranger to ably summarize, ecologically or humanly.  The mountain, valley and canyon topography does intricate wonders with cold mountain waters that birth the Grande Ronde River, and then steadily refresh it on its long course to the Snake River. (The Grande Ronde has crossed into Washington when it reaches the Snake; 92% of the watershed is in Oregon.)

	Human works add to and subtract from each river. When my interviewees said the names – Wallowa, Lostine, Minam, Wenaha, Grande Ronde, Imnaha, Joseph Creek – I heard something of the depth the names carry for people who know these streams.
Some echoed Kevin March, a retired acupuncturist in La Grande: “One thing here is that many of these rivers and stretches are hard to get to. In canyon country, you can always leave people behind.”
Or John Milbert, a veteran fisherman, gatherer of foods, and writer: “I like to get high in the little tributaries. I enjoy fishing these tributaries because I get to know them intimately from walking and wading them. You get surprises.”
The extinction threshold data led me first to the upper Grande Ronde River, and its large tributary Catherine Creek. (The upper Grande Ronde is roughly the river’s watershed above the town of Elgin.)
In both, significant damage to river function has occurred in headwater areas, from past logging, roading and grazing, and, in both, the salmon nurseries in and passages through the big valleys are now mostly disconnected and ditched.
In the early 1990s, scientists identified eight populations of Snake River spring and summer Chinook in northeast Oregon. Two are deemed extirpated since then: the Lookingglass and Big Sheep populations, in the lower Grande Ronde and Imnaha respectively. Washington’s Asotin population, upstream of the Tucannon, is also extirpated.
“Though extirpated for now, the Tribe does not want any of these taken off the Endangered Species list,” Hesse says. “We don’t want them forgotten, and over time we want them back.”
The Upper Grande Ronde and Catherine Creek host two of northeast Oregon’s six remaining Chinook populations.
Retired lawyer David Baum remembers fishing for salmon long ago, far up the Grande Ronde, at Tony Vey Meadows. And as a boy in the 1950s, he made a spearing platform on a bridge across Catherine Creek at his grandmother’s home.
“A salmon would come up every few minutes in season,” he said. “I had no success, but I saw a lot of salmon going up Catherine Creek.”
No longer. I will offer some numbers, which need not be retained. Their scale and trend is what matters.
Upper Grande Ronde Chinook, returning to 144 miles of identified Chinook habitat, had an estimated return, 2016 through 2022, of 43, 19, 39, 7, 57, 24, 98 and 19 fish. (The Nez Perce update should include the 2024 estimate.) At 20 returning fish, a Chinook must find at least one of 10 possible mates in 144 miles of stream habitat to secure a next generation.
The Nez Perce Fisheries’ map projects that, at current rates of decline, this Chinook population will be at or below the extinction threshold, joining the critical list, by 2029.
In Catherine Creek’s 89 miles of Chinook habitat, the estimated range of adult returns, 2016-2023, is 31 to 190 fish. For now, the Catherine Creek population remains among those not projected at or below 50 fish within five years, but it is uncomfortably close.
The Upper Grande Ronde and Catherine Creek share one steelhead population, with 808 miles of identified habitat. Its return was last above 1,000 in 2016. The 2017-2023 range is 247 to 874. Northeast Oregon wild steelhead are generally in better shape than its Chinook, but are also in decline. Four digit returns become three digit become … is the trendline.

	None of the local fishers I spoke with were surprised.
“If not extinct in Upper Grande Ronde, Chinook must be perilously close,” says John Milbert. “The last carcass I saw was probably 15 years ago.”
Kevin March is a steelhead fisherman: “I don’t fish the upper Grande Ronde, because those are wild fish and the stocks are too low. And I don’t fish for salmon anywhere in eastern Oregon. There are too few.”
John Appleton and his wife Anieta own Alpine Archery and Sport, La Grande’s fishing shop.
“Wild salmon are very low in the upper Grande Ronde; steelhead are better but not good,” Appleton told me.
As for fishing, “in all of northeast Oregon, Chinook fishing any more is really minimal,” he continued. “There is some hatchery-based coho fishing in the fall.”
Fall steelhead fishing, on hatchery stocks, attracts people, though that fishery too can be uncertain.
Kyle Bratcher is district fish biologist for Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. His district includes the lower Grande Ronde from the Wallowa River down, and the Imnaha River.
“In my territory, the salmon in most trouble are Wallowa/Lostine spring Chinook, and Imnaha spring Chinook,” Bratcher said. “They’re not as bad as in the Tucannon, but it’s clear we need to do more for them.”
This Wallowa population was last estimated above 1,000 in 2014, its 2015-20 range is 189 to 750 (the Nez Perce and Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife reports should include more recent data), and it has 137 miles of habitat.
Bratcher and Hesse confirmed the department and Nez Perce Tribe have begun discussion of interim “safety net” actions for Wallowa/Lostine Chinook. Decisions will not be simple.
“Steelhead are depressed in my territory, far below recovery goals, but they are a bit more stable than salmon,” Bratcher added. “Steelhead can use more of our wilderness and inaccessible habitat.”
The fishing people I spoke with generally have more hope for steelhead in the Grande Ronde and Imnaha than for salmon.
“Steelhead range more, they can go up the small streams and creeks, to many more places,” Kevin March said. “I know a farmer who sees them in his little creek.”
Biologist Rick George, now retired from the Confederated Umatilla Tribes, lives in Troy, Oregon, on the lower Grande Ronde. “The Umatilla Tribes are doing some excellent habitat restoration in the Upper Grande Ronde – the McCoy Creek project, for example,” he said. “But I can’t see much hope for salmon in the Grande Ronde with eight dams on the lower Snake and Columbia. We’ve put billions into increasing salmon over several generations of salmon now. I don’t see even a blip of recovery. The systems are pretty empty of salmon, and, without that ocean nutrient freight train, the rivers are more sterile. We have large rivers that look beautiful, but without salmon that is deceiving.”
“I’ve been on the Imnaha for 30 years,” Joe McCormack told me.  “Watching the natural processes, what I see over those 30 years is less and less naturally spawning salmon and steelhead.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Election officials turned over at the highest rate in at least a quarter century during the last presidential election, according to new research from the Bipartisan Policy Center.
An analysis of shifts in election officials published Tuesday found nearly 41% of election officials administering the 2024 election were different than those in 2020. Turnover has accelerated over the past two decades, rising from about 28% in 2004 to 40.9% last year.
The growing percentage of departing election officials comes after years of challenges. They navigated the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as well as harassment and false conspiracy theories surrounding stolen elections that persist today.
The analysis released by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based group that seeks to foster policy cooperation across party lines, represents an updated version of a report that previously examined turnover from 2004 to 2022. The new research, which extends the data through 2024, shows the turnover rate continued to climb.

The change means that, over time, election officials have less experience. The research found that the share of chief local election officials with six or more years in their role has dropped from 60% in 2006 to 47% in 2024.
But last year, 60% of election officials had previously overseen the administration of a presidential election in their jurisdiction.
“Despite increasing turnover and loss of experience, the majority of chief election officials still have experience running at least one presidential election cycle,” the analysis said. “This is important because presidential elections typically see the highest turnout and are the most visible elections administered.”
The analysis found that over the long term, election official turnover rates have been rising gradually in small jurisdictions, defined as areas with fewer than 100,000 voting-age residents. But large jurisdictions have experienced a more sudden jump in turnover.
Small jurisdictions had a 27% turnover rate in 2004 that had risen to 40% in 2024. But large jurisdictions enjoyed a turnover rate as low as 31% in 2018 before climbing rapidly to nearly 46% last year.

Jim Pillen meets with troops at the southern border in Texas. (Courtesy of the Governor's Office)LINCOLN — The media spectacle of Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen unveiling plans for a new Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in the southwestern part of the state follows a political playbook from the Trump administration.
President Donald Trump’s Department of Homeland Security touted the new facility, saying it would help ICE agents “remove the worst of the worst” — despite the governor and state agency heads explaining it would house only low-level and medium-risk immigration-related detainees.
Speaking inside McCook’s Ben Nelson Regional Airport as protesters gathered outside, Pillen said he was “proud to be a part of Trump’s Team” in an effort to “make sure we keep our community safe. He pointed to a previous arrest of an MS-13 “kingpin” in Omaha as a justification for the ICE partnership.

“This stuff hits close to home and hits every corner of this state and country,” Pillen repeated in a Wednesday evening post on X. “Government’s most important job is to keep us safe.”
Dona-Gene Barton, a political science professor who studies political behavior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, said it was no surprise Nebraska would want to join Trump’s expansion of ICE detention efforts as the agency tries to meet its goal of increasing deportations.
“This is a Republican governor showing support for a Republican president’s agenda,” Barton said.
Trump, throughout his 2024 presidential campaign, promised voters what he called “the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History,” after the Biden administration saw illegal border crossings spike at the end of 2023 but start decreasing last year.  
ICE is poised to become the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency because of the recently passed “One Big Beautiful Bill” that pays for much of Trump’s domestic agenda. Roughly $45 billion in the law was set aside to build, rent and staff new centers to detain immigrants, like the one Nebraska plans to operate for ICE at the state prison system’s McCook Work Ethic Camp. 
Other funding would be allocated toward hiring 10,000 ICE officers within five years, providing retention bonuses, covering the transportation of immigrants, upgrading ICE facilities, detaining families and hiring ICE immigration lawyers for enforcement and removal proceedings in immigration court.
Using Nebraska’s McCook facility, a medium-security prison, is part of a detention expansion strategy aimed at reviving dormant prisons, repurposing military bases and securing partnerships with private prison contractors, local sheriffs and GOP governors to house a record number of detainees, The Washington Post reported. 
The nationwide ICE expansions come as recent polling suggests a majority of Americans now disapprove of Trump’s handling of immigration, though most Republicans still support it. Recent polling indicates a shift in people’s attitudes from last year, when more Americans supported less immigration and stricter immigration enforcement. 
The state also experienced an ICE raid on Glenn Valley Foods in Omaha earlier this year, which sparked protests in the state’s largest city and in Lincoln.

Several local Democrats, advocacy groups, and everyday Nebraskans have raised concerns about the federally dubbed “Cornhusker Clink,” calling it a “​​harmful, dangerous and rapid expansion.”
The Nebraska Democratic Party said the facility is “yet another ‘bend the knee’ moment by top Republicans in Nebraska.” It said Republicans promised to “go after criminals” but “instead locked up hardworking” people who contribute to the state’s agricultural economy.
State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln, a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, told the Examiner he had questions about whether the facility would require the state to provide funding and whether an ICE detention center is needed in the state.
“For [Pillen] to be showing off to the federal administration in this way just seems out of touch with everyday Nebraskans,” Dungan said. “All of it is because we have an administration that’s failed to actually deal with any kind of real immigration reform.” 
Most Republican state senators reached by the Examiner have said they are on board with the new effort in Nebraska. State Sen. Loren Lippincott of Central City, a conservative who has carried bills Trump sought, including efforts to change how Nebraska counts its Electoral College votes for president, said he fully supports the McCook facility “as Nebraskans in service to a safer America.” 
State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, often a conservative swing vote in the Legislature, told the Examiner, “If Nebraska has the capacity to help out, I don’t think that we should resist … as long as it’s a good and fair and legal process.”
The Nebraska Republican Party said the announcement “demonstrates the seriousness of the crisis and the need for leadership that prioritizes Nebraska families.”
Pillen’s office said any “backlash to this initiative is politically motivated.”

“It’s simple. Those who are opposed to Nebraska doing its fair share in securing our nation’s border want to relive the failed Biden-era open-border policies,” said Laura Strimple, a Pillen spokeswoman. “Nebraskans spoke loud and clear last November and demanded order at the border.” 
Barton, the UNL professor, said the tough talk on immigration from Pillen is a similar political playbook to ones used by Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis when it came to “Alligator Alcatraz,” the Florida-run immigration detention facility in the Everglades. 
“The issue is this rhetoric doesn’t match reality,” Barton said. “This rhetoric doesn’t even match what Governor Pillen has said about the facility being used to house low to medium security risks.”
Nebraska officials said the facility will be the Midwestern hub for ICE detentions. Pillen, during his Tuesday press conference at McCook, said the center could hold migrants from nearby states. Neighboring Colorado, led by Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, has recently pushed back against helping ICE with immigration enforcement.
The Work Ethic Camp in McCook would be converted to house up to 300 migrants. The state prison was designed to house up to 200 people. Florida’s “Alligator Alcatraz” was designed to house 3,000 and could accommodate up to 5,000. Indiana’s new ICE facility, which the feds nicknamed the “Speedway Slammer,” is expected to hold up to 1,000. 
As for the Nebraska facility’s name, it appears to be part of a broader PR strategy by the White House to use visuals that aim to persuade migrants without legal status to leave the country, while also signaling that the administration will not tolerate resistance.
Homeland Security, for instance, posted an AI-generated photo of a cornfield with ICE hats with a caption of “Coming Soon: The Cornhusker Clink” next to a corn emoji.
The names of the immigration detention facilities and online memes surrounding them are aimed at gaining media attention and riling up a part of the GOP base that supports Trump’s approach to immigration enforcement, Barton said. 
Barton said the Nebraska facility’s small capacity shows it is “largely symbolic,” meant to demonstrate support for Trump’s approach. 
“It’s not only a way to show support for Donald Trump’s agenda, but show the electorate that these detention centers are going to be throughout the United States,” she said.

Mikie Sherrill (D) saying Wednesday she would freeze utility rates if elected and Jack Ciattarelli (R) accusing Sherrill of backing ""failed energy policies."" (Photos by Reena Rose Sibayan/Amanda Brown)The rising cost of electricity became a central focus of the governor’s race on Wednesday when Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D) pledged to freeze utility rates if she’s elected and Jack Ciattarelli (R) argued Sherrill’s party is to blame for the spike in rates customers saw starting in June.
Sherrill, speaking outside a private residence in Kenilworth, said she would declare a state of emergency over utility rates on “day one” if she becomes New Jersey’s next governor. She said rising electric bills are “breaking the back of too many families when we have an overall affordability crisis.”
“So much of that pain is coming from electric bills, and the rate hikes are forcing families to make impossible choices between putting food on the table and paying for electric bills,” she said.
Sherrill said the average New Jersey family would not see an increase in utility rates for one year under her plan.
She also pledged to “massively increase” in-state power generation to bring down the cost of energy, including by supporting new solar and battery storage projects, expediting upgrades at existing nuclear plants, modernizing natural gas plants, and more.
It’s not clear whether Sherrill, if she’s elected governor, would have the power to freeze utility rates. She said it would be an action no other governor has taken.
Sherrill and Ciattarelli are competing in November to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat wrapping up two terms in office.
A spokesman for Ciattarelli, who has hammered New Jersey Democrats as responsible for soaring utility rates, did not comment directly on Sherrill’s pledge to freeze rates. But in a statement, Ciattarelli said Sherrill has been a “lockstep supporter of Phil Murphy’s failed energy policies.” 
“When I’m Governor, things are going to change. I’ll ban offshore wind and diversify our energy sources in New Jersey to once again include natural gas and nuclear,” he said. “I’ll rewrite our master plan and deliver safe, clean, and sustainable energy to everyone in our state at a price you can afford.”
New Jersey Democrats, anxious over New Jersey’s November election, when the governor’s race and all 80 Assembly seats will be on the ballot, have tried to pin the blame for rising electric bills on PJM Interconnection, the grid operator for New Jersey and 12 other states. They say PJM has been too slow to add renewable energy projects to its grid. Republicans say the fault lies with Murphy’s focus on renewable energy, including offshore wind projects that have failed to materialize.

June 14, 2025. | Photo by Erick Diaz VelizBlocking public roadways and highways in an act of mass protest could saddle groups expressing their First Amendment rights with misdemeanor charges, heavy fines and possible jail time under a Republican bill discussed Wednesday by a Michigan House panel.
House Bill 4664, sponsored by state Rep. Alicia St. Germaine (R-Harrison Township), was before the House Judiciary Committee, which adopted a substitute altering the bill but took no further action after hearing testimony.
St. Germaine said her bill was aimed at ensuring public safety and preventing obstructions to traffic when groups hold political actions in areas designated for motor vehicles.
The bill would change the current civil infraction for blocking the flow of traffic to a misdemeanor punishable by up to 93 days in jail and up to a $5,000 fine, or both.
“It’s a problem, and we all have the right to free speech and to assemble to express our opinions,” St. Germaine said. “Where that ends is when you block people or hold them hostage, because that’s exactly what’s going on in some of these scenarios.”

The bill sponsor showed the committee short, edited and glossed up TikTok videos of protests where it was insinuated that demonstrators had caused some kind of dangerous obstruction.
But state Rep. Kara Hope (D-Holt) noted that it appeared that some of the videos showed instances where the drivers were in the wrong because they drove their vehicles into protesters, thereby assaulting them in the process.
The conversation broke into a short debate over who was at fault in situations where drivers become aggressive against protesters, with St. Germaine saying it was unfair to not hold a protester accountable for blocking a roadway. She was also adamant that blocking someone in their car for a long period while protesters made their political points amounted to hostage taking and false imprisonment.
State Rep. Kelly Breen (D-Novi) was quick to note that the bill covers only fault for the protesters, some of whom might become injured through the aggressive actions of a driver if they ram protesters with their vehicle. Breen said that protesters could, under the bill, become seriously injured by someone who was frustrated with the protest and then also face jail time for expressing their right to free assembly.

Macomb County Prosecutor Peter Lucido and Oakland County Sheriff Mike Bouchard testified in favor of the bill.
Bouchard said the current civil infraction doesn’t provide for a meaningful deterrent against the unlawful blocking of a roadway, especially in the instance of a group making a political statement.
“We’ve seen individuals and groups shut down highways with little or no consequences, and it creates a significant risk to public safety,” Bouchard said. “Blocking a roadway is not merely an inconvenience. It has life and death ramifications for first responders that rely on open roads to reach people in need, and even a delay of minutes, which I’ve seen tragically as a former fatal accident investigator, means the difference between life and death and losing someone.”
There was some debate about whether the bill expressly prohibited protests or just groups of people. St. Germaine noted instances of parties forming on highways as a gimmick.
The substitute adopted by the committee on Wednesday changes the initial language from a group of 10 or more people to an assembly of individuals.
Bouchard said, however, that an assembly is not a clearly defined term, pulling from his time in the Legislature.

Kyle Zawacki, legislative director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, said his organization was opposed to the bill. He said the ACLU was deeply concerned about what the bill would mean for the free exercise of speech and the right to peacefully assemble.
“Demonstrations on public streets have long been utilized for political speech, marches, rallies. Protests all require a physical space to occupy in order to exist,” Zawacki said. “Michigan’s highways do not exist in a vacuum, and vehicular blockades are not a new form of protest, nor are the government’s frequent attempts to suppress these public demonstrations and silence dissent through police force and legal intimidation.”
Zawacki added that it was apparent that drivers hate to be inconvenienced when protests block streets.
“However, driving is not a right, it is a privilege,” Zawacki said. “Protesting, on the other hand, is a fundamental constitutional right.”
That comment started a debate between Zawacki and state Rep. Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay), who said that he and others have a fundamental right to move freely unimpeded through the state and across state lines.
“That has been affirmed over and over and over again by courts and the Supreme Court,” DeBoyer said. “I know that we’re not talking about lawful protest, we’re talking about unlawful protest. … There is a significant difference.”
Zawacki said he wanted to be clear that the ACLU’s position was that it was against the increase of penalties from a civil infraction to a misdemeanor. As to whether a roadway is a proper or protected venue for a protest, Zawacki noted Hague v. The Committee for Industrial Organization, a U.S. Supreme Court case from 1939, which spelled out that such a right does exist.
DeBoyer, undeterred, cited Saenz v. Roe, a 1999 U.S. Supreme Court case. Although the Saenz ruling did reaffirm the right to free travel, the holding had other key components limited to the case, which had to do with residency requirements for welfare benefits in California. The ruling mostly held that “the right to travel prevents states from imposing durational residency requirements that withhold the privileges and immunities of a state’s citizens from people who have newly arrived in that state,” according to the legal information website Justia. 
The case didn’t deal with the free travel rights of individuals throughout the U.S. unimpeded by roadway protesters, either.

“We’re not complying with the court orders,” said Commissioner Bridget Thorne, a Republican who represents north Fulton. “We’ve had two hearings, one on Friday, one on Monday, forcing us to comply. And the decision today was to not comply.”
The vote came down 2-2 with three members of the commission not present.
Georgia Republican Party Chairman Josh McKoon called the development “outrageous” and called fort he commissioners to be punished.
“A Petition for Contempt of Judge (David) Emerson’s Order should be filed immediately and I hope the Judge will consider not only a fine but jail time for the unlawful defiance of a lawful court order!” McKoon said in a statement.
Commissioner Dana Barrett, a Democrat whose district includes all of the Atlanta neighborhoods of Buckhead and parts of Midtown and the suburb of Sandy Springs, said she doesn’t know what could come next.
“It’s really hard to say. I don’t know what’s in the judge’s mind about that,” she said. “He can choose jail or fines, I think, and that’s really going to be up to him. I think the jail thing is a little bit confusing because when it is a civil charge like this, the whole idea is that you’d be in jail until you solved the problem – which, we can’t vote from jail — so I’m not sure if it really works in this case, but I think he has the ability to do it. So making the vote, for me, I had to be prepared to face those consequences.”
The politics and policy behind the case
The Fulton County Registration and Elections Board consists of two members appointed by each major political party and a chair selected by the Board of Commissioners. Fulton County, which is home to Atlanta, is Georgia’s most populous county with more than 1 million residents, and among the likeliest to support Democratic candidates, though the northern suburbs are more conservative.
In May, the Fulton County Republican Party nominated incumbent board member Julie

Adams and newcomer Jason Frazier, but the commissioners declined, citing concerns about their past actions.
Adams refused to certify the 2024 results in Fulton’s presidential preference primary and filed a failed lawsuit against the county, arguing that board members have the option to refuse to certify election results if they have concerns. In a ruling similar to the one now at issue with the commission, judges said election superintendents’ roles are actually to certify the results and not to investigate or veto them.
Democrats say Frazier challenged thousands of Fulton County voter registrations.
Speaking at the May meeting, Commissioner Marvin Arrington, a Democrat whose district includes parts of Atlanta and south Fulton, said he could not approve the two because of their politics.
“The problem we have in this country is the far right and the far left,” he said. “The answers and the solutions are in the middle. And I want to applaud the Democratic Party for nominating people that are in the center and not nominating people that are in the far left. And I think the Republican Party ought to take a look at their people and not nominate people that are on the far right and nominate people that are in the center. That’s where all of our answers and our solutions are. There is no way I can vote to support either of these people.But if y’all present some people that are in the center, they can get approved.”
Arrington was not present for Wednesday’s vote.
Obligations of the word ‘shall’ 
The county GOP took the commissioners to court, where the legal debate centered around the meaning of the word “shall” in state law.
The law says the members of the board “shall” appoint two members appointed by each major party, while the chair is appointed by the board of commissioners.
The county GOP said that shall means the board’s job is to approve the people nominated by the parties as long as they meet basic required standards like living in the county, being an elector and not being an elected official.
Democrats on the board said the word “shall” leaves more wiggle room – that the power to appoint also includes the power to reject.
“I am very willing to appoint from nominees that are put forth by the Republican Party of Fulton County,” Barrett said. “But not everybody gets a pass. What if they put up a murderer? I’m not going to appoint a murderer. So there has to be some discretion on my part to say no to particular nominees, but still only to choose from their nominees.”
Superior Court Judge David Emerson agreed with the Republican Party, issuing an Aug. 3 order calling on the commissioners to approve Adams and Frazier.
“There is nothing in the statute to support the BOC theory that the county commissioners can veto the chairperson’s nominees other than for failure of the nominee to meet the two qualifications and one restriction,” Emerson wrote.
“The General Assembly placed the discretion in the county executive committee chairperson. It is up to the Fulton County Commission to follow the law and honor that person’s nominations,” he added.
They didn’t do that Wednesday, and Commissioner Mo Ivory, a Democrat who represents Atlanta and parts south, indicated that she’s not likely to change her stance.
“No one should force an elected official or any voter to cast a particular vote. We’re opening up a very scary door to do that, no matter where your politics lies. Our residents deserve appointees who are unquestionably committed to fairness, transparency, and ethical standards in our election administration. This is not about personalities or politics, although that’s what grabs the headlines. It is about ensuring that the board of registrations and elections in Fulton County is held to the highest level of accountability and that our elections are fair.
The Board of Commissioners has filed an appeal in the lawsuit.
What about next week’s election?
A special election to replace former state Sen. Brandon Beach, a Republican who stepped down to serve as U.S. Treasurer under President Donald Trump, is scheduled for Tuesday. The district includes part of north Fulton County and much of neighboring Cherokee County.
Thorne said that race can be certified even if the situation is still unsettled next week.
“Julie Adams continues to serve on the board until they appoint someone else, and so (Republicans) will just only have one member on that board to certify the elections, look over the results, follow that,” she said. “They’ve just got to get a majority of the board. So it’s supposed to be a five-member board, so if they get three votes, they’ll go ahead and certify the election.”
Thorne said Adams will be forced to vote yes on the winner even if she has reservations because of a rule similar to the one she wants the Democrats on the commission to follow.
“Under her lawsuit, they told her she ‘shall’ — just like here, she ‘shall’ certify — on Monday at 5 o’clock, and she can’t vote no,” Thorne said. “So they should have four votes to certify, no matter what.”

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Administrators representing the three colleges located at Denver’s Auraria Campus during a hearing Wednesday defended the institutional responses to an anti-war encampment that occurred last year.
The 10-member Colorado Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights oversees an investigation into alleged antisemitism at the Auraria Campus, site of the University of Colorado Denver, Community College of Denver and Metropolitan State University of Denver.
In April 2024, anti-war demonstrators set up an encampment on the Auraria Campus quad, in protest of university policies relating to Israel and the war in Gaza. They called for the university to condemn “the genocidal actions of Israel” and divest from companies that manufacture weapons or operate in Israel.
Police in riot gear arrested at least 40 demonstrators a day after the encampment was set up. Anti-war protests continued on the Auraria Campus throughout the spring 2024 semester. Skip Spear, the chief administrative officer and general counsel for the Auraria Higher Education Center, said during the committee’s virtual hearing that 81 people were arrested in relation to the anti-war demonstrations, 33 of whom were affiliated with the colleges.

“(The Auraria Higher Education Center) did everything in its power to keep our campus safe through our limited police department, but we did not have the resources to respond to a disturbance this large, without assistance,” Spear said. 
In response to last year’s anti-war encampments on college campuses across the country, the Trump administration has targeted universities like Harvard, Columbia and UCLA for antisemitism probes and research funding freezes.
The committee’s goal with the investigation is to “contribute to more informed approaches to federal, state, and education policy in higher education and develop recommendations” directed to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and other federal entities.
David Fine, the general counsel for MSU Denver, said that few of the April 2024 demonstrators were MSU Denver students.
“MSU Denver is very different from a school like Columbia, for example, where parents can afford to spend roughly $100,000 a year to have their students sit in encampments for weeks,” Fine said. “Our students are working their way through school, and they’re here to get a degree and get a job.”
After college administrators spoke during the Wednesday hearing, the committee hosted a community forum, which was also virtual. Several professors, alumni and students spoke.










The encampment was mostly coordinated by undergraduate students, who were protected by nothing but tents and their trust in each other, staring down armed police in riot gear on their own campus, without escalating.

Chloe East, an economics professor at the University of Colorado Boulder who previously taught at the Auraria campus, said during the forum that she went to the encampment several times and spoke to student demonstrators. East said the encampment was an “inclusive and welcoming space.”
“We are seeing attacks on free speech at the federal level, with the Trump administration targeting students and others around the country whose views he does not agree with,” East said. “I urge the committee not to bring these kinds of attacks on free speech to our state and to our schools.”
Jessica Ellis, a student at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, said she attended the April encampment, where she saw an “atmosphere that was peaceful, positive and prioritized growth and learning.” 
“In my entire life, this encampment was the largest, most intentional and authentic display of interfaith and multiethnic cooperation and respect,” Ellis said. “The encampment was mostly coordinated by undergraduate students, who were protected by nothing but tents and their trust in each other, staring down armed police in riot gear on their own campus, without escalating.”
Ellis added, “I emphatically disagree with the allegations of widespread antisemitism during this encampment.”
Brandon Rattiner, the senior director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Colorado, said in a July interview with Colorado Newsline that he hopes the work of the committee can spotlight “the experiences that made life on campus really difficult for Jewish students, and also create pressure for universities to do better.”
He added, however, that there “are many people in our community who are uncomfortable with the way combating antisemitism has been used to attack higher education in the abstract in this country.”
“We want to make sure that this process stays focused on our real concerns, and doesn’t turn Jewish pain into a political football that is being used to advance political agendas,” Rattiner said.
Since Israel’s intense bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza began after Oct. 7, 2023, when a Hamas-led attack killed more than 1,200 people in Israel, at least 60,000 Palestinians are reported to have been killed, while many more have been injured and face widespread hunger.
The committee’s next public hearing is scheduled for Sept. 3, when Auraria Campus student organizations and other impacted people are set to testify.

“We’ve had a healthy working relationship with the federal government over these past 11 months since Hurricane Helene swept through western North Carolina,” Stein said. “In terms of the extent of federal support, it has not met the moment.”

According to Stein, federal agencies including the Federal Emergency Management Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, and others have provided less than $5 billion in relief toward the roughly $60 billion in damages the state suffered from the disaster.
He expressed dismay that the Trump administration’s response to Helene has been to float ending FEMA altogether.
“The scale of these storms are massive — $60 billion in western North Carolina from Hurricane Helene,” Stein said. “Those kinds of resources don’t exist in western North Carolina to respond. Heck, our state two-year budget is $66 billion, so essentially we would have to forgo the entire two-year budget just to get western North Carolina back to where it was before.”
The state legislature has appropriated more than $1 billion in funding to support Helene recovery since January, though that represents less than 2% of the storm’s toll on the region. In February, Stein traveled to Washington to request $19 billion in relief — meeting with North Carolina senators Thom Tillis and Ted Budd — though in the months since, Congress has not passed further Helene aid.
“We’re going to continue to make our case to our congressional delegation and to the administration to urge them to support western North Carolina to the degree that is necessary,” Stein said. “We need a lot of help for western North Carolina, and we hope that that funding will come.”
Earlier this month, Stein wrote to the Trump administration seeking a major disaster declaration due to the impacts of Tropical Depression Chantal.  That storm left more than 100 roads impassable due to flooding, washouts, sinkholes, and structural damage. Orange County residents forced from their homes by Chantal’s torrential rains pleaded for additional relief on Wednesday.  Many worry they could be homeless when disaster assistance from the county and private citizens runs out at the end of the month.
As for the prospect of federal help in response to Hurricane Erin — projected to bring severe winds and flooding to the North Carolina coast and especially the Outer Banks through Thursday — Stein said it “remains to be seen.”
“We haven’t needed to call upon those resources to respond to the immediate aftermath of the storm,” Stein said. “We just have to wait and see what the extent of the damage is and whether it has any impacts on our ongoing ability to get the support we need from the federal government.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages2025-Helene-MarioTama-1024x698.jpg,,,2025-08-20 20:57:28.022083

Chris Wilson, R-Logan, listens during a press conference with Senate leadership at the Capitol in Salt Lake City on the first day of the legislative session, Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2025. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Earlier this year, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox vetoed a bill that would have given him and the state Senate power over choosing the next Utah Supreme Court chief justice — but now, Utah lawmakers are moving to bring it back in a potential special session in September. 
This time, however, the bill’s sponsor, Senate Majority Whip Chris Wilson, R-Logan, has included a key change: the next chief justice would have a single, eight-year term, rather than being subject to reappointment every four years. 
Currently, the Utah Supreme Court’s five justices elect their own chief justice. But earlier this year, the Utah Legislature passed SB296, one of several bills that sought to exert more legislative influence over the judiciary. It would have required the Utah Supreme Court chief justice to be subject to reappointment from the governor — and Senate confirmation — every four years.
Cox, when he issued his veto, specifically took issue with the four-year term provision included in SB296, calling it “problematic” to require reappointment so often. But Wednesday, while presenting his draft legislation to the Judiciary Interim Committee, Wilson said a deal has been struck. 
Cox vetoes bill that would have given governor power over appointing Utah chief justice

“This … is a compromise bill that we’ve been negotiating with the governor,” Wilson said. 
If lawmakers pass his bill as currently written, after Utah’s current Chief Justice Matthew Durrant vacates his seat or his term ends in April 2028, the governor will appoint a new chief justice, subject to confirmation from the Utah Senate. The bill would also limit a justice from serving as  chief justice for more than one, eight-year term. 
Wilson also said the bill would align Utah with 13 other states that allow the governor to appoint their chief justices. Currently, Utah is among 22 states that let justices elect their chief justice. 
Wilson said with these changes, “the governor is completely on board with this legislation.” 
“We’ve been negotiating with him for a number of months,” Wilson said. “So yes, he is on board with this bill.” 
Cox’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday seeking to verify Wilson’s comments. The judiciary also hasn’t taken a public position on the new bill. A spokesperson for the Utah Supreme Court said the judiciary didn’t have a comment on it. 
The Judiciary Interim Committee later voted to favorably recommend Wilson’s draft legislation for consideration during the potential special session next month. The motion passed on a vote of 7-4 from House committee members and 4-1 from Senate committee members, with Democrats voting against. 
No veto override session this year, Utah legislative leaders say

The apparent compromise came after Republican legislative leaders announced this spring that they would not be calling a veto override session this year after Cox stopped SB296, along with five other bills, from becoming law. Instead, they said they would “focus on constructive dialogue and thoughtful policymaking during the interim to find the best path forward that benefits all Utahns.” 
Cox had previously said he expected to call a special session in May to deal with several bills he signed with the expectation that they would be tweaked to address various issues, but the month came and went without a call as discussions took longer than expected. Now, he’s expected to issue the call for sometime in September. 
Cox hasn’t yet issued an official agenda, but lawmakers this week discussed several drafts of legislation they expect to be considered, including the new version of SB296. 
Why do Utah lawmakers want to change how the chief justice is selected?
Wilson has argued that requiring the chief justice to be appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate would allow for more public input in the selection of the chief justice, who leads the state’s Judicial Council, the policy-making body for the judiciary. 
But the bill also came during a time of unusual tension between lawmakers and the Utah Supreme Court, which has issued several rulings that have upset Republican legislative leaders. 
Wilson’s SB296 was one of several bills that surfaced during the 2025 Utah Legislature that sought to exert more control over the judiciary. The tension between the GOP-controlled Legislature and the judiciary reached a fever pitch during the 2025 session, when legal professionals and even some Utah Supreme Court justices criticized lawmakers’ bills as an attack on the judicial branch’s independence. 
But that clash largely fizzled when Utah’s Republican legislative leaders announced they had struck a deal with the judiciary to drop the most controversial proposals, including a bill that would have given legislators a say in judicial retention elections. In exchange, other bills including SB296 would advance, with the Judicial Council taking a neutral position. 
After weeks of division, Utah legislative leaders announce deal with judiciary

Despite that compromise, however, Cox vetoed SB296 anyway. He wrote in a letter to legislative leaders that while the new power was “tempting,” he took issue with requiring the chief justice to be reappointed every four years. 
“Supporters of the bill correctly point out that the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. If that were all the bill did, it is something I could support,” Cox wrote. “However, this bill takes a very meaningful and problematic additional step: requiring the appointment process to occur every four years.”
Cox also wrote that it’s “not lost on me that this bill actually gives me — the governor — more power than I currently possess.”
“I admit it is very tempting to sign this bill and assure that the Chief Justice would need to stay in my good graces to retain his or her position,” Cox continued. “Knowing the head magistrate of our state’s highest court would have to think twice before ruling against me or checking my power is difficult to reject.” 
However, Cox concluded, “just because I can doesn’t mean I should.” 
After Cox’s veto, House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, and Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, issued a joint statement saying Cox’s decision “undermines that good-faith compromise” between the Legislature and judiciary that ultimately led to lawmakers abandoning the other bills, and the Judicial Council and Utah State Bar taking a neutral position.”

They also said the Legislature “remains firm in its commitment to improve transparency, efficiency, and integrity within all branches of government to ensure we’re responsive to and representative of the people in our state.” 
Arguments 
During the bill’s public comment period on Wednesday, a Utahn, Steven Rosenberg, opposed the change, questioning its need. 
“If something isn’t broken, then why are we changing it? If it’s worked through the history of this great state of Utah, why must we change it now?” Rosenberg said. “Leave it alone. Let it be. Let the justices choose their own leader and let the branches be separate as they were intended.” 
Sen. Todd Weiler, R-Wood Cross, pushed back, arguing the Utah Constitution allows the Legislature to decide the process for how the chief justice is selected. 
The Sutherland Institute, a conservative think tank, also circulated a statement to the Judiciary Interim Committee expressing support for the bill, saying it was “grateful the Legislature is considering measures to strengthen the institutions of free government through creating reasonable checks and balances.”
“This will help ensure that the judiciary can focus on its constitutional mandate to faithfully apply existing law,” the Sutherland Institute’s statement continued. “Ultimately, what is needed is for each branch of government to fulfill its constitutional functions fully and independently. For the judiciary, that requires judges to be committed to the constitutional principle that the text of the constitution and of the laws enacted pursuant to its authority governs their decisions rather than considerations of policy.”
During the bill’s debate, Weiler made a point of noting that the chief justice doesn’t have the power to tell the Utah Supreme Court’s other four judges how to rule on decisions or decide what cases get heard. 
Utah Supreme Court disputes lawmakers’ allegations that it’s not productive enough

Rather, the chief justices’ duties primarily entail acting as the chief administrative officer for the judiciary, responsible for administering the day-to-day operations of the court. The chief justice also acts as presiding officer of the Utah Judicial Council, which is the governing body of the courts’ administrative rules. 
Sen. Brady Brammer, R-Alpine, argued that many other top positions within other state agencies and branches of government are chosen through appointment and confirmation processes. 
He also said “underlying this” bill are “some administrative concerns as far as decision work load within the court.” 
“Some of this is to say, ‘Hey, there may be at times something that isn’t quite functioning on the broader scale in terms of the number of decisions,’ which have decreased quite a bit over the last few years,” Brammer said, alluding to a complaint he made earlier this year that the Utah Supreme Court was being “productive” enough. 
In a rare statement issued in February, the Utah Supreme Court disputed those allegations. 
“I think they’re working to fix that,” Brammer added, “but that is one of the things that was an impetus for making this change, so there’s a little more input, a little more push, on the commitments that are made with regards to the nuts and bolts functioning of the court, which the chief justice has a lot to do with.”

Powell County will pay a $500 fine for violating the Stream Protection Act after an amphibious vehicle on contract with the county rolled through a portion of the Blackfoot River.
Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks notified Powell County it was in violation in an August 11 letter, and Commissioner Dan Sager said Wednesday the county agreed to pay the fine.
“We really had no grounds to fight it. Our subcontractor was definitely in violation, and it comes back to us,” Sager said.
An earlier news release from the county said the contractor should have consulted with the county’s weed coordinator or acquired a permit prior to the weed control work.
Sager said the weed board agreed the fine should be paid, commissioners approved the payment Wednesday, and the private company will reimburse the county for the fine.
The contract was not available from Powell County on Wednesday afternoon.
In a statement, Commissioner Bill Hooker earlier apologized to the Powell County community and all who enjoy the Blackfoot River.
“Powell County takes pride in its stewardship of one of the state’s most popular and cherished recreational streams,” Hooker said. “We will continue to strive to make sure we protect the natural wonders we are so fortunate to enjoy.”
FWP spokesperson Greg Lemon said $500 is the maximum penalty allowed by law.
However, a conservation advocate who is among a group that reported the incident to FWP and a federal official said the amount might not be enough to deter other bad actors.
Keith Hammer, chairman of the Swan View Coalition, said he’s heard the way some operators dismiss penalties, such as snowmobilers who motor into closed areas.
“We call that bragging rights,” Hammer said of the way some perpetrators react to fines.
He said $500 is minuscule compared to the cost of the vehicle itself, potentially tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars. Hammer also said he believes the penalty should “sting” and possibly be equal to a portion of the contract.
“If it doesn’t take a big chunk out of their profit on that contract, it’s essentially meaningless,” Hammer said.
Hammer was among 20 conservationists including organization leaders who signed an August 11 letter to FWP and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service expressing “our utmost disgust” at the incident.
The letter said the vehicle ran at least 9.5 miles down the river including through bull trout pools — and, Hammer said, possibly churning through springs in the river where bull trout try to stay cool.
The letter said the event took place at a time the native and threatened species are under increased pressure from heat, drought and low water levels.
“Crashing through pools caused great damage,” the letter said.
Just this week, FWP itself warned anglers against causing stress on federally protected bull trout. A news release and corresponding materials said the species need cold and clear water to survive and are “highly vulnerable” to silt.
FWP spokesperson Lemon said the agency called the perpetrator out of the river the same day it received a report of the incident, and they complied.
He said FWP put staff on the river one day later and found only minimal impacts.
“We saw tracks in the gravel, which we expected to see, but there didn’t seem to be much impact, and we didn’t see any dead fish,” Lemon said.
Hammer said he doesn’t believe fish need to immediately die to be harmed, and he said he hopes the federal Fish and Wildlife Service conducts an investigation too.
A spokesperson for the Fish and Wildlife Service could not be reached Wednesday.
Commissioner Sager said he is not aware of any federal investigation, but he said the county views the fine from the state as reasonable.
“It could have been a lot worse — and shouldn’t have ever happened in the first place,” Sager said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1380958948-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-20 19:57:33.227057

AmeriCorps members were cut from the program at Bur Oak in April 2025, as were AmeriCorps participants across the country. (Photo courtesy of Bur Oak Land Trust) Bur Oak Land Trust, an Iowa nonprofit organization, joined more than a dozen groups from across the country in a lawsuit against the Trump administration for continuing to withhold funding for AmeriCorps programs. 
Bur Oak, and 13 additional nonprofits won a preliminary injunction in July from a lawsuit in response to Department of Government Efficiency cuts to AmeriCorps program funding and staffing. Despite the injunction, the expanded suit alleges the White House’s Office of Management and Budget is withholding the funds. 
Jason Taylor, Bur Oak Land Trust’s executive director, said the cuts meant the group lost all of its AmeriCorps staff for the summer, which greatly impacted the projects the trust could complete. The trust works to restore native habitat, remove invasive species and maintain infrastructure at various nature preserves in the state.
“The whole idea that all of this was behind efficiency – our funds were cut as part of the DOGE program – this has been such an incredibly inefficient summer for us, because we’re dealing with all these other things on top of our normal jobs,” Taylor said.

The lawsuit alleges that the withholding of funds and “dismantling” of the AmeriCorps program, which was established in 1993, has caused “irreparable harm” to the associated nonprofits, individual program participants and members of the AmeriCorps Employees Union, AFSCME Local 2027.
AmeriCorps places participants at service locations like schools, local governments and nonprofits focusing on health, disaster relief, environmental stewardship, workforce development and veterans. 
Since April 2025, the lawsuit alleges, the administration has effectuated program closures, “arbitrary” funding withdrawals, layoffs that “crippled” organizations and left staff in “disarray.” 
Despite the preliminary injunction, issued by a federal district court in Maryland to return $400 million in funding to the affected nonprofits and individuals, the lawsuit alleges the feds have “flouted” the court’s orders to return funding. 
AmeriCorps is under siege. What happens in the communities it serves?

The new action on the lawsuit lists the OMB as an additional defendant and adds more organizations that have been harmed by the withholding of funds. According to a press release from Democracy Defenders Fund and Democracy Forward Foundation, which are organizing the effort, the suit represents AmeriCorps grantees from 26 states. 
Norm Eisen, executive chair of the Democracy Defenders Fund, said the administration’s efforts to “kneecap” the programs are more than just illegal. 
“They’re an attack on one of the most fundamental American ideas: that we Americans help each other,” Eisen said in the press release. “With this amended complaint, we look forward to building on last month’s order that such funding be restored to ensure the vital services these organizations provide can continue.”
The lawsuit asks the court to declare it was unlawful to withhold AmeriCorps funding and terminate staff and programs. It also asks for the OMB to release the funds already appropriated to AmeriCorps programs. 
A status report, filed on behalf of the Corporation for National and Community Service, the lead defendant, notes the office has restored affected jobs and is “in compliance” with statutes and appropriations that require it to carry out programs and award grants.
This filing was the fourth of six required status updates to be filed by the offices per the July ruling in the case, and was filed one day after the nonprofit groups expanded the lawsuit to include OMB.
The expanded filing from the nonprofit organizations said, in reference to the previous three reports, that while the administration alleges it is in compliance, the withholding of appropriated funding is a “blatant” statutory violation.
Impact to Iowa
In the petition, Bur Oak Land Trust is named as a single entity and as a representative of similar nonprofit organizations in the country that have been similarly impacted. 
Taylor said while the impacts to Bur Oak over the summer were difficult and the instability has been “frustrating” the trust will be able to bring in a new group of AmeriCorps members regardless of if the OMB releases funding. 
Taylor said funding from the federal program is more efficient and easier to manage, but if the office does not cede the funding, Volunteer Iowa has said it will step in to fund the program. 
Since 2019, Bur Oak Land Trust has had an AmeriCorps crew to help with prescribed burns, mowing, removing invasive species, leading guided hikes and restoring natural spaces in the state.
Taylor said the crew is never a guarantee, as nonprofits have to apply for federal funding for the program each year.
“But we’ve never had questions about whether or not the program may or may not exist at the federal level before,” Taylor said. “This is the first time that we’ve seen all this uncertainty there.”



Other plaintiffs
Other plaintiffs named in the case include AmeriCorps Employees Union AFSCME Local 2027, Aspire Afterschool, Democracy Maine, Evelyn Rubenstein Jewish Community Center, Elev8 Baltimore, HandsOn Suburban Chicago, Housing and Community Development Network of New Jersey, Michigan College Access Network, National College Attainment Network, North Carolina Housing Coalition, Partners for Campus-Community Engagement, Rainbow Labs, Red Cloud Indian School, Seed Coalition, The Corps Network, and The Service Collaborative of WNY.

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)Hurricane Erin continues to churn up the East Coast, whipping up dangerous waves and winds even as it stays offshore. The storm is not expected to make landfall, but Virginia is preparing for rough waters, tropical-storm-force gusts, and bands of heavy rain as warnings go into effect. 
Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Wednesday updated the public on the storm’s potential impact expected for Thursday morning. Hurricane Erin is a massive storm, already being felt along South Carolina’s Outer Banks Wednesday evening, capable of throwing tropical weather across several states.
“We also are seeing coastal floods watches announced across the whole region as we see the tidal flooding risk really enhanced,” Youngkin said. “This is a dangerous storm, and because of the size of this storm, even though it is offshore, we will see rain bands that will bring heavy rain.”
The governor said first responder resources are staged in Hampton Roads and the Eastern Shore in case swift water rescues are needed. Utilities and the Virginia Department of Transportation are also prepared to clear fallen trees and restore services as tropical-storm-force winds arrive.
“We also have asked state police to preposition resources, and that includes boats and crews on the Eastern Shore into Hampton Roads, particularly and on this side of the tunnel to make sure that we have adequate resources who can move quickly should they be needed, and we also have our aerial support through helicopters and our fixed-wing capabilities,” Youngkin said.
As of Wednesday evening, bridges and tunnels as well as the Jamestown ferry were expected to remain open, though conditions could force changes if the storm worsens. 
Virginia Department of Emergency Management Director John Scrivani urged the public to steer clear of beaches and keep boats off the water until Erin passes.
“There is going to be dangerous marine conditions, rip currents, tidal flooding, beach and dune erosion, as well as those hazardous seas,” Scrivani said. “That’s why you see those warnings over water, not just over land. Outer rain bands can impact the coastal areas. We do not anticipate much impact as we get further inland.”
Flood-prone coastal communities are being told to stay alert. So far, there have been no evacuation orders, voluntary or mandatory, and no emergency declaration. The governor said his team continues to monitor the storm’s track and is ready to adjust if needed.
“I believe what we have staged is sufficient for what we are currently expecting. If circumstances change then we will react very quickly,” Youngkin said. 
“Often an emergency declaration is paired with utilization of the Virginia National Guard, and moving even more resources, and at this point, we see such extensive resource capability in the Hampton Roads region. And with the state assets we’ve already moved, we do believe we’re reacting appropriately.”

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)The Idaho state government pays governors a housing stipend.
That’s because Idaho is one of five states without an official residence for the governor.
After expressing interest in buying or building a home for the governor last year, a panel of state lawmakers briefly revisited it on Wednesday. 
But for now, the Governor’s Housing Committee voted to keep the governor’s monthly housing stipend at $4,551 each month, which is roughly $54,600 a year.
Idaho Gov. Brad Little earns $151,400 each year as governor. He lives in a home in Emmet, but also owns a condo in downtown Boise.

At the end of the meeting, Rep. Jaron Crane, R-Nampa, asked the Department of Administration to prepare a list of state properties that might work to remodel or reuse for a governor’s residence. He floated the Alexander House near the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, which is just by the Idaho State Capitol Building.
“I know that the governor may not want to live there. He may want to actually use his personal home. I don’t blame him for that. But I guess my question was, could that be in consideration for a property as maybe a governor’s mansion, for more of a permanent residence that he could have hosted” U.S. Health secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Crane asked.
Idaho Department of Administration Director Steve Bailey said the agency could get started on a list.
“I know that’s a discussion that comes up just about every year, is having a permanent residence for the governor. And for one reason or another, you don’t seem to get traction on it,” Bailey said. 
Only two of the four lawmakers on the committee were present for Wednesday’s meeting. Crane and Sen. Ali Rabe, D-Boise, attended virtually.
Rep. Brooke Green, D-Boise, was appointed to the committee late Tuesday to fill in for former Rep. Todd Achilles, a Boise Democrat who resigned from the Legislature to run as an Independent challenger to Republican U.S. Sen. Jim Risch. The committee’s other member, Sen. Todd Lakey, R-Nampa, did not attend.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)LENEXA, Kansas — A 74-year-old certified public accountant’s misunderstanding and subsequent call to the Kansas Bureau of Investigation sparked a police inquiry into a Lenexa City Council member’s citizenship, public records show, igniting public scrutiny and leading to records requests from local residents.
Melanie Arroyo, who became a U.S. citizen in 2018 and has served on the Lenexa City Council since 2021, disclosed the police investigation during an Aug. 5 council meeting. Her decision to go public that night caught colleagues and city staff by surprise, according to newly disclosed documents.
In a rare move, the city of Lenexa turned over the police investigative file and a copy of Arroyo’s citizenship certificate in response to records requests made by Kansas Reflector, the Kansas City Star and two local residents. The documents identify Douglas Shipe as the Lenexa man who made the initial complaint, and they shed new light on how police proceeded with their investigation into Arroyo.
Arroyo said she understands why police felt obligated to investigate but that she was disappointed in how they went about it.
“It just kind of confirms to me that they are not sensitive with how to handle immigration situations,” Arroyo said.
Shipe, a registered Republican and CPA who lives in Lenexa, called the KBI on July 8 and requested an investigation into Arroyo’s citizenship status based on written testimony she had provided to the Legislature in February.
Arroyo wrote about growing up “as an undocumented immigrant girl” in the testimony she provided in opposition to Senate Bill 254, which would have eliminated in-state tuition and other benefits for immigrants. She also wrote that she resolved her immigration status in order to attend college in Kansas. The Senate didn’t vote on the bill.
KBI agent Jeff Muckenthaler described Shipe’s call in an email to Lenexa police on July 16. Muckenthaler said he was forwarding the information “to handle however you deem appropriate.”
Lenexa police Detective Bill McCombs opened an investigation on July 21. His first move was to call Special Agent Hayden McGrath with Homeland Security Investigations to ask for assistance regarding Arroyo’s immigration status. McCombs provided Arroyo’s Social Security number and date of birth.
Arroyo said she was concerned to learn police had contacted HSI about her.
“That alarmed me a little bit,” Arroyo said. “What the hell, bro?”
Two days later, the investigative file shows, McCombs read Arroyo’s testimony. He noted that Shipe had “not understood” Arroyo’s testimony.
“As written, one would assume her immigration status was satisfied,” McCombs said.
In the meantime, Police Chief Dawn Layman had called Arroyo to let her know about the investigation. Arroyo responded by hiring an attorney who then sent a copy of Arroyo’s citizenship certificate to police. McCombs’ report said he cross-referenced the certificate with Arroyo’s driver’s license to verify that her full name and Social Security number matched. HSI’s assistance was no longer needed.
Lenexa police Capt. Justin Schopfer reported that he called Shipe on Aug. 5 to provide an update. Schopfer explained that police had confirmed Arroyo’s citizenship, which predated her election to the city council.
“After ensuring Shipe had no further questions, I ended the call,” Schopfer said.
Shipe didn’t respond to Kansas Reflector phone calls or emails. Kansas Reflector attempted to knock on his door on Friday, but the apartment number he lists on his voter registration doesn’t exist. An employee in the leasing office for the apartment complex said she would give Shipe a copy of a Kansas Reflector business card, but he never called.
Online records show Shipe donated $100 to Republican Kris Kobach, who rose to prominence as a political figure for his anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies, when Kobach was running for governor in 2018 and again in 2022 when he was running for attorney general. Shipe also donated a total of $925 to former state Sen. Julia Lynn, a Republican from Olathe, between 2012 and 2019.
Arroyo said she went public with her frustration over the police inquiry after federal authorities on July 30 raided El Toro Loco restaurants in Lenexa and Kansas City, Kansas. She voiced her concerns at the Aug. 5 council meeting, where numerous members of the public spoke in support of Arroyo.
“I understand why people would be frustrated with me,” she said in an interview Wednesday. “Speaking up is risky, and I recognize that, absolutely. At the same time, not speaking up also poses a major risk for everyone. So I really had to weigh my options here, and ultimately I decided that speaking up is in support of not just our immigrant community but in defense of constitutional rights and also in defense of our humanity. I could never regret doing that.”
Tim McCabe, a Lenexa resident who has testified before the Legislature about his displeasure with facemasks during the COVID-19 pandemic and his concerns that China could influence the outcome of local elections, submitted a Kansas Open Records Act request directly to Arroyo seeking documents related to her citizenship status and the police investigative report.
Kansas Reflector asked McCabe why he submitted the request, if he was surprised by anything the city provided, and whether he is satisfied Arroyo is a U.S. citizen. He replied via email with a one-word response: “Nope.” He didn’t respond to an email seeking clarification.
Laura Owen also asked for police records and whether city staff had invited media to the Aug. 5 council meeting. She declined to comment.
MacKenzie Harvison, deputy city attorney, told her city staff were “entirely unaware” that Arroyo intended to talk about the investigation that night, until media outlets began to ask questions in the hours before the meeting.
The city could have exempted the requested records under state law because they are part of a police investigative file, Harvison said, but provided them in the interest of transparency.
Kansas Reflector submitted a Kansas Open Records Act request on Aug. 14 for other requests and the city’s response. The city failed to respond within three business days as required by law. On Wednesday, Harvison apologized for the delay.
“We had what felt like a million balls in the air last week and this simply fell through the cracks,” she said. “The city of Lenexa takes its commitment to transparency very seriously, and we strive always to meet and exceed the requirements of KORA. I know that we didn’t do so in this instance, and I apologize on behalf of all of the staff involved. Rest assured that this mistake was not intentional at all, just simply human error.”

Eighteen months after Roberts’ actions incited global outrage, a grand jury decided the Daniel resident should face felony charges.
The post Grand jury indicts Cody Roberts, infamous Wyoming wolf captor, on felony animal cruelty appeared first on WyoFile .","Sublette County law enforcement officials announced today that a grand jury has indicted Cody Roberts for the charge of felony cruelty to animals, a crime that could net the Daniel resident up to two years in prison. 
The announcement came in a press release that provided few details about the grand jury, which meets behind closed doors and is confidential in nature. The 12-person panel, selected by the 9th District Court, met during the second and third weeks of August. After “receiving evidence and deliberation,” the notice said, the grand jury returned a “true bill” resulting in the indictment against Roberts.
Sublette County Prosecuting Attorney Clayton Melinkovich could not be reached immediately for an interview. 
Early on during fallout from the incident, which incited global outrage, the county attorney suggested that he disagreed with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department, which took the lead in responding to the Feb. 29, 2024 incident. Game and Fish has maintained that wolves are not protected by animal cruelty laws in Wyoming where they are designated as predators by the state.

Mark Gordon and other state officials on Dec. 15, 2023 at a town hall-style meeting focused on Wyoming’s mental health struggles and resources.

“While many of the animal abuse provisions do not apply to the hunting, capture, killing, or destruction of a predatory animal, there are narrow circumstances where a person could be charged and convicted of animal abuse,” Melinkovich said in an announcement in early April 2024. 
Nearly a year and a half later, the grand jury agreed.
In the spring of 2024, Game and Fish’s investigation and subsequent citation were handled without public notice in the days after the incident. Roberts was fined $250 for possessing the wolf, though the investigating wardens could have issued steeper penalties and sent the case to court but declined to take that step. The leniency of the penalty stoked outrage that exploded globally when Roberts’ stunt with the injured wolf became widely publicized, with photos of him and the injured animal splashed across the internet.
In the aftermath, the Wyoming Legislature even convened a “Treatment of Predators Working Group,” which included lawmakers and other stakeholders. That group workshopped a bill intended to deter the torture of predatory animals. 
In addition to up to two years of imprisonment, felony animal cruelty can be punishable with a fine of up to $5,000.

Felony animal cruelty is committed in Wyoming if a person, “knowingly, and with intent to cause death or undue suffering, beats with cruelty, tortures, torments or mutilates an animal,” according to Section 6-3-1005 of the criminal code.
At the one-year mark after Roberts’ stunt with the wolf, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department declined to comment on Sublette County’s law enforcement proceedings. 
“The Wyoming Game and Fish Department cannot comment on pending or ongoing litigation within or outside of our jurisdiction,” Chief Warden Dan Smith said in a statement at the time.

Rep. Jim Grueneich, R-Ellendale, chair of the committee, said rural communities can be hit the hardest with even small personnel challenges with emergency service providers.
“I think we have to look at what we can do to help these essential services in rural North Dakota, and of course in our urban areas as well,” Grueneich said.
One of the committee’s tasks is a study of volunteer emergency responder recruitment and retention that was mandated by the passage of House Bill 1311 during the 2025 legislative session.
Grueneich said he expects to have legislation drafted ahead of the 2027 legislative session to help emergency services. He added the committee plans to hold four more meetings during the interim with the last meeting focused on debating and editing draft legislation.
Rep. Todd Porter, R-Mandan, owner of Metro-Area Ambulance Service which serves Morton and Burleigh counties, said he thinks one of the most important fixes is recruiting more young people to the profession. 
“I do think that we have to start utilizing our CTE (Career and Technical Education) centers, and getting them fully engaged, and doing some of that initial training with our high school students to get them interested in these kinds of important careers,” Porter said.
Porter said the state will still need to subsidize some of the emergency services in rural North Dakota, but having a stable pipeline of workers entering the career field would alleviate some of that stress.
Emergency services personnel from across the state testified to lawmakers about their challenges, including low wages, rising insurance costs, a lack of housing and competition among rural providers for staff and grants.
Some employers have stopped letting volunteer firefighters respond to calls during the workday, said Travis Bateman, director of Badlands Search and Rescue.
He said he understands if oil and gas workers can’t leave their posts to respond to a fire because something might blow up, but he sees more employers not affiliated with critical operations withholding emergency volunteer employees from calls.
“If it’s a non-critical, non-essential role, that’s ridiculous,” Bateman said.

He added some employers do allow their staff to respond to emergency calls and even leave them clocked in as a way to honor their employee’s service.
State Fire Marshal Doug Nelson said North Dakota has 357 fire departments, of which 334 are entirely volunteer-based. Those departments have more than 8,100 firefighters, including about 7,400 volunteers.
The incidents those firefighters respond to have more than doubled over the last decade, he said. 
In 2024, firefighters across North Dakota responded to more than 51,500 incidents, up from more than 22,000 in 2014. Those incidents in 2024 included more than 3,000 fires, up from nearly 2,000, 10 years earlier.
Recruitment issues, a lack of resources and increasing equipment costs are not things that will be fixed overnight, Nelson said.
“We just kind of want to come up with some of those basic steps, really ideas, that we need to build further consensus with the fire service and our partners into this committee to make sure we’re all going in the same direction,” Nelson said.
Porter said there are multiple emergency service issues the committee will discuss at future meetings.
“I think there are models out there that would work for our rural areas that don’t necessarily mean an ambulance sitting on every corner,” he said. “In the end, we should be looking at making a huge commitment to solidifying the delivery of those services that people are expecting.”

Displaced residents of Camelot Village in Chapel Hill are growing anxious as time runs out on their stay at the Comfort Inn in Durham. The residents were forced to leave their rental homes in early July after rain from Tropical Storm Chantal sent Bolin Creek overflowing its banks and spilling into the nearly 60-year-old townhome community.
At a press conference Wednesday, the residents told reporters that they must leave the hotel Aug. 29 after disaster assistance from Orange County, Triangle Mutual Aid and private citizens runs out.
“I’m gonna be homeless, pretty much because I haven’t found a place to go that I can afford,” said Jessica Tickles. “I had to take out of work to find housing, so I’m like restarting back to work and it’s like starting from zero.”










Their rent and those deposits are their money and that’s not being returned so that they can move forward with their lives, get housing, return to their dignity.


– C.R. Clark, Triangle Tenant Union


Residents complained that landlords and town and county officials have been slow to respond to concerns and have not done enough to help as they struggle to find housing in the aftermath of the storm, which they say left them financially strapped and stressed.
With the help of the Triangle Tenant Union, the residents issued these demands:

Return of July rents due to the uninhabitability of the units after the storm.
Return of security deposits to assist tenants in securing new housing.
Cancellation of leases and August rent for tenants who want to move.
Relocation assistance in securing permanent housing that meets their needs.
Temporary accommodations for tenants who want to return after building repair and remediation.

“It’s unlawful to charge rent for an uninhabitable apartment in North Carolina,” said C.R. Clark with Triangle Tenant Union. “This is a legal violation, but we’re trying to ensure that people can make demands of this landlord and move that forward rather than trying to go through court.”
Clark said the former tenants have only one week to secure housing and the county is telling them to “just figure it out.”
“A lot of these people have been through so much trauma that figuring it out is really hard …” Clark said. “Their rent and those deposits are their money and that’s not being returned so that they can move forward with their lives, get housing, return to their dignity.”
He said “people are gonna be in on the street” if Chapel Hill Mayor Jess Anderson doesn’t step up and provide staffing to “get some of these things done, to get some relocation assistance, to pay for some of these application fees … so that folks can get relocated and begin to rebuild their lives.”
Many residents lost everything in the flood and as many as three-fourths of them were unhoused before moving into Camelot Village, Clark said. The townhome rentals provided low-income residents with rare  affordable housing in affluent Chapel Hill, he said.
Some residents had federal Section 8 vouchers which means their rent was based on income. Others without vouchers pay as much as $950 a month to live there.

“Camelot was the only affordable housing that I was able to be placed in, and I was not made aware of a flooding situation until the time of signing my lease, and at that point, I could not back out because of how the system works with people that are on county funding and things like that,” said Heather Gibbs. “If you say ‘no’ to something in the process, then you are put out on the street and left to find housing somewhere else on your own.”
Gibbs said she has applied to three or four places for housing and paid more than $300 in non-refundable application fees. The fees aren’t refunded even if the unit doesn’t pass required inspections for Section 8 vouchers, she said.
“It’s been really complicated for us to get in somewhere else that is safe,” Gibbs said. “I definitely would not return there [Camelot Village].”

Dale Weldele, a recent amputee who now walks with the aid of a prosthetic leg, said he barely survived the flooding at Camelot Village.
“The neighbors saved my life, they got me to safety,” Weldele said. My prosthetic came off in the current. I couldn’t stand against it, so I’m on one leg with crutches, trying to make it to the stairs …”

The prospect of starting over is daunting,” Weldele said.
“Everything got destroyed. It’s starting all over at an old age, and the whole thing, so it’s really hard,” he said.










Putting someone who is not stable on their feet in a ground level unit that you know floods and to leave them there and walk away, that should be illegal.


– Devin Gilder, volunteer Triangle Mutual Aid


Devin Gilgor, a volunteer with Triangle Mutual Aid, said many Camelot Village tenants have medical conditions and cannot afford to be unhoused.
Gilgor noted that one of the former tenants is a paraplegic and that Weldele is still learning to navigate the world with his prosthetic. He said neither is capable of living in a tent in the woods if they’re unable to find safe, affordable housing.
“They’re not capable of being unhoused,” Gilgor said. “They have medical conditions, they have special equipment for mobility purposes and some of them have intellectual disabilities that are creating massive hurdles for us in terms of getting through the application process for apartments.”
Long history of flooding
Camelot Village has a long history flooding, Gilgor said.
“I’ve lived down the street from Camelot my whole life, but my first memorable flood in Camelot was in 1972,” he said. “I’ve been over there and mucked out apartments eight times now.”
Apartments are currently being refurbished, he said, with plans to put new residents in them, despite flooding and safety concerns. Some units are privately owned and others are corporate owned.
“They’re rebuilding to put more people in who are going to be low income, who are going to be on vouchers, who are going to have a special needs, and someone’s going to drown,” Gilgor said. “Putting someone who is not stable on their feet in a ground level unit that you know floods and to leave them there and walk away, that should be illegal.”
Gilgor lamented the fact that few elected officials attended the press conference despite being invited.
“I think the citizens need to take a good, hard look at town council,” Gilgor said. “Being that this is an election year, I would venture to say you’d think more people would have showed up today because I personally invited everybody from town council and the mayor of Chapel Hill.”

The law weakens health care and food assistance more than any legislation in history. Combined with tax cuts that give a whopping $1 trillion to the richest 1%, no law has ever done so much to enrich the wealthy while hurting those of modest income.
What does it mean for your state and community? For starters, states will lose billions in federal funding for health care, food, and other necessities.
Federal funds provided more than one of every three dollars that states spent last year — and much more in places like Mississippi, Indiana, and South Dakota. In Louisiana, federal aid delivers fully half of state spending. But we’re likely to see layoffs of federal employees in every state — and potentially of state and local employees whose paychecks rely on federal dollars, too.
For families, it means less access to the basics.
Hospitals and nonprofits (like food banks) depend on federal funding and will reduce staff at best and shutter at worst. More than 300 rural hospitals face likely elimination. And because of Trump’s health care cuts, more than 50,000 Americans will die early every single year.
In addition to these cuts, Trump has also illegally withheld congressionally authorized funding for health care, Head Start, child care, disease control, disability services, and more, causing crises at organizations nationwide.
Funding is also getting cut for community colleges, four-year universities, financial aid, loans, and first-generation students. This will block access to degrees for working-class kids coast-to-coast.
Federal emergency funding, long the bedrock of state response to floods, hurricanes, and other disasters, is also on the chopping block — meaning more devastation, less recovery, and billions in costs shifted to states. Transportation projects will stall too, harming commuters and construction jobs.
All in all, this law will leave our communities sicker, less educated, and less safe.
Only the federal government can raise sufficient funds from those most able to pay and distribute them to poorer states like Alabama, Mississippi, and West Virginia, who have less capacity to raise dollars locally.
But policymakers can fill some of the gap with improved state and local taxation. With Trump and Congress turning their backs on American families, states have to rise to the moment.
States have many options.
They can raise more by bolstering income taxes on the wealthiest— policies that have won recently in Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Minnesota. They can also tax income from wealth by improving capital gains income taxation. Washington, Maryland, Minnesota, and New Mexico have passed such reforms recently.
And they can stop corporations from hiding profits in other states, as most states now do, or in other countries, something innovators are increasingly proposing.
Localities have options too: enacting mansion taxes, as cities in California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, New Mexico, and New York have done, and passing local income taxes as thousands of communities in Ohio, Indiana, and 13 other states do. At the very least, local policymakers could rein in costly corporate tax breaks that shortchange schools.
Tax dollars pay for essentials that make America healthy, educated, and safe. If Trump and his allies slash those fundamentals to enrich the richest, we must insist that states and cities get creative in taking care of the rest of us.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/trumpjuly42025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-20 18:57:13.288984

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)LENEXA — A 74-year-old certified public accountant’s misunderstanding and subsequent call to the Kansas Bureau of Investigation sparked a police inquiry into a Lenexa City Council member’s citizenship, public records show, igniting public scrutiny and leading to records requests from local residents.
Melanie Arroyo, who became a U.S. citizen in 2018 and has served on the Lenexa City Council since 2021, disclosed the police investigation during an Aug. 5 council meeting. Her decision to go public that night caught colleagues and city staff by surprise, according to newly disclosed documents.
In a rare move, the city of Lenexa turned over the police investigative file and a copy of Arroyo’s citizenship certificate in response to records requests made by Kansas Reflector, the Kansas City Star and two local residents. The documents identify Douglas Shipe as the Lenexa man who made the initial complaint, and they shed new light on how police proceeded with their investigation into Arroyo.
Arroyo said she understands why police felt obligated to investigate but that she was disappointed in how they went about it.
“It just kind of confirms to me that they are not sensitive with how to handle immigration situations,” Arroyo said.
Shipe, a registered Republican and CPA who lives in Lenexa, called the KBI on July 8 and requested an investigation into Arroyo’s citizenship status based on written testimony she had provided to the Legislature in February.
Arroyo wrote about growing up “as an undocumented immigrant girl” in the testimony she provided in opposition to Senate Bill 254, which would have eliminated in-state tuition and other benefits for immigrants. She also wrote that she resolved her immigration status in order to attend college in Kansas. The Senate didn’t vote on the bill.
KBI agent Jeff Muckenthaler described Shipe’s call in an email to Lenexa police on July 16. Muckenthaler said he was forwarding the information “to handle however you deem appropriate.”
Lenexa police Detective Bill McCombs opened an investigation on July 21. His first move was to call Special Agent Hayden McGrath with Homeland Security Investigations to ask for assistance regarding Arroyo’s immigration status. McCombs provided Arroyo’s Social Security number and date of birth.
Arroyo said she was concerned to learn police had contacted HSI about her.
“That alarmed me a little bit,” Arroyo said. “What the hell, bro?”
Two days later, the investigative file shows, McCombs read Arroyo’s testimony. He noted that Shipe had “not understood” Arroyo’s testimony.
“As written, one would assume her immigration status was satisfied,” McCombs said.
In the meantime, Police Chief Dawn Layman had called Arroyo to let her know about the investigation. Arroyo responded by hiring an attorney who then sent a copy of Arroyo’s citizenship certificate to police. McCombs’ report said he cross-referenced the certificate with Arroyo’s driver’s license to verify that her full name and Social Security number matched. HSI’s assistance was no longer needed.
Lenexa police Capt. Justin Schopfer reported that he called Shipe on Aug. 5 to provide an update. Schopfer explained that police had confirmed Arroyo’s citizenship, which predated her election to the city council.
“After ensuring Shipe had no further questions, I ended the call,” Schopfer said.
Shipe didn’t respond to Kansas Reflector phone calls or emails. Kansas Reflector attempted to knock on his door on Friday, but the apartment number he lists on his voter registration doesn’t exist. An employee in the leasing office for the apartment complex said she would give Shipe a copy of a Kansas Reflector business card, but he never called.
Online records show Shipe donated $100 to Republican Kris Kobach, who rose to prominence as a political figure for his anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies, when Kobach was running for governor in 2018 and again in 2022 when he was running for attorney general. Shipe also donated a total of $925 to former state Sen. Julia Lynn, a Republican from Olathe, between 2012 and 2019.
Arroyo said she went public with her frustration over the police inquiry after federal authorities on July 30 raided El Toro Loco restaurants in Lenexa and Kansas City, Kansas. She voiced her concerns at the Aug. 5 council meeting, where numerous members of the public spoke in support of Arroyo.
“I understand why people would be frustrated with me,” she said in an interview Wednesday. “Speaking up is risky, and I recognize that, absolutely. At the same time, not speaking up also poses a major risk for everyone. So I really had to weigh my options here, and ultimately I decided that speaking up is in support of not just our immigrant community but in defense of constitutional rights and also in defense of our humanity. I could never regret doing that.”
Tim McCabe, a Lenexa resident who has testified before the Legislature about his displeasure with facemasks during the COVID-19 pandemic and his concerns that China could influence the outcome of local elections, submitted a Kansas Open Records Act request directly to Arroyo seeking documents related to her citizenship status and the police investigative report.
Kansas Reflector asked McCabe why he submitted the request, if he was surprised by anything the city provided, and whether he is satisfied Arroyo is a U.S. citizen. He replied via email with a one-word response: “Nope.” He didn’t respond to an email seeking clarification.
Laura Owen also asked for police records and whether city staff had invited media to the Aug. 5 council meeting. She declined to comment.
MacKenzie Harvison, deputy city attorney, told her city staff were “entirely unaware” that Arroyo intended to talk about the investigation that night, until media outlets began to ask questions in the hours before the meeting.
The city could have exempted the requested records under state law because they are part of a police investigative file, Harvison said, but provided them in the interest of transparency.
Kansas Reflector submitted a Kansas Open Records Act request on Aug. 14 for other requests and the city’s response. The city failed to respond within three business days as required by law. On Wednesday, Harvison apologized for the delay.
“We had what felt like a million balls in the air last week and this simply fell through the cracks,” she said. “The city of Lenexa takes its commitment to transparency very seriously, and we strive always to meet and exceed the requirements of KORA. I know that we didn’t do so in this instance, and I apologize on behalf of all of the staff involved. Rest assured that this mistake was not intentional at all, just simply human error.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/P8190854-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-20 18:57:13.288984

The Department of Financial Regulation issued an order late last week that sets guardrails around any agreements the state’s two largest health insurers enter into with half of Vermont hospitals.

Vermont’s insurance regulator has intervened to set significant guardrails on the contracts that hospitals and insurers are negotiating for the coming year in an effort to reduce health insurance costs for individuals, families and businesses in the state.
On Aug. 14, the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation — the state agency tasked with ensuring the solvency of insurance companies of all types — issued an order that escalated its involvement in what have largely been private negotiations between hospitals and commercial insurers over payment rates. Those negotiated prices — along with how much and what kind of health care hospitals provide to insured Vermonters — are a major factor determining the cost of monthly health insurance premiums for the year. 
The department’s order requires Vermont’s two largest insurers — Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont and MVP — to demonstrate in writing that any agreements the companies make with the state’s larger hospitals and hospital network will lead to a “material reduction” in commercial health insurance premiums. The order also requires any contract to contain “discount provisions and other cost containment provisions that reflect industry standards.”
“The point of the order is to be flexible but also hold the feet to the fire for all parties in the negotiations. There needs to be cost savings here. The status quo will not do,” said Kaj Samsom, the Department of Financial Regulation’s commissioner, who issued the order. 
This year, the average monthly premium for the benchmark plan on Vermont Health Connect, the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace, hit $1,277 per month. That is the highest cost premium anywhere in the United States, 22% higher than a comparable plan sold in the next most expensive state, Alaska; more than twice as expensive as one sold in Maine; and almost four times the cost of one in neighboring New Hampshire, according to the health care data analysis nonprofit KFF. 
Although just a fraction of people covered by commercial health insurance in Vermont purchase plans through the marketplace, the cost of those plans are impacted by the same factors that drive other premiums — the cost of health care services and how often they are used. The marketplace plans are also standardized in their coverage, so they allow for an easier comparison across states.
The department’s order is explicitly aimed at shoring up the finances of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, which has lost nearly $152 million between 2021 and 2025 and faces insolvency without drastic changes in its costs and revenue. However, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont (BCBSVT) and MVP Health Plan, Inc. (MVP) are the only two insurers who sell health insurance plans on the Vermont Health Connect marketplace, so the department extended the order to apply to MVP as well, in order “to assure reasonable competition,” as the order states. 
“There was a lot of hope by all parties that in the regular cadence of negotiation, Blue Cross and MVP could prevent some of the necessary insurance rate increases, through negotiated cost reductions with providers,” Samsom said. “All parties are trying to find common ground, but the fact is that they’ve failed.” 
The order only applies to contracts between the two insurers and certain hospitals, generally the state’s larger ones: University of Vermont Medical Center in the Burlington area; Rutland Regional Medical Center; Central Vermont Medical Center in Berlin; Southwestern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington; Northwestern Vermont Medical Center in St. Albans City; Brattleboro Memorial Hospital and Porter Medical Center in Middlebury — the latter because it is part of the University of Vermont Health Network. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont sees this move from the department “as strongly supporting a more affordable healthcare system for Vermonters” as they work through negotiations with hospitals, Andrew Garland, a vice president and spokesperson for the insurer, wrote in an email.
Jordan Estey, an MVP vice president and spokesperson, also acknowledged the order’s significance in “addressing both affordability for Vermonters and long-term sustainability within the health care system,” in an email.
The Green Mountain Care Board, the state’s independent health care regulator, is tasked with setting guidelines for plans sold on the Vermont Health Connect marketplace and approving the annual premiums.
Due to a series of health care reforms signed into law this June, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont has been able to lower its requested average premium increases — from 23.3% for individual plans and 13.7% for small group plans in May, to 15.1% for individual plans and 7.4% for small group plans. The care board expects to issue its guidelines for the 2026  marketplace rates on Friday.
While the department is pushing for even lower rates, it is unclear how the order will apply to the Green Mountain Care Board’s decisions on insurance rates. Regardless, the department is asking that board members give the move consideration as it makes hospital budgets decisions next month. 
The power of the department’s order is limited, because the agency only oversees insurers and cannot compel hospitals to make the same cost-cutting efforts in their negotiations, Samson, the department’s commissioner, explained in a letter to board Chair Owen Foster. The letter suggests that complementary action from the Green Mountain Care Board could secure the savings needed to reduce premiums.

Foster acknowledged the letter but declined to indicate how the care board will act on the department’s action, citing its ongoing deliberations. But generally, “this all works better if we all work in alignment,” he said. “We work closely and very, very well with DFR every single day.”
Samsom said the care board could make a similar order, either by placing a revenue cap on major hospitals or ordering across-the-board unit cost reductions. 
“[The Care Board] are the experts and they hold the keys necessary to understanding to where cuts can be made,” he said.
Both insurers expect fewer plans will be sold in the individual marketplace for 2026.  With the likely end of federal subsidies at the end of this year, costs will increase dramatically for many purchasers. The expected disenrollment is one factor driving up the cost of premiums for those still insured.
“This is a crisis,” Samsom said of the end of the subsidies. “Those tax credits helped make things — I wouldn’t say affordable, but — more affordable and within reach for a lot of [individual marketplace] insurance buyers.” 
Still, insurers and hospitals must find a path to move forward. 
“At the end of the day, they have to come to an agreement,” Samsom said.  “We cannot have the UVM Health Network be an out-of-network provider. At some point, we have to have a contract between all parties and an agreement.”
The order essentially bolsters insurers in their negotiations as the department has to approve any contracts the hospitals and insurers enter into. Despite that, Samsom said he will be sparing with his veto power.
“At this point we are looking for a plan,” Samsom said. That could look like BCBSVT and MVP striking tentative agreements with major hospitals on certain service cost reductions, or some type of risk-sharing component that helps cap the maximum claims, he said. “That’s what it would take for me to endorse the findings of such a contract.”
“I’m putting my thumb on the scale here to say we need more cost reductions from the major hospitals,” he added.

Attorney General James Uthmeier earlier this month sent a letter to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick that outlined the state’s concerns that Florida was “egregiously undercounted” during the last Census, conducted under the first term of President Donald Trump but certified by the administration of President Joe Biden.
Gov. Ron DeSantis and Uthmeier appeared together in Palm Beach County on Wednesday, where the governor cited the letter and laid out other reasons that he contended could require the state to do a mid-decade redistricting.
 Something we’re going to have to address
“We’ve had really significant growth and migration, and our congressional map should reflect that,” DeSantis said. “So, this is something that we are going to have to address as a state.”
The Republican governor said he had “spoken with some folks in the Florida Legislature and I think that there’s broad acknowledgement that this is something — you know — that is going to have to happen.”
DeSantis asserted that the U.S. Supreme Court could in the next few months issue a ruling in a closely watched case over redistricting that questions whether the deliberate creation of majority-minority districts is constitutional. 
The governor suggested that at least one seat in South Florida — if not a second — would need to be redrawn if that occurred. The seat DeSantis appeared to be referencing is held by Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, a Democrat whose district includes parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties.
A tussle over redistricting has broken out among red states and blue states since Trump pushed Texas to redraw its congressional districts so that Republicans could pick up extra seats during the 2026 midterm elections. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has responded, pushing ahead with his own map that could bolster the number of Democrats elected there.
While this has been unfolding, DeSantis has been calling for state legislators to draw a new congressional map. He has said several times that the decennial Census should be redone so that Florida could gain additional seats. But DeSantis has also cited a state Supreme Court decision that upheld Florida’s existing map, which eliminated the North Florida district that had been held by Rep. Al Lawson, a Black Democrat.
Following the 2020 Census, Florida was awarded one new congressional seat, for 28 total, and it was included in a new map pushed into law by DeSantis that resulted in Republicans gaining four seats in Florida.
DeSantis said he had been told by the Trump administration that it was likely the state would get two additional seats. He said the Commerce Department itself had acknowledged problems with the survey after it occurred.

In his letter, Uthmeier contends that nothing precludes the Commerce Department from conducting a “streamlined” recount that corrects “now discovered errors.” During the press event, both Uthmeier and DeSantis speculated that Florida and other Republican-controlled states had been purposely harmed. Uthmeier called it a “deep state effort to manipulate the Census.”
Nikki Fried, chair of the Florida Democratic Party, blasted the latest efforts by DeSantis to push for a mid-decade redistricting.
“This is yet another manufactured crisis from Ron DeSantis — speculative, corrupt, and a complete waste of taxpayer dollars,” said Fried. “Floridians are facing increased costs of living, meanwhile, Ron’s trying to stir chaos to distract from his failures, all in pursuit of Gavin Newsom-style headlines.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/OklahomaVoice)OKLAHOMA CITY — In an attempt to limit risks to its investments, an Oklahoma state board plans to try to shape some major companies’ policies pertaining to the dispensing of medications, “discrimination” in charitable giving and child pornography.
The Tobacco Settlement Endowment Trust’s board of investors voted 3-1 Wednesday to ask the shareholders of 10 companies to vote on changing policies related to a variety of issues including child pornography, “politicized and anti-religious discrimination in charitable gift matching,” “gender ideology activism,” and the dispensing of mifepristone. The board also wants the companies to disclose “risks of executive compensation plans” that include diversity, equity and inclusion and environmental, social and governance policies, and the risks of “China exposure” on investment returns.
They would not say which companies would be targeted. The requests would be made publicly available once submitted, according to a spokesperson for Treasurer Todd Russ, who serves as chair of the board.
Members of the Oklahoma board said they were concerned the policies at the 10 companies could open their trust, which oversees the investment of about $2 billion in public dollars, up to backlash and potential litigation. 
Jerry Bowyer, CEO of Bowyer Research, a portfolio construction and asset allocation consulting firm, said the sale of mifepristone, which can be used to help induce abortions, could prevent pregnancies. That would reduce future sales of items like diapers, which could harm overall investment returns.
He also said a company that has diversity, equity and inclusion policies that run counter to the Trump administration’s position could lose out on federal contracts, harming shareholders.
“One could be credibly accused of not exercising full fiduciary responsibility,” he said. 
Bowyer said public pressure brought by “activists” often drives company policies. TSET’s proposals would offer shareholders and management an alternate option.
“It helps them to resist activist pressure,” he said. “And that’s generally the design of these proposals, to help companies to do what they want to do and do what they know they should do.” 
Most public companies give shareholders the opportunity to vote on compensation packages for executives and let management know their views on issues that could affect the value of shares. 
Some shareholders also have the opportunity to add proposals or recommended action items to the agenda at shareholder meetings. That’s what the TSET board voted to do. 
TSET’s board of investors makes decisions on investing the proceeds of Oklahoma’s settlement with the tobacco industry. A different TSET board then spends the interest on programs and other grants aimed at improving health. 
Russ, who chairs the board of investors, said the proposals are a way to “responsibly protect shareholder value and financial returns.” 
“These investments currently have good financial returns, so simply pulling them is not the solution,” he said in a statement after the meeting. “Submitting proposals allows us to address potential risks while maintaining the value of the investments for the fund.”
Russ said the board wasn’t acting in response to a directive from any official. He said it is the board’s responsibility to pay attention to these issues and protect the fund’s investments with the processes available. 
“The goal of the proposals is to bring attention to shareholder concerns and encourage companies to avoid behaviors that could ultimately create financial risk,” he said. 
He said he doesn’t know what the TSET board will do if the companies’ don’t take action on the concerns. 
John Waldo, the sole dissenting vote, said the board should communicate directly with these companies to express their concerns before telling them how to conduct business. 
Some companies have already separated from diversity, equity and inclusion policies, he said. 
A previous attempt by Russ to pass similar proposals failed in June. At the time, he had targeted companies like Amazon, Lululemon and Netflix for policies on issues including diversity and gay rights, according to reporting from Oklahoma Watch.

(Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)After a string of high-profile incidents of political violence, along with an uptick in threats and harassment of elected leaders around the country, a group of Pennsylvania lawmakers announced they plan to introduce a series of bills intended to help keep legislators safe, and ensure seats are filled immediately in the event one is killed.
The proposed measures follow a series of high profile attacks on government officials, including the firebombing of the Governor’s Mansion in Harrisburg in April, and shootings that targeted two Democratic state lawmakers in Minnesota in June. Melissa Hortman, who was the former speaker of the Minnesota House of Representatives, was killed.
“These incidents only underscore the fact that political violence is on the rise, including here in Pennsylvania,” Rep. Greg Scott (D-Montgomery), said in a statement Tuesday. “Political violence has no place in our democracy, and it is paramount that state legislators are safe while serving the people of Pennsylvania.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
While two of the four measures address the immediate safety of lawmakers, others limit their exposure to the public and would ensure representation in the event a Pennsylvania legislator dies while in office. 
Advocates, however, have raised concerns about some of the proposals, but agreed, given the state of political rhetoric in the country, lawmakers are right to have concerns for their safety.
One proposal would exempt their home addresses from disclosure under Pennsylvania’s Right-To-Know laws. A similar rule already exists for state judges.
“Our safety as legislators is threatened, and we must not let fear be a deterrent to our work,” co-prime-sponsor Rep. Roni Green (D-Philadelphia) said in a statement. 
Philip Hensley-Robin, executive director of Common Cause PA, a government watchdog group, said he understood the concerns lawmakers might have with their addresses being public record, but worried about their constituents’ ability to ensure that they’re meeting residency requirements. 
“Holding public office is a public trust, and there are some attendant transparency that comes along with that,” Hensley-Robin said. “There’s an existing state constitutional requirement that legislators are able to establish residency in their districts, and maintain it. For that requirement to be at all enforceable, someone has to be able to confirm residency.”

Hensley-Robin acknowledged, however, without seeing the bill’s language, which has not been released yet,  it’s difficult to know whether it satisfies that requirement.
Another  measure would place the Capitol Police, who guard the state Capitol building, under a new police board. Currently, they serve under the governor.
According to a press release from Nicole Baxter, a House Democratic Caucus spokesperson, the measure, “mirrors how the U.S. Capitol police force operates and would enable the legislature to evaluate whether security arrangements are sufficient in this politically volatile environment.”
A third measure doesn’t directly deal with a lawmaker’s safety, but would allow an incumbent to bypass the signature-gathering requirements to appear on a ballot. Instead, they  would be able to file what’s called a certificate of nomination, creating a process similar to one allied for magisterial district judges.
Andrew McGinley, the vice president of external affairs at the Committee of Seventy, a nonprofit focused on ethics, democracy and transparency in Pennsylvania government, criticized the proposal.
He said the signature-gathering process is “almost like a proof of concept for a campaign that demonstrates that someone has support from a community.”
“Elected officials need to interact with voters and I don’t think getting rid of that step would increase security,” he said.

Moreover, he worried that only allowing incumbents to bypass signature requirements would give them an inherent advantage in the election.
In a call with the Capital-Star, Scott defended his proposal. 
He said he didn’t believe that an incumbent skipping the signature-gathering process would have an advantage. 
 “The truth is, it’s gonna cost you more money and more time and energy,” Scott said of campaigns that skip the step.” Because those votes you would get — the people who go out and sign your petition are likely going to vote for you anyway. You still have to work for that, so it’s not like it’s a clear advantage.”
He also said, while the bill’s language is being finalized, he is considering including a provision that would bar a candidate who skips the petition process from challenging the petitions of other candidates.
A fourth bill would propose a constitutional amendment that would allow lawmakers to name three successors each in the event of their deaths, one of whom could be chosen by the House speaker to serve temporarily until a special election is held. 
As it stands, a lawmaker’s seat is held vacant after they die until a a special election is held and the winner is sworn-in.
That’s what happened after Pittsburgh-area Democratic Rep. Matt Gergely died in January, leaving his seat vacant — and control of the chamber effectively tied — until a special election was held in March.
In order for the Pennsylvania Constitution to be amended, lawmakers in both chambers must pass identical measures by majority vote in two consecutive sessions. Then, the amendment would have to be voted on by Pennsylvanians during an election. 
McGinley was also critical of this proposal, saying that allowing lawmakers to choose their own replacements was “undemocratic.”
“It reminds me of a monarchy sort of proposal,” he said. 
Scott, however, said that, in a state where partisan control of the House is separated by a single vote, allowing somebody from the same party to serve in the event of a legislator’s death would help ensure the will of the voters is enacted. 
He pointed to Minnesota, where, following the assassination of Hortman, the Democratic lawmaker, Republicans took control of what was previously an evenly split chamber.
“Let’s remove any type of incentive for an assassin to take one of us out, by saying, ‘This won’t shut down the chamber,’” Scott said. “We want to make sure government continues to operate and that those constituents still have a voice.”
He said he’s also considering a provision that would bar the temporary replacement from running in the special election.
Hensley-Robin, from Common Cause PA, noted that similar systems are in place in other countries. In elections for France’s National Assembly, for example, candidates’ potential replacements are on the ballot with them, in the case they become unable to serve.
“I think that would be an interesting way to approach this,” Hensley-Robin said. “It would be strengthened by having the names of their replacements right there on the primary and general election ballots for people to know who they’re voting for.”

(Photo by Kaveh Mowahed / KUNM News)New Mexico’s foster care, juvenile justice and child welfare programs have not made significant progress in the last six months toward complying with a landmark settlement agreement, a court-appointed arbitrator found this week.
The 2020 “Kevin S” settlement stems from a lawsuit filed two years prior against the Children, Youth and Families Department, along with the agency now called the Health Care Authority, which alleged state officials had failed to uphold their legal obligations to keep children in their custody safe.
Charles Peifer, the Albuquerque attorney appointed as the arbiter in the case, found in January that New Mexico failed to meet the settlement’s requirements. Then after hearing from both sides in July, Peifer on Monday issued a second order finding that the state still “has not made significant progress in its efforts to come into compliance” with the settlement’s terms.
Those terms include: hiring and properly training caseworkers to determine a child’s needs; finding foster families to care for them; and connecting children to services.
“The evidence and submissions provided to me establish that the State is preparing to make progress and has indeed obtained additional funding that will assist in future progress, but that, measured by outcomes for children, measurable and verifiable progress is lacking,” Peifer wrote. “Children and youth remain at imminent risk of harm and time is of the essence.”
The state Legislature in its most recent session created a new Office of the Child Advocate, attached administratively to the state Department of Justice, to provide more oversight of CYFD.

In a meeting on Tuesday with state lawmakers on the interim Legislative Health and Human Services Committee, Native American Disability Law Center Executive Director Therese Yanan, who represents one of the children in the initial lawsuit, said Monday’s order represents a measure of accountability for the state’s failures.
“This system is not working for our kids,” Yanan said. “We are also hoping that this committee and other committees can hold the state to account as well, because there needs to be some accountability.”
Dr. George Davis, a child and adolescent psychiatrist and former CYFD psychiatry director, said it’s impossible for the state to comply with the settlement so long as caseworkers are overworked, foster families turn over and children don’t receive the services they need.
Davis said many foster families withdrew from the system during the COVID-19 pandemic “and they have never, ever recuperated.” Even though the state brought on 134 new foster families in 2024, he said, approximately the same number left in the same period.
Without foster families to care for children, Davis said, authorities place them into either residential treatment centers or congregate facilities, which are “not a place to raise a child” and “not a substitute for foster care.”
“Beds are not what we need,” he said. “Families are what we need.”
Jesse Clifton, an attorney with Disability Rights New Mexico, which represented another plaintiff in the case, told the committee one of the main reasons his organization joined the lawsuit was New Mexico’s placement of children into residential and congregate settings, which he called “needless institutionalization of youth.” He said state officials continue to propose expanding congregate care in New Mexico, but doing so won’t solve the problem.
“It does stand to reason to expand that network of providers — especially if we’re not also making the same efforts and investments in community-based mental health services — that we’re going to see a return to that practice,” Clifton said.
Under Peifer’s order, CYFD and the HCA must make “continual and continuous progress” to comply with the settlement between now and Dec. 31. He will hold hearings in October and November to check their progress and will again determine whether they have complied in January.
A spokesperson for CYFD told Source NM on Wednesday that the agency is reviewing Peifer’s findings, compiling the requested data and will respond by the deadline imposed in the order.
“We are disappointed by these findings, some of which are troubling, but we intend to address them as best we can and continue improving the way in which we protect New Mexico children in vulnerable circumstances,” CYFD Deputy Director of Communications Jessica Preston said in a statement.

(Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)This week, the Trump administration’s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced an effort to check the immigration status of people who get their health insurance through Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.
Medicaid is the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. For families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford private insurance, CHIP is a public program that provides low-cost health coverage for their children.
The feds will begin sending states monthly enrollment reports that identify people with Medicaid or CHIP whose immigration or citizenship status can’t be confirmed through federal databases. States are then responsible for verifying the citizenship or immigration status of individuals in those reports. States are expected to take “appropriate actions when necessary, including adjusting coverage or enforcing non-citizen eligibility rules,” according to a CMS press release.
“We are tightening oversight of enrollment to safeguard taxpayer dollars and guarantee that these vital programs serve only those who are truly eligible under the law,” Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who oversees CMS as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said in a press release announcing the new program.
As of April, roughly 71 million adults and children nationwide have Medicaid coverage, while another 7 million children have insurance through CHIP. Immigrants under age 65 are less likely to be covered by Medicaid than U.S.-born citizens, according to an analysis from health research organization KFF.
Immigrants who are in the country illegally aren’t eligible for federally funded Medicaid and CHIP. Only citizens and certain lawfully present immigrants — green card holders and refugees, for example — can qualify.
But some states have chosen to expand Medicaid coverage for immigrants with their own funds. Twenty-three states offer pregnancy-related care regardless of citizenship or immigration status, according to KFF. Fourteen states provide coverage for children in low-income families regardless of immigration status, while seven states offer coverage to some adults regardless of status.
The tax and spending package President Donald Trump last month cuts federal spending on Medicaid by more than $1 trillion, leaving states to either make up the difference with their own funds or reduce coverage. But the new law also includes restrictions on coverage for certain immigrants, including stripping eligibility from refugees and asylum-seekers.

The new provisions in Act 73 halt what had been an increasing amount of public tuition dollars from flowing to Vermont's religious schools. Legislators say that is a side effect, not the intent.

Since 2021, religious schools in Vermont have been receiving an increasing amount of money through Vermont’s school tuitioning program. But Act 73, Vermont’s wide-ranging education reform law signed into law in July, effectively halts that trend.
Last week, the state Agency of Education finalized a list of 18 private schools (called independent schools under state law) that remain eligible for the public tuition dollars under the new law’s provisions. Students who were already enrolled in ineligible schools prior to the law’s passing can continue receiving public dollars until they graduate. 
Vermont’s public tuition system allows families in districts without a public school for certain grades to use public dollars to send their children to public or private schools elsewhere.
Under the new law, however, private schools located in the state must now pass two tests to remain eligible for public funding: they must be located in a school district or supervisory union that does not operate a public school for some or all grades, and they must have had at least 25% of their student body from the 2023-24 school year funded by a Vermont public school district.
The provisions leave the 12 religious schools that last year received public tuition dollars ineligible for that funding. That includes Rice Memorial High School and Mount St. Joseph Academy, two prominent Catholic high schools based respectively in South Burlington and Rutland that, like others, have received an increasing share of public dollars since 2021.
To be sure, a very small percentage — about 100 students, or less than 4% — of the state’s roughly 3,000 students who used public funds for independent school tuition were going to religious schools. Meanwhile, a little over 2% of the $59,752,073 in education fund dollars that went to private schools in 2023-24 flowed to religious schools.
But the effect that Act 73’s eligibility requirements have on the state’s formerly eligible religious schools marks a departure from a trend seen in recent years that followed significant federal court rulings which bolstered the use of public tuition for religious schools.
In 2021, a federal appeals court judge ruled that three Vermont school districts could not exclude Catholic school students from the state’s tuition system.
Then, in 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Carson v. Makin held that Maine — which runs a similar tuition funding program to Vermont’s — could not award some parents a “public benefit,” specifically, tuition money, while in other cases “denying the benefit based on a recipient’s religious exercise.”
Since then, the number of religious schools receiving tuition has increased, as well as the amount of public funding flowing to them.
Rice Memorial High School received $644,385 in public tuition dollars for the 2023-24 school year, according to data provided by the Agency of Education, a more than 60% increase from the $386,925 in tuition dollars the school received during the 2022-23 school year.
Other prominent schools now ineligible for public funding include the Mid Vermont Christian School in Hartford, the Rutland Area Christian School and Mount St. Joseph Academy in Rutland. The latter received $395,250 in public tuition funds for the 2023-24 school year — a roughly $70,000 increase from the prior year.
VTDigger used information on schools’ websites to identify religious affiliation since the Agency of Education does not categorize schools as “religious.” Data for the 2024-25 school year was not available.
‘Non-religious criteria’
Now that that funding has been halted, questions remain over whether Vermont’s new independent school eligibility requirements, and their effect on religious schools, could be litigated.
Peter Teachout, a professor of law at Vermont Law School, said in an interview that the criteria around independent school eligibility is on solid footing regarding religious schools, at least based on the precedent set by the U.S. Supreme Court in the Carson v. Makin case.
The criteria that state lawmakers used in determining public tuition eligibility are religiously neutral, he said, and potential plaintiffs seeking legal action would need to prove these criteria were “somehow surrogates for excluding private, religious, independent schools.”
“That would have to be the argument: that in fact, the Legislature was seeking to exclude private, religious schools, and then it came up with non-religious criteria that would achieve that consequence,” he said. “That would be an extremely hard case to make, because the state is absolutely free to decide which independent schools get funding or don’t get funding, provided the criteria are not exclusively based on religion.”
Lawmakers who spoke to VTDigger said that the changes to funding for religious schools were a side effect of the policy changes enacted last session.
“The fact of the matter is what we implemented was really just a generally applicable standard to reflect continuing use of those schools that have served historically as public schools,” said Rep. Peter Conlon, D-Cornwall, the chair of the House Committee on Education who helped craft the final contours of Act 73.
Sen. Seth Bongartz, D-Bennington, the chair of the Senate Committee on Education, said he and others advocated for tuition dollars to continue to go to schools that “were integral to the delivery system” of education in Vermont.
Still, religious school officials said this will have an effect.
David Young, the superintendent of schools for the Diocese of Burlington, said the new eligibility requirements “certainly will hurt.” But he specifically took issue with the July 1 deadline imposed by lawmakers around independent school eligibility.
Young said the process around Act 73 feels “in disarray,” and noted that, while Act 73 immediately set requirements around the state’s tuitioning system, many aspects of the law remain unresolved.
As part of Act 73, Vermont’s School Redistricting Task Force has begun work to consolidate Vermont’s 118 school districts, contained within 51 supervisory districts or supervisory unions, into anywhere from 10 to 25 future districts.
“I just feel like it would have been better to say, ‘Let’s be clear on the procedures in the process. Let’s then set the date,'” he said. “If you’re going to draw these lines that encompass some of the larger districts in with others, you probably ought to understand that first before you upset the apple cart a little bit.”

The shooting was notable because it involved multiple agencies and mixed Barrus’ long-held conspiracy theories with drugs and alcohol. During the original prosecution, the court found that Barrus was incapable of assisting in his own defense, and psychiatrists prescribed a treatment to restore his mental health.
When Barrus refused, district court Judge Kathy Seeley ordered him to comply with the treatment, which included medication, or be forcibly treated. After he complied, doctors a year later determined that he was stable and able to help in defense of the charges.
On Sept. 21, 2021, a jury returned a verdict of guilty on one count of deliberate homicide, and two counts of attempted deliberate homicide, and Seeley ordered him to prison on three life sentences without the possibility of parole.
However, Barrus and his attorney appealed the decision saying that he should have been sentenced to the care of the state Department of Public Health and Human Services where he would be under psychiatric care.
In a unanimous decision on Tuesday, the Montana Supreme Court ruled that Barrus should remain in the care of the Montana Department of Corrections, which includes prison instead of the state’s mental hospital. Montana Supreme Court Justice Cory Swanson recused himself from participating in the case because he was the Broadwater County Attorney at the time and prosecuted Barrus.
  The meaning of ‘appreciate’ 

The decision the state’s highest and only appellate court had before it wasn’t simply confirming whether Barrus suffers from any psychiatric condition — something well established by the original trial. Instead, in order for the Supreme Court to make a decision on whether he should have been sentenced to the state mental hospital, it must consider whether Barrus, at the time of the crime, could appreciate the criminal repercussions he could face for his actions.
The judges determined that because the violent shooting spree began with anti-government rants and plans, and because he knew that drugs and alcohol could exacerbate his mental condition, that Barrus understood the consequences of his actions, even remarking after he had been apprehended that he wished that law enforcement agents would have shot him, effectuating a suicide-by-cop.
Even during his trip to jail, Barrus seemed to indicate he understood the gravity of the situation, according to court documents.
He told deputies that he wanted to be hung, “like the old vigilantes,” at one point asking, “Why don’t you guys shoot people anymore?”
He said he would rather be executed than “hanging around a bunch of god—n criminals.”
It wasn’t Barrus’ first time confronting law enforcement, and it wasn’t the first time he’d been in a shoot-out. In 2000, court records show that Barrus and one of his other sons, Jeffrey, had led a high-speed vehicle chase with a shoot-out and stand-off with law enforcement in the Mojave Desert. Both he and his son were charged with multiple felonies. Barrus served time in California from then until 2013, and had maintained a clean record after being released from prison.
That changed on the night of May 16, 2017. Barrus told his family that “all police should be hung (sic),” and warned his grandchildren against brainwashing by teachers, according to the court documents. He encouraged his son to help against the government, and ordered his son’s girlfriend to delete texts on her phone.
After heavy drinking, Barrus talked of a “suicide mission” and signed a copy of a manifesto, “We the People or Them the Government?” He drove a Chevrolet Suburban along with his son, Marshall, when they stopped in Townsend to get beer and gas in the early morning hours. Shortly after, they passed Moore at speeds in excess of 100 mph.
After a brief chase, Barrus slowed, apparently to allow Moore to get within range of Marshall’s rifle, according to court documents. Moore was struck in the face and he struggled to keep control of the vehicle. For three minutes in his squad car, which had left the highway, Moore attempted to get free and get help. That’s when Barrus and his son returned. The video footage captured Marshall yelling, shots being fired, then the Barruses fleeing.
Moore was found with tire tracks near his car and spent .308 shell casings. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
Later that morning, the father-son duo were brought to a stop approximately 120 miles away, west of Drummond on Interstate 90, even after driving on the rims of the wheels at 70 mph while shooting. Officers from four different counties were able to stop Barrus, but not without a volley of gunfire, which had managed to disable two other patrol vehicles.
Marshall Barrus lay dying of a gunshot wound to the head, while Lloyd Barrus surrendered.
The Supreme Court outlined the details of the grisly shoot-out, emphasizing Barrus’ understanding and knowledge of the situation, which lasted hours:	
    
“As the driver of the Suburban, Barrus returned to Deputy Moore’s stopped vehicle to allow Marshall to eliminate Deputy Moore as a witness so that his son was not charged with attempted murder — a rationale that suggests a recognition of legal consequences, strategic reasoning, and an understanding of their actions…Upon his surrender to law enforcement Barrus remained cogent and articulated the preceding events and his participation in them, including an expressed awareness that he had transgressed the laws of Montana, and that the state would inevitably prosecute him for his actions.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GettyImages-1185364093-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-20 18:57:13.288984

(Getty Images)Idaho reported the state’s third measles case in the last two weeks, after not reporting any infections this year during a national surge. 
Health officials say they don’t know of a link between the new measles case in Bonner County reported Wednesday and a separate case reported last week in Kootenai County, which are both in North Idaho. That means measles is likely spreading more, said Dr. Christine Hahn, Idaho’s state epidemiologist.
“Without any link between these two confirmed cases in north Idaho or travel outside of their communities, it’s reasonable to suspect that there is more measles circulating,” Hahn said in a statement. “As we’ve seen with other states around the nation, cases can begin to multiply quickly.” 
Idaho’s three measles cases are all in unvaccinated children. Vaccination is the best way to prevent measles, which is highly contagious and usually leads to hospitalization for one in five children younger than 5 years old who are infected. 
Last week, eastern Idaho health officials confirmed a measles case in Bonneville County. But officials said they didn’t think the public was exposed. 
In both regions of Idaho that have seen measles cases this year, the infections are the first reported in more than three decades and came shortly after early signs of the virus locally. Idaho hasn’t reported local measles cases since 2023, when an outbreak in southwest Idaho led to 10 infections.
The U.S. is experiencing the worst outbreak of measles in decades. This year, health officials have confirmed 1,375 measles cases across 41 states by Tuesday, according to the Centers for Disease Control, or CDC. About 13% of measles cases in the U.S. this year led to hospitalizations, the CDC reports.

 Officials encourage people to verify vaccination records

Measles is highly contagious but rare. Up to 90% of non-immune people in contact with an infected person can become infected. The virus can live in the air up to two hours after someone infected leaves.
Symptoms typically appear seven to 14 days after exposure and include high fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a distinctive rash, the CDC says. While many recover without problems, measles can lead to serious complications, especially in very young children and people with weakened immune systems.
Health officials encourage people to verify their family’s vaccination records with their primary care provider or through the Docket App. A person is considered immune if they were born before Jan. 1, 1957, have a documented history of laboratory-confirmed measles or have documentation that they received both doses of the MMR vaccine. 
Idaho has a spotty record for measles vaccinations, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
The virus’s serious complications can include pneumonia, encephalitis (an inflammation of the brain) and, in rare cases, death.
People with measles symptoms should not enter health care settings without calling ahead, and they should contact their health care providers. People exposed to measles should monitor for symptoms for 21 days after exposure.
There is no antiviral treatment for measles, according to the CDC.

(Main photo courtesy of the University of Iowa; form courtesy of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security)The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is seeking the dismissal of a lawsuit filed by University of Iowa students who fear they’ve been targeted for deportation.
The federal agency argues that it has complied with court orders in the case by reversing a decision in April to alter the students’ status within the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System — a move that could have paved the way for deportation.
By reversing course, the agency’s lawyers argue, Homeland Security has rendered the lawsuit moot. The plaintiffs, they argue in their motion to dismiss the case, “have obtained the relief they originally sought. There is nothing more for the court to do.”
In their motion, lawyers for Homeland Security acknowledge the judge in the case, when responding to a different motion, had previously ruled that “actions compelled by court order are not actions that moot a case.”
Attorneys for the students have yet to respond to the motion to dismiss. The students’ attorney, Katherine Melloy Goettel, declined to comment on the matter. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Aug. 27.
Judge has rejected prior requests from DHS
In April 2025, the three UI international students and one international-student graduate sued DHS for wrongful termination of their student status, which they alleged caused irreparable stress and anxiety due to fear of imminent seizure and deportation.
On May 15, 2025, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction requiring DHS to maintain the plaintiffs’ status as students in its Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records. The judge also ordered DHS to add to the records a notation of active student status that would be backdated to the date the agency had terminated that status — ensuring that other entities wouldn’t act on the termination and attempt to deport the students on that basis.
On June 12, 2025, DHS filed a motion seeking to revise the injunction. The department argued that due to technological limitations with SEVIS records, the system did not allow the creation of written notations that would be visible to other users of the system, such as schools and employers, outside of DHS.
DHS asked that the court issue a ruling indicating it had fulfilled the requirements of the injunction, while also arguing the injunction was overbroad and amounted to a prohibition against any sort of prosecution for crimes the students might commit.
Noting that DHS had made no assertions as to what, if any, efforts had been made to remedy the claimed technological limitations within SEVIS, U.S. District Court Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger denied DHS’ motion to revise her order.
With regard to DHS’ claim that the injunction bars future criminal prosecutions, Ebinger noted that her order does not apply to state, county, or local law enforcement acting separately from DHS and not at DHS’ instruction.
Also, she ruled, the injunction “prevents neither arrests nor the commencement of prosecutions. Rather, as to the plaintiffs — four individual people whom the court previously found to be likely to succeed on their claims of unfounded and harmful status record interference — the court’s order requires advance notice to the court as part of defendants’ due process efforts. The order does not prohibit law enforcement actions.”
DHS officials describe Student Criminal Alien Initiative
As part of their recent request for a dismissal of the lawsuit, attorneys for Homeland Security provided the court with a sworn statement from Akil Baldwin, the acting assistant director of the National Security Division of Homeland Security Investigations within the department.
In his statement, Baldwin said he oversees the Student Exchange Visitor Program “in support of ICE efforts to identify, disrupt and dismantle transnational criminal enterprises and terrorist organizations.” He said the four UI students’ criminal histories — which, according to the students’ attorney, are limited to misdemeanor-level offenses such as drunken driving — led to the revocation of their student visas.
The process, he said in his statement, began when Homeland Security Investigations, or HSI, launched what he called the Student Criminal Alien Initiative.
As part of that initiative, he said, HSI obtained access to the federal criminal database maintained by the National Crime Information Center to determine “whether any nonimmigrant students had criminal records.”
HSI then sent its findings to the U.S. Department of State “to take action as it deemed appropriate,” Baldwin said. The Department of State then revoked “some nonimmigrant student visas with an NCIC record,” Baldwin stated.
Then, at the Department of State’s request, HSI terminated the SERVIS records of those students who now had no valid student visa. In April, amid a flurry of litigation related to its actions, Homeland Security reversed course and began restoring the students’ SEVIS records to “active” status.
During a District of Columbia court hearing in April, Homeland Security’s assistant director for national security, Andre Watson, discussed the agency’s Student Criminal Alien Initiative.
Watson testified as to how 10 to 20 ICE employees spent several weeks combing through the records of 1.3 million holders of student visas to determine whether any of them might have had some form of interaction with law enforcement, such as a traffic violation that was later dismissed.
An exasperated D.C. District Court Judge Ana C. Reyes asked Watson, “Are you telling me that with all of the cost cutting that we have going on right now — because apparently we’re spending too much money in the federal government doing things like, oh, I don’t know, funding cancer research, can’t afford to do that — that we had, not ‘we,’ but ‘someone,’ had 10 to 20 federal employees spend their time going name by name in a database to see what hits they got for 1.3 million people? Is that what happened? Yes or no.”
“Yes,” Watson replied. He explained that of the 1.3 million student names, less than half of 1%, or roughly 6,400 student names, were passed on to the State Department. The State Department then revoked visas to travel into the United States for 3,000 of those students, and then told Homeland Security to terminate those students’ status in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System.
After hearing from Watson, Judge Reyes cited what she called the federal government’s “utter lack of concern for human individuals who we have invited into our country and who have (made) communities richer by being students who have contributed to our colleges and who have paid our colleges.”

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)Staring down an estimated $1.1 million budget gap resulting from congressional defunding, Rhode Island’s recently merged public media entity is cutting staff — first on a volunteer basis, and later, potentially through layoffs.
Pam Johnston, CEO of Rhode Island PBS and The Public’s Radio, notified employees of cuts in a staff meeting Wednesday. The internal announcement was followed up with a statement published on the company’s website shortly after. 
Citing the “significant and painful cut” prompted by the federal rescission package, which eliminated federal support for public broadcasting, Johnston said the company will be offering voluntary buyouts to “most” staff members. If not enough workers take the offer by the Sept. 5 deadline, the next step is organizationwide layoffs, according to the email.
Meg Geoghegan, a spokesperson for the company, referred to Johnston’s email when asked for comment.
The news comes less than two years after the premiere state media organizations announced plans to merge, pooling talent and resources. The merger was approved by state and federal regulators in the spring of 2024, with Johnston, a Massachusetts broadcast veteran, brought on to lead the newly created company in July 2024. At the time of the merger application, the company said it would have roughly 100 employees.
An updated staffing number for the newly christened Ocean State Media was not immediately available.
Nationwide, public media outlets have been grappling with the fallout of federal funding cuts, which have provided a key source of money to public radio and broadcasting stations for nearly 60 years. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting announced it would be closing its doors by the end of the year due to eliminated federal funding.
In Rhode Island, the estimated $1.1 million cut represents 10% of the public media entity’s combined operating budget, according to news reports.
“We have scrutinized our budget and reduced expenses wherever possible while navigating the complexities of our merger,” Johnston wrote in the email sent to staffers. “We’ve also received an outpouring of support from our community and have hosted two of our most successful pledge drives ever. Despite these efforts, it is not enough to close the financial gap.”
Staffing cuts will not affect programming until further evaluation of the remaining workforce, Johnston said.
“This federal funding cut happened to us; we have no choice but to respond,” she said. “As I have said before, this moment will change us, but it will not stop us. Despite these challenging times, we will continue evolving, adapting, and innovating. Our audiences, who rely on us for trusted local news and information, expect nothing less.”

Five famous Floridians who identified as Sunshine State residents, including musician Jimmy Buffet, were awarded the Governor’s Medal of Freedom Wednesday.
In addition, Gov. Ron DeSantis bestowed the medal upon the late Democratic Govs. Bob Graham and Buddy MacKay Jr.,  South Florida Congressman Lincoln Díaz-Balart, and former Florida State University President John Thrasher.
“I’m proud to recognize the legacies of these great Floridians,” DeSantis said. “Our state is better for their contributions, and we’re proud they called Florida home. They have each earned the honor of being awarded the Governor’s Medal of Freedom.”
Buffet wasn’t born in Florida but had a strong connection to the state, living here for many years. He was active in conservation efforts, including performing in 2015 at the Florida Capitol at an Everglades Coalition rally. 
Buffet died in 2023; the Florida Legislature designated A1A, the road that meanders along Florida’s eastern coast, “Jimmy Buffett Memorial Highway.”
Buffet was friends with fellow honoree Graham, a Democrat born in Coral Gables who served as governor from 1979-1987 and as U.S. senator from 1987-2005. After retiring from the Senate, he remained active in public policy and civic education, giving back to his alma mater, the University of Florida, through the Bob Graham Center for Public Service. Graham died in April 2024.
MacKay served as governor for less than a month following Gov. Lawton Chiles’ death and is the second Democratic politico who received the medal. Mackay, who died in January, was the last Democrat to serve as governor in Florida, marking the bridge between two political eras. He had just lost to Jeb Bush in the 1998 governor’s race when Chiles died in December of that year.
MacKay was just two years removed from a bid for the U.S. Senate that he narrowly lost to Connie Mack when he became Chiles’ running mate. Part of Mack’s signature line against MacKay was, “Hey, Buddy you’re a liberal.”
The Governor’s Medal of Freedom was established in 2020 under Section 14.35, Florida Statutes, which allows the governor to recognize any person who has made an especially meritorious contribution to the interests and citizens of the state, its culture, or other significant public or private endeavor.
Attorney and Republican politician Díaz-Balart was born in Havana, Cuba. He served in the U.S. House for 18 years and authored key pieces of legislation including provisions of the Cuban Liberty (Libertad) Act which codified the U.S. embargo against the Cuban dictatorship in 1996. 
He also co-founded the Congressional Hispanic Leadership Institute in 2003 to help advance economic opportunities for the Hispanic community in Washington, D.C., and across the country. Before Congress, he served in the Florida House and Senate. He died in March 2025.
Thrasher was president of FSU from 2014 through 2021, the culmination of a lengthy career that began with him lobbying for the Florida Medical Association and eventually led him to serve in both chambers of the Florida Legislature. Thrasher, born in South Carolina but raised in Jacksonville, was speaker of the House for his last two years in the chamber.

State officials have a “high level of confidence” that ECFiber’s network will continue to operate smoothly through the transition, but noted the possibility of “a lot of strain” on staff and board members involved.

A federal judge has cleared the way for Vermont’s ECFiber broadband network to transition to a new operator, issuing an order aimed at ensuring stability of service for its roughly 10,000 rural customers.
ECFiber and its current operator, Great Works Internet or GWI, have traded several legal blows over their contract in recent months. GWI filed a suit in March against ECFiber board chair F.X. Flinn, accusing him of spying on the company and attempting to poach its employees in a plot to replace it. ECFiber moved for a preliminary injunction in June, seeking to force GWI to comply with a transition policy it said the operator was resisting. 
The Aug. 11 decision from Judge Mary Kay Lanthier dictated that GWI must comply with certain transitional measures, but also limited what the communications union district could require of its current operator before the switch to the new provider on Jan. 1. At that time, the Vermont ISP Operating Company, or VISPO — a new nonprofit created by members of ECFiber’s board — will take over the network’s operations. 
While GWI is not required to train VISPO employees or share confidential practices, the court ordered the company to provide access to infrastructure and management systems for representatives of the district.

Granting the injunction reflects the court’s belief that a smooth transition between operators is crucial to avoid harm to the public, Lanthier’s decision states. For many in ECFiber’s service area, the only alternative to the broadband network would be Digital Subscriber Line — or DSL — internet, which runs along telephone lines and provides much slower speeds for sending and receiving information. 
Although the parties to the suit describe the events of the last six months very differently, one thing they all agree on is that it’s expensive to provide internet to rural areas in Vermont. That’s why communications union districts — municipal bodies with the ability to fund fiber network infrastructure — were formed.
“Nobody else is serving them,” said Christine Hallquist, executive director of the Vermont Community Broadband Board, which was created in 2021 to advance the goal of universal, high-quality broadband access across the state.

Areas only covered by DSL are considered underserved by the state of Vermont. And even in places where other options exist, some locals say ECFiber is far better than the alternatives.
Holly Lague, the director of libraries in Thetford, said a lack of access to ECFiber’s broadband services would be a “huge hurdle” for the services she provides. Though other providers reach the area, she said she’s heard concerning reports that their services suffer from a lack of reliability and quality.
“I would probably panic,” Lague said.
But Hallquist said the community broadband board had a “high level of confidence” that ECFiber’s network will continue to operate smoothly through the transition, though acknowledged the possibility of “a lot of strain” on staff and board members.
The injunction, Hallquist said, provides a clear path through differences of opinion for the switch to happen.
“The law ruled in favor of ECFiber,” she said. “It really is that simple.”
GWI argued in court that VISPO would not be adequately prepared to step into its new role come January, citing concerns about the new organization’s experience and staffing levels.  
Gopi Sundaram, the newly appointed CEO of VISPO, declined to comment on his company’s operational progress. The nonprofit’s board chair, Alessandro Iuppa, said there was “no question in my mind” regarding VISPO’s ability to take on the ECFiber operations.

However, S&P Global released a report in May revising ECFiber’s rating outlook to “negative,” based largely on risks associated with the district’s transition to an untested operator. 
Scott Sagen, the primary analyst for the report, said the risks lay in the new operator’s lack of experience and an absence of employed staff in May. The outlook revision translates roughly to a 1-in-3 chance that Sagen’s company could downgrade the district’s rating for the municipal revenue bonds it might issue in the future, he said. ECFiber has used this type of bond before to help finance its construction efforts.
“We just felt like the plan change in 2026 could present additional operational challenges that could potentially weaken financial metrics,” Sagen said.
A downgrade wouldn’t be good, Flinn said, but it wouldn’t be an existential threat. The district doesn’t have specific plans to borrow more money in this way at the moment, he said, and when ECFiber issued unrated bonds with a higher interest rate in the past, they made it work financially.
In the Aug. 11 decision, Lanthier wrote that the court could not reasonably draw a conclusion on VISPO’s readiness, and that the court’s focus was ensuring a smooth transition to the new operator.
The decision came during a moment of uncertainty at GWI, during which Mac Mountain, a Vermont-based broadband investment company, exercised warrants for control of the internet service provider. 
According to an Aug. 14 Federal Communications Commission Filing by Mac Mountain, which holds a controlling interest in GWI, the move was prompted by an “emergency situation.” Several company officers, per the filing, fired a number of senior employees without notice, stopped paying some vendors, and planned to file for bankruptcy, among other actions with which Mac Mountain took issue.
Those officers are no longer employed at the company, said Alex Rozek, CEO of Mac Mountain and owner of GWI. There is also a new board of directors. 
Rozek said he had no doubts about the company’s stability. GWI’s former leadership did not respond to requests for comment.
Tom Cecere, a longtime manager at GWI, did not comment on the reasoning behind the decisions of previous leadership. 
“It had nothing to do with an immediate cash problem,” he said.
Cecere resigned from his position at GWI in the chaos preceding Mac Mountain’s takeover before returning to work the following week. Now, he said, the financial situation at GWI is stable, even with the impending loss of the ECFiber contract.
The company still has agreements with Northwest Fiberworx and DVFiber, two other Vermont communications union districts.
Rozek said he considers the transition “very risky” for the stability and financial health of the communications district. 
In response to criticisms from the district that GWI has an interest in keeping hold of the ECFiber contract, Rozek said the operator’s employees “also all live here, and have a vested interest in having the internet.”
In July, GWI posted an open letter to ECFiber customers detailing concerns around the district’s transparency, and VISPO’s preparedness. Flinn called the operator’s messaging on the transition “a campaign to create fear, uncertainty and doubt.”
Hallquist reaffirmed her confidence in ECFiber’s operation, and said that if it became necessary, her board could step in.

DemasA Republican bill to ban ranked choice voting in the state of Michigan, which was introduced in the House of Representatives last month and rammed through committee on Tuesday after just one hearing, was passed in the lower chamber Wednesday with opposition from the chamber’s Democrats.
House Bill 4707, sponsored by state Rep. Rachelle Smit (R-Martin), would ban the voting method if signed into law. The measure passed 55-44 with nine members of the House not voting.
Each vote affirming the passage of the bill came from a Republican member of the House, while each no vote came from the chamber’s Democrats. Eight Democrats and just one Republican – state Rep. Phill Green of Watertown Township – did not vote on the bill.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In a statement following the bill’s passage, Smit said her years as a township clerk taught her that clear, straightforward election rules were “the only way to maintain public trust.”
“Ranked Choice Voting, with its rounds of counting and reallocation, only breeds skepticism – especially when every close contest invites lawsuits and recount battles,” Smit said. “Michigan doesn’t need ballot-box gymnastics. We need integrity, clarity, and confidence, which are all qualities Ranked Choice Voting cannot deliver.”

The voting method allows voters to rank candidates for a position based on preference, rather than casting a ballot for a single candidate. It has been floated as an option to break up partisan gridlock and the grip of the two-party duopoly in American politics, but it gained further traction this year after the primary win of New York Democrat Zohran Mamdani, who became that party’s nominee for New York City mayor in an upset of former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The city uses ranked choice to select its mayoral primary candidates.
Smit acknowledged during a Tuesday hearing of the House Elections Integrity Committee that the law could likely be overturned at the ballot box next year if an initiative to institute ranked choice voting is affirmed by voters.
Some Michigan cities adopted measures to introduce the method in local elections, but existing state law has kept those plans from taking root. The Rank MI Vote initiative would make that method the law of the land for all statewide and federal elections.
Still, Smit and House Republicans said it would cause chaos for clerks and introduce confusion into an elections system that Republicans have – and without evidence – accused of being rife with fraud and irregularities.
“This may sound interesting in theory – but in practice, it’s a logistical nightmare,” Smit said. “Ranked Choice Voting creates serious confusion at the ballot box. Studies and real-world elections have shown that Ranked Choice Voting disproportionately impacts minority voters and those who don’t vote in every election. Instead of empowering voters, Ranked Choice Voting risks silencing them. It doesn’t strengthen democracy; it weakens it. Ranked Choice Voting has no place in Michigan.”
Smit advocated for the bill’s passage on the House floor Wednesday, as did Republican state Rep. Ann Bollin of Brighton and state Rep. Josh Schriver of Oxford.

Rising to oppose the bill in a floor speech was Democratic state Rep. Penelope of East Lansing.
“When somebody talks about banning something that is already banned, you have to ask, ‘what else is going on?’” Tsernoglou said. “I ask what those who believe rank choice voting violates these principles would say to the number of jurisdictions here in Michigan, where when left to the voters, a majority of the voters in those communities decided that they wanted to use ranked choice voting for their local elections. When communities across Michigan decide through their own ballots that they want ranked choice voting, that should be the end of the conversation.”
Tsernoglou said it was apparent to her that some of her colleagues don’t like it when voters make changes through referendums.
“Instead of respecting local democracy, they’re reaching in with heavy hands to say, ‘No, you can’t do that,’” Tsernoglou said. “This is more than overreach. It’s a flat out rejection of our democratic values.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_1251-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-20 17:57:31.176127

Earlier this year, lawmakers passed House Bill 137 to establish the Strategic Water Supply, which includes $40 million to treat salty waters in aquifers and alleviate the stress from climate change shrinking rivers and depleting freshwater supplies in aquifers.
The bill represented a slimmed-down version of the project touted by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, which would have included efforts to treat wastewater from oil and gas projects and had a half-a-billion dollar price tag.
Leadership at the Office of the State Engineer and the New Mexico Environment Department, which manages the program, told lawmakers at the legislative Water and Natural Resources Committee meeting this week in Las Cruces that the $40 million will exclusively be used for grants for local governments or contracts with private companies.
“The goals for the program are to encourage communities to be able to withstand that potential future of less water supply available, and to allow them to diversify supplies that they have amongst service water, groundwater, recycled water elements,” said Deputy State Engineer Tanya Trujillo.
While no specific projects have been put forward, cities like Eunice are increasingly looking to desalination to increase water supplies.
For desalination to work, some of the water may have to be treated for more than just salt, in order to address contaminants such as arsenic or uranium. As part of the new initiative, the state is undertaking a yearslong process to determine the shape, size and quality of New Mexico’s aquifers. Researchers at New Mexico State University, in partnership with the environment department, the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources and private owners say they have thus far sampled water from 19 aquifers to test for quality.
Pei Xu, one of the NMSU researcher in the civil engineering department, said further research will be needed.“The challenges and opportunities of developing brackish water is understanding the quantity and the quality of the water aquifers,” Xu said.
Officials said they would have feasibility studies to compare the costs of any proposed projects for treating brackish water with benefits to the community or impacts on the environment.
“We don’t want a science experiment,” Deputy Cabinet Secretary John Rhoderick told lawmakers. “We want results.”
Rhoderick said he anticipates requests for grant funding will “greatly outstrip” the $40 million allocated by the Legislature, and said the departments would likely seek further funding in the 2026 session.
Rep. Patricia Roybal Caballero (D-Albuquerque) asked how the push to install expensive infrastructure for desalination is being balanced with cheaper policy options to conserve water.
Rhoderick and Trujillo said an “all of the above approach” is necessary.
“Nothing is more apparent than the reality that the only way we solve water problems in New Mexico is by utilizing 100 different methods,” Rhoderick said. “There is no one-size-fits-all solution.”

State House Speaker Rep. Phillip DeVillier, R-Eunice, has asked lawmakers to keep their schedule flexible between Oct. 23 and Nov. 13, which is just days after the Supreme Court justices are scheduled to hear arguments in Louisiana v. Callais, a case that could lead to the overturning of Louisiana’s congressional maps. 
Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New Iberia, chairman of the House and Governmental Affairs Committee that oversees redistricting, said the speaker wants lawmakers to be available in case they need to take action in response to the court’s ruling. A decision is not expected until months after arguments, perhaps as late as June of next year, prompting some lawmakers to call the planning premature. 
“First of all, there can’t even be a special session until the courts rule,” Rep. Jack McFarland, R-Jonesboro, said, “and if they don’t rule in October, then why would you have a special session?” 
DeVillier did not respond to a request for comment. 
Several lawmakers interviewed for this report said they believed calls to prepare for a special session come from Gov. Jeff Landry, rather than legislative leaders. 
Landry spokeswoman Kate Kelly declined to comment. 
The jump to tackle redistricting is in line with other states with Republican governors and party majorities in their legislatures that have announced their intent to draw new districts that favor Republicans ahead of the 2026 congressional midterm elections. 
Rep. Edmond Jordan, D-Baton Rouge, chairman of the Louisiana Legislative Black Caucus, said not only would it be too soon to hold a special redistricting session without a Supreme Court ruling, it would also be disingenuous. He referenced a separate redistricting lawsuit, Nairne v. Louisiana, in which Black voters sued over new state House and Senate maps that did not increase the number of majority Black districts despite an increase in Louisiana’s Black population percentage. 
A U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals panel upheld a district judge’s ruling that found the maps violated the Voting Rights Act, but the state won’t have to update until the outcome of the Callais case is determined. 
“I think if we’re going to [ask for a] stay on the state court case pending the ruling of the Supreme Court in the federal court case, it seems to make sense that we would hold off on the congressional maps pending the decision of the Supreme Court,” Jordan said. 
In the Callais case, in which non-Black voters sued over the creation of a second majority-Black congressional district, the Supreme Court has indicated it will consider the constitutionality of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Its provisions prohibit actions and policies that restrict a person’s right to vote based on their race, color or membership in a language minority group.
Justices were expected to rule on the case in the spring. But in a rare move, they scheduled additional arguments in October. The delay meant not only that a new congressional map, if necessary, would not be in place until the 2028 election, but that the legislature would be delayed in crafting new state House and Senate districts. 
“They want to slow roll this and take full advantage of these unconstitutional maps,” Jordan said, referring to the legislative district maps. “But then, when it comes to try to implement maps that are constitutional, that would be fair and just for African Americans in this state, they want to slow roll it and play judicial games with us.” 
“We’re not naive about this,” Jordan added. “We’re certainly cognizant of what’s happening and … voters in Louisiana need to wake up and pay attention to what’s happening.”

Dan McKee took to the Rhode Island State House Wednesday afternoon for a ceremonial signing of two bills he approved nearly two months ago that will expand Rhode Island’s Temporary Caregiver Insurance (TCI) — the state’s form of paid family leave.
McKee may have waited to celebrate the bills, but Rhode Islanders will also have to wait to enjoy the new law’s benefits, as they don’t kick in until Jan. 1, 2027. The perks include gradually raising TCI’s weekly income replacement from 60% to 70% of a worker’s usual wages. The wage replacement will rise again to 75% of full weekly income on Jan. 1, 2028. 
The legislation also increases the taxable wage base for Temporary Disability Insurance — TCI’s funding source — from $38,000 to $100,000 to boost the program’s solvency. 
The new law builds on legislation approved last year that lengthened paid family leave from six to seven weeks. That law went into effect on Jan. 1, and starting Jan. 1, 2026, qualifying workers will be eligible for a full eight weeks. By the time the 2025 legislation goes into effect, workers will be able to enjoy a full eight weeks of benefits, with the income replacement calculated by a formula based on a worker’s highest quarter of earnings.
“By expanding paid family leave, we are reinforcing the message that workers in Rhode Island should not have to choose between their paycheck and their family,” McKee said in a statement. “This expansion of the wage replacement rate helps us stay competitive and a national leader on this issue.”
McKee first OK’d the legislation on June 26, shortly after the end of the 2025 legislative session, when the bills sponsored by Senate President Valarie Lawson, an East Providence Democrat, and Rep. Joshua Giraldo, a Central Falls Democrat, passed both chambers. Lawson and Giraldo joined McKee, advocates, and labor leaders Wednesday for the signing ceremony.
In 2013, Rhode Island became the third state in the nation to offer paid parental leave — an amenity that’s common in other wealthy countries, but not in the United States. Neighboring states Connecticut and Massachusetts both provide benefits for longer than Rhode Island does — up to 12 weeks — but use more complex payment formulas.
Connecticut benefits are tied to the state minimum wage and max out at $981 a week, replacing up to 95% of weekly pay for lower earners. Massachusetts calculates benefits based on the “state average weekly wage” for a maximum benefit around $1,170 a week. In Rhode Island, benefits are currently capped at $1,103 weekly. 
Lawson echoed McKee and said in a statement the legislation will help Rhode Island catch up in temporary leave benefits after having “fallen behind other states.” 
“A society in which people have the time to bond with their babies and care for their loved ones is a healthier society, in every sense of the word,” Lawson said. “This proven program is funded not through employers but through a modest assessment on the workers themselves.” 
Giraldo said in his own statement that “the gift of time that TCI provides is priceless,” given his own experiences caring for his prematurely born daughter.
Lawson and Giraldo also sponsored the bills approved last year that expanded the amount of time workers were eligible for paid leave. The successful versions of these bills followed an initial push for 12 weeks of benefits, which was eventually whittled down to the model now in effect. 
The newly approved legislation does, however, accomplish a goal left unfulfilled from last year’s efforts, by adding siblings to the roster of eligible family members for which workers can take paid leave.  
Rhode Island’s paid family leave is funded entirely through payroll deductions and allows workers to take time to bond with a new child or care for an ill family member, such as a parent, spouse, domestic partner, grandparent, sibling, or in-law. Eligible workers include people who earn their income in Rhode Island, pay into the TDI fund, and make at least $18,000 annually, or meet an alternate threshold. 
According to a legislative press release when the bills passed in June, workers making up to $89,200 will see no increase in contributions. A person making a salary of $100,000 would see a weekly increase of about $2.70 a week.
Full details about the program, including applications, are available on the Department of Labor and Training’s website.

Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte made a criminal referral to the Department of Justice on Wednesday, accusing Cook of falsifying bank documents and property records “to acquire more favorable loan terms,” for properties in Ann Arbor, Michigan and Atlanta, Georgia.

She was confirmed for an additional, full term in 2023, with her tenure set to expire on Jan. 31, 2038. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Before she was appointed to the board, Cook was a professor of economics and international relations at Michigan State University as well as a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research. She was previously on the faculty for Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. 
Cook also served as a senior economist on the Council of Economic Advisers under Democratic former President Barack Obama from 2011 to 2012. She served as a senior adviser on finance and development in the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of International Affairs from 2000 to 2001.
Chelsea Grate, media relations assistant for the board, said they did not have anything to share when asked for comment. 
The allegations against Cook have emerged amidst Trump’s ongoing feud with the Fed’s Chair, Jerome Powell, with the president pressuring Powell to resign over his refusal to lower interest rates.  
Pulte has also made referrals against New York Attorney General Letitia James, who secured a $464 million fraud judgment against Trump for misrepresenting his assets in financial statements, and Sen.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Florida’s new second-in-command is headed to California to extradite a man who was driving a semi-truck in Florida and allegedly caused an accident that resulted in three people dead. 
Lt. Gov. Jay Collins and Gov. Ron DeSantis said Wednesday that Collins will to to California to “ensure” Harjinder Singh, an immigrant from India without permanent legal status “is extradited back to Florida.”
Garnering national headlines over the weekend, including a dashcam video the White House responded to on social media. Singh is seen attempting a U-Turn on the Florida Turnpike in St. Lucie County in an “official use only” turning lane, blocking traffic. The video shows a minivan with three people inside crashing into the truck. 
“Today I’m sending Florida’s new Lt. Gov. Jay Collins to California and tomorrow morning he is going to take possession of this illegal alien, extradite him back to the state of Florida, and we’re going to throw the book at him when he gets back here for what he did, so you can count on that,” DeSantis said during a news conference Wednesday afternoon.
According to DeSantis, once it was determined that Singh could’ve committed a crime, federal authorities “were able to provide pretty much the whole dossier on this guy.”
The information included, DeSantis said, that Singh entered the country in 2018 through the U.S.=Mexico border and applied for work authorization in 2020, was rejected, then accepted in 2021.

Day in court
The Modesto Bee reported Wednesday that Singh signed extradition papers Tuesday, giving Florida 30 days to take him into custody. Singh had a fugitive warrant and appeared in San Joaquin Superior Court in Stockton, the Bee reported. 
“Dressed in an orange jail jumpsuit Tuesday, Singh stood before Judge John Soldati and was assisted by an interpreter. He confirmed he understood his rights, and the judge appointed a public defender to represent him. Singh then signed extradition forms, which Soldati also signed, starting the process for Florida authorities to take custody,” the Bee reported. 
According to DeSantis, Singh obtained a commercial driver’s license from the state of Washington, then used that license to obtain a commercial license in California. 
Singh “abysmally failed” an English test conducted in the past few days, DeSantis said. 
“Not even close, not even broken English, like this guy did not know English and yet somehow he was given a CDL by Washington and a CDL by the state of California, and that should not have happened,” DeSantis said. 
The company Singh worked for, White Hawk Carriers, is no longer permitted to operate outside of California after losing its insurance, the Bee reported. 
“The company put him in there. Did the company not look to see whether he could speak English?” DeSantis said.
“That’s a huge problem with the company, so we’re looking through that,” DeSantis said.
DeSantis criticized the GOP-majority Congress for not taking action against states with more welcoming immigration policies. 
“Why doesn’t Congress use the power of the purse and say, ‘Your funding is contingent upon following federal law with respect to immigration, you can’t be a sanctuary jurisdiction,’” DeSantis said. 
Collins is a former Green Beret who suffered a leg amputation in the line of duty and left his spot in the Florida Senate this month to become lieutenant governor. 
Attorney General James Uthmeier said Singh will face immigration charges at the conclusion of the vehicular manslaughter charges. 
State Rep. Alex Andrade, a Republican who has traded jabs with the DeSantis administration over Hope Florida, criticized the “political stunt” on social media.

(Courtesy photo from the city of Providence)Providence Police are now tapping into private cameras to try to solve crimes quicker — and it’s all being done voluntarily.
The city this week announced the launch of a “Real Time Crime Center” where detectives can access live feeds from hundreds of cameras to gather “actionable” information to rapidly respond to incidents via Fusus, a police surveillance technology.
Providence is the first city in Rhode Island to launch an operations center of this kind, according to the city’s announcement.
“By equipping our officers with real-time tools and intelligence, we are modernizing our approach to policing and ensuring faster, more coordinated responses that keep our communities safer,” Mayor Brett Smiley said in a statement.
The new operations center located inside the police department’s Major Crimes Unit integrates security cameras, license plate readers, body cameras, and 911 data that analysts can share in real-time with officers.
Private citizens and businesses can voluntarily register their cameras to assist police in tracking crimes. 
So far, 21 private citizens or businesses have given Providence Police access to 145 cameras, city spokesperson Anthony Vega confirmed in an email to Rhode Island Current. An additional 145 city-owned cameras are part of the system.
As of Wednesday, the city had around half a dozen pending applications from residents who wanted to link their cameras to the new crime center, Vega wrote.
The city will pay Arizona-based Axon Fusus $750,000 to run the system through at least July 2028, according to the contract the city signed in June 2024. The agreement technically runs for two years from the active start date, but automatically renews each year for up to three more years, as long as the Providence Board of Contract and Supply approves the funding.
Another vendor, Constant Technologies, has also worked on the real-time crime center, according to Smiley’s office. A copy of that contract was not immediately made available.
To cover the cost, the city is using a $1 million federal earmark secured by U.S. Sen. Jack Reed in 2023, according to the city’s announcement.
Reed said the new operations center will help Providence police stop, and solve, crimes while ensuring that “law enforcement is accountable to the public.”
“As with any new technology used by law enforcement, balancing public safety, privacy, and civil liberties is paramount and there must be stringent safeguards and oversight,” Reed said in a statement.
But the city’s crime center has drawn concerns from the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island, which is drafting a formal letter to the city over what it calls the “normalization of constant surveillance.”
“Making a whole web of someone’s movements throughout the day can really do a number on surveillance,” Madalyn McGunagle, a policy associate for the ACLU of Rhode Island, said in an interview Wednesday.
The mayor’s office stressed that officers will not monitor security cameras in the system 24/7, nor will they pull up live feeds randomly. Shared footage is used solely in response to active criminal incidents or public safety emergencies, according to the city’s announcement.

Kate Kampner is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
HYDE PARK — When New Zealand native Charlotte Brynn moved to Vermont in 1998, it didn’t take long for her to discover the natural waters of Vermont. 
Brynn grew up swimming in glacial lakes and the waters that surround the island country. Now she’s been the executive director of the Swimming Hole, a nonprofit community pool and fitness center in Stowe, since 2001. 
While she transitioned to her life in the United States, she began open water swimming in Vermont at the Green River Reservoir in Hyde Park. In 2006, Brynn entered a YMCA Burlington event to swim eight miles across Lake Champlain from Willsboro Point in New York to Burlington. 
She quickly fell in love with long-distance open water swimming and eventually set a goal to swim the English Channel, the part of the Atlantic Ocean that separates southern England and northern France. Brynn was able to do the 21-mile swim in 11 hours and 43 minutes. 
The 12-year journey to success would deepen Brynn’s relationship with the natural waters of the world and strengthen her passion for protecting the environment. For many open water swimmers like Brynn, concern for the environment plays a large role in their swimming careers. 
“As open water swimmers, we gain an appreciation for the environment,” said Paula Yankauskas, a resident of Hyde Park and another long-distance swimmer who uses Green River Reservoir for training. “Without it, we wouldn’t be able to do what we do.” 
Yankauskas has been swimming since she was 11 years old and swam for the University of Vermont. Eventually, she would train and successfully swim the English Channel, making her the oldest woman in the United States to do so in 2016. She and Brynn also both swam the Catalina Channel and around the island of Manhattan. 
“You start to want to care about [the natural waters] and do what you can to help keep things clean and available,” Yankauskas said. 
Brynn said that Green River Reservoir is well-maintained and protected from bad water quality and doesn’t appear to have runoff. Both Crystal Lake and Lake Willoughby, other natural waters in the Vermont and New Hampshire area, she said, are also pretty clear. “Lake Memphremagog saddens me because I’ve noticed a real decline,” Brynn said. 
Brynn has been swimming in Lake Memphremegog since 2009 and has seen a variety of manmade waste, bleaching and discoloration of rocks on the side, and occasionally white and foamy bubbles on the surface. In 2021, Canadian officials found traces of PFAS in the lake. 
Lake Memphremagog, which crosses over into the Canadian border, is 31 miles long. Three-quarters of it is in Vermont and it serves as a water source for 200,000 people. 
“I’m in there an hour to five to ten hours,” Brynn said. “There’s definitely a concern.”

Brynn said she has her own test kit to test any of the waters she swims in after flooding or if there’s discoloration. 
She also said, despite its great swimming community and accessibility, Lake Champlain has work to do. She monitors swimming areas online to make sure they are safe from harmful recurring contaminants like cyanobacteria or phosphorus runoff. 
Another concern that Yankauskas raised is the recent increase in wildfire smoke in the state. When open water swimming in a group, she noted how one of their members, who has asthma, hadn’t been able to swim on days with bad air quality. In response, their practices have been moved indoors if the air quality index is high enough. 
But despite concern for water and air quality, as well as their health, both Brynn and Yankauskas keep on swimming. 
“The water really produces a giant hug and the ripples of it just wash away stuff,” Brynn said. “It’s very much like meditation or yoga where once you are one with the water and you’re swimming, those other stresses and worries, whether they’re relevant or not, they melt away.” 
Brynn said she felt her relationship with nature had changed during the process of training for the English Channel, especially with the Green River Reservoir. 
“I know every tree and rock along that shoreline,” Brynn said. “You have such an appreciation for the beauty.” 
Franny Cohen is a New Hampshire resident who spends time swimming in Vermont’s natural waters. She said she feels like part of the landscape when open water swimming.
“You’re aware of the loons and the ducks in New England,” said Cohen. She called her time swimming in the Boston Harbor euphoric. 
Yankauskas recalled swimming in the Catalina Channel at night and swimming through bioluminescent organisms in the water. “It’s like shooting diamonds and lightning off your fingertips,” she said. “It’s just really beautiful.” 
Brynn said sometimes when she’s swimming she can feel fish swim under her bodies’ shade, hiding from people who are fishing in the lakes. 
These swimmers’ passion and commitment for the open waters only empowers them to communicate, educate, and inspire others to think about how important good water quality is for the planet. 
Brynn called water the resource of the future.

(Pool photo by Bethany Baker/The Salt Lake Tribune) When campaigning for president in 1992, Bill Clinton raced back to Arkansas to oversee the execution of Billy Ray Rector. Clinton’s actions had nothing to do with addressing Arkansas’ record crime rates at the time. It was political theater. Mr. Rector’s crime was atrocious. He also suffered from mental illness to such an extent that on his way to be executed, he deliberately left behind the dessert from his last meal. He said he was “saving it for later.”
Yet Clinton believed it better politically to watch a mentally ill man put to death than to show mercy. Although sadly he may have been proven right, the execution is “remembered as a disgrace” to the state of Arkansas.
Utah may be poised to join Arkansas and other states as having executed a person with mental illness. After going over a decade without executing anyone, our state chose to execute Taberon Honie in 2024. Now the state seeks to execute Ralph Menzies.
In 1986, Mr. Menzies committed a terrible crime, kidnapping and murdering Maurine Hunsaker. Today, he is 67 years old. He relies on a wheelchair. He breathes with aid of an oxygen tank. And like Mr. Rector, he suffers with mental illness, having been diagnosed with dementia.
There is not an apparent reason why his crime compared to others requires the punishment of death. Combined with the 11 other people put to death or currently on death row, his crime represents less than one percent of the over 2250 murders in Utah between 1986 and 2024. By any definition, killing Ralph Menzies is an arbitrary infliction of extreme punishment for punishment’s sake only.
When the United States Supreme Court briefly abolished the death penalty in 1973, it was the arbitrary nature of its use that led to it being declared cruel and unusual in violation of the constitution. Justice Potter Stewart described that “death sentences are cruel and unusual in the same way that being struck by lightning is cruel and unusual.” He explained that for all the people sentenced to death, their crimes did not stand out for any reason other than they were among a “random handful upon whom” the sentence of death has been imposed.
As for Mr. Menzies, his crime does not stand out for any reason from the other notable, and thousands of less notable, murders over the decades in Utah. Mark Hofmann avoided the death penalty. He used bombs to kill two people to cover up a scheme to defraud The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. There is the “self-described ‘white-power skinhead’” who murdered Corrections Officer Stephen Anderson in an escape attempt. He too avoided the death penalty. Of the four other people on Utah’s death row, two sit there while their co-defendants do not.
It may be said that even if the death penalty is arbitrarily imposed, it must exist as a deterrent. Not so. The death penalty is not a deterrent. It is a fact that overall states without it have lower murder rates than states with it and that states that have recently abolished the death penalty saw no increase in their murder rates. In contrast, six of the seven states with the highest murder rates all have the death penalty, with five having executed someone since the start of 2024.
What about victims? Ms. Hunsaker’s daughter recently came out against the execution, writing that she does not “believe that justice will be served by taking another life.” Ms. Hunsaker’s son has publicly supported the execution, saying the family is ready for “closure.” No one can question his feelings or the reasonableness of wanting closure. But closure comes in many forms. What cannot be known is how anyone would feel about closure if the case had ended in any other fashion. As Mr. Menzies’ case typifies, waiting for imposition of the death penalty inhibits closure.
Which comes back to Mr. Menzies. Whatever led him to commit the horrendous crime is long since gone. Whoever he was then is not the person we see today. That is true due to the passage of time. It is true because none of us should be defined by the worst thing we ever did. And it is true because he is an elderly, sick man.
We can be better than this. Or Utah will go through with killing a man with dementia who needs an air tank to breathe. It will be our own unforgettable disgrace.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/250813_MENZIESCOMMUTATION.081325_2006_bb-1024x673.jpg,,,2025-08-20 17:57:31.176127

(Official White House Photo by Daniel Torok)South Florida U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Oregon U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley have written a letter calling on the heads of the Department of Homeland Security, ICE, and FEMA to provide detailed information regarding the operation of the Everglades immigration detention facility known as “Alligator Alcatraz.”
“Human rights experts have condemned the plan as ‘cruel and inhumane’ by design,” reads the letter, co-signed by more than 60 other Democrats from the House and Senate.
“Construction progressed at ‘turbo speed,’ and it remains unclear whether the facility has plans to ensure medical care, rapid hurricane evacuation, access to counsel, and sufficient infrastructure for sewage, running water, and temperature controls, despite being located in one of the ‘hottest parts of the state.’”
The lawmakers say they want federal authorities to provide extensive information about the facility by Sept. 3, including:

Identify the legal authority that allows Florida to run the facility;
Confirm that it meets federal standards for the treatment of detainees;
Identify private vendors contracted to operate the facility;
Identify criteria are used to segregate detainees;
Explain what is being done to prevent contamination of drinking water;
Explain any consultation with the Miccosukee and Seminole tribes before construction of the facility; and
Tell whether any minors or women have been detained at the facility.

Six of the eight members of the Florida Democratic congressional delegation signed the letter; the only members who did not were South Florida Rep. Jared Moskowitz and Central Florida’s Darren Soto.
A federal judge on Monday dismissed part of a lawsuit over the legal rights of detainees at the facility.
U.S. District Judge Rodolfo Ruiz in the Southern District of Florida ruled that claims detainees at the facility lack confidential access to immigration court were rendered moot when the Trump administration designated the Krome North Processing Center near Miami as a site for the cases to be heard.
The court order transferred the case to the Middle District of Florida. The detention site is in Collier County, under the Middle District’s jurisdiction.
Eunice Cho, senior counsel at the ACLU National Prison Project, said Wednesday that because of the lawsuit the federal government is now allowing immigrants at Alligator Alcatraz the ability to petition the immigration court for release from detention.
Related litigation
A second lawsuit over environmental concerns at the facility by Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity has resulted in U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ordering a 14-day pause on additional construction on the site while witnesses testify at a hearing.
Gov. Ron DeSantis announced last week that state officials are now working on opening a second immigration detention facility that will be called “Deportation Depot” within the Baker Correctional Institution, a temporarily closed state prison in Northeast Florida. It will hold around 1,300 detainees and is expected to open sometime next month.

Entergy Louisiana plans to spend $3.2 billion on a power plant to run the center, plus additional money on a related gas plant in south Louisiana and transmission lines. (Meta)PLAQUEMINE – State utility regulators approved a plan Wednesday to install three natural-gas fueled power plants for the tech company Meta, which needs the electricity for a massive data center it’s building in Northeast Louisiana. 
The Louisiana Public Service Commission voted 4-1 to approve the unprecedented project from Entergy Louisiana to supply a massive amount of power for a single customer. Commissioner Davante Lewis, D-Baton Rouge, cast the lone dissenting vote, saying an agreement Meta and Entergy struck with other stakeholders before the vote felt rushed with too many questions still left unanswered. 
“There’s a lot of things I just can’t verify at the moment,” said Lewis, who has previously voiced support for the Meta data center. 
The Public Service Commission originally expected to vote on Entergy’s plan in October, coinciding with a deadline it set for its administrative law judge to settle any disputes involving businesses and groups opposed to the power generation project. The judge would then issue a recommendation to the commissioners about whether Entergy could move forward. 
Instead, Entergy, Meta and parties previously against the project told regulators last month they had reached an agreement with Entergy  ahead of the deadline, and a vote could take place to allow the power plant to advance. Entergy then filed a request to immediately place the matter on this month’s Public Service Commission meeting, held at the Carl F. Grant Civic Center in Plaquemine, rather than wait on the judge’s recommendation. 
This shortcut around the normal project approval process drew concerns from the public and ratepayer advocacy groups, who spoke for hours in opposition to Entergy’s plan. 
The three turbines dedicated to the Meta facility will have the capacity to generate 2,200 megawatts of electricity. They will increase Entergy’s statewide generation capacity roughly 20%, as the data center’s power needs are over twice the amount the entire city of New Orleans uses on a hot summer day, according to the Alliance for Affordable Energy. The ratepayer advocacy group wanted the Public Service Commission to delay its vote until October.
Meta has 20 other data centers around the world, and its Richland Parish facility would be the largest. While Entergy’s power complex is being built specifically for the data center, it will be connected to the larger electric grid and could supply power to other customers.
Entergy’s proposal has the full support of the commission’s consultants, who studied it for 10 months. One of the consultants, Lane Sisung, said Meta is covering 100% of the cost of all three turbines.

Read it here.
Desde 2020, los demócratas han soñado con derrotar a la representante republicana Young Kim de su escaño en el Condado de Orange, solo para ver cómo sus candidatos eran vencidos por amplio margen. 
Pero eso no ha disuadido a Lisa Ramírez, una abogada de inmigración, mejor conocida por haber ayudado a liberar a un padre migrante de tres hijos marines estadounidenses que fue detenido por ICE , de sumarse a la carrera para 2026.
Hija de una madre inmigrante, Ramírez citó lo que describió como la ola de detenciones masivas, la falta de proceso, el desprecio del presidente Donald Trump por las órdenes judiciales y el estado de derecho como las principales razones para postularse.
 “Para mí, esta carrera se ha tratado fundamentalmente de proteger nuestra Constitución, nuestra democracia y, en última instancia, mi comunidad”, dijo Ramírez en una entrevista con CalMatters antes del lanzamiento de su campaña hoy.
Kim es uno de los cuatro republicanos en el Congreso de California cuyos escaños el informe no partidista Cook Political Report ha identificado como competitivos.
 Si bien nunca ha ocupado un cargo público, Ramírez destaca sus décadas de defensa, asistencia legal y trabajo pro bono como prueba de que tiene el currículum de servicio público necesario para representar al Condado de Orange en el Congreso. Dijo que era obvio que representaría a Narciso Barranco, el paisajista del Condado de Orange cuyo arresto por parte del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE) en junio se hizo viral después de que varias organizaciones comunitarias y funcionarios electos lo recomendaran a su oficina.
“Soy un fan de los desvalidos, por así decirlo”, dijo Ramírez. “He trabajado muy duro para forjarme la reputación de que, cuando hay mucho en juego y los casos son realmente difíciles, soy la persona a la que recurren”.
 Ramírez se suma a un amplio campo demócrata, que incluye a la ex miembro de la junta del Distrito Escolar Unificado de Chino Valley Christina Gagnier, la comerciante de arte autofinanciada Esther Kim Varet y el más reciente rival de Kim, Joe Kerr, quien perdió el escaño por más de 10 puntos porcentuales el año pasado.
Kim ha demostrado ser una formidable rival para los contendientes demócratas desde que el Distrito 40 de California pasó de ser un bastión liberal a un escaño republicano tras el censo de 2020. Con casi 4 millones de dólares en efectivo, su eventual oponente enfrentará una batalla cuesta arriba. Y eso antes del plan de redistribución de distritos del gobernador Gavin Newsom, que, de ser aprobado por los votantes en unas elecciones especiales el 4 de noviembre, convertiría el Distrito 40 en un escaño aún más republicano.
 Pero Ramírez dice que planea postularse sin importar lo que los votantes decidan en los mapas.
 “Mi compromiso es cambiar el escaño y contribuir a que la Cámara cambie su resultado”, dijo. “Estoy aquí para ganar esta campaña, y la ganaremos sin importar las fronteras geográficas”.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/052418-Young-Kim-AP-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-20 16:56:52.851165

This story by Matthew Thomas was first published in The Montpelier Bridge on Aug. 19, 2025.
At a time when Montpelier is overwhelmed by increasing numbers of people experiencing homelessness — and President Donald Trump has decreed that homeless people be removed from public spaces — the Montpelier City Council discussed amendments to the city’s public camping policy at Wednesday’s city council meeting. 
The amended policy proposed by the City Manager’s Office passed along with two amendments during the meeting: one, proposed by Councilor Pelin Kohn, stipulated that the policy be reviewed again in six months; the other, by Councilor Cary Brown, removed the language from the city manager’s amendment designating all city parks as “High-Sensitivity Areas,” passing with help from the mayor’s tie-breaking vote.
“The city’s approach to camping in the city has not changed, and we’re not suggesting it would at this time,” said Acting City Manager Kelly Murphy. Murphy added that while the city does not allow public camping, it is also not looking to roust those who camp who aren’t causing a disturbance. So long as they are not doing so in “High-Sensitivity Areas,” a hot topic during discussion of proposed amendments to the city’s encampment policy.

Among the particulars of the amended policy are removing the Montpelier Police Department from tasks such as triaging the city’s response to moving an encampment. The Fire, EMS and Parks departments will now be part of the group notified by the City Manager’s Office of an encampment. The city manager will now coordinate the response, relieving the beleaguered police department from such responsibility. 
Murphy said that her proposed amendments were not intended to be transformative. Rather, she said, they sought to bring the policy in line with de-facto city practice and also to account for current staff capacity. For example, Murphy cited the current practice of storing items cleared out of unattended encampments for 90 days; her office proposed the time limit be amended to 30 days so as to line up with the city’s actual storage capacity. 
Councilor Adrienne Gil said she’s not interested in talking about changes until the city’s partners have also reviewed current policy and had a chance to offer input. “We need guidance in enforcement,” Murphy said in response. To which Gil replied, “We need an emergency meeting with our partners to go through this policy to have an understanding about what we want in our community. … Just having one side of the story, updating a policy, is not sufficient.” 
Councilor Cary Brown agreed with Gil. “If we’re going to review this policy, it does need to be with everyone involved,” she said. “I think it’s a good idea to pull this policy out, to dust it off, take a look at it, because we went through a lot to put it in place.”
Brown did take issue with one of the proposals, which she deemed an “extremely substantive change,” a line in the notification letter affixed to the policy, which was amended to designate all city parks as “high-sensitivity areas,” and, therefore, subjecting any encampments within them to removal. According to Brown, this change negates the spirit and meaning of the entire original policy. 
Contained in Murphy’s response was the paradox that has flummoxed the city for years and would return throughout the meeting: If public spaces are increasingly off limits to camping, where are unhoused people supposed to go?
Councilor Sal Alfano said the policy has “many inconsistencies” and suggested the whole thing be scrapped and the city start over. As an example, he noted where the policy states that shelter will be offered when moving campers out of prohibited areas. The problem is that the city has no shelter space to offer. 
Members of the public weighed in as well. 
Richard Sheir, of Montpelier, suggested that matters related to the parks fall under the jurisdiction of the elected Parks Commission, and perhaps not the city council. 
Montpelier resident David Kitchen spoke about the encampments by the river near where he lives, and said he has instructed his son to no longer ride his bicycle on the bike path near the transit station but instead ride in traffic, as it’s “safer,” according to Kitchen. 
“I rode through there the other day,” Kitchen said, “and two individuals blocked the path and they could tell I wasn’t going to stop. They split. One guy gives me the ‘finger gun,’ pulling his trigger. The other guy mentions something about ‘destruction,’ that he’s going to ‘destroy’ me.” 
Montpelier residents Stan Brinkerhoff and TJ Poor both said that they do not allow their children to use the bike path by themselves. Poor said his daughter is afraid of using the bike path, and when she is downtown often crosses the street many times to avoid confrontation. 
Bonnie Robertson, a 30-year resident of Montpelier, described her experience of using the bike path, citing broken glass on the ground, litter down by the river, fighting, and “half-naked” people relieving themselves by the river, among other examples of disorder. While noting that she does not want to see people moved, Robertson said “I would like to see the law being enforced,” a sentiment that was echoed throughout the meeting. 
“I don’t have a solution for homelessness,” Robertson said. “But I don’t see why we can’t enforce the laws that are already on the books.” 
Multiple residents, while expressing empathy for the unhoused, also registered their discontent with what they characterized as lawlessness by some members of the city’s homeless encampments, prohibiting use of public spaces by the larger public. Poor said the problem is bigger than Montpelier and should be tackled by the state. 
“The empathy and compassion that was well intentioned with the policy has really enabled entitlement,” Poor said. “Entitlement that these public places belong only to a small portion of those who are unhoused, really, and not to the rest of the community. We’re making a choice without policy. We’ve devoted our priority. We’ve done it away from our children, done it away from the economic vitality of the community, and that really needs to change. Our town is unwelcoming now.”

The federal agency argues that it has complied with court orders in the case by reversing a decision in April to alter the students’ status within the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System — a move that could have paved the way for deportation.
By reversing course, the agency’s lawyers argue, Homeland Security has rendered the lawsuit moot. The plaintiffs, they argue in their motion to dismiss the case, “have obtained the relief they originally sought. There is nothing more for the court to do.”
In their motion, lawyers for Homeland Security acknowledge the judge in the case, when responding to a different motion, had previously ruled that “actions compelled by court order are not actions that moot a case.”
Attorneys for the students have yet to respond to the motion to dismiss. The students’ attorney, Katherine Melloy Goettel, declined to comment on the matter. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Aug. 27.
Judge has rejected prior requests from DHS 
In April 2025, the three UI international students and one international-student graduate sued DHS for wrongful termination of their student status, which they alleged caused irreparable stress and anxiety due to fear of imminent seizure and deportation.
On May 15, 2025, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction requiring DHS to maintain the plaintiffs’ status as students in its Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records. The judge also ordered DHS to add to the records a notation of active student status that would be backdated to the date the agency had terminated that status — ensuring that other entities wouldn’t act on the termination and attempt to deport the students on that basis.
On June 12, 2025, DHS filed a motion seeking to revise the injunction. The department argued that due to technological limitations with SEVIS records, the system did not allow the creation of written notations that would be visible to other users of the system, such as schools and employers, outside of DHS.
DHS asked that the court issue a ruling indicating it had fulfilled the requirements of the injunction, while also arguing the injunction was overbroad and amounted to a prohibition against any sort of prosecution for crimes the students might commit.
Noting that DHS had made no assertions as to what, if any, efforts had been made to remedy the claimed technological limitations within SEVIS, U.S. District Court Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger denied DHS’ motion to revise her order.
With regard to DHS’ claim that the injunction bars future criminal prosecutions, Ebinger noted that her order does not apply to state, county, or local law enforcement acting separately from DHS and not at DHS’ instruction.
Also, she ruled, the injunction “prevents neither arrests nor the commencement of prosecutions. Rather, as to the plaintiffs — four individual people whom the court previously found to be likely to succeed on their claims of unfounded and harmful status record interference — the court’s order requires advance notice to the court as part of defendants’ due process efforts. The order does not prohibit law enforcement actions.”
DHS officials describe Student Criminal Alien Initiative
As part of their recent request for a dismissal of the lawsuit, attorneys for Homeland Security provided the court with a sworn statement from Akil Baldwin, the acting assistant director of the National Security Division of Homeland Security Investigations within the department.
In his statement, Baldwin said he oversees the Student Exchange Visitor Program “in support of ICE efforts to identify, disrupt and dismantle transnational criminal enterprises and terrorist organizations.” He said the four UI students’ criminal histories — which, according to the students’ attorney, are limited to misdemeanor-level offenses such as drunken driving — led to the revocation of their student visas.
The process, he said in his statement, began when Homeland Security Investigations, or HSI, launched what he called the Student Criminal Alien Initiative.
As part of that initiative, he said, HSI obtained access to the federal criminal database maintained by the National Crime Information Center to determine “whether any nonimmigrant students had criminal records.”
HSI then sent its findings to the U.S. Department of State “to take action as it deemed appropriate,” Baldwin said. The Department of State then revoked “some nonimmigrant student visas with an NCIC record,” Baldwin stated.
Then, at the Department of State’s request, HSI terminated the SERVIS records of those students who now had no valid student visa. In April, amid a flurry of litigation related to its actions, Homeland Security reversed course and began restoring the students’ SEVIS records to “active” status.
During a District of Columbia court hearing in April, Homeland Security’s assistant director for national security, Andre Watson, discussed the agency’s Student Criminal Alien Initiative.
Watson testified as to how 10 to 20 ICE employees spent several weeks combing through the records of 1.3 million holders of student visas to determine whether any of them might have had some form of interaction with law enforcement, such as a traffic violation that was later dismissed.
An exasperated D.C. District Court Judge Ana C. Reyes asked Watson, “Are you telling me that with all of the cost cutting that we have going on right now — because apparently we’re spending too much money in the federal government doing things like, oh, I don’t know, funding cancer research, can’t afford to do that — that we had, not ‘we,’ but ‘someone,’ had 10 to 20 federal employees spend their time going name by name in a database to see what hits they got for 1.3 million people? Is that what happened? Yes or no.”
“Yes,” Watson replied. He explained that of the 1.3 million student names, less than half of 1%, or roughly 6,400 student names, were passed on to the State Department. The State Department then revoked visas to travel into the United States for 3,000 of those students, and then told Homeland Security to terminate those students’ status in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System.
After hearing from Watson, Judge Reyes cited what she called the federal government’s “utter lack of concern for human individuals who we have invited into our country and who have (made) communities richer by being students who have contributed to our colleges and who have paid our colleges.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-08-20 20:35:03+00:00,Mississippi Today,"As Jackson State University president search looms, politics may make the position more difficult",Candice Wilder,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/20/jackson-state-university-president-search-looms/,The next leader of JSU will face pressure from constituent groups and state legislators under a changing higher education landscape.,"The presidency at Jackson State University has had its fair share of tumultuous transitions. 
Students, faculty and alumni were left in disbelief when Mississippi’s higher education board announced Marcus Thompson’s resignation in May, just five days after graduation and two years into his term. 
He was the third president to suddenly depart at the state’s largest historically Black university in less than seven years. His predecessor, Thomas Hudson left after two years. Before that, William Bynum resigned after three years, following his arrest in a prostitution sting at a Clinton hotel. The typical college president has been in their current job for 5.9 years.
Yet, in all three cases, the JSU presidents left without formal explanation from the Institutions of Higher Learning board. 
During summer break, alumni have taken up the torch, leading email campaigns to voice their frustrations to board members, state lawmakers and elected officials about the university’s chronic leadership turnover. 
The effort forced the college board to confront lingering questions about its past choices of university presidents and, more importantly, scrutinize how it plans  to make the right decision this time. 
Still, the board only pulled back some of the curtain to reveal insights into its executive search process. It has remained mum about most of the plans for seeking the university’s next president. 
In any other era, a search committee and timeline would have been publicly announced by now. But, the pressure to hire a permanent leader has grown increasingly complex, polarized and secretive in a contentious higher education climate. 
“Discussions on the process have begun, but it’s important to make sure this process is efficient, thorough and timely,” John Sewell, a spokesperson for the board, said in a statement to Mississippi Today. 
The board says it wants to ensure Denise Jones-Gregory, the university’s current interim president, who was appointed immediately after Thompson’s departure, has the opportunity to settle into the role. 
But, repeated criticism about the board’s history of elevating internal hires and appointing interim leaders among Mississippi’s eight universities has left advocates increasingly wary that the IHL board will continue to ignore its own procedures to provide a fair and transparent search for Jackson State.  
Mississippi Today asked the board if Gregory had expressed interest in the role, the board said it was a “personnel matter” and members “have no comment on it.”

Jackson State’s next leader will enter the post amid sweeping federal research funding cuts, uncertainty about federal student loan programs and college support services like Upward Bound, TRiO and GEAR UP, and the Trump administration’s crusade against diversity, equity and inclusion policies. 
The university is also experiencing its own set of challenges: student housing shortages, financial constraints, fluctuating enrollment, low morale from faculty and staff, almost a decade worth of mistrust from alumni, community members and supporters. 
And there are the perennial questions of how to deal with the many and sometimes conflicting constituencies including the governor, state legislators, political activists and college governing board members.  
“This is certainly not a job for the weak,” said Mark Dawson, who chairs Thee 1877 Project, a renegade group of alums who aren’t affiliated with the university’s national alumni association. 
Through self-described “guerilla” methods, the group created a qualitative questionnaire for its roughly 3,000 email subscribers this month inquiring about leadership traits alums are looking for in the  university’s next president. 
They collected more than 370 survey responses, with specific qualities emphasized as being important, like “strong appreciation for HBCU culture, history and legacy,” “financial accountability and budget management” and “unwavering integrity and ethics.”
“Overwhelmingly, people were telling us in our survey that character counts,” Dawson said. 
The group’s data mimics national findings: A 2024 report by Academic Search, an executive headhunting firm, found that top education executives commonly listed attributes like trustworthiness and resilience as relevant traits for their presidencies. 
Among the 700 college presidents surveyed, more than 90% listed those qualities as “very relevant” to the job, with “behaves in a way that is trustworthy, consistent and accountable” cited the most frequently at 96%. Listening to and understanding stakeholder concerns was also highly cited. 
The alumni group said it will share its survey results with IHL board members at a meeting Thursday. With these efforts, they aim to send a clear message: If you’re going to be responsible for selecting  presidents, make sure you listen to all voices. 
“What we heard from IHL last month is that they believe their processes work and that to me sounds like they’re unwilling to change,” said Sharolyn Love, a member of Thee 1877 Project. “We really want to be in collaboration with IHL to get this right. These results let them know that we are also holding them accountable and we want someone living, breathing and walking these values.” 
‘It’s an eight-day-a-week job’ 
The role of a university president has shifted in recent decades to focus on external relations, while the provost handles many internal issues, said Judith Wilde, a George Mason University professor who studies college presidential searches. 
Most can agree being chief of a university has become increasingly harder. For HBCU leaders under Trump, that means a delicate dance of advancing legislative goals and bracing for change while addressing student fears. 
“I quote The Beatles and say, ‘it’s an eight-day-a-week job’’ ” Wilde said. “One of the most important qualifications that boards seem to look for now in a university president is their ability to raise money and that requires a lot of time meeting with tons of stakeholders at local, regional and statewide (levels).” 
Public universities rely on private donations due to decreasing state appropriations. Just this year, the Mississippi Legislature decreased support for public universities by 4.2% from last year, with an appropriation of $838.4 million to all eight institutions for the 2026 fiscal year.

Even IHL commissioner Al Rankins stated during June’s IHL board meeting that the role of college president has become tougher and many universities “fight above their weight” to keep faculty and staff on campus. 
For years, Mississippi’s institutions have all agreed that faculty and staff are underpaid. The average salary of a professor at one of the state’s universities is $87,865 according to data compiled by The Chronicle of Higher Education. But despite several years of state-funded pay raises, Mississippi’s faculty and staff continue to make far less than those in other Southern states.
“We’re at a time in higher education where we’ve seen more change and more flux than I’ve seen over my entire career,” said Rankins, who previously served as president of Alcorn State University. “We can’t continue to go backwards. If we do, it will be very hard for these individuals to provide the quality education and experience that they provide for our students.” 
Jackson State and  Mississippi’s other HBCUs have experienced historic underfunding compared to their predominantly white counterparts like Mississippi State University and the University of Mississippi, which have deep pockets and big stadiums largely due to private support. 
Constant leadership turnover can also disrupt private donor alumni relationships, as well as research funding. While many grants remain in limbo because of the federal administration, other unfriendly policies around international students at tuition-driven institutions could pose a problem. 
But Wilde said the  job will still attract qualified candidates, appealing to those interested in generous salaries and benefits and mansion-like residences on campus. Currently, Jackson State University presidents make $450,000 annually. 
“It’s not a crass way to think about it,” Wilde said. “Of course, there are problems with these jobs and it may attract individuals who don’t have any higher education experience.” 
Amid the many challenges, turnover at the president level is a growing problem. The years of experience of those in the job has been declining steadily for nearly two decades, and 55% of surveyed presidents say they plan to step down in the next five years, according to the American Council on Education’s 2023 college president report. 
Wilde also said it is not unusual for college boards to choose insiders rather than taking a chance on newcomers. Facing political and financial pressures, university boards appear to have grown more allergic to risk. 
In many cases, the IHL board can give itself two options when it searches for a new university president, according to its policy: an extended search with a consultant, or an expedited process in which trustees interview candidates that are “known to the board.” The board has latitude to flip-flop between the two types of searches. 
In 2023, the board spent $115,000 on Academic Search, an executive head hunting firm for Jackson State’s president search, after Hudson resigned. 
The board appointed Elayne Hayes-Anthony, chair of the journalism department, as temporary acting president. When Anthony expressed interest in the role, the board opted not to pick her for the permanent position. It followed its protocol, announcing a search committee, building a search timeline, and scheduling community listening sessions and a survey. 
But then the board went with an internal hire, yet again, and chose Thompson, who was the board’s communications chief and had no experience leading a university. While plans for the current search remain unclear, Wilde said the choices for fairness and transparency are up to those in charge of the process. 
“Search firms promote secrecy,” Wilde said. “What you’re really looking for is someone who has been president before and is maybe ready to do it again.” 
‘A gemstone that needs to be reset’ 


This week kicked off fall semester classes at Jackson State. One student,  Rayvn Webster, said she hopes her next president will prioritize needs around mental health and burnout. 
“So many of us are coming from out of state, and witnessing that instability of president changes since I’ve been here has made our school have a rocky foundation,” Webster, a junior from Memphis, Tennessee, studying industrial technology with a concentration in electrical systems. “We want to think of this place as our home away from home and not a place we can’t trust or feel free.” 
Angel Edwards, a sophomore studying political science, said she does not fault any president for leaving abruptly. 
She had admired Thompson for his engagement with students, which she saw as his biggest strength. He bridged JSU alums and new generations of future alums. 


“I think he understood that this school was our path to a better career, life and opportunity for many of us and our families, and the bonds we built here were sacred,” Edwards said. “But, it was also a lot of kids and a lot of responsibility. So, I get it.” 
From the outside, the job of Jackson State president may not seem appealing. 
The role requires overseeing nearly 6,000 students, four satellite campuses, a $250 million operating budget and millions of dollars in federal research funding. The next leader will also walk a tightrope, needing to please a mainly white board and advocate for the school. 
“Jackson State University is a gemstone that just needs to be polished and reset,” Dawson said. “We have a rich legacy and history and whoever takes the helm needs to understand where we are coming from, where we’re going and what we hope to achieve in the future.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20114243/MT-JSU-President-Survey-FeatImage-01.jpg,,,2025-08-20 16:56:52.851165

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Four Republicans and one Democrat have filed paperwork indicating they are running for lieutenant governor.
Republican Lt. Gov. Matt Pinnell is serving his second term and can’t seek reelection to the post.
Republicans seeking the post are State Auditor and Inspector Cindy Byrd, state Sen. Darrell Weaver, state Rep. J.J. Humphrey and political newcomer Victor Flores.
Kelly Forbes of Oklahoma City is the sole Democrat thus far to file paperwork with the Oklahoma Ethics Commission indicating an intention to run.
Byrd, 52, of Coalgate, wants to focus on promoting tourism and the music industry.
She said the lieutenant governor sits on a lot of boards and commissions that drive economic development involving millions of dollars. Her skill set makes her ready to start on the first day, she said.
About 80% of every tax dollar is spent on education and health care, but the state ranks at the bottom in outcomes, she said. She wants to do a deep dive into the reasons and assist the next governor on making improvements, she said.
Weaver, 63, of Moore, is the former head of the Oklahoma State Bureau of Dangerous Drugs Control, an agency in which held various positions.
He and his wife operate Weaver clinics, which provide medical care.
Weaver said his relationships in the Capitol and law enforcement and business background make him a good fit for the office.
He said his background as a pilot has taught him about all of the opportunities the state has in the aerospace industry.
Flores, 47, of Edmond is a small business owner and a partner with a national accounting firm.
He would like to improve the relationships between the tribes, state agencies and the executive branch.
Flores said he wants to focus on making sure economic development is happening statewide, especially in rural areas.
Humphrey, 59, of Lane, is a rancher and retired probation and parole officer.
He said the Oklahoma House leadership has shut down his efforts to expose problems at the Oklahoma Department of Corrections and Oklahoma Department of Human Services.
“I hope to use the lieutenant governor’s position to make the state aware of these things and expose corruption,” he said.
He also wants to improve the state’s educational system and broadband access in rural Oklahoma so businesses can grow.
Forbes could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
The filing period is April 1-3 at the state Capitol for federal, state, legislative and judicial offices.
The primary election is June 16, followed by a Aug. 25, 2026, runoff. 
The general election is Nov. 3, 2026.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s court system declared a judicial emergency Wednesday in response to an ongoing outage of state websites, data portals and communication systems.
Since Tuesday, people in and outside the judicial system have been unable to get court records or court dates, file documents like protection orders, trial motions, civil lawsuits or small claims cases. Public access points like ecourts.sd.us remain inaccessible, and court system employees can’t access records through their own non-public information portals.
The court system is also unable to take electronic payments of fines, though a press release from the Unified Judicial System said clerks can take payments in person.
The judicial emergency suspends “all deadlines, time schedules, due dates and filing requirements imposed by applicable statutes, rules and court orders” until ordered by the court.
Power outages across South Dakota government stymie services statewide

The emergency declaration is part of the fallout from a power outage in the state’s data center, which is the term used by the Bureau of Information Technology to describe the hardware scattered across the state and connected through the state’s network.
Driver’s license exam stations and self-service kiosks remained inaccessible Wednesday, as did vehicle registration and vehicle licensing, birth and death records and the state’s voter registration database.
Law enforcement has been affected, as well. Faulk County Sheriff Kurt Hall said his dispatch was unable to run license plate and warrant checks for deputies doing traffic stops for most of Tuesday.
“We couldn’t run plates yesterday, but we can today,” said Hall, whose office polices a county of 2,100 and runs a 32-bed jail.
Law enforcement has been affected, as well. Faulk County Sheriff Kurt Hall said his dispatch was unable to run license plate and warrant checks for deputies doing traffic stops for most of Tuesday.
Minnehaha County Sheriff Mike Milstead, who oversees the deputies patrolling South Dakota’s most populous county and one of its largest jails, said state system services have been spotty at best and mostly inaccessible. Metro Communications, which dispatches for both the county and the Sioux Falls Police Department, has been able to communicate with law enforcement, even as some state resources have been unavailable.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)“We couldn’t run plates yesterday, but we can today,” said Hall, whose office polices a county of 2,100 and runs a 32-bed jail.
Milstead’s office has relied on its local warrants database for information, but adding warrants to the system has been cumbersome with the state court system down. Deputies have had to hand-deliver court information for warrants, he said, and for orders to release jail inmates from custody.
“This is certainly demonstrating how dependent we are on the state network,” Milstead said, adding that he can’t recall an outage that’s lasted as long as this one in the years since his office has been using it.
Attorney General Marty Jackley, who oversees the state Division of Criminal Investigation, said Wednesday that his office has also been impacted, as the consumer protection division is unable to process complaints. 
Jackley’s office also oversees the State Automated Victim Notification System, through which victims or the public can sign up for alerts about court dates, incarceration status or release dates for people accused or convicted of crimes. That SAVIN system wasn’t sending out alerts as of Wednesday. 
Milstead said “we still have processes in place” to notify victims using the information held on local servers without SAVIN. 
“That’s kind of a check and balance, not in every case, but in most cases,” Milstead said. “I would call it more of a workaround, but the jail still does victim notification if we have a victim on file.”
The Bureau of Information Technology’s spokesperson, Lisa Rahja, said in an email that the state is continuing its work to mitigate the power outage that “affected all state hosted services and some network communications.”
She wrote that the state engineer’s office has investigated the “root cause” of the outage, and that “recovery efforts are a top priority.” 
The power outage wasn’t caused by a cybersecurity breach, she wrote.

The panel, hosted by Byrum & Fisk Advocacy Communications partner Dianne Byrum, a former Democratic lawmaker, featured members of the Economic Alliance of Michigan, the Michigan Education Association and the Small Business Association of Michigan, alongside perspective from small business CEO Carrin Harris. 
Bret Jackson, Economic Alliance of Michigan president and CEO, told attendees that health care costs for his employees had increased 41% over the past three years. As a result of these increasing costs, Jackson said he was not able to offer his employees an increase in wages this year, and with an expected rate increase of 11% for next year, Jackson said he was doubtful he’d be able to increase wages next year. 
According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, health care premiums for a family of four cost $5,791 in 1999, whereas in 2024, worker contributions alone had risen to $6,296. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Jackson also noted that the costs of health insurance have outpaced what a family of four will pay in state and federal taxes combined. 
When looking to address this issue, Jackson noted two thirds of Michigan hospitals have double digit operating profit margins. While some rural hospitals are struggling to stay afloat, those double digit operating profits showcase where the money is going, Jackson said.

Jackson also pointed to data from the Michigan Health Purchasers Coalition showcasing differing costs of procedures between hospitals. 
For childbirth, vaginal delivery of a baby carried a median cost of $5,810 at Trinity Health Oakland, the least expensive facility in Metro Detroit, compared to $14,671 at the Detroit Medical Center’s Harper Hutzel hospital. 
 For cesarean births, Trinity Health in Oakland was again the least expensive facility, with the median cost of care coming in at $7,590 compared to $14,712 at the Detroit Medical Center’s Receiving Hospital. 
“Again, same patient, right? Could be. Different facility, substantially different cost. Bottom line is health care costs are going up at an incredibly unsustainable rate, and it’s impacting employers’ ability to pay their employees more, to hire more workers, to invest in their companies,” Jackson said.  
These rising costs also carry a higher impact on women who overwhelmingly make the health care decisions for their families, Jackson said. 
“Not only are they making health care decisions based on what information they know, they’re also seeing the bills as they come in, and perhaps not focusing on themselves, because they see how much it costs to take care of their families, and they want to make sure that their families are being taken care of,” Jackson said. 
Kelli Saunders, the vice president for policy and engagement at the Small Business Association of Michigan said that for the past 10 years small business owners have had to grin and bear increasing health care costs, though the strains of recent years have raised questions on whether they can continue to offer these benefits. 
In a survey of 300 small business association members earlier this year, 76% said the cost of health care was impacting their ability to hire employees while 51% said they had to reduce or eliminate benefits due to costs. 
“This is a red flag moment where our small business owners – who make up over half of the jobs in our state – are saying, ‘I don’t know what to do, and it’s either shut my doors or reduce benefits.’ And that’s not the right answer, so let’s get around the table and try and solve it,” Saunders said.

School districts face a dilemma
Chandra Madafferi, president and CEO of the Michigan Education Association shared how rising health care costs had placed a similar strain on budgets for schools, stretching beyond personnel like teachers and school counselors. 
In Michigan, the cost of health care seems to have exploded in recent years, placing it out of reach for many, Madafferi said. 
While some educators have received great raises in recent years, those earnings have largely been wiped out by the increased cost of health care, Madafferi said.
It has also raised questions among young educators on whether they will be able to afford to have more than one child, she said.
When looking at the cost of education, one question that gets asked is how a district can provide an excellent workforce, Madafferi said. 
“We have got to still attract the best and the brightest, and that means providing a competitive salary,” Madafferi explained.

However, increased health care costs have impacted districts’abilities to offer competitive salaries and benefits, Madafferi said, pointing to hospital consolidation as another piece of the problem. 
According to a report published by global policy thinktank RAND, hospital consolidation is tied to an increase in price, with quality of care either remaining the same, or worsening. 
A report from the Detroit Free Press in 2023 ahead of the Henry Ford and Ascension Michigan merger noted the effort would place 59% of Michigan hospitals under three health systems.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/unnamed-10.png,,,2025-08-20 16:56:52.851165

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski launched her bid for lieutenant governor on Wednesday — passing on running for governor and becoming the first to enter the field for the position.   
At the Madison Labor Temple, Godlewski was joined by her 5-year-old son, Hartley, who from the podium shyly told people to vote for his mom, and her parents, who she said gave her advice that has led to her decision to run. 
“When you see something wrong, you’ve got to stand up and you’ve got to do something is what has guided me my entire life,” Godlewski said. “Whether it is my career where I started in national security to working in local government to supporting small businesses to eventually running the constitutional amendment to save our state treasurer’s office and now serving statewide, to me, this has always come down to one thing, which is how I can make the biggest difference in Wisconsin.”
Godlewski has served in her current office since March 2023. She was appointed by Gov. Tony Evers to fill a vacancy left when former-Secretary of State Doug La Follette, who had served in the position since 1983, abruptly stepped down less than three months into his term. The position in Wisconsin has been diminished over the years, in part because Republican lawmakers took away its responsibilities and in part because the office lacked resources, though Godlewski has worked to modernize its operations.
Godlewski previously served as state Treasurer from 2019 to 2022, running for the office just a couple of months after leading a successful campaign to urge voters to reject a Republican ballot measure that would have eliminated the position from the state constitution. 
When she won the election for Treasurer in 2018, she flipped nine counties in Wisconsin that voted for Trump in 2016 — something that she noted Wednesday in making the case for her candidacy. She didn’t run for reelection in 2022 because she ran in the Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate that year, withdrawing before the August primary election. 
If elected, the lieutenant governor’s office would be her third statewide position in Wisconsin. Godlewski said her sisters jokingly asked whether she was going for a record when she told them about her campaign. 
“All kidding aside, I’m not running for this office because I need another title,” Godlewski said. “I’m running for this office because I want to be a part of the team that’s not only going to win but is actually going to deliver for the state of Wisconsin.”
Former Democratic Lt. Gov. Barbara Lawton, the first female to hold the office in Wisconsin, and several Democratic state legislators were also at the announcement. Godlewski said she has endorsements from Lawton and 27 of state lawmakers — about 54% of the Democrats in the state Legislature.

Rep. Jodi Emerson (D-Eau Claire) called Godlewski “Eau Claire’s favorite daughter,” saying she “knows how to build coalitions and bring people together across communities and even across partisan divides.” 
“When she sees a problem, she rolls up her sleeves and she digs in and she talks to people who need to get it fixed, from saving the treasurer’s office to revitalizing the treasurer’s office and the Secretary Secretary of State’s office to managing a $1.4 billion dollar trust fund to invest in our communities,” Emerson said — a reference to the Board of Commissioners of Public Lands, which Godlewski has served on both as state treasurer and secretary of state. 
Godlewski has said she has heard from people across the state who are struggling financially to afford their homes, health care and other expenses. 
“They’re fed up that workers who are critical to our community, like EMT workers and nurses and teachers, can’t even afford a home in the communities that they serve, while they’re watching these billionaires get tax write-offs for their second and third vacation home,” Godlewski said. “They’re fed up that corporations are cashing in on some of the largest tax breaks in our history, and families are getting the scraps.”  
She said she wants to help find solutions for those issues, but can’t work on them as secretary of state. 
Godlewski criticized Republicans and said Wisconsinites deserve better leadership. 
“In Madison this year alone, we’ve seen how Republicans have had an opportunity to expand Medicaid to 90,000 more Wisconsinites. They said no. Republicans had an opportunity to expand postpartum care for new moms. They said no. The Republicans had an opportunity to invest in our kids’ future by supporting and funding public schools. They said, no. But when it comes to giving tax write-offs for corporations and perks to the well-connected, they said yes, yes, yes,” Godlewski said. “This isn’t leadership. It’s betrayal.”
Godlewski told reporters that she decided to run for the number two position over running for governor because she thinks it will be the right fit for her. 
“We’ve got some major challenges we’ve got to solve in Wisconsin, whether it’s affordable health care to families being priced out of their communities, and I want to be a part of the team that’s going to help solve these problems for Wisconsin,” Godlewski said.
In Wisconsin, voters cast votes separately for governor and lieutenant governor during the partisan primary. After the primary, the winners run on the same ticket in November and voters choose them as a pair. 
Wisconsin’s partisan primary is about a year away and the Democratic field for governor is still taking shape. Godlewski didn’t make any endorsements in the race Tuesday.  
“We have a really impressive bench in the Democratic party, and so I look forward to seeing who’s going to get in” and to working with whoever is the nominee, Godlewski said. 
Gov. Tony Evers’ decision not to seek a third term has made the race for governor the first open one in Wisconsin in 16 years and is leading to some other open seats as well, including lieutenant governor and now secretary of state. With Evers not on the ballot, the Wisconsin governor’s race has been rated a toss-up by Sabato’s Crystal Ball. 
Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez jumped into the race for governor less than 24 hours after Evers announced his retirement. Other Democrats considering a run for governor include Attorney General Josh Kaul, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, state Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) and state Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison).
Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann and Whitefish Bay manufacturer Bill Berrien are the two announced Republican candidates so far. U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany is also considering a run for the office. 
Godlewski told reporters Democrats need to listen to people if they’re going to win statewide in 2026.
“We’re seeing how folks don’t trust politicians, and it’s because they feel like they’re not hearing us. They’re watching a system that’s working for corporations and not for them, and so, how do we build trust? We’ve got to travel the state, meet them where they are, listen and that’s how we rebuild it,” Godlewski said. 
She added she recently met a mom in Kenosha, who “literally has two jobs just to support her family” and met another family in the northern parts of the state who “are still drinking bottled water because they have PFAS that are coming out of their faucet.” 
“These are real big issues, and that’s what I look forward to talking about — things that are keeping Wisconsinites up at night — and actually doing something about it,” Godlewski said.

(Photo by Ellen Schmidt/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota’s statewide minimum wage will increase 28 cents to $11.41 per hour on Jan. 1, a 2.5% increase based on the annual rate of inflation. 
The minimum wage applies to virtually all employees since the Democratic-controlled Legislature eliminated a lower minimum wage for small businesses, workers younger than 18 and workers on J-1 visas in 2024. (As before, tips cannot be counted toward the minimum wage.)
Only workers under 20 years old in their first 90 days of training may receive a lower wage of $9.31 per hour starting in 2026. 
Minneapolis and St. Paul each have higher minimum wages of $15.97 per hour, which will increase with inflation in 2026. Small and micro businesses in St. Paul may pay a lower minimum wage, but the city is phasing in a single minimum wage for all employees by 2028. 
Minnesota’s minimum wage is higher than most of its neighbors’ (save South Dakota), but it isn’t enough to cover basic living expenses. The cost of living for a childless, working-age adult requires earning $17.68 per hour, according to the state Department of Employment and Economic Development. A household with two children requires two parents earning at least $24.25 per hour. 
The federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour has remained unchanged since 2009 and is the effective minimum wage in 20 states, including Wisconsin. 
Minnesota’s minimum wage has been indexed to inflation since 2018 but was limited to annual adjustments of 2.5% until last year when lawmakers raised the threshold to 5% to ensure the lowest paid workers receive larger raises in periods of high inflation. 
The increase will directly affect a relatively small number of workers. Fewer than 90,000 salaried and hourly jobs out of more than 3.3 million in Minnesota were paid at or below the minimum wage in 2023, according to the state’s latest minimum wage report. Still, a rising minimum wage puts upward pressure on jobs paying just above minimum wage, creating a ripple effect across a larger number of workers.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Minnesota-Reformer-File-61-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-20 16:56:52.851165

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)State spending in Rhode Island has surged. Public tracking of how state agencies and programs are using that money has not.
And the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council (RIPEC) is sounding the alarm as part of a new analysis of the state’s fiscal 2026 budget published on Wednesday. The 49-page report by the business-backed research group reprises warnings of years past regarding unsustainable spending. This year’s report features a sterner admonishment than usual over lack of transparency in how state administrators craft the budget, or monitor the results from multibillion-dollar spending. 
“Despite a statutory requirement for agencies to include performance measures in their budget requests, the actual utilization of these measures in state budgeting decisions is unclear,” the report states. “While [the Office of Management and Budget]’s Performance Management Unit is tasked with maintaining and updating these measures, much of their work is internally facing and public reporting on program effectiveness has been minimal. This limited public data makes it challenging for the public to evaluate how effectively tax dollars are being utilized for programs administered by state departments and agencies.”
Derek Gomes, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Department of Administration, which includes the state office, said in an emailed response that the budget office has worked to bolster agency performance reporting, which now includes 244 separate measures aligned with Gov. Dan McKee’s long-term, RI 2030 state plan. Annual reports are published online, alongside quarterly updates, Gomes said. 
“The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is committed to providing timely and accurate information about its roles in terms of developing the Governor’s annual budget proposal and collecting performance metrics from state agencies,” Gomes said. “OMB regularly posts information on state websites to include up-to-date agency budget instructions, quarterly budget reports, and agency performance data.”
McKee’s office did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Wednesday. McKee let the spending plan take effect July 1 without his signature, an unprecedented move meant to symbolize his concerns with increased state taxes and fees.
Legislative leaders continued to defend state spending in a joint statement Wednesday.
“We have a responsibility as elected leaders to invest in health care, education and housing for Rhode Islanders, especially as Republicans in Congress cut federal support for Medicaid and other programs to states,” House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson said.
They are still reviewing RIPEC’s comments about public transparency, Larry Berman, a spokesperson for Shekarchi’s office, said via email.
The $14.3 billion fiscal 2026 budget features a record $5.81 billion in state general revenue, up 3.8% over the fiscal 2025 budget even though the total bottom line is less.
The state share of spending is 13.8% higher than fiscal 2019, even when accounting for inflation, according to RIPEC’s analysis. 
Meanwhile, the fiscal 2026 budget imposed new or higher taxes and fees on gasoline, property sales, high-value second homes, and health insurance, cementing the need for more open information sharing on how the extra funds are being spent, said Michael DiBiase, president and CEO of RIPEC.
“The tax burden has been going up, and people are paying for these things,” DiBiase said in an interview Wednesday. “It’s time to reflect on what we are getting for that money.”

A veiled process 
As a former state administration director under then-Gov. Gina Raimondo, DiBiase is more familiar than most with the behind-the-scenes components of the state budget process.
Each year, state agencies submit an initial funding request to state budget-crunchers. The memos span hundreds of pages, with details on how agencies spent the last year’s money, and justification on requests for more. The submissions are reviewed internally and used to shape the governor’s initial spending plan, typically released at the beginning of the calendar year. Lawmakers then update and revise the governor’s proposal to finalize a spending plan ahead of the July 1 start date.
Agency budget submissions are available by request, but not otherwise released publicly. And follow-up reporting is also kept behind closed doors.
“That’s a choice,” DiBiase said. “Politically, it’s more difficult to expose some of these things and talk about things that are working and not working.”
But difficult choices must be made, especially as state revenue growth slows and federal budget cuts curtail aid to key programs like Medicaid and food assistance.










The tax burden has been going up, and people are paying for these things. It’s time to reflect on what we are getting for that money.


– Michael DiBiase, president and CEO of the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council


Rhode Island House fiscal advisory staff projected a $304.3 million deficit for the next fiscal year, swelling to $462.1 million. The forecast does not include any impact from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which is expected to bring major changes to federal health and social services aid, as well as tax changes, over the next five years.
How Rhode Island will fare amid forthcoming federal budget cuts remains under review by RIPEC and separately by a set of governmental advisory groups mandated to study and prepare for possible funding changes, reporting back to the Rhode Island General Assembly by Oct. 31.
Among the biggest sources of concern for state lawmakers and budget analysts is how changes to federal Medicaid eligibility and funding will affect Rhode Island. The $4.9 billion in Medicaid funding included in Rhode Island’s fiscal 2026 budget (from both federal and state sources) is more than one-third of the bottom line. Medicaid funding has steadily risen over the last eight years even though Rhode Islanders participation in the government-subsidized health care program fell, according to RIPEC’s report. 
Medicaid costs keep rising
The $1.82 billion in state revenue directed toward Medicaid in fiscal 2026 is more than twice the 3.8% annual growth in state revenue. The spending includes extra money to increase reimbursement rates for primary care providers, nursing home workers, and hospitals in an attempt to lessen the gap between Rhode Island’s low rates and the higher rates in neighboring states. Yet DiBiase questioned if more money was actually solving the problem, noting that commercial insurers have also proposed double-digit rate increases for next year.
“It just doesn’t seem like the system is finding any relief,” DiBiase said. “We’re not really seeing, for the most part, where this money is going.”
RIPEC’s budget analysis also pointed to funding for K-12 education, despite fewer students, and on state employees (largely due to new bargaining agreements that include salary hikes and other benefits) as areas in need of more public financial reporting and reined-in spending.
The report largely centered on what’s wrong with state spending, and how to improve it. But RIPEC also offered praise to a pair of provisions tucked into the fiscal 2026 spending plan that will already make small strides in improving financial reporting. First, a change in the state Office of Internal Audit — in name and function — that expands the administrative power to subpoena and investigate potential fraud in state assistance programs, and recover misappropriated money. The fiscal 2026 budget offers $1.2 million extra money for two additional staffers to carry out the work of the rechristened Office of Internal Audit and Program Integrity.
The current year’s spending plan also provides a policy change to let the state Division of Taxation more effectively crack down on scofflaws with unpaid and overdue income and business taxes by putting levies on their assets. The access to out-of-state tax delinquents’ bank accounts, coupled with the ability to put levies on their assets, is expected to bring in an extra $5.3 million in revenue this year.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Nurses working at UnityPoint hospitals in Des Moines submitted a request Wednesday for voluntary recognition of a union, calling for the health care system to provide safer work space, better wages, and adequate staffing.
A group of UnityPoint nurses, supporters and Democratic candidates gathered near the entrance of the UnityPoint Health complex in Des Moines, calling for the hospital network to voluntarily recognize the union and begin negotiations as soon as possible. Alex Wilken, a critical care nurse, told the crowd he and two other nurses had returned from delivering a letter to UnityPoint executives requesting voluntary recognition through a card check agreement.
The proposed “United Nurses of Iowa” union would be comprised of nurses who work at Iowa Methodist Medical Center, Blank Children’s Hospital, Methodist West Hospital and Iowa Lutheran Hospital, four UnityPoint hospitals in the Des Moines metropolitan area. The union, which is organizing through Teamsters Local 90, would represent about 2,000 nurses at the bargaining table.

At the Wednesday event, several nurses said union representation was needed because UnityPoint leaders are not addressing their needs as workers. Nurses called for higher wages and benefits to be competitive with other states and retain their workforce, and for UnityPoint to hire more nurses to deal with staff shortages that could put patients in danger. Several also said UnityPoint is not meeting nurses’ safety needs as they face dangerous situations while working with patients and visitors.
Sammi Ladd, a critical care unit nurse at the Iowa Methodist Medical Center, said a union was needed because “we are quite literally fighting for our lives.”
She said she was assaulted by a critically ill patient in the hospital’s Intensive Care Unit two months ago that left her with bruises and has faced numerous instances of violence, including having remotes and lights thrown at her while she was 32 weeks pregnant. Another emergency room nurse, Ladd said, was recently stabbed by a patient. The nurse “did everything in her power to avoid harm, but because her concerns were either ignored or downplayed, she will have to carry that physical, mental and emotional trauma with her for the rest of her life.”
“UnityPoint is aware of these incidents, and instead of finding ways to keep us safe, we are being forced to work short-staffed, while simultaneously caring for sicker and sicker patients,” Ladd said. “Instead of hiring more nurses to help us, UnityPoint is paying $450 an hour to outside consultants that are trying to convince nurses to fight against these unions.”
UnityPoint CCU nurse Gail Grimes said as nurses have expressed their frustrations to UnityPoint and moved toward unionization, the health care company has hired outside consultants, like Crossroads Group Labor Relation and C Hunt Management Consulting, to work to persuade individual nurses to oppose a union. Leaders at UnityPoint have also held listening and dialogue sessions with nurses, Grimes said, which have not resulted in the changes workers say are needed.
“They come in and tell us things that they would like to improve, but they’re almost certainly never the things that we’re asking for,” Grimes said. “We’re asking to have metal detectors put in at the entrances instead, they’re like, ‘We bought you 150 new chairs.’ It’s kind of like, well, that’s not going to keep us in a weapon-free environment. So just a lot of our requests falling on deaf ears.”
While the letter was intended to be delivered to Scott Kizer, the CEO of UnityPoint, Wilken said Kizer was not present, and the letter was given to Jon Rozenfeld, market president of UnityPoint Health Des Moines. Wilken said Rozenfeld directly told them he would not recognize the union — meaning the nurses plan to file for an election.
UnityPoint did not respond to a request for comment.
Grimes said the union will be filing for an official vote with a National Labor Relations Board. Calling an election requires 30% of the employees in the bargaining group have to signed an interest card, which she said the nurses union has surpassed.
Several Democrats running for the U.S. Senate and House came to the event to show support for the union, including Iowa Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville and former Knoxville Chamber of Commerce director Nathan Sage, both running for Senate, as well as former Iowa House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst, who is running in Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District.
Konfrst said she believed union protections are necessary to keep nurses safe, saying Lorena Schulte, an Anamosa State Penitentiary nurse who was killed in 2021 by two inmates, “would still be alive today if she had had strong union protections when she was at Anamosa and she was caring for patients.”
“These people don’t deserve that,” Konfrst said. “They deserve better. Let me tell you this right now: This is what democracy looks like. Don’t wait for that to give it to you. Take it from them. That’s what it takes. They’re not going to voluntarily give up their money unless it’s to a union-busting firm.”
Wahls was endorsed by Teamsters Local 90, the union representing the UnityPoint nurses. On Monday, he was  endorsed by Ironworkers Local 89, a Cedar Rapids union.
Wahls, who is running for the seat currently held by U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, said supporting labor is a key component of his campaign. He said his track record as a state legislator shows his support for organized labor, and that if elected to serve in Washington, he would vote in support of the PRO (Protecting the Right to Organize) Act, a bill that would expand some workers’ rights to unionization and bargaining. Passing this bill would strengthen the ability of workers like the UnityPoint nurses to have their contracts approved faster and create penalties for employers that engage in illegal retaliatory practices related to organizing, he said.
“We know that we have a broken economy that’s working great for the people at the very top, but not for the rest of us,” Wahls said. “One of the best ways that you can level the playing field is by joining a union and being able to bargain collectively, prepare contract better wages, better workplace protections and better benefits. … It is so important that workers have democracy in the workplace the same way that we have democracy in our politics — that’s what this is all about.”
Sage also said he supports the PRO Act and would work to support workers and unions if elected to the Senate.
“I think at the end of the day, it’s working alongside labor unions to give them more negotiating powers,” Sage said. “… The PRO Act obviously needs to be passed to give labor unions the strength they need to be able to work for the workers that they represent.”

In July, Alachua School Board Vice Chair Tina Certain asked a public commenter, Jeremy Clepper, to leave the room after he caused what board members called a disruption. Before deputies could escort the man from the room, the district’s attorney advised against removing him. The board then went into recess.
During a Board of Education meeting Wednesday, public commenters, state board members, and the chair and vice chair of the Alachua County board took turns explaining their perspectives on a First Amendment concern that arose out of the county board meeting in late July. 
Certain, presiding at the time, maintained that all speakers had been granted time to speak and that she called for Clepper’s removal after he began shouting on his way back to his seat, and that he had disrupted the meeting earlier. 
“At all times, I upheld the board’s obligation to allow public input and to maintain order,” Certain said, adding that she hoped to clarify “significant mischaracterizations” of the events. 
“He was recognized, he spoke, and he was heard. He was allowed to use his full two minutes to express his personal views, many of which were sharply critical of the board members. … He was not silenced, he was not removed during or immediately after his comments,” Certain said. 
The state board voted to approve the recommendation Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas proposed: That there is probable cause that Alachua officials did not comply with parental freedom of speech protections and that board members should participate in free-speech training. 
Additionally, the state will monitor the board during the new school year “to ensure that there is not another violation of First Amendment rights for parents in that district.”
If the board finds violations, it will deny Alachua board members their paychecks. 
“This is the moment to restore trust in the Alachua County School Board, to reinforce the First Amendment and parents’ rights, promote transparency, and ensure that parents and students are not silenced when they speak up,” Kamoutsas said. 
In a letter Kamoutsas wrote to Alachua board Chair Sarah Rockwell on Aug. 1, he said “all members should be held accountable for creating an environment where citizens’ constitutional rights are under attack,” going on to say that he has found probable cause that state laws were violated during the meeting.

The comment
Clepper attended the Alachua meeting shortly after Rockwell came under criticism for a social media comment she made after pro wrestler and GOP figure Hulk Hogan died. 
“Oh did Hulk die? I didn’t even know. Good. One less MAGA in the world,” Rockwell commented online about the wrestler who spoke during the 2024 Republican National Convention. 
Since the Alachua meeting in question, board members underwent a public comment training session and Rockwell made public apologies for her remark, which she maintains is protected speech. 
“Chair Rockwell, I’m proud that you owned up to it and apologized for those comments,” state board member Daniel Foganholi said. “But I believe that this shouldn’t be about politics and, again, we get caught up in a situation talking about something that is not about our students. These are adult problems that we’re spending time on. Literacy is nonpartisan, student achievement is nonpartisan.” 
Earlier this summer, the board called the Hillsborough County superintendent to defend that district’s review of library books.
“If this would have happened to a left-leaning parent, we would have done the same thing, let me make that abundantly clear,” Kamoutsas said. 
During the state board meeting, public commenters filled the room in support of and in opposition to taking action against Alachua County, one of the few Democratic-majority counties in the state. 
Tim Marden, mayor of Newberry and chair of the Alachua Republican Party, spoke during the public comment period. 
“Y’all are completely over the target here, 100%,” Marden said. “This is just a symptom of greater disease that we have going on in the school board of Alachua County. The reason there’re not more conservatives in that room is because of the toxic environment that has been created in and outside of these meetings.”
The Florida Education Association slammed the state board’s action.
“The Governor’s playbook was in full display today when the school board discussed protecting parents’ rights, but in practice, are only concerned about the rights of those who agree with them,” the FEA said in a news release. “There’s no better example of that than the Florida Department of Education’s effort to ban books, censor learning, and dictate whose voices and stories are allowed in our schools.”

Trump called states ""merely an ‘agent’ for the federal government in counting and tabulating the votes,"" Hageman disagrees.
The post Gray, Wyoming Freedom Caucus back Trump plans to ban mail-in ballots, voting machines appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s chief elections officer is backing the Trump administration’s plans to restrict how voters are able to cast their ballots ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. 
In a lengthy Truth Social post on Monday morning, President Donald Trump announced he would “lead a movement” to stop states from using mail-in ballots and voting machines.
“Remember, the States are merely an ‘agent’ for the Federal Government in counting and tabulating the votes,” Trump wrote. “They must do what the Federal Government, as represented by the President of the United States, tells them, FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY, to do.”
Such an executive order is likely to face legal challenges — the U.S. Constitution vests the power to determine the “times, places, and manner” of elections with the states. That was the case with Trump’s earlier executive order that would have required documentary proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote. A federal court temporarily halted the order in April. 
Shortly after Trump’s announcement Monday, Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray said he was in “complete and total support” of the president’s plans. 
“The election integrity measures President Trump outlined are very important and are supported by the people,” Gray wrote in a press release, pointing to similar legislation Wyoming lawmakers voted to sponsor last week.

The Wyoming Freedom Caucus also expressed its support on Monday. 
“Here in Wyoming, we’ve already led the way in advancing President Trump’s agenda by requiring documentary proof of U.S. citizenship to vote, enhancing voter list maintenance statutes, and banning ranked choice voting,” the caucus wrote in a post on Facebook.  
The caucus said it “will prioritize” pen-and-paper ballots as the default in Wyoming but stopped short of spelling out its stance on mail-in ballots. 
Meanwhile, Gov. Mark Gordon “continues to believe that Wyoming has the most secure elections in the nation,” Michael Pearlman, spokesperson for Gordon, told WyoFile. 
“I appreciate the President’s concerns and recognize that our Constitution chooses a Republican form of government over a centralized one,” Gordon wrote in a statement. 
Both the primary and general elections in Wyoming were unanimously certified by the state canvassing board — a committee on which both Gray and Gordon sit. Ahead of last November’s election, almost 90% of Wyoming adults said they expected their county’s tally of ballots for president in the 2024 election to be very or somewhat reliable, according to a University of Wyoming survey. 
Local election officials also say voter fraud is exceedingly rare.

Lawmakers, however, have spent considerable time and resources in recent years aiming to revamp the state’s election system. Forty-five election-related bills were filed in the 2025 legislative session and one committee may choose to sponsor as many as 10 new bills modeled on failed 2025 bills in next year’s session. 
If Trump’s agenda is enacted — whether through an executive order or legislation at the state level — Wyoming’s elections could look dramatically different for some voters. 
Absentee voting, which accounts for both mail-in and early voting in Wyoming, is popular amongst Equality State residents. At least 45% of the state’s registered voters cast their ballots absentee in the most recent election.
Most states, including Wyoming, allow voters to request ballots that they can fill out at home and mail in or deliver via official dropboxes. Secretary Gray has been pushing to eliminate drop boxes in Wyoming, going so far as to say that state law does not currently allow for them. While county clerks have not taken a stance on banning ballot drop boxes, they have defended them as a longstanding, legal method for people to cast their ballots. Eight states and Washington, D.C., meanwhile, allow elections to be handled entirely by mail. Oregon, for example, credits its vote-by-mail system as increasing voter turnout and security.
As for voting machines, only Laramie County, the state’s most populous county, relies on them. More specifically, the county uses “express voting,” which has voters use a touchscreen to select their candidates. The machine then prints a ballot of their selections to be tabulated. But if they so wish, Laramie County voters may request a pen-and-paper ballot. 
Wyoming’s other 22 counties already use pen-and-paper ballots as the default. 
At the most recent Joint Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee, lawmakers debated the extent to which the federal government should play a role in Wyoming’s elections. 
Amid discussion on a bill to ban ballot drop boxes, Gray told the committee that such a policy “is a huge priority of the Trump administration.” 
Gray also said returning ballots via the postal service is “more secure and regulated” than ballot drop boxes. 
Soon thereafter, Jackson Democrat Rep. Mike Yin recalled Gray’s opposition to previous executive orders related to elections, including one during the Biden administration.  
“I think it was just two years ago we were talking about, ‘Why would we ever federalize our elections?’” Yin said. “So I do want to take issue with the, ‘Oh, this is the federal administration’s position, so this is my position, too.’”
“And I’m curious whether you think that our elections should be decided by Wyoming or should they be decided by D.C.?,” Yin said. 
Gray responded that he’d long opposed “the Biden-Obama-Harris attempt” to decrease rural post office services, which can deliver absentee ballots. When Yin interrupted to ask that “federal personalities” be kept out of the conversation, committee co-chairman Sen. Cale Cale, R-Lander, called a point of order. 
“We don’t need to drag in all the world’s politics into this discussion,” Case said. 
After last week’s meeting, Yin told WyoFile he’s “happy to get advice from the federal government if they want to find ways for us to have more people vote.”
“I think that can be a shared goal between the state and federal government,” Yin said. “But if the federal government is going to start dictating ways for us to prevent people from voting, I don’t think the federal government should be telling the state what to do.”
Several hours after Trump’s announcement, Wyoming U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman held a town hall in Casper. 
A constituent asked Hageman, a staunch ally of the president, about Trump’s forthcoming executive order. 
“So elections are run by the states,” Hageman said. “So I don’t know that President Trump is going to succeed at that.”

The U.S. Service has already corrected the violations that “needed to be immediately addressed,” according to the Department of Ecology. 
If leaking or damaged packages contain materials such as insecticides, propane, paints, or cleaning products, the facility is required to properly identify the substances, assess the related hazards, and then safely store and dispose of the waste.
The Postal Service has 30 days to pay the penalty or appeal to the state Pollution Control Hearings Board.
The penalty is due to several violations of dangerous waste laws that inspectors found at the facility in 2024. 
Those violations include failure to identify dangerous waste; failure to safely store dangerous waste; failure to properly manage waste like batteries and fluorescent bulbs; and failure to maintain personnel training records. 
The Department of Ecology noted that containers awaiting disposal were often unlabeled and stored in crowded areas. 
Inspections completed at the facility in 2018, 2019, 2022 and 2024 all found deficiencies in how the Seattle Bulk Mail Center was identifying and storing packages containing dangerous wastes, according to the Department of Ecology. 
Inspectors also reportedly found that hazardous wastes from regular operations and vehicle maintenance at the facility were also an issue. 
The U.S. Postal Service has corrected issues related to all four violations, such as changing how they store dangerous materials, safely disposing of their accumulated waste, and recording their weekly inspections, according to an Ecology spokesperson. 
There are other compliance issues, such as a training plan for employees that they are continuing to work on with Ecology, the spokesperson said. 
“We expect businesses that generate hazardous waste to take the regulations seriously,” said Christa Colouzis, Northwest Region manager for Ecology’s Hazardous Waste and Toxics Reduction program.

Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer.Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison sued the Trump administration for the 35th time this year, this time alleging that the federal government is illegally placing conditions on funds for services and resources for crime victims.
Ellison joined 20 other attorneys general in filing the suit. 
The Victims of Crime Act, signed by President Ronald Regan in 1984, created grant programs to pay for victim and witness advocacy services; emergency shelter; medical, funeral, and burial expenses; crime scene cleanup; sexual assault forensic exams; and more. 
This year, the U.S. Department of Justice, which administers the program, imposed new conditions on the grants, mandating that they may not be used for “any program or activity that, directly or indirectly, violates (or promotes or facilitates the violation of) federal immigration law…including by failing to…give access to DHS agents, or honor DHS requests and provide requested notice to DHS agents.”
In other words, states — and the organizations that provide crime victim services, like domestic violence shelters, rape crisis centers, child advocacy centers  — can’t access the funds without agreeing to cooperate with President Donald Trump’s immigration priorities.
“Crime victims deserve so much better than to be used as political leverage, so I am filing a lawsuit to put an end to that and make sure victims get the support and compensation they deserve,” Ellison said in a press release. 
Over the past four years, Minnesota has received an average of nearly $2 million per year in Victims of Crime Act grants. Last year, grant recipients served more than 115,000 individuals in Minnesota, according to DOJ data.
The lawsuit alleges that the DOJ violated the Administrative Procedure Act, which requires federal agencies to work within the language of the law approved by Congress — the Victims of Crime Act makes no mention of immigration. 
The lawsuit also accuses the federal government of violating the separation of powers outlined in the Constitution by refusing to spend money allocated by Congress.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/P1130286-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-20 16:56:52.851165

(Photo by Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)Two pipeline companies are competing for a financial guarantee of up to $500 million from the North Dakota government to bring natural gas to the eastern half of the state.
The North Dakota Industrial Commission is expected to decide on Thursday which project to back.
The state wants more pipeline capacity to help oil and gas operators in the Bakken reach customers in the east, said North Dakota Pipeline Authority Executive Director Justin Kringstad. Right now, eastern North Dakota gets its natural gas from one source — the Viking Gas Transmission pipeline, which brings gas down from Canada. 
A pipeline connecting the area to the west would support economic development as well as make the power supply in the east more secure, Kringstad said.
“There’s long been a risk in having a single source of supply,” he said.
A west-to-east natural gas pipeline also would benefit Bakken oil producers. As Bakken wells age, they produce a higher percentage of natural gas. Inadequate natural gas pipeline capacity could cause producers to cut back on oil production — which would reduce state oil tax revenue.
The state has had a program to encourage businesses to increase natural gas pipeline capacity since 2007, but it went unfunded for years. The Legislature in 2023 made $30 million per year in financing available. The 2025 Legislature then voted to increase this amount to $50 million per year. The state’s support was essential to get companies interested in the project, Kringstad said.
WBI Energy and Intensity Infrastructure Partners put their hats in the ring for the contract. Representatives from both companies pitched their vision for the pipeline project in July presentations to the Industrial Commission, which consists of the governor, attorney general and agriculture commissioner.

WBI Energy proposes building the first phase of the new pipeline from McKenzie County to Washburn, and the second phase from Washburn to Mapleton, just west of Fargo. The company would also build out an extension from Jamestown to Ellendale, home to a data center. WBI’s timeline is to have phase one in service in November 2029, and phase two in service in November of 2030.
WBI’s project, known as Bakken East, is expected to transport about 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day to eastern North Dakota, Kringstad said, noting the initial designs could change as the project progresses. North Dakota produces more than 3 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day.
WBI’s pipeline would be built entirely in North Dakota but would be considered an interstate pipeline because it connects with other pipelines that leave the state. That means it would be permitted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, not the North Dakota Public Service Commission.
Intensity Infrastructure Partners pitched a pipeline that would first extend from Watford City to Underwood in phase one, and then connect Underwood to Casselton in phase two. Intensity said it would aim to finish the first leg of the project by July 1, 2029, and the second phase by Jan. 1, 2030. The capacity to central North Dakota would be about 1.1 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas. The capacity to eastern North Dakota would be about 430 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, expandable to 875 million cubic feet, Kringstad said.
However, Intensity officials told the Industrial Commission the second phase of the project is not yet firm. Intensity is seeking up to $50 million per day from the state for phase one of the project, or $30 million per year for a smaller version of phase one.  
The Intensity project would be considered an intrastate pipeline, which means it would be regulated by the North Dakota Public Service Commission. It also would require some certificates from FERC for connections with other interstate pipelines. Intensity has a partnership with Rainbow Energy, which operates Coal Creek Station at Underwood.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who chairs the Industrial Commission, indicated in July that the board would select a winner during its August meeting.
“We have tough decisions to make, but it’s a whole lot better than not having any decision,” Armstrong said.
After a project is selected, the state would negotiate specific terms with the company, Kringstad said. 
North Dakota is purchasing capacity on the pipeline as a financial backstop. However, the state plans to release its pipeline capacity to private businesses. WBI Energy said in its application that it’s confident a customer will want to acquire the state’s capacity. Kringstad said there are already companies expressing interest. 
If the state can’t release its capacity, another option would be for the North Dakota Pipeline Authority to work with a gas marketing firm to try to recoup the state’s investment, Kringstad said.
In a worst-case scenario, the state would provide up to $500 million, or $50 million a year for 10 years, and not be able to recoup its investment. The funding would come through a loan from the Bank of North Dakota, to be repaid with state dollars from the Strategic Investment and Improvements Fund. 
“The No. 1 goal of the program is to release that capacity back to the private sector as quickly as possible,” Kringstad said.

Young Kim in a district that could be drawn redder by Gov. Gavin Newsom’s gerrymander.,"In summary
An immigration attorney who represented an ICE-detained Orange County father of three military sons is the latest Democrat to challenge Republican Rep. Young Kim in a district that could be drawn redder by Gov. Gavin Newsom’s gerrymander. 


Democrats since 2020 have dreamed of ousting Republican Rep. Young Kim from her Orange County seat, only to watch their candidates get trounced by near double digits. 
But that hasn’t deterred Lisa Ramirez, an immigration attorney, best known for helping free a detained migrant father of three U.S. Marine sons, from jumping into the race for 2026. 
The daughter of an immigrant mother, Ramirez cited what she described as the wave of mass detentions, the lack of due process and President Donald Trump’s disregard for court orders and the rule of law as main reasons for running.
“To me, this race has fundamentally been about protecting our Constitution, our democracy, and ultimately my community,” Ramirez said in an interview with CalMatters before her campaign launch today.
Kim is one of four California incumbent congressional Republicans whose seats the nonpartisan Cook Political Report has identified as somewhat competitive. 
While she’s never held public office, Ramirez points to her decades of advocacy, legal aid and pro bono work as proof that she has the public service resume to represent Orange County in Congress. She said it was a “no brainer” that she would represent Narciso Barranco, the Orange County landscaper whose arrest by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement in June went viral after several community organizations and elected officials referred him to her office. 
“I’m kind of a fan of the underdog, if you will,” Ramirez said. “I’ve worked really hard to create a reputation that when the stakes are high and cases are really challenging, I’m kind of the go-to person.”
Ramirez joins a crowded Democratic field, which includes former Chino Valley Unified School District Board member Christina Gagnier, self-funding art dealer Esther Kim Varet, and Kim’s most recent challenger Joe Kerr, who lost the seat by more than 10 percentage points last year.
Kim has proven a formidable foe for Democratic challengers ever since California’s 40th District was redrawn from a liberal stronghold to a purple swing seat after the 2020 census. With nearly $4 million cash on hand, her eventual opponent will face an uphill battle. And that’s before Gov. Gavin Newsom’s redistricting plan, which if approved by voters on a widely anticipated Nov. 4 special election, would draw the 40th District into an even redder seat. 
But Ramirez says she plans to run no matter what voters decide on the maps.
“My commitment is to flip the seat and to contribute to the flipping of the House,” she said. “I’m in it to win this campaign, and we’ll take it regardless of the geographical boundaries.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/052418-Young-Kim-AP-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-20 15:57:08.315343

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The Iowa Utilities Commission on Wednesday held its first monthly public commission meeting since August 2023, and heard public comment from landowners opposed to the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline.
IUC decided to resume regular public meetings shortly after Gov. Kim Reynolds vetoed a bill that would have restricted the use of eminent domain for hazardous liquid pipelines. In her veto, Reynolds also called for greater transparency in the commission through increased attendance at hearings and informational meetings. 
The commission has held meetings and public hearings scheduled for specific docket items, many of which move into closed session. Commission Chair Sarah Martz said at the top of Wednesday’s meeting that input from the public, governor and stakeholders showed there was a need to bring the public meetings back. 
“Part of this is the desire of the commission to be more transparent and have a more open decision-making process,” Martz said. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Martz said the commission additionally has plans to hold more of its deliberations and other meetings in a public format. She said more details will be released in the coming weeks. 
While the majority of public comment focused on the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline, for which the IUC granted a conditional permit  in 2024, the pipeline was only on the agenda for an update to a lawsuit. 
More than 100 landowners sued the commission over its decision to grant Summit a permit. According to a staff attorney for IUC, final briefs for all parties in the case are due later this week and oral arguments for the case will likely be set for sometime in the fall. 
Landowners in attendance, donned in their signature red shirts, thanked the commission for allowing them the public space to voice their concerns. Commissioners, per the meeting rules, did not respond to public comments.
Landowners brought up continued worries about devalued land, water use, safety and daily disruption from the pipeline project and asked the commissioners to dismiss the project’s phase two permit application and to review the permit issued for phase one. 
Colleen Tucker, a landowner from Mitchell County, said the repeated and loud outcry from Iowans shows an “overwhelming mandate” that they do not want the project. 
“I wonder how you can defend and justify the fact that Summit is given a permit to desecrate our land,” Tucker said. “We are ordinary citizens, and we are here because we love our land, our state and our country.” 
Jess Mazour, the conservation program coordinator with the Iowa chapter of the Sierra Club and an organizer with the landowners, reminded commissioners of the “immense power” they had to impact “other people’s lives” and “their legacies.” 
Mazour held up print outs of the Exhibit H documents that show the status of easements secured along Summit’s phase two route. This route would connect to additional ethanol plants along the pipeline and represent an increase of more than 300 miles of pipeline.

A spokesperson for the Iowa Utilities Commission said Exhibit H files are required documents from the IUC that show where a company does not have a voluntary easement and is requesting eminent domain. 
Mazour noted in many counties, per these exhibits, voluntary easements had not been secured along the route, which she said shows “a failing project.” 
The IUC spokesperson noted it is “very common” for a company to file Exhibit H documents and later submit withdrawals of the exhibits as it obtains more voluntary easements through negotiation. 
“The filing of Exhibit H in no way confers a right to use eminent domain,” the spokesperson said in an email.
Landowners also suggested the IUC revoke or reevaluate the permit for phase one of the project because Summit has been unable to secure a permit through South Dakota. Per the IUC, in order to begin construction on the project, Summit had to secure permits in North Dakota and South Dakota. 
Permits have been approved in North Dakota, but are tied up in litigation. South Dakota regulators have denied permit applications from the company twice, and enacted a bill this spring that restricts CO2 pipelines from using eminent domain. The company has received a permit to cross through Minnesota. 
One landowner said the setbacks in the Dakotas mean the project is a “pipeline to nowhere.”
“We all have these Iowa values that we were brought up with, working hard, integrity, taking care of others,” Mazour said to commissioners. “Remember that the decision that you three have is going to shape the lives of 1000s of Iowans, and it can be for the better, or it can be for the worse.
Summit Carbon Solutions did not respond to a request for comment.

Article Summary

The Illinois State Board of Elections fined Senate President Don Harmon $9.8 million for accepting greater campaign donations than the law allowed in 2024.
Harmon loaned his campaign money during the 2024 primary, lifting the donation cap under a “self-funding” exemption.
But the board ruled fundraising caps should have been reinstated after the March primary and Harmon should have filed a new notice of self-funding.
Harmon is appealing the fine. His attorney argued the fundraising limits should remain suspended through the 2026 election because Harmon was not on the ballot in 2024.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

CHICAGO – How long can a political candidate’s decision to loan their campaign money allow them to take unlimited donations from donors? As long as four years for a state senator, according to Senate President Don Harmon’s attorney.
The Illinois State Board of Elections had a different take earlier this year when they fined Harmon’s campaign $9.8 million following Chicago Tribune reporting that Harmon, an Oak Park Democrat, accepted $4 million more than was allowed during the 2024 election.
The donations in question involve a state law that limits contributions to campaigns during an election cycle. Under the law, a campaign becomes “self-funded” when the candidate puts more than $100,000 into the campaign. Once that happens, the candidate and their opponents are no longer subject to limits on how much people or political action committees can contribute to the campaign.
Harmon contributed $100,001 to his own campaign in January 2023. However, the State Board of Elections ruled the contribution only lifted the cap through the primary – meaning about $4 million collected after the primary was accepted improperly.
Harmon is appealing the board’s decision, and his lawyer argued in a hearing on Wednesday that the self-funding exemption should have remained in place, because Harmon’s name was not on the ballot in 2024.
While Harmon wasn’t on the ballot, legislative leaders frequently eliminate fundraising caps each election cycle to use their campaign funds to contribute to other candidates in their caucus.
Harmon’s objection
Harmon’s attorney Mike Kasper said he shouldn’t have had to make another $100,001 loan to reactivate the self-funding exemption when the primary season concluded. And it should still be in effect through the 2026 election, he argued before a State Board of Elections hearing officer.
“Once you become a candidate for that office, you remain a candidate for that office … until the election for that office,” Kasper, a long-time election law attorney for Illinois Democrats, told the hearing officer.
Though Harmon began self-funding his campaign in the middle of an election cycle in which he was not on the ballot, Kasper said reestablishing caps either after the 2024 primary or general election would establish new limits on fundraising in the middle of Harmon’s term. Though Kasper argued fundraising limits should have been off for Harmon through the 2026 election, he said at a minimum they should have been off through the entire 2024 election.
“If it’s unfair to have the caps reattached after the primary when there’s a self-funder, it seems even more unfair to apply it halfway through the election,” Kasper said. “I don’t think anyone ever intended for the caps to be put back on in the middle of an election.”
Citing the state law that allows candidates to self-fund without limits, Kasper said the board’s interpretation “stretches the statute into a pretzel I think is incomprehensible” and limits an opponent’s ability to financially compete against the self-funding candidate.
An attorney for the board declined to defend the penalty at Wednesday’s hearing.
Prior violations
The alleged 2024 violation is not the first time one of Harmon’s political committees has been fined for improperly accepting contributions.
The State Board of Elections fined the All for Justice political action committee $108,500 for not timely filing reports for how it spent more than $7 million during the 2022 campaign.
The committee, backed by Harmon, was established to help elect two Democrats to the Illinois Supreme Court. It was disbanded shortly after the fine.
Harmon currently operates three campaign accounts for his Senate seat, township committeeman position and his bid to be elected next year to the Democratic Party of Illinois’ State Central Committee.
His main account for his Senate campaign that he also uses to support other Democratic candidates for Senate had $14.5 million at the end of June, according to State Board of Elections records, meaning a $9.8 million fine would seize most of the money he has available. Harmon filed a new notice of self-funding in January after depositing another $100,001 into his campaign. However, the notice only indicates self-funding and the suspension of contribution limits through the March 2026 primary.
The State Board of Elections could rule as soon as their meeting on Sept. 16 whether Harmon will have to pay the full fine, a smaller penalty or no fine at all. The board’s ruling is likely to set a precedent for future campaigns on how long contributions limits can remain suspended in an election.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Americans are becoming well acquainted with data centers’ use of electricity via their utility bills, but the power-hungry warehouses that fuel our insatiable appetite for memes, movies, pics and posts is thirsty for an even more important resource: water. 
One large-scale data center can consume as much water as 12,000 households, according to the the Alliance for the Great Lakes.
“We are going to see more water conflicts as the data center sector expands at the same time as we see an expansion of irrigated agriculture into areas that haven’t needed it as much,” said Helena Volzer, a water policy manager for Alliance for the Great Lakes, in an interview. 
A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources order temporarily barring new or expanded irrigation allowances along Little Rock Creek portends broader conflicts over groundwater use across the Great Lakes region, the Alliance said in a report released Wednesday. 
The DNR’s April 2024 order found “substantial evidence” that agricultural irrigation and other authorized uses harmed the Mississippi River tributary, which runs along the boundary of Benton and Morrison counties in central Minnesota. Elsewhere in the region, proposed mines, factories and data centers threaten to deplete the underground aquifers that supply up to 40% of the Great Lakes’ volume — and drinking water reserves for nearly three-quarters of Minnesotans. 
Climate change, the artificial intelligence race, and pressure to mine and manufacture more on U.S. soil mean “we are seeing a convergence of increasing water demand from different sources,” said Volzer, who spent a year compiling the report. 
Data centers with evaporative cooling systems, in particular, can consume vast amounts of water. Though most of Minnesota lies outside the Great Lakes basin, Volzer said the concerns raised in the report apply to other major watersheds, too.
Minnesota statute allows the DNR to limit groundwater appropriations in designated groundwater management areas. But it can only take that step after determining that groundwater draws hurt nearby surface waters, as it did last year in the Little Rock Creek case, or when “there are competing demands among existing and proposed users which exceed the reasonably available waters,” Volzer said in the report.
That restricts the DNR to act only in situations where actual or proposed water withdrawals clearly impact people and businesses. In her report, Volzer advised Minnesota lawmakers to expand the state’s groundwater protection law to let the DNR intervene when water appropriations are “likely” to impact surface or groundwater reserves.
State legislators passed a series of water protection laws earlier this decade after a Lakeville-based rail company proposed shipping 500 million gallons of Dakota County groundwater each year to the U.S. Southwest, said state Rep. Rick Hansen, DFL-South St. Paul. (The DNR shot down that proposal.)
Proactive measures will help states like Minnesota get ahead of a fast-growing IT industry whose environmental impacts remain unclear, Volzer said. 
In her report, Volzer advised states to fund studies of expected water demand and groundwater resources, while expanding water use reporting requirements. That could give state and local authorities more insight into where large IT facilities could be located without unduly stressing aquifers, she told the Reformer.
The ag industry’s political sway could complicate further legislation to manage Minnesota’s groundwater, Hansen said.
“Big Ag makes water law changes hard because some legislators are susceptible to ‘cropaganda,’” he said.
Thirsty data centers have already caused political backlash in Georgia, where residents on private wells near Atlanta say a new Meta facility has rendered their water “undrinkable.” 
Meta is spending $800 million to build another data center in Rosemount, southeast of the Twin Cities. The city says that facility could draw 100,000 gallons of groundwater per day at peak capacity, or one Olympic swimming pool every six days, the Star Tribune reported in April. 
Data centers proposed for Chaska and Farmington could use 15 and 24 times more than Meta’s Rosemount hub, the Strib reported, though Chaska’s water manager assured the paper that the city can handle the added demand.
“We don’t have a good sense of the water footprint of a data center right now,” Volzer said. That’s due to the fact that data center developers require city officials to sign nondisclosure agreements before moving forward, she said, and because data center designs vary widely and continue to evolve. 
Newer designs favor closed-loop or waterless liquid cooling systems that are more economical than evaporative water cooling. The catch, Volzer said, is that those systems may require more electricity to run pumps, fans and heat exchangers, increasing demand on nearby thermal power plants fueled by coal, gas or uranium. 
Those plants themselves need huge amounts of cooling water, setting up a “shell game” where data centers shift water usage beyond their sphere of influence. (Wind turbines and solar panels use little or no water in their operations.)
“There is a nexus between water and energy. You can’t silo them,” Volzer said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MG_1065-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-20 15:57:08.315343
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-20 19:08:27+00:00,CT Mirror,ICE arrests 65 people in CT in four-day operation,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/20/ice-arrests-65-people-in-ct/,The announcement comes after people in Western Connecticut cities warned about increased federal immigration enforcement activity last week.,"Officials from Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s New England Office announced Wednesday that they had arrested 65 immigrants in Connecticut in a four-day operation dubbed “Operation Broken Trust.” 
The announcement comes after advocates in multiple cities in Western Connecticut alerted residents and organized protests about increased federal immigration enforcement activity last week. 
Last Thursday, immigration advocates held a rally in Stamford to protest recent ICE activity in the city. Two men were reportedly arrested at the Stamford Superior Courthouse on Aug. 11. According to reporting by CT Public, the two men were there for a follow-up appointment after being the victims of an armed robbery. 
The group Greater Danbury Unites for Immigrants said in a Thursday release that federal agents have been seen at the courthouse on a regular basis. The group says that on Aug. 12, six people were arrested on their way to work, and an additional four were arrested on Aug. 13. On Aug. 14, two people were allegedly arrested at Danbury Superior Court. 
Videos posted on social media show confrontations between advocacy groups and ICE agents in the parking lot of Danbury Superior Court, as the officials arrest a man and a woman. The videos show a group of officers dressed in tactical gear, some of whom wore masks. 
According to ICE, 29 of the 65 people arrested had been either charged with or convicted of “serious crimes.” Of the 13 people named in the release, five were arrested in Stamford, two in Norwalk, and six in Danbury. Some of the 13 people identified in the release had been convicted of crimes, including drug possession, sexual assault, DUI and larceny, according to ICE. Others were facing charges, including assault, breach of peace, and carrying a dangerous weapon. 
It isn’t clear from the release how many of the 65 people arrested had been convicted of crimes.
In Norwalk, ICE officers sat in the parking lot of the police department on Thursday and Friday. Mayor Harry Rilling and Police Chief James Walsh put out a statement on Friday saying that ICE had not been authorized to sit in the parking lot and that they were asked to leave on both days. Rilling said during a press conference on Friday that the police department was not working with ICE. 
Walsh said that he and Rilling had a long conversation with federal authorities to “voice their displeasure” about ICE officers’ using the parking lot. Walsh told The Connecticut Mirror on Wednesday that he did not know of any additional ICE activity this week.
Police in Danbury, Norwalk and Stamford all told CT Mirror that they were not aware of “Operation Broken Trust” and that they did not know the number of people who were arrested or detained by ICE. 
A video posted to social media showed two brothers, Ricardo and Leonard Chavez, tased and arrested by ICE agents in Norwalk in the middle of the street. Walsh said at the press conference that police had removed a vehicle with smashed windows from Main Street. 
ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Boston acting Field Office Director Patricia H. Hyde criticized Connecticut’s Trust Act, which prohibits local and state law enforcement from cooperating with ICE, unless the person has been convicted of certain serious crimes, is on the federal terrorist list or is the subject of a judicial warrant.
“Sanctuary legislation like Connecticut’s Trust Act only endangers the communities it claims to protect. Such laws only force law enforcement professionals to release criminal alien offenders back into the very communities they have already victimized,” Hyde told Fox News.
This year, the Trust Act was modified to allow individuals to sue over alleged violations of the law but also expanded the situations in which officials can comply with federal immigration detainers — and not be subject to such litigation. Sexual assault, injury or risk of injury to a child, strangulation, burglary with a firearm, possessing child sexual abuse material, enticing or sexually exploiting a minor and violating a protective order are now crimes that allow Connecticut law enforcement to hand someone over to ICE. 
On Aug. 13, U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi sent a letter to Gov. Ned Lamont in which she said that Connecticut had been placed on a list of jurisdictions that “engages in sanctuary policies and practices that thwart federal immigration enforcement to the detriment of the interests of the United States.” 
She asked Lamont to confirm “your commitment to complying with federal law and identif[y] the immediate initiatives you are taking to eliminate laws, policies, and practices that impede federal immigration enforcement.”
Lamont wrote back that Connecticut law does not stop federal immigration enforcement from carrying out operations. He also criticized the federal government for practices like arresting people at courthouses, which he said make it more difficult for law enforcement officers to do their jobs. 
“We all agree that violent criminals should be arrested, prosecuted, and, when appropriate, deported, which is why Connecticut law facilitates law enforcement working with federal officers in those instances. Unfortunately, DHS’s current deportation tactics undermine legitimate law enforcement by instilling fear among residents and interfering in the orderly functioning of our state courts,” the letter reads. 
In a statement to CT Mirror, Rob Blanchard, a spokesperson for Lamont, underscored that Connecticut is not a “sanctuary” state — a term that he said has no legal definition. 
“As [Operation Broken Trust] proves, nothing in Connecticut law prevented immigration officials from conducting these enforcement efforts, contrary to their own agency’s assertions,” Blanchard said. 
Sen. Rob Harding, R-Brookfield, and Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, called the ICE operation “excellent news.” 
“Connecticut’s streets are now safer. Violent offenders are now in custody. The federal government clearly has taken note of Connecticut’s super-sanctuary policies, even though Gov. Lamont and Democrats really, really don’t want the term ‘sanctuary state’ applied to our state,” they said in a statement. 
Rep. Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, the House Minority Leader, also praised ICE for its “successful operation targeting and removing criminals from our communities” while criticizing Connecticut’s policies, which he said “provide sanctuary for individuals with extensive criminal histories, including members of transnational gangs.”
“Connecticut residents want and deserve leadership that puts their safety first by working cooperatively with federal authorities to ensure that those who pose threats to our communities are captured and removed,” he said in a statement.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025_0820_SR_FairfieldCourthouse_008-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-20 15:57:08.315343

Thompson Federal Courthouse in Nashville. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout) NASHVILLE — Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia are asking a federal judge in Tennessee to dismiss human smuggling charges against him, calling the case a clear example of “selective and vindictive prosecution” by the Trump administration.
In a motion filed late Tuesday, just days ahead of Abrego’s expected pretrial release, the attorneys conceded their argument to dismiss the case is “infrequently made and rarely succeeds.”
“But if there has ever been a case for dismissal on those grounds, this is that case,” they wrote. “The government is attempting to use this case — and this Court — to punish Mr. Abrego for successfully fighting his unlawful removal. That is a constitutional violation of the most basic sort.”
The government has not yet filed a legal response. “The United States’ position is set forth in Mr. McGuire’s statements in court and our pleadings,” a spokesperson for Acting U.S. Attorney Robert McGuire said in an email Wednesday.
The 35-page petition seeking to dismiss all charges narrates a chain of events that began with Abrego’s detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in March, while driving with his son in Maryland, through his deportation days later to a Salvadoran prison. Abrego remained for months in the notorious maximum security CECOT prison, despite the admission by a government attorney he had been sent there in error. 
Abrego has subsequently claimed he was tortured while in CECOT. 
‘A wide-ranging and unprecedented retribution campaign’ 
Attorneys for Abrego challenged his removal to El Salvador for lack of due process in a separate lawsuit filed in federal court in Maryland, where the 29-year-old sheet metal apprentice had been living with his wife and children.
“The government did not take steps to fix its mistake,” his Tennessee lawyers wrote Tuesday. “Instead, in response to his lawsuit — and to the substantial publicity it received — the government undertook a wide-ranging and unprecedented retribution campaign against Mr. Abrego.” 
The human smuggling charges brought against Abrego in Tennessee are part of that campaign, his lawyers argued. 
Kilmar Abrego Garcia to remain jailed in Tennessee as judge weighs arguments on release

A Tennessee grand jury in June returned the indictments for “conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain” and “unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain.” Prosecutors contend Abrego participated in a national scheme to move immigrants who entered the United States illegally to points around the country. Abrego, as his attorneys refer to him in legal filings, has pleaded not guilty.
The charges are tied to a 2022 traffic stop in Putnam County, Tenn., where Abrego was pulled over for speeding with nine passengers in the back of his car. Abrego was neither ticketed nor arrested in the stop.
A Department of Homeland Security special agent later testified he was not tasked with investigating the Tennessee traffic stop until April 28 of this year. By then, a Maryland federal judge had ordered the government to facilitate Abrego’s return to the U.S.nited States and the Supreme Court had upheld the decision. 
The government returned Abrego to Tennessee to face charges on June 6. 
Case draws national scrutiny
The case generated widespread public scrutiny of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics during his initial months in office, which were criticized for undermining due process rights guaranteed to both citizens and noncitizens. 
Abrego, a Salvadoran national who entered the United States illegally as a teenager, is subject to a 2019 immigration court order that prohibits the government from deporting him to El Salvador, where he says he faces threats of gang violence.

After his wrongful deportation, administration officials, including President Donald Trump, singled out Abrego in their public comments, calling him a “gangbanger,” “monster,” “illegal predator,” “illegal alien terrorist,” “wife beater,” and “human trafficker.” 
Abrego’s attorneys accused the administration of a public smear campaign intended to paper over its embarrassment over his wrongful deportation and retaliate against his legal efforts to assert his due process rights. Abrego has denied gang affiliation. 
The administration’s public statements, Abrego’s attorneys argued, bolster their claims that the prosecution against him is retaliatory.
“The unprecedented public pronouncements attacking Mr. Abrego for his successful exercise of constitutional rights by senior cabinet members, leaders of the DOJ, and even the President of the United States, make this the rare case where actual vindictiveness is clear from the record,” they wrote.
Lawyers seek to curb Trump administration comments about the case
Earlier this month, Abrego’s attorneys sought, for a second time, a court order restricting government officials’ remarks about the case as prejudicial and contrary to standard court rules.
In response, U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw, who presides over the Tennessee criminal case, directed all “counsel and those working with counsel” to note in their public communications that Abrego is presumed innocent. 
“Our Constitution requires that Abrego is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury,” Crenshaw wrote in his July 31 order.
Separately, in response to Abrego’s attorney’s waiver of the right to a speedy trial, the court set a trial date of Jan. 27.

Abrego remains in the custody of the U.S. Marshalls, who have jurisdiction over pre-trial detainees in federal cases.
Abrego has already been cleared for release pending trial by a Tennessee magistrate, an order placed on hold at the request of his attorneys amid uncertainty over whether federal immigration officials intend to detain or deport him to a “third country.”
Abrego’s attorneys on Tuesday requested the magistrate move forward with releasing him Friday, the day the hold expires. 
The attorneys noted a Maryland federal judge has barred the government from taking Abrego into immigration custody and required immigration officials to provide 72-hours written notice before removing him to a third country. 
His Tennessee lawyers, Sean Hecker and Rascoe Dean, also wrote they are “retaining a private security firm that has experience providing court-approved pre-trial transportation and security services in criminal cases to transport Mr. Abrego from Tennessee to Maryland upon release.”  
The lawyers requested details about the security arrangements be kept under seal “in order to protect Mr. Abrego’s safety.”
A federal magistrate on Wednesday set a tentative hearing for Friday if prosecutors oppose any of the conditions of Abrego’s release sought by his attorneys.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)TAMPA — Polls from the 2024 election showed that Democrats were on the wrong side of public opinion when it came to their immigration policies.
But could a perception that the GOP has overreached to achieve President Donald Trump’s goal of mass deportations bring a correction next year? That’s apparently the philosophy several Florida Democrats are pushing, as demonstrated by their comments in Tampa on Tuesday night.
“Republican leaders are fighting communities, not crime,” said Democratic gubernatorial candidate David Jolly, speaking during an immigration forum hosted by the Hillsborough County Democratic Hispanic at the Cuban Club in Ybor City.
Jolly maintains that the GOP has gone down the wrong path by conflating undocumented immigration with crime.
“This is a contrast of values and, fundamentally, the American people understand, regardless of party registration, cruelty and broken promises,” he said. “And we’re living through an era of cruelty and broken promises. It’s not new. We’ve seen it in years past, and it has taken people to speak up and say, ‘Enough.’”
When speaking about immigrants lacking legal status, Gov. Ron DeSantis often focuses on those who have committed criminal acts, such as the immigrant accused of killing three people while trying to make an illegal U-turn in a tractor-trailer on the Florida Turnpike in Fort Pierce last week.
The Associated Press reported last month that ICE statistics showed that, as of June 29, 57,861 people had been detained by ICE, of whom 41,495 — 71.7% — had no criminal convictions. That included 14,318 people with pending criminal charges and 27,177 who are subject to immigration enforcement but have no known criminal convictions or pending charges.
The governor also boasts about how no state has done more to fulfill the president’s agenda. Those actions include legislation requiring many local and state law enforcement agencies to collaborate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in detaining and potentially deporting individuals.
It also includes building the state’s own immigration camp to hold detainees (“Alligator Alcatraz”), and the governor announced last week that a second facility will soon open in North Florida.
‘Political theatre’
Former Miami-Dade County state Sen. José Javier Rodríguez, a candidate for attorney general next year, denounced the Everglades detention center.
“If I was attorney general, what I would be focused on is going after the insurance companies,” he said. “Going after the utilities that are screwing people and taking advantage of us and getting away with anything with whatever they want in Tallahassee, right?
“Instead, we have this political theater where the only purpose is for the current attorney general and the governor to get a pat on the head by the president, and that’s what they got, right? But meanwhile, we are the ones who are left with the costs of this thing.”
Tampa Bay area Democratic U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor said U.S. immigration laws are broken and repeated a talking point made by Democrats last year blaming Trump for killing a proposed bipartisan bill dealing with immigration.
That proposal would have raised the bar for migrants to claim asylum, created a temporary procedure to shut down the border at particularly active times, and ended the practice of allowing migrants to live in the United States while waiting for their cases to be heard by an immigration judge, among other policies.
“He was the one who blocked a bipartisan immigration reform effort where we would ensure those pathways to work in citizenship exist while strengthening border security and investing in the immigration courts, to make sure things moved smoothly,” Castor said.
“So instead, right now, playing on the fears and prejudices and abusing his powers, because I think that everyone agrees that If you are not here legally and you violate the law, you’re subject to deportation. But what they’re doing now goes far beyond that.”
She added that the bulk of her work in her congressional office is dealing with “egregious case after egregious case” of people who she said were following the law but have now been detained and subject to deportation.
Joining the professional politicians on the stage were two Tampa immigration lawyers who, along with Javier Rodríguez, occasionally responded in both Spanish and English to the audience.
Expedited removal
Attorney Danielle Hernandez previously served as assistant chief counsel for the Department of Homeland Security in both the Obama and (the first) Trump administrations. She said that among the changes that the current Trump regime has enacted is expanding what is known as expedited removal.
Previously, ICE and Customs Border Patrol only used expedited removal against people within 100 miles of the border and within two weeks of their arrival in the U.S., Hernandez said. However, an executive order signed by the president in January changed that.
“They expanded that criminality and said, ‘Hey, if you came in illegally, you’re a criminal.’ Which is not true,” she said. “Coming in through the border is a civil infraction, it’s not actually a criminal action unless you re-enter through the border, then it becomes a federal crime, right? So that’s one thing that people don’t know.”
Hernandez explained that now anyone who entered the country after April 2023 is “fair game to absolutely any arrest.”
“They can go into any court, terminate your asylum proceedings, and arrest you outside. So that’s what you see on the news,” she added.
Combined with the discussion of illegal immigration on Tuesday night was talk about how Democrats have lost their share of the Latino vote in recent elections — a trend that started in Florida years ago.
“We definitely have a war against Hispanics going on in the country,” said La Gaceta editor and publisher Patrick Manteiga.
“The real problem is many of them agree with the Trump administration and helped put them into place today. I think they thought that it was some other Hispanic that was going to get picked up rather than themselves, and they were happy to close the door right behind them, and that’s a real shameful part of this whole thing.”
Jolly said that Democrats need to talk to Latino voters about something other than immigration all the time.

“The way we get them back is we speak to their true concerns that will inform their votes,” he said.
“What the other side got right in the last few cycles was they understood the anger and anxiety and they spoke to that. And it wasn’t necessarily around immigration, and we make a mistake by thinking that if I walk into a room of Black pastors, that somehow I have to speak about Black pastor issues, when their issue of getting their kid to school on time that was the same as mine. That’s where I think we have an opportunity to make up ground.”

Changing sentiments?
Polls show political sentiment may be changing, however.
A Suffolk University/WSVN-TV 7 News survey of 500 residents of Miami taken last month — 52% of whom identified as Hispanic or Latino — showed that 61% said recent ICE enforcement raids had gone too far, and 52% of respondents said recent deportations of Venezuelans, Cubans, and Argentinians living in Miami made them less likely to support President Trump going forward.
And a YouGov survey of 2,156 U.S. adult citizens published Wednesday found that 53% of Americans (and 56% of independent voters) say Trump’s approach on immigration is too harsh, with 36% saying it is “just right.” Two-thirds of those polled believe the Trump administration has wrongfully detained U.S. citizens in immigration detention centers.

Towards the end of the two-hour forum, a group of people began shouting suggestions to the panel about what do to reverse the situation.

Nearly all of the speakers on stage said, “vote.”
“What about now?” came one response.
The lack of an immediate call to action frustrated another member of the public, who said later that “we feed those communities. What do you do?”
“We cannot wait until November of next year,” cried another voice.

And he won.
Looney, who owns Bad Boy Bail Bonds in Gallatin County, took two Bozeman municipal judges to court, alleging that they had unfairly and illegally discriminated against his business.
This week, the City of Bozeman has settled with him for $100,000.
Looney’s case was notable for several reasons: First, it saw him forced to take two municipal judges to federal court, after sitting Gallatin County state judges as well as the Montana Supreme Court appeared not to find a judge willing to take the case.
The case is also notable because it marks one of the few times in the state’s history where judges haven’t been protected by judicial immunity — a far-reaching legal doctrine in which judges cannot be sued for decisions related to administering justice as judge. However, U.S. District Court Judge Donald Molloy ruled that judicial immunity didn’t necessarily allow the judges to blacklist Looney’s business.
The case is also notable because the 2025 Legislature considered it in light of a slate of judicial reform bills that Republicans had championed, but mostly fizzled out by the session’s end. The case drew broad attention, leading the national bail bonding association to call on Montana leaders and courts to remedy what it believed was a miscarriage of justice.
Meanwhile, the state’s Judicial Standards Committee also dismissed the challenge. The state’s judicial standards committee is comprised of attorneys as well as citizens who receive and evaluate complaints against sitting judges, and when appropriate, mete out disciplinary sanctions.
The challenge happened because Looney purchased the name of a former bail bond company, Bad Boy Bail Bonds, but didn’t purchase the business itself. However, several bonds issued under the name had been forfeited, and the two municipal judges — Colleen Herrington and Karolina Tierney, ordered Looney to pay the amount, $1,585, which he originally refused.
When Looney attempted to explain that the had purchased just the name and not the company or its book of business, the judges ordered that Bozeman municipal court  not accept bail bonds from Bad Boy Bail Bonds, leading him to allege that he was losing tens of thousands of dollars. At one point, other counties began to follow suit. Even after Looney paid one of the bonds under protest, the judges continued to refuse bonds, at one point asking the state’s insurance commission to revoke Looney’s bonding authority.
Herrington is running unopposed for re-election to her municipal judge position. It’s a four-year term.
Attorney Matthew Monforton, who represented Looney and his business, said that the settlement will be paid by the city’s insurance carrier.
“Mr. Looney got justice, but only by fighting a long and costly battle against two of the state’s most vindictive and unfit judges,” Monforton said to the Daily Montanan. “Mr. Looney had to wage this battle on his own because the Legislature and the JSC refused to act against this egregious judicial abuse.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/John-Looney-Bail-Bonds-1024x578.jpg,,,2025-08-20 15:57:08.315343

The transfer is made possible by the Utah State Parks Adjustment Act, a 2024 law sponsored by Utah GOP Rep. Celeste Maloy, which targeted several isolated tracks of federal land to be handed over to the state and absorbed by existing state parks. 
“Having federal lands interspersed throughout these parks has made effective management more challenging,” Maloy said after the bill passed the House last December.

(Screenshot of SCETV legislative livestream)COLUMBIA — South Carolina’s state-owned hospital system plans to take a controlling stake in a struggling Grand Strand hospital operator.
A legislative oversight committee gave the initial nod Tuesday for the Medical University of South Carolina’s hospital system to purchase a more than 50% share in Tidelands Health.
Legislators revealed, during a meeting of the Joint Bond Review Committee, that Tidelands is operating at a $50 million deficit. The private hospital company has asked MUSC to step in and help.
Neither MUSC nor Tidelands disclosed how much the deal would cost. According to the two hospital systems, negotiations are ongoing.
SC-owned hospital system set to double debt with 2 new hospitals

Tidelands employs more than 2,500 people in coastal Georgetown, Horry, and Williamsburg counties, according to its website.
“From Georgetown to Murrell’s Inlet, they’re really the only game in town,” state Sen. Stephen Goldfinch told the SC Daily Gazette. “We need it. We can’t let it fold up.”
The Murrell’s Inlet Republican said he supports the deal with MUSC.
Tidelands owns a pair of hospitals in Georgetown and Murrell’s Inlet with a total of 170 beds. It also owns a pair of medical rehab centers. And it has regulatory approval to build a small, 36-bed hospital that could treat patients in the fast-growing retirement communities surrounding Myrtle Beach.
“There are things we can do to strengthen them financially and turn them around,” MUSC Health CEO Dr. Patrick Cawley told legislators.
For example, he said MUSC has buying power and can get equipment and expensive medical records software at a reduced price.
“Our health systems have worked together to improve health care for more than a quarter century,” according to a statement from Tidelands. “A closer alignment would allow us to build on that important work and continue meeting the needs of the people and communities we serve. Patients would benefit as we recruit additional physicians, purchase leading technology and expand clinical research — delivering increased value while controlling costs.”
For nearly 200 years, MUSC had stayed largely contained to its Charleston base.
But beginning in 2019, the hospital system went on an expansion spree. It purchased four rural community hospitals in Florence, Marion, Chester and Lancaster counties.
Two years later, MUSC again expanded with the purchase of three hospitals and a standalone emergency room in the Midlands. Those hospitals, previously owned by Providence Health, had a $70 million deficit.
And in 2023, it took over operations of Orangeburg’s hospital, where there was a $30 million deficit.
MUSC was able to return Orangeburg to fiscal health within two years, Cawley said. And the Midlands hospitals are expected to be back in the black by next year — a five-year turnaround.
Cawley pointed to that track record when making his pitch to legislators.
Democratic Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter, whose district covers Orangeburg, praised MUSC for major improvements in the health care available to that community since the organization stepped in, including oncology, orthopedics and new treatments for sickle cell disease.
“Y’all must be doing something right,” Senate Finance Chairman Harvey Peeler, of Gaffney, chimed in.
MUSC already has a 30% stake in Tidelands and controls six seats on Tidelands’ governing board, according to documents provided to the Joint Bond Review Committee. This deal would up its buy-in at the small hospital system.
Goldfinch said Tidelands, with its roughly $540 million in annual operating revenue, never really recovered from the financial hardships caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, when hospital systems had to cancel surgeries that earn income and focus solely on treating those infected with the virus.
MUSC Health, on the other hand, is a $4.7 billion operation with the support of state funding and larger cash reserves that helped it weather the pandemic challenges.
“Health care is hard when you’re the small guy,” Goldfinch said.
Tidelands has about two years’ worth of cash reserves, so that’s how long MUSC has to make improvements, Cawley said. If the effort ultimately fails, the state-owned hospital system would be financially liable.
By 2043, SC hospitals could receive $2.4B less to treat Medicaid patients

The deal comes as hospitals gear up for other looming financial changes.
In 2028, South Carolina also will start losing its ability to pay hospitals for treating Medicaid patients at similar rates as private insurance following changes included in Republicans’ “big beautiful” spending package.
The law signed July 4 phases out the so-called state directed payment program that South Carolina has used since 2023 to hike Medicaid payments to hospitals by a whopping 70% on average.
For the 60 general care hospitals in the Palmetto State, that collectively means a looming loss of roughly $150 million annually over 15 years, according to the state’s hospital industry group.
Instead of hospitals getting reimbursed with rates that align with private insurance — as they have for the last two years — payments will sink back to near Medicare levels. The higher rates came from the state taxing hospitals to draw down even more federal Medicaid dollars ultimately funneled back to the hospitals.
For the fiscal year that ended June 30, Tidelands received $40 million from these payment boosts, according to data provided by the state Medicaid agency.
South Carolina is among 10 states that never expanded Medicaid coverage to all adults up to 138% of the federal poverty level, as intended under the 2010 law commonly known as Obamacare. For that reason, most other Medicaid changes in the spending package don’t apply to the Palmetto State.
But the state also has a higher percentage of uninsured residents, giving hospitals much less wiggle room to absorb the impact of payment reductions.
In Georgetown County, 21% of the population (adults and children) relies on Medicaid for health insurance, which mirrors the state average. Horry County’s rate is 18.8%, according to US Census Data.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-19-at-4.33.57 PM.png,,,2025-08-20 15:57:08.315343

At the end of the 2023-2024 school year John Russell Elementary in Moscow closed, but now it has a new purpose.
Over the summer, members of the Palouse River Ward of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Unitarian Universalist Church of the Palouse have been working together to turn one room of John Russell Elementary into a Book Nook.
 Book Nook opens to give children free books

The nook, which opened Aug. 15, is open to any child who comes to The Family Resource Hub and houses a variety of books for them to take home. Ricki Martin, a literacy aid at A.B. McDonald Elementary in Moscow, said they wanted to make a room that could get books into the hands of kids.
Martin, a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, said her ward had worked with the Unitarian Church before for programs like Family Promise or the Food Bank.
“We really wanted members of both congregations to work together,” Martin said.
 Volunteers transform a classroom into a reading haven

Nancy Nelson, a member of the Unitarian Universalist church, was in charge of setting up the SignUpGenius for the volunteers. She said both congregations were encouraged to work together to turn a small room into a library for children of all ages to use. The months of planning meant they spent a few weeks in the room to transform it.
Here’s how Idaho’s educators can strive to create supportive environments that cultivate literacy

Volunteers worked together to tape off certain areas and then to paint the walls a light blue and green. They would also build floating shelves and hang them. They discussed having a chalkboard but decided on a white board for children to draw on or leave notes.
“A lot of times — families, when they can’t get basic needs, it can be hard to get books into the house,” Martin said. “This is getting books into a kid’s hands.”
There are board books and picture books as well as chapter books for older children. Books line the walls and are organized by reading level. Martin said all this could change as the space evolves.
Martin also said she had already seen some use since she set it up Aug. 15. She received some books as donations and others from her fellow teachers at McDonald who were taking them out of their classrooms.
 Supporting families beyond books

The Book Nook joins another room in the former elementary school: The Hub. The Hub is a space for families in need to come and find seasonally appropriate clothing, school supplies, sports gear and now books.
“It’s been great to see the small regrowth of Russell after we closed it,” Shawn Tiegs, the superintendent of the Moscow School District said. “The vibrancy, the life is coming back into it.”

Tiegs said The Hub started last year, and the goal was to be able to support families in the school district. He said it had moved into the school about a year ago, and he hopes to see the building continue to help the community.
“The idea is that this is not a dead or dormant building but that it is helping our community,” Tiegs said.
Brian Smith, principal at Paradise Creek Regional High School, oversees The Hub and said it served close to 180 families in the 2024-25 school year. Smith said in the few days it had been open, 40 students have visited the Book Nook and been able to take home books.
“The idea for a ‘Book Nook’ came from Ricki, whose daily work with students developing their reading skills highlighted the need for such a space. I also wanted a welcoming area where students could wait comfortably while parents shopped for clothing, supplies or other essentials,” Smith said.
The Book Nook, Tiegs said, is also an example of the community coming together to help a need they found. The new room also gives children a place to go while parents may be helping another child as well as expanding the books in their home libraries.
“We’ve found in Moscow that there’s a lot of organizations that want to help,” Tiegs said. “The project is a great example of connecting groups.”
Smith said families in need of assistance with clothing, school supplies or other items can reach out to their school counselors or to him at bsmith@msd281.org to schedule a time to shop at The Hub.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The Indiana Commission for Higher Education will hold a special meeting Friday to approve Secretary of Education Katie Jenner as the state’s next commissioner for higher education. 
If successful, she would begin the role Oct. 11 — leading both the Indiana Department of Education and the higher education commission.
Jenner has served as Indiana’s top K-12 education official since 2021. She was tapped by former Gov. Eric Holcomb and remained in the role after Gov. Mike Braun’s inauguration earlier this year.
Indiana’s Higher Education Commissioner Chris Lowery to step down in October

“Immediately upon taking office, my administration launched a new vertical structure across state government to streamline operations, increase accountability and transparency, and improve customer service,” Braun said in a news release. “As we continue to identify ways to better serve Hoosier taxpayers, having a proven, consistent leader directly overseeing both K-12 and higher education is the logical next step and will ensure that the best interest of our students remains top of mind every step of their educational journey.”
Chris Lowery, who has led the commission since 2022, announced in July he would step down in October. 
It’s not clear if — or how much — Jenner’s pay could increase if confirmed by the 14-member CHE board. 
She currently earns $275,00 per year as education secretary, according to the Indiana Transparency Portal. Lowery earns just shy of $238,000 per year.
The education secretary’s salary is determined by the governor, per state law. The General Assembly approved a specific appropriation for CHE in each state budget. The agency received $7.3 million per year in the biennial budget that took effect in July.
Jenner’s new duties
In the new dual role, Jenner’s priorities would include affordability, educational attainment, aligning degrees with industry needs, and supporting the state’s new high school diploma requirements, according to the commission.

Lowery said he plans to work with Jenner and commission leadership in the coming weeks to transition.
“Secretary Jenner is a strong advocate for increasing educational attainment for all Hoosier students from kindergarten through college,” Lowery said in a statement. “The logical next step of Secretary Jenner assuming the role of Commissioner will offer clarity and consistency for the Commission, while continuing to drive our mission and deliver better results for Indiana students, employers, and our state.”
Jenner holds a doctorate in education from the University of Kentucky and an MBA from Indiana State University. 
She previously served as Holcomb’s senior education adviser, vice president of K-12 initiatives for Ivy Tech Community College, and a school administrator and teacher in Madison.
Friday’s vote is scheduled for 1 p.m. in Indianapolis.
The commission’s next regularly scheduled meeting is Sept. 18 at Vincennes University in Jasper.

(Photo by Leah Romero / Source NM)Election officials turned over at the highest rate in at least a quarter century during the last presidential election, according to new research from the Bipartisan Policy Center.
An analysis of shifts in election officials published Tuesday found nearly 41% of election officials administering the 2024 election were different than those in 2020. Turnover has accelerated over the past two decades, rising from about 28% in 2004 to 40.9% last year.
The growing percentage of departing election officials comes after years of challenges. They navigated the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as well as harassment and false conspiracy theories surrounding stolen elections that persist today.
The analysis released by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based group that seeks to foster policy cooperation across party lines, represents an updated version of a report that previously examined turnover from 2004 to 2022. The new research, which extends the data through 2024, shows the turnover rate continued to climb.

The change means that, over time, election officials have less experience. The research found that the share of chief local election officials with six or more years in their role has dropped from 60% in 2006 to 47% in 2024.
But last year, 60% of election officials had previously overseen the administration of a presidential election in their jurisdiction.
“Despite increasing turnover and loss of experience, the majority of chief election officials still have experience running at least one presidential election cycle,” the analysis said. “This is important because presidential elections typically see the highest turnout and are the most visible elections administered.”
The analysis found that over the long term, election official turnover rates have been rising gradually in small jurisdictions, defined as areas with fewer than 100,000 voting-age residents. But large jurisdictions have experienced a more sudden jump in turnover.
Small jurisdictions had a 27% turnover rate in 2004 that had risen to 40% in 2024. But large jurisdictions enjoyed a turnover rate as low as 31% in 2018 before climbing rapidly to nearly 46% last year.

Th[...]","A “no trespassing” sign outside of Northwest ICE Processing Center. (Photo by Grace Deng/Washington State Standard)Washington state should be allowed to enforce health and safety standards at the embattled immigrant detention center in Tacoma, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday.
The decision overturns a lower court order blocking a 2023 state law that sought to provide greater oversight of conditions at the facility, including through unannounced state inspections. The detention center is run by the Florida-based GEO Group under a contract with the federal government.
With the state law, Democratic lawmakers looked to impose numerous new regulations on the facility, known as the Northwest ICE Processing Center. Among other requirements, the law mandated the detention center provide fresh fruits and vegetables, air conditioning and heat, free telecommunication services, weekly mental health evaluations and rooms with windows. 
Failure to comply could result in fines of up to $10,000 per violation. GEO says these standards go beyond requirements the company must follow under its contract.
The law also required the state departments of Health and Labor and Industries to conduct routine, unannounced inspections of the for-profit detention center, which holds immigrant detainees before deportation or release back into the United States. Labor and Industries inspected the site last summer with authority under a separate state law, and found no violations.
The policy followed an earlier effort to ban private detention facilities entirely statewide, but that statute was deemed unenforceable. So lawmakers turned to increasing oversight. 
The 1,575-bed facility has a history of allegations of mistreatment, abuse and neglect of detainees. Seven potential cases of tuberculosis were recently reported there, according to state health officials. Access to medical care has long been a concern inside the facility. 
It has come under renewed scrutiny as more detainees have been sent there with President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. The state and GEO, one of the biggest private detention center companies in the nation, have been enmeshed for years in various legal battles over the facility. 
GEO’s 2015 contract with the federal government awarded the company at least $700 million to operate the facility over the following decade.
The state Department of Health celebrated the ruling from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, saying it allows the agency to investigate complaints of mistreatment and “work toward safer, healthier conditions for everyone in these facilities.”
“We applaud the Ninth Circuit’s decision affirming the Washington State Department of Health’s authority to uphold basic health and safety standards in private detention facilities like the Northwest ICE Processing Center,” spokesperson Kara Kostanich said in an email. 
Kostanich didn’t say if the agency now has imminent plans to inspect the facility.
GEO and its attorney didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Legal lingo
The case served as a test of state versus federal power. The legal doctrine of “intergovernmental immunity” holds that state laws can’t unduly regulate federal activities. 
One of the major controversies in whether the state had overstepped was determining the correct comparison for the Tacoma facility, the only private, for-profit detention center in Washington. 
GEO said prisons are an apt comparison. U.S. District Court Judge Benjamin Settle agreed, finding the law imposed an economic burden on GEO through standards the state doesn’t apply to its own Department of Corrections.
The state countered that involuntary treatment facilities are a better parallel, as they also hold people in civil, not criminal, proceedings.
The three-judge appeals court panel sided with the state. The requirements Washington seeks to impose on GEO and these civil facilities are “almost identical,” the judges found. But the judges will leave the comparison of mandated standards to the lower court.
Washington has also run into legal roadblocks because the law only applied to the Tacoma facility. Lawmakers sought to address this problem this year by expanding the definition of private detention centers to include ones run by nonprofits. So state law now also covers the Martin Hall Juvenile Detention Facility, near Spokane.
GEO moved to get the appeal dismissed in light of the new law, which took effect in May. The judges declined that request.
The appeals court judges note states can treat contractors more stringently than if facilities are run by the federal government.
“A state has greater ability to regulate a contractor of the federal government than to regulate the government itself,” Judge William Fletcher wrote in the opinion.
All three of the judges making Tuesday’s decision were appointed by Democratic presidents, two by Bill Clinton and one by Barack Obama. 
The Department of Justice, which has sided with GEO under both former President Joe Biden and Trump, declined to comment on the ruling.
The ruling is the second loss in as many weeks for GEO at the 9th Circuit. 
Last week, the court declined to reconsider an earlier decision affirming that the company needed to pay more than $23 million for violating Washington’s minimum wage law. GEO plans to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to weigh in on that case.

Connecticut holds the distinction of being the first state in the United States to pass a motor vehicle speed limit law. 
On May 21, 1901, the state enacted “An Act Regulating the Speed of Motor Vehicles,” setting limits of 12 mph in cities and 15 mph on country roads. Drivers were also required to slow down or even stop if they encountered horse-drawn carriages. Those who ignored the law faced fines of up to $200, a steep penalty for the era.
The law was introduced by legislator Robert J. Woodruff, who had initially proposed even stricter limits. While local jurisdictions elsewhere – like New York City – had experimented with auto speed rules, Connecticut’s statute was the first to apply statewide, making it a national pioneer in traffic regulation. Today, every state sets its own speed limits, but Connecticut led the way.

This comes after at least 20 families were forced to vacate their south Jackson apartment, where JXN Water had disconnected services due to the owner’s nonpayment of the property’s water bill. 
At the city’s request in recent weeks, a federal judge twice ordered the utility to restore the water. But Horhn said during a housing task force meeting Monday that Jackson would not ask for another extension, leaving the Wednesday shutoff in effect.
“The first question is: Do we want to look at approaching the Legislature about any sort of criminal charges that can be put together, that the Legislature would have to approve, to let folks know that we’re really serious about this?” Horhn said.
Jackson’s Housing Task Force was created this month in response to the ongoing battle over water services at Blossom Apartments and resident abandonment at Chapel Ridge Apartments in south Jackson. Its aim is to examine and improve policies and strengthen compliance to ensure safe conditions for renters.
It’s a tall order, considering the more than 7,000 registered rental properties and nearly 26,000 individual units across the city.

On Monday, nine of the 11 task force members discussed absent landlords and the millions in unpaid bills that complexes have accrued with JXN Water. The utility has publicized the names of 15 properties with the largest delinquencies. Many of the landlords in question live out of state.
“ It’s really hard to get to these people,” task force member Emma Redding said. “Most of them live in New York or California. The only thing they want is to get their rent money dropped in the bank every month, and they don’t care about the upkeep or anything.”
Jennifer Welch, whose Jackson-based company owns and manages properties in Jackson, Meridian and Hattiesburg, said that since the discontinuation of pandemic-era rental assistance, it’s been tougher for landlords to secure rent payments from tenants.
“If you don’t collect the rent, you’re not going to make the bank note and you’re not going to make the water payment,” Welch said. “I think we’re seeing some trickle down effects of that phenomenon, which was just a cause of COVID.”
This is exacerbated by JXN Water issuing larger water bills. Welch said she’s seen her charges double.
 ”I’ve got a bill that goes from $7,000 to $15,000, which is shocking. What do you do in that situation?” Welch said. “You owe a $15,000 bill and you cannot find the source of why your bills have doubled. I have found myself in that situation before.”
Earnest Ward, president of the Association of South Jackson neighborhoods, said he couldn’t understand how the water bills of various apartment complexes could reach over six figures.
“How did you all allow the water bill to get to $100,000, $200,000, $700,000?” Ward said. “We didn’t know. The only way we found out was when our associates brought the attention to the media.” 
Carla Dazet, a billing executive for JXN Water, was also in attendance, though not as the company’s designee to the task force. She said the private water utility is only concerned with water usage dating back to December 2022. Landlords and apartment owners have been difficult to reach, she said, causing JXN Water to disconnect services.
“We do everything we can prior to disconnections. I reach out. I do research. We call the offices. These property managers flip quickly,” Dazet said. “We don’t want to turn people off, but we don’t get a response until the water goes off. They don’t even respond to final notice letters.”
One of two attorneys present, Robert Ireland, said bad actors need to be held accountable for placing their tenants in a difficult situation. 
“We don’t have the power to control the resolution while the system is under a federal receiver, but there are folks that are not doing the right thing and are pocketing tenants’ money and not paying bills,” Ireland said. 
U.S. District Judge Henry Wingate first ordered the water at Blossom Apartments to be restored on Aug. 8, calling it a “temporary humanitarian measure.”
“I think that the court has been very indulgent to us,” Horhn said. “They’ve gone above and beyond the call of duty in the 12 days that have been extended to the tenants.”
Water was set to be disconnected again at Blossom Apartments on Wednesday once the second order expires, and residents have until then to move out of the apartments. Earlier this month, Mississippi Home Corp. declared the complex to be unsafe, and residents have said they’ve dealt with poor living conditions, including mold, water leaks and dysfunctional appliances. 
Many rely on housing vouchers to cover a portion of their rent, meaning they don’t have the disposable income required to move on such a short notice. Stewpot Community Services is using a federal emergency housing grant to help residents with relocation costs. 
“We’ve got about $100,000 right now to assist the Blossom tenants,” Horhn said. “If they haven’t found a place to live within a few days, then we’re going to put them up in hotels … but we’re going to run out of that money if we don’t come up with a solution real soon.”
Another solution presented: creation of a rapid response team for when JXN Water terminates service at another housing complex. Region 6 Housing Authority stepped in to provide housing vouchers for residents at Blossom, many of whom are lower-income. Stewpot Community Services held a relocation assistance meeting Aug. 12, but Horhn said a majority of the 20 families who remain were still searching for housing.

Election officials turned over at the highest rate in at least a quarter century during the last presidential election, according to new research from the Bipartisan Policy Center.
An analysis of shifts in election officials published Tuesday found nearly 41% of election officials administering the 2024 election were different than those in 2020. Turnover has accelerated over the past two decades, rising from about 28% in 2004 to 40.9% last year.
The growing percentage of departing election officials comes after years of challenges. They navigated the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as well as harassment and false conspiracy theories surrounding stolen elections that persist today.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The analysis released by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based group that seeks to foster policy cooperation across party lines, represents an updated version of a report that previously examined turnover from 2004 to 2022. The new research, which extends the data through 2024, shows the turnover rate continued to climb.
The change means that, over time, election officials have less experience. The research found that the share of chief local election officials with six or more years in their role has dropped from 60% in 2006 to 47% in 2024.
But last year, 60% of election officials had previously overseen the administration of a presidential election in their jurisdiction.
“Despite increasing turnover and loss of experience, the majority of chief election officials still have experience running at least one presidential election cycle,” the analysis said. “This is important because presidential elections typically see the highest turnout and are the most visible elections administered.”
The analysis found that over the long term, election official turnover rates have been rising gradually in small jurisdictions, defined as areas with fewer than 100,000 voting-age residents. But large jurisdictions have experienced a more sudden jump in turnover.
Small jurisdictions had a 27% turnover rate in 2004 that had risen to 40% in 2024. But large jurisdictions enjoyed a turnover rate as low as 31% in 2018 before climbing rapidly to nearly 46% last year.

DemasMany Michigan localities expect to see harm from the loss of public funding, though few are preparing for cuts according to a recent survey from the University of Michigan Center for Local, State and Urban Policy. 
Released earlier this month, the survey examines city and county governments’ plans as funding from several major streams enacted during the administration of former President Joe Biden, including the American Rescue Plan Act, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, come to an end, with federal cuts to housing and transportation championed by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans also on the table. 
The survey included county, city, township and village officials from 1,328 jurisdictions across the state, with a 72% response rate. In their responses, 40% of local government officials said the loss or pause of one type of federal or state funding would pose problems.
Of that 40%,  72% of cities, 68% of counties, 46% of villages, and 30% of townships voiced concerns with the loss of funding.
Concerns were greater in communities facing high fiscal stress, with 6% of jurisdictions with high fiscal stress reporting that the loss of American Rescue Plan Act Funding would pose a significant problem, compared to 2% of communities with low fiscal stress. 
MPPS Federal Funding Infographic Spring 2025
Through the American Rescue Plan Act, Michigan’s counties received a collective $1.93 billion in federal funds, while 49 townships received $1.8 billion and a group of smaller cities, villages and townships received $664 million. Although governments were required to commit the funds to specific purposes by December 2024, and have until December 2026 to spend them, the Michigan Public Policy Survey has previously noted administrative challenges tied to procuring the funding and navigating bureaucracy. 
Despite these concerns, 60% of governments had not begun preparing for a loss of state or federal funding as of spring 2025. According to the survey, this includes 31% of counties, 42% of cities, 59% of villages and 66% of townships. 
“Both uncertainty as well as other internal local governmental capacity challenges are hindering some local governments from girding themselves for the coming drop in revenues that will impact their budgets and their service provision,” Debra Horner, the survey’s senior program manager, said in a statement. 
For local governments who are preparing for a loss in funding, 12% of jurisdictions focused on water and sewer infrastructure, with 14% focusing on other capital improvements, with both categories among the most commonly reported uses of ARPA funds. 
Eleven percent of jurisdictions were preparing for a loss of funding for public safety and economic development while 5% were preparing for a loss of funding on energy programs and infrastructure.

Brit McKenzie (center), R-Rogers, as he's sworn into his second term in the Arkansas House of Representatives on Jan. 13, 2025. (Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders named six new members to the State Library Board on Wednesday, in compliance with a law mandating an overhaul of the board.
In April, Sanders signed Act 903 of 2025, the culmination of Republican lawmakers’ attempts to exert control over the Arkansas State Library. The agency is under the umbrella of the state Department of Education but operates independently.
Act 903 gave Sanders up to 30 days after Aug. 5 to replace the entire seven-member board. Since taking office in 2023, Sanders had appointed three new board members as previous members’ staggered terms expired.
Sydney McKenzie of Rogers, wife of Republican Rep. Brit McKenzie, became the library board’s newest member earlier this year and was the only member Sanders reappointed Wednesday.
The other five appointees are Annette Bailey of Mountain Home, Clay Goff of Beebe, Jack Fortner of Yellville, Lynlee McMillan of Benton and Emmaline Pilkington of Knoxville.
Challenges to public library funding throughout Arkansas meet frustration, some resistance

A spokesperson for Sanders’ office said they would provide the Advocate a response when asked how soon a seventh appointment is expected. The response was not yet available by publication time.
The overhaul is part of the Republican legislative supermajority’s ongoing efforts to regulate public library leadership, funding and content. There have been similar conservative-led local efforts throughout the state in the past few years, including in Yellville and Benton.
McMillan is Sanders’ director of constituent services. Fortner is a former Republican state representative who served four terms before declining to run for reelection in 2024.
Like McKenzie, Pilkington is married to a sitting lawmaker, Knoxville GOP Rep. Aaron Pilkington. Bailey and her husband are the co-founders of Mountain Home’s Twin Lakes Baptist Church.
Goff is president of the Beebe School Board and a former chairman of the White County Regional Library System’s governing board. Beebe’s Goff Public Library is named after his father, Leroy Goff, a real estate agent who provided the labor to build the library, which opened in 2014 during his son’s tenure as library board chairman.
The Senate is required to confirm gubernatorial appointments. The new board is required by law to be in place by Sept. 3 and is expected to meet between then and Nov. 14, its next scheduled quarterly meeting.
Act 903 requires the seven new board members to draw lots determining how their terms will be staggered, ending between one and seven years from now. Subsequent appointees would serve seven-year terms, the usual length of time library board members serve.
The previous board members’ terms ended Oct. 18 each year. Now-former member Jo Ann Campbell of Fort Smith would have reached the end of her term two months from now and cleared the way for a 4-3 majority of Sanders appointees.
The other board members replaced by Act 903 were Pam Meridith of Cherokee Village, Lupe Peña de Martinez of Mabelvale and Board Chairwoman Deborah Knox of Mountain Home.

Arkansas Senate approves State Library Board overhaul after dissolution bill fails


 The buildup to Act 903

Shari Bales of Hot Springs, one of Sanders’ other two appointees on the previous board, told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette earlier this month that she hoped to be reappointed.
Bales was among the previous board’s majority that consistently voted down efforts from Sanders’ third appointee, former Republican state Sen. Jason Rapert, to withhold state funds from libraries where children can access certain content. The board’s primary responsibility is to disburse state funds to local public libraries.
Rapert repeatedly called for the abolition of the board for rejecting his efforts to “protect children.” Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Jonesboro, sponsored a bill with this purpose during the 2025 legislative session.
In March, Sullivan asked the board to pass two motions to ensure its survival: to create nonbinding policies to protect children from “sexually explicit” content in libraries and to separate the State Library from the American Library Association. Conservatives frequently mention LGBTQ+ topics and sex education when decrying “sexually explicit” material, and they also claim the American Library Association has a left-wing agenda.
All three Sanders appointees supported the motions, but the other four members voted them down. By the same split vote, the board passed a separate motion aimed at protecting children in libraries while honoring the First Amendment and library material selection standards.

House panel rejects proposal to dissolve Arkansas State Library and Board

 

Sullivan responded by filing a bill that would have abolished the State Library as a whole and directed its responsibilities to the Department of Education. The bill passed the Senate but failed in a House committee. Act 903 was filed hours later and hit no roadblocks during the legislative process.
In 2023, Sullivan sponsored a law that would have given local elected officials the final say over whether to relocate challenged library materials some consider “obscene” and made librarians legally liable for disseminating such materials. A federal judge blocked portions of the law on First Amendment grounds, and the state is appealing the ruling.
Rapert asked his fellow State Library Board members this year and last year to withhold funding from the libraries that are plaintiffs in the ongoing litigation; the rest of the board repeatedly declined.
Rapert did not attend the previous board’s final meeting after Act 903 became law.

Medicaid is the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. For families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford private insurance, CHIP is a public program that provides low-cost health coverage for their children.
The feds will begin sending Pennsylvania and other states monthly enrollment reports that identify people with Medicaid or CHIP whose immigration or citizenship status can’t be confirmed through federal databases. States are then responsible for verifying the citizenship or immigration status of individuals in those reports. States are expected to take “appropriate actions when necessary, including adjusting coverage or enforcing non-citizen eligibility rules,” according to a CMS press release.

“We are tightening oversight of enrollment to safeguard taxpayer dollars and guarantee that these vital programs serve only those who are truly eligible under the law,” Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who oversees CMS as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said in a press release announcing the new program.
As of April, roughly 71 million adults and children nationwide have Medicaid coverage, while another 7 million children have insurance through CHIP. Immigrants under age 65 are less likely to be covered by Medicaid than U.S.-born citizens, according to an analysis from health research organization KFF.
States scramble to shield hospitals from GOP Medicaid cuts

Immigrants who are in the country illegally aren’t eligible for federally funded Medicaid and CHIP. Only citizens and certain lawfully present immigrants — green card holders and refugees, for example — can qualify.
But some states have chosen to expand Medicaid coverage for immigrants with their own funds. Pennsylvania and 22 other states offer pregnancy-related care regardless of citizenship or immigration status, according to KFF. Fourteen states provide coverage for children in low-income families regardless of immigration status, while seven states offer coverage to some adults regardless of status.
The tax and spending package President Donald Trump last month cuts federal spending on Medicaid by more than $1 trillion, leaving states to either make up the difference with their own funds or reduce coverage. But the new law also includes restrictions on coverage for certain immigrants, including stripping eligibility from refugees and asylum-seekers.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)As historic drought conditions on the Western Slope fuel another dangerous wildfire season, a new paper from researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder warns that human-caused climate change is playing a major role in making those conditions worse.
Previously published climatological research has found that the Colorado River Basin’s current “megadrought” is the worst dry spell the region has experienced in at least 1,200 years. But a new study, published last week in the journal Nature, concludes that those persistently dry conditions are being driven by human activity “more intensely — and more directly — than previously understood,” its authors say.
Jeremy Klavans and Pedro DiNezio of CU Boulder’s Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences worked with other scientists from around the country to model how global climate patterns affect rainfall across the U.S. southwest.



Their findings concern a climate pattern known as the Pacific decadal oscillation. Related to the better-known El Niño-La Niña cycle to the south, the PDO is a natural fluctuation that brings warm water to the northeastern Pacific Ocean near the U.S. West Coast during its “positive” phase, leading to more storms and higher-than-average rainfall. During its “negative” phase, however, cooler water and air temperatures result in less precipitation in Western states.
Despite typically reversing itself every one or two decades, the PDO has been “stuck” in the negative, dry phase since the 1990s. By analyzing more than 500 climate model simulations developed by climatologists around the world, the study’s authors were able to paint the clearest picture yet of the influence of human activity on the PDO, and the resulting Southwestern megadrought.
“All of them had this common signal when we averaged them together,” DiNezio said in an interview. “By having so many simulations, we could be absolutely sure that this was not an artifact of a single model, or of a subset of simulations.”
Severe drought conditions have persisted in the Colorado River Basin since 2000, putting increased stress on the water supplies relied on by about 40 million people in Colorado and six other Western states. Water levels in two key reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, have fallen to record lows in recent years.












What's important here is that we're showing that rainfall has also been influenced by humans, in addition to just evaporation ... Both contribute to drought.


– Pedro DiNezio, researcher with CU Boulder's Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences




Rising levels of greenhouse gases, mostly the result of fossil-fuel combustion, have caused much of western Colorado and neighboring states in the Colorado River’s Upper Basin to warm by an average of more than 4 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data.
Prior research has attributed about 40% of the post-2000 megadrought to higher temperatures alone, as hotter weather leads to greater evaporation of moisture from water surfaces and soils. Modeling global warming’s precise impacts on rainfall patterns has proved more elusive, but DiNezio said the new research “add(s) more human influence to that previous number.”
“What’s important here is that we’re showing that rainfall has also been influenced by humans, in addition to just evaporation,” he said. “Both contribute to drought.”
Colorado and other states that are parties to the 103-year-old Colorado River Compact have negotiated for years over how to distribute the cuts to water use made necessary by the basin’s ongoing drought. The federal Bureau of Reclamation on Friday announced another year of reduced water allocations for the Lower Basin states of Arizona and Nevada.
Not long ago, the possibility that the Pacific decadal oscillation would eventually reverse itself offered hope that the long-term drought outlook for the U.S. Southwest wasn’t as bad as it seemed. Instead, evidence now suggests the last two decades are the region’s “new normal.”
“I was a Ph.D. student in 2012, and there was a consensus that eventually (the PDO) was going to flip,” DiNezio. “We had a big El Niño in 2015, and there was this idea that El Niño will flip the PDO back to the opposite, rainfall-producing phase. And we had that big El Niño event, and the PDO remained stuck. We just had an El Niño event in 2023 … and (it) also didn’t flip the PDO.”
“That’s the most important implication of  our findings,” he added. “That this drought is here to stay, unless we we do something about rising temperatures and global warming.”

Prospective developers seeking to build stations in Wisconsin and share in the state’s federal grant have until Sept. 5 to submit their proposals, according to the Wisconsin Department of Transportation.
Wisconsin was one of the first states to take part in the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) project, part of the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.
“Our state DOT was incredibly proactive” in participating in the program, Amy Barilleaux, communications director for Clean Wisconsin, told the Wisconsin Examiner.
The state’s allotment was $78 million and 53 projects were awarded with the funds in May 2024, a state DOT spokesperson said. The department signed 39 agreements accounting for $16 million before the program was frozen earlier this year; eight projects have been completed and five are under construction.
Countermanding the push to reduce reliance on fossil fuels that have been associated with worsening climate change, President Donald Trump issued executive orders promoting fossil fuels and attempting to block measures to promote renewable energy that were enacted during former President Joe Biden’s administration.
One of Trump’s first such orders, on the day he took office, froze NEVI funding that had not been committed to projects by then.
“It should have never been paused in the first place,” Barrilleaux said. “This was money that was allocated by Congress that was ours to spend under this program.”
Wisconsin along with more than a dozen other states and the District of Columbia sued to restore the NEVI grants. A federal judge in June blocked the Trump administration from freezing the grants or withholding the money from the 14 states and D.C. that joined the lawsuit.
Barrilleaux noted that by joining the lawsuit, Wisconsin was able to benefit from the ruling that released the money.
U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy issued new guidance for the grants Aug. 11. The new guidance eliminates various provisions in the original federal program, including specifications that emphasized using renewable energy, required consumer protections and required engagement with rural, underserved and disadvantaged communities.
“While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress’ will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently,” Duffy wrote in a statement.
“It’s good that we’re getting back to building out this infrastructure,” said Ben Behlke, clean technology programs manager for Renew Wisconsin. “This is a great opportunity for us to solve ‘the chicken or the egg’ issue as it relates to making charging available as adoption of electric vehicles becomes more prevalent. Beyond making this technology more accessible, electrifying our transportation is a necessary part of our effort to create a clean energy economy.”

The nearby Yellowstone, Madison, and Big Hole Rivers offer world-renowned trout fishing, and top ski areas are within easy reach; Big Sky Resort lies just 45 miles to the south, and Bridger Bowl is a mere 15-minute drive.
“While it’s true that this is a beautiful state and a wonderful place to live, it is not just the mountains that make people want to move here,” said Timaree Driscoll, a mother of six and newly elected president of King Arthur Park Tenant Union, representing a mobile home community located just outside Bozeman. “It is not just the blue-ribbon trout streams that make Montana ‘The Treasure State.’ We are Montana. We are the treasure.”
Driscoll stood before roughly 50 residents of King Arthur and Mountain Meadows parks on Thursday, as the group publicly launched their majority unions and called on Billings-based owner Gary Oakland to give them the chance to purchase the land that sits beneath their homes. 
“We are the salt of the earth,” Driscoll continued. “We are the value in this land.” 
  Bozeman’s Housing Crisis

Bozeman has made headlines in recent years for its increasingly extreme cost of housing. A 2024 report from the National Association of Realtors ranked Montana’s housing as the least affordable in the entire country. As of August, the Economic Research Institute puts Bozeman’s cost of living at 17% higher than the average Montana city, and the Bozeman Real Estate Group currently lists the average price of a single-family home in Bozeman at $911,150. 
Mobile home parks remain one of the few options for affordable housing in Bozeman, but that option is quickly dwindling, with only 15 current listings on MHBO.com. The 338 sites in King Arthur and Mountain Meadows parks make up about one-third of the valley’s mobile home park supply. 
“Purchasing my home here was literally the only way I could afford to stay in this valley, and maybe the state, because the entire state is expensive,” Driscoll told the Daily Montanan. “And at this point, I cannot move my home. It’s a double-wide trailer with an addition, and it’s from like 1978 or something. There’s nowhere that house is going. It would be an enormous financial loss. Having to uproot my children and move them somewhere else because I can’t afford to be here would be devastating.” 
While Oakland did not respond to Daily Montanan’s requests for comment, he told the Bozeman Chronicle “This is a good-sized business, and any organization that is going to pay good money for it is going to want to grow it and make it better and make improvements.” 
However, as Montanans have sometimes seen, the purchase of these parks by private equity firms often results in the opposite, such as a severe degradation of services and drastically increased lot rents, at times up to 138%. 
“We’ve seen private equity purchase mobile home parks like mine, drive up the prices, displace residents, leaving infrastructure crumbling and long-time residents to lose the equity they have managed to build,” said resident Sara Folger, one of the elected bargaining team members for the Mountain Meadows Tenant Union. “We are here today to ask Gary Oakland to sell to us as a collective to create a Resident Owned Community.” 
  Mountain Meadows resident and elected Bargaining Team Member Sara Folger speaks on behalf of the majority unions of Mountain Meadows and King Arthur parks. Gallatin County, Montana. Aug. 14(Photo by Jenna Martin for the Daily Montanan).
A Resident Owned Community is a model where residents jointly own the land and infrastructure instead of relying on a single landlord or corporate owner. Montana currently has 22 Resident Owned Communities. The nearest ROC to Bozeman is Stan’s Garden, formerly Belgrade Village, which officially became an resident-owned community in February 2024. 
“Working people struggle to pay rent, to buy groceries, to care for kids and healthcare all while doing the physically difficult jobs with long hours, while being exploited every step of the way,” continued Folger. “Either the struggle will get worse for the residents of these parks or this can be a moment where we get a chance to create a future of ownership, equity, and peace of mind.” 
  Organizing The Community 

When King Arthur Park resident Cindy Smith found out about the sale of the park on July 16, she contacted Bozeman Tenant’s Union Organizer Emily LaShelle, who is now Organizing Director and Lead Organizer of the King Arthur Park and Mountain Meadows. Smith had previously tried to organize King Arthur Park into a Resident Owned Community roughly a year ago, said LaShelle, but it hadn’t gotten traction at the time, so Smith had been organizing with the citywide tenant union and was a leader on the strategy team.

“She is a phenomenal leader,” said LaShelle. “So when she called and told me that her park was up for sale and that she wanted to unionize it, I knew she was serious.” 
LaShelle, Smith and a few others met on July 21 to make a plan. They created a petition, which has now garnered 150 community supporters, including all three Gallatin County Commissioners, all five Bozeman city commissioners, and 11 bipartisan legislators. Residents spoke with NeighborWorks about the possibility of making a bid, and by July 26 they had a four-hour training session with 15 people about how to have organizing conversations with neighbors. 
“Then we just went out and started talking to neighbors and saying, ‘Is this something that people want?’” said LaShelle. “The response was overwhelmingly in favor.” 
On July 29, residents met at Town and Country, an employee-owned grocery story . 
“We thought there’d be like 30 people who would show up. There was 75. We were way too big for the space,” LaShelle said. “There were people shoulder to shoulder, we had to really apologize to Town and Country. Shout out to Town and Country staff.” 
The union card drive began that night, as well as elections for the bargaining team, with positions such as presidents, secretaries and treasurers. Smith was elected as a member of the King Arthur Tenant Union Bargaining team. 
Just 12 days later, residents had gathered the requisite 51% of signatures required to unionize, and beat the deadline for a bid. 
“I’m in awe,” said Driscoll. “I’m in awe of the effort and the dedication and the kindness. That took a lot of work. People were stretched thin, and they were continuously kind and warm and encouraging. For me, it’s just been deeply inspiring. I wish we had done this earlier. We’re in good hands with each other.” 
That has led to a direct ask of the owner, Gary Oakland. 
“We own our mobile homes; we only rent the land underneath. We have grown flowers, gardens, decorative landscaping, raspberry bushes and our families here,” said Smith. “We are asking you, Mr. Oakland, to leave our community with us. Sell this land to us, the people who love and care for it.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/JennaMartin-0122-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-20 13:57:18.553607

(Photo courtesy NMED) The New Mexico Environment Department’s installation of new pre-treatment equipment for the City of Las Vegas’ drinking water supply should offer at least some reassurance to residents the next time they see storm clouds gather on the horizon, a department official told Source New Mexico this week.
The Environment Department recently took over almost all the Northern New Mexico town’s work to replace its water treatment facility, a necessity after the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire in summer 2022. 
During the fire, sediment turned the Gallinas River black as it flowed through town, and the city and other areas in and around the burn scar have seen repeated floods ever since the fire. 
Because the United States Forest Service started the blaze, Congress approved more than $5 billion to compensate fire victims, and specifically included $140 million to the city for a brand new water treatment system. A year ago, the city received $98 million of that.
But repeated flood events last summer and earlier this year, as well as a complete water shutoff in the city this winter, prompted the city to enter into a “joint governmental agreement” with three state agencies in hopes of fast-tracking the new system. 
Legislative Recap Feb. 21: Why Las Vegas isn’t celebrating Las Vegas Day at the Roundhouse

The agreement, which all the parties signed off on early last month, empowers the state’s finance, disaster response and environmental departments to “plan, design, procure, construct, test, deliver, and close out a temporary water treatment facility and a permanent water treatment facility” in the city, according to a copy of the agreement. 
The city keeps control of the $98 million it received, along with other federal and state grants and loans it has received as part of the replacement project. Its main job is to pay for all the work the state does, according to the agreement.
On Tuesday, state environment officials announced that they’d successfully completed a half-dozen projects that aim to improve the city’s water filtration system and ensure the public is kept in the loop on what they’re drinking. 
One of the most important improvements is the installation of temporary “pre-treatment” equipment at the city’s water treatment plant, said Jonas Armstrong, director of NMED’s Water Protection Division, in an interview Tuesday afternoon with Source. The city procured the equipment, which removes extra sediment and debris in high-turbidity or runoff events, last year. 
“[The city was] having some issues earlier this year with getting it connected and making sure it was operating correctly,” Armstrong said. “We’ve worked through that with them in the last couple months, and it’s connected now and ready to go. So that’s a big improvement.”
Las Vegas to get $98 million to replace water treatment facilities after 2022 wildfire damage

The state has also begun upgrades to filters at the existing facility; replaced a vacuum system that removes scum and floating debris from the Gallinas River; and built a sediment pond near a reservoir to reduce flooding and contamination risks, according to a news release Tuesday. 
Armstrong deferred questions about the costs of the improvements to the city, including how much of the $98 million the city received last year has been spent. A spokesperson for the city did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. 
While the state does not expect to begin construction on the new facility until next year at the earliest, Armstrong said the changes should offer a measure of comfort to Las Vegas residents who’ve seen their drinking water supply repeatedly compromised due to floods and equipment failures.
“I think the pre-treatment system being brought online and ready to go at the flip of a switch is a big advancement, and an assurance that the shutdowns and the restrictions that have happened in the last couple of years should not happen again,” Armstrong said.
Armstrong said the joint agreement has been “really collaborative so far,” with the state drawing on local knowledge about how best to tailor the project to the city’s needs. When it’s finally built, the new water treatment system will be a “generational asset,” given the adequate funding and the state’s technical expertise, he said. 
“This existing facility is 50-plus years old and needs to be replaced, and having the federal funds and the state funds to do it is a huge opportunity for the city and the people of Las Vegas,” he said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/New-Pretreatment-System-—-Courtesy-City-of-Las-Vegas-1-1024x461.jpg,,,2025-08-20 13:57:18.553607

(Photo by Spenser Heaps/Utah News Dispatch) Election officials turned over at the highest rate in at least a quarter century during the last presidential election, according to new research from the Bipartisan Policy Center.
An analysis of shifts in election officials published Tuesday found nearly 41% of election officials administering the 2024 election were different than those in 2020. Turnover has accelerated over the past two decades, rising from about 28% in 2004 to 40.9% last year.
The growing percentage of departing election officials comes after years of challenges. They navigated the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as well as harassment and false conspiracy theories surrounding stolen elections that persist today.
The analysis released by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based group that seeks to foster policy cooperation across party lines, represents an updated version of a report that previously examined turnover from 2004 to 2022. The new research, which extends the data through 2024, shows the turnover rate continued to climb.
Wanted: Poll workers. Must love democracy.

The change means that, over time, election officials have less experience. The research found that the share of chief local election officials with six or more years in their role has dropped from 60% in 2006 to 47% in 2024.
But last year, 60% of election officials had previously overseen the administration of a presidential election in their jurisdiction.
“Despite increasing turnover and loss of experience, the majority of chief election officials still have experience running at least one presidential election cycle,” the analysis said. “This is important because presidential elections typically see the highest turnout and are the most visible elections administered.”
The analysis found that over the long term, election official turnover rates have been rising gradually in small jurisdictions, defined as areas with fewer than 100,000 voting-age residents. But large jurisdictions have experienced a more sudden jump in turnover.
Small jurisdictions had a 27% turnover rate in 2004 that had risen to 40% in 2024. But large jurisdictions enjoyed a turnover rate as low as 31% in 2018 before climbing rapidly to nearly 46% last year.

A Morrisville man has been arrested and charged with murder in the death of a Hardwick woman two months ago in Vermont.
Michael A. Williams, 60, was taken into custody Tuesday afternoon, according to Vermont State Police. Williams is facing charges of aggravated domestic assault and second-degree murder in the killing of Tina Daigle, 38, who authorities said was strangled to death, according to police.
Williams is set to appear Wednesday afternoon in Caledonia County Superior criminal court in St. Johnsbury to be arraigned on the charges. He was held overnight in custody without bail pending his arraignment. 
Daigle was killed in Caledonia County on June 19, according to state police. Her body was left and then discovered on the side of Route 14 in Woodbury. 
Police have released few details about the investigation leading to Williams arrest Tuesday. More information is expected to be made public Wednesday following his arraignment, when an affidavit of probable cause in support of the charges against him becomes public.

The resolution, which was approved by a unanimous vote, requires CTECS to provide the Connecticut State Department of Education with quarterly updates about the school’s admissions, student withdrawals, and other changes to student enrollment related to special education students.
The resolution follows a report by Michael McKeon, the lawyer for the education department, which confirmed that the admissions process at CTECS, which denied admission to nearly 160 students in the 2024-25 school year, was a “clear violation of federal and state law.”
Former leadership at CTECS used what they called “safety review panels” in the admissions process, which gauged whether potential students posed a safety risk. A department investigation found the panels denied admission to students who received disciplinary infractions at their previous schools — including for things like vaping — and disproportionately kept students with disabilities out of the CTECS system.
At Wednesday’s meeting, McKeon said that he was also concerned by his findings that a large number of students withdrew from the schools for no clear reason. While some students left because they felt the program wasn’t a good fit for them, and some left when their family moved out of the area, others simply left without explanation.
“One has to wonder if students were routinely counseled out,” McKeon said. Of the students who withdrew without explanation McKeon said a third had disabilities. That’s “a troubling percentage,” he said, “and seems to underscore idea that they were being targeted and essentially exited from CTECS system.”
McKeon said that many of the students who were denied tried to appeal the decision. 
“Sixty seven of the 158 appealed, because there was an appeal process. Everyone was denied. This was a process that seemed to have offered no real opportunity,” for students who were appealing the decision, he said.
“This was, needless to say, a problematic and illegal process,” McKeon said. 
At Wednesday’s meeting, the system’s new executive director Alice Pritchard spoke to the board, saying that CTECS has since implemented a truly blind lottery for its spots. McKeon thanked Pritchard for her help with providing needed documentation to review what exactly had happened at the school under previous leadership.
Pritchard said, “It’s never pleasant to be called out for bad behavior, but we do appreciate it, because we know that students deserve better than that.”

Fueled by hot summer weather and persistent drought conditions across the western half of the state, wildfires as of Aug. 20 had burned more than 200,000 acres in Colorado in 2025.
It’s Colorado’s worst fire year since 2020, when multiple historic blazes burned a record-setting 625,357 acres, according to National Interagency Fire Center data.
Drought conditions classified as “severe” or “extreme” extend nearly all of the Western Slope, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. A large area covering most of Garfield and Rio Blanco counties is now considered to be in “exceptional” drought, the monitor’s most severe classification. A critical fire weather advisory for western Colorado and several neighboring states has been issued by the Rocky Mountain Area Coordination Center, a Denver-based branch of the NIFC, and will remain in place through at least Aug. 27.

“After a dry winter with minimal snowpack fuel moistures are well below normal, and much of the region is under severe to extreme drought,” the agency warns. “Extreme fire behavior marked by rapid spread, torching, and resistance to control is being driven by critically dry … fuels, and drought-stressed brush and trees. As heat intensifies and fuel moistures decline further, fire potential will remain elevated across the area.”
Here is a look at three 2025 Colorado fires:

The Lee Fire, west of the town of Meeker in Rio Blanco County, has burned an estimated 137,755 acres with 68% containment as of Aug. 20. It was caused by lightning on Aug. 2.
The nearby Elk Fire, southeast of Meeker, was also caused by lightning on Aug. 2. It burned an estimated 14,518 acres and is 100% contained.
The Turner Gulch Fire, east of Gateway near the Colorado-Utah border in Mesa County, is 79% contained and has burned an estimated 31,698 acres since it was started by lightning on July 12.

Gov. Jared Polis has issued a broad emergency declaration covering fires burning in multiple counties and the risk of new fires as the state faces “continued high temperatures, high winds, severe to extreme drought conditions, and near record level fire indices.”
Due to climate change, much of Colorado has grown hotter and drier in recent decades, increasing wildfire risk. The three largest wildfires in Colorado history all occurred in 2020, and the state’s 20 biggest fires on record have all occurred in the past 20 years. Rising levels of greenhouse gases, mostly the result of fossil-fuel combustion, have caused much of the Western Slope to warm by an average of more than 4 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels, and the region’s current “megadrought” is its worst dry spell in at least 1,200 years.
Most wildfires are caused by human activity. To minimize the risk of sparking a fire, authorities urge visitors to national forests and other public lands to follow local fire restrictions, ensure that vehicles are properly maintained and trailer chains are secured, and avoid driving or parking on dry grass.
In 2017, the State Forest Service reported that more than 2.9 million Coloradans lived in the “wildland-urban interface” — areas at risk of being impacted by wildfires. Fire safety experts urge residents of such zones to familiarize themselves with the “Ready, Set, Go” system of precautions.

Mandatory evacuations have been ordered after a new wildfire grew rapidly in a remote area of northwestern Eagle County on Tuesday.
The Derby Fire was estimated at 839 acres as of 11:30 p.m. Tuesday, having more than tripled in size over the previous 24 hours, and continued to grow overnight, officials said. It was first reported on Sunday near Sweetwater Lake, about 15 miles northwest of Gypsum, and is believed to have been caused by lightning.
The Eagle County Sheriff’s Office has ordered residents in several zones along the Colorado River to the east of the fire to evacuate by midday Wednesday. Other areas nearby have been placed on pre-evacuation notices. Up-to-date evacuation information is available on Eagle County’s emergency information website.
U.S. Forest Service officials have closed the area of the White River National Forest where the Derby Fire is burning until further notice.
About 80 personnel were assigned to the Derby Fire as of Wednesday, and a federal incident command team assumed control of firefighting efforts as of 6 a.m.  No containment has yet been achieved on the fire, whose “remote location makes access very difficult,” officials said.
“We’re currently cooperating with the local agencies that have initially attacked this fire,” Philip Knaub, operations section chief for the team assigned to the fire, said. “We started yesterday afternoon with our own personnel, gathering intelligence and checking out the roads, checking out all the houses, looking at the structures and what might be needed in order to protect them.”
“As far as the fire goes, we do have a slew of aircraft — we’ll have helicopters and we’ll have air tankers working on that fire today, applying retardant and water where it’s most beneficial,” he added.

Human emissions driving Colorado River ‘megadrought,’ CU Boulder research finds


By: Chase Woodruff - Monday August 18, 2025 4:00 am





As historic drought conditions on the Western Slope fuel another dangerous wildfire season, a new paper from researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder warns that human-caused climate change is playing a major role in making those conditions worse.
Previously published climatological research has found that the Colorado River Basin’s current “megadrought” is the worst dry spell the region has experienced in at least 1,200 years. But a new study, published last week in the journal Nature,  concludes that those persistently dry conditions are being driven by human activity “more intensely — and more directly — than previously understood,” its authors say.
A 2022 study attributed about 40% of the megadrought to higher temperatures alone, as hotter weather leads to greater evaporation of moisture from water surfaces and soils. Modeling global warming’s precise impacts on rainfall patterns has proved more elusive, but Pedro DiNezio, an associate professor at CU Boulder’s Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, said the new paper “add(s) more human influence to that previous number.”
“What’s important here is that we’re showing that rainfall has also been influenced by humans, in addition to just evaporation,” said DiNezio. “Both contribute to drought.”

Polis declares emergency over ‘near record level’ Colorado fire danger


By: Chase Woodruff - Friday August 15, 2025 9:23 am





Colorado Gov. Jared Polis on Thursday issued a broad emergency declaration covering multiple wildfires currently burning on the Western Slope and the risk of new fires as dangerous weather conditions persist in the coming weeks.
More than 2,000 local, state and federal personnel are currently battling nine large fires in Colorado, including the Lee Fire in Rio Blanco County, which as of Friday ranked as the fifth-largest fire in state history at an estimated size of 133,602 acres. Polis said in a press release that Thursday’s executive order declaring an emergency would “bolster our ability to jump on fires early” as elevated fire risk continues.
“Continuing throughout July and into August, and as part of the same prolonged weather pattern, parts of Colorado have experienced continued high temperatures, high winds, severe to extreme drought conditions, and near record level fire indices,” the order says. “Elevated fire weather and fire risk is forecast for the coming weeks.”

Crosho Fire breaks out in Rio Blanco County, burns 300 acres


By: Delilah Brumer - Tuesday August 12, 2025 4:13 pm





As the Lee and Elk fires continue to blaze in Rio Blanco County, a new fire sparked near the county’s border with Routt County on Monday night, officials reported. The new fire, near Crosho Lake and about 22 miles southwest of Steamboat Springs, has burned about 300 acres.
Evacuation orders were issued for campgrounds surrounding Crosho Lake, and pre-evacuation orders were issued for nearby areas. About 110 firefighters were on scene as of Tuesday morning, and no structures were immediately threatened, according to an update from Routt County officials.

Containment of the Lee Fire west of Meeker has dropped slightly to 6%, compared to its 7% containment Monday. A Tuesday morning map of the fire, which is the fifth-largest in state history, showed 116,859 acres burned. That’s more than 3,000 new acres burned since Monday.
The Lee Fire started in Rio Blanco County and has spread toward Rifle in Garfield County, pushed by strong winds and dry conditions.
During a community meeting at Colorado Mountain College on Monday night, incident meteorologist Rose Schoenfeld said smoke conditions are expected to improve in Rifle throughout Tuesday as winds change. But fire crews still face challenges ahead, especially moving into Wednesday, Schoenfeld added.
“Wednesday is really the day to watch with regards to fire weather,” Schoenfeld said. “Wednesday is going to be warmer, and it’s going to be more of an unstable atmosphere.”
“In the past 30 days, we have gotten 5% of the normal precipitation, putting the area in extreme drought,” she added.

Lee Fire becomes 5th largest in Colorado history as Oak Fire burns to the south


By: Delilah Brumer - Monday August 11, 2025 12:19 pm





The Lee Fire near the town of Meeker in Rio Blanco County has grown to be the fifth-largest wildfire in state history as crews continued to battle fires in several parts of Colorado on Monday.
Dry weather and strong winds have pushed the Lee Fire south toward Garfield County, blazing through more than 113,000 acres. It was at 7% containment as of Monday. The fire was believed to have been caused by lightning on Aug. 2.
The state’s newest wildfire, the Oak Fire, sparked Sunday west of Pagosa Springs in Archuleta County. The blaze prompted mandatory evacuations in Elk Park and pre-evacuation orders in other nearby areas.

The Lee Fire in Rio Blanco County prompted the evacuation Saturday of all 179 people incarcerated in the Rifle Correctional Center, according to the Colorado Department of Corrections.
Evacuees from the minimum security prison at about 10:30 p.m. were relocated to the state prison in Buena Vista. No injuries were reported.
Staff members remained on site in Rifle working with emergency management personnel to “safeguard the facility and property,” according to a press release from the Department of Corrections.
The fire as of midday Sunday had grown to about 107,000 acres.









Western Slope wildfires already add up to Colorado’s worst fire year since 2020


By: Chase Woodruff - Wednesday August 6, 2025 2:23 pm





High winds and extreme drought conditions in northwest Colorado have fueled the rapid growth of two wildfires this week near Meeker in Rio Blanco County, where firefighting crews say they’re prioritizing structure protection with “limited resources” on hand.
The Lee Fire, west of Meeker, nearly doubled in size Tuesday and has now burned 22,497 acres, predominantly on Bureau of Land Management land south of Colorado Highway 13. About 20 miles to the east, the Elk Fire is estimated at 8,304 acres in size. Both fires are believed to have been started by lightning strikes on Aug. 2.
With the latest growth, the estimated area burned in Colorado by 11 major wildfires in 2025 now stands at 64,196 acres, according to federal data. That doesn’t include smaller fires suppressed by state and local first responders, but it already makes for the state’s worst fire year since 2020.

Turner Gulch wildfire nears 14K acres in western Colorado


By: Sara Wilson - Wednesday July 16, 2025 3:27 pm





The Turner Gulch wildfire near Unaweep Canyon northeast of Gateway is burning about 14,000 acres as of Wednesday afternoon.
“This fire remains active and continues to make significant advances to the east as winds become aligned with the terrain. Fire officials are developing a strategy to protect values while providing for safety of firefighters and the public,” said a Wednesday afternoon update from the Rocky Mountain Complex Incident Management Team 1.
The fire was caused by lightning on July 10. Winds have stoked the blaze in recent days.

Alabas Farhat (D-Dearborn). July 24, 2025 | Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceA key Republican legislator announced Tuesday that the Michigan House of Representatives’ full budget plan could land as soon as next week, but hours later, Republican House Speaker Matt Hall gave that pronouncement a swift kick to the knees, publicly contradicting his own appropriations chair.
In a news conference hosted Wednesday by Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids), the leader and her Democratic colleagues called Hall’s continued antics on the budget “unprecedented chaos.”
The already tense and befuddling budget fight hit a new point of confusion when Republican House Appropriations Chair Rep. Ann Bollin of Brighton announced Tuesday morning that the chamber was nearing atmospheric reentry on its long-awaited budget proposal to fund the whole of state government.
Bollin estimated that the plan could land soon, possibly next week, giving the politically fractured Michigan Legislature a chance to get schools the money they need by Labor Day and to possibly avoid a government shutdown. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Bollin’s apparent optimism was dashed just hours later when Hall, on the House floor, told reporters that he too thought Bollin was optimistic, at best. Gongwer News Service, a Lansing-based legislative intelligence service and newsletter, reported that Hall was eyeing a Sept. 30 delivery date, which is the constitutional deadline to have a budget passed. The speaker told reporters that the longer time table was necessary because archconservative state Rep. Matt Maddock of Milford, who is the vice chair of the House Appropriations Committee, supposedly identified additional “waste, fraud and abuse” that needed to be addressed.
A message seeking comment from Bollin’s office was not returned at the time of publication.
In a regularly scheduled news conference held Wednesday by Brinks, which was planned to discuss the budget holdup, the Senate’s leader said Hall’s back and forth with his own appropriations chair was “truly unbelievable.” 
“Imagine my incredulity when I read a press release from the House appropriations chair saying they are preparing to announce a budget plan and then her own speaker undercut her shortly thereafter and said he’ll need even more time,” Brinks said. “I will reiterate that the stakes could not be higher. While the new school year is already underway for many districts all over the state, schools still do not have the security of state funding to responsibly determine their own budgets.”
If uncertainty was the goal, Brinks said House Republicans were working to make that a reality for every school in Michigan.
Joining Brinks were other Senate Democrats including Sen. Jeremy Moss of Southfield, Sen. Sam Singh of East Lansing and Sen. Kevin Hertel of St. Clair Shores.
In a quip most timely, Moss said that even fans of Taylor Swift had more clarity on her latest release than those watching the budget process in Michigan.
“It’s been three or four months of them telling all of you that they’re dropping their budget next week,” Moss said. “Even Taylor Swift, when she says the album is dropping at 12:12 a.m., the album drops at 12:12 a.m. House Republicans don’t believe in the same philosophy.”
Communication breakdown: No end to budget impasse in sight as leaders spend day throwing jabs

Moss went on to detail the various Senate bills the chamber has sent over to the House this session, aside from the pending budget. Hall has refused to act on many of them, saying the bills were either unready or needed more work. Moss bristled at that assertion, and used his long-sought Freedom of Information Act reform legislation as an example.
The Legislature and the governor’s office are currently shielded from Michigan’s FOIA, and Moss and colleagues from across the aisle have endeavored to change that, multiple times. The legislation has yet to cross the finish line despite those attempts. The recurring work on the bills shows Moss that the FOIA legislation, in particular, was not unripe for the picking.
“I can tell you who benefits without this being in the law, officials who have something to hide,” Moss said. “These are perfectly written bills. They don’t even need to be fixed.”
Moss then read the names of all the Republicans who previously voted for FOIA reform, including Hall.
The bills were reintroduced this session and passed out of the Senate earlier this year nearly unanimously. They are now collecting dust in the House.
“Where the hell are these people?” Moss said. “So, you want bills passed? You want budgets passed? Half of this building is doing its damn job. It’s time for the House to come to the table and join us to work on behalf of the people of Michigan.”
Brinks’ solution to breaking the impasse was to remain engaged in the whole budget process and to continue putting the onus on Hall’s caucus to do their jobs.
“Our plan is to bring the best resources of our caucus and of the Senate as a whole to the table and to expect that, at some point, he has to reciprocate and join us there,” Brinks said. “We will continue to raise the pressure on him to do that, because the stakes are so high, particularly with this budget.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSC_0159-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-20 13:57:18.553607
,Mississippi Today,2025-08-20 17:20:51+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Mississippi unemployment holds steady, ‘no hire, no fire’",Katherine Lin,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/20/mississippi-unemployment-steady-labor-force-participation/,Mississippi's state economist believes that the rise in real wages and decrease in inflation at the end of 2023 may have motivated people who were not working or looking for work to rejoin the labor force.,"Mississippi’s July unemployment rate held steady for a fourth straight month. 
And while Mississippi saw the largest increase in unemployment in the country year over year at 0.9%, that’s not necessarily bad news.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics on Tuesday published updated state employment numbers that showed Mississippi’s unemployment rate at 4.0% from May through July. The national unemployment rate was 4.2% in July. 

“What we’re seeing is kind of a continuation of what we’ve seen for the past few months. In Mississippi as well as across the country, it seems to be kind of a no-hire, no-fire labor market,” said Corey Miller, Mississippi’s state economist. 
The increase in unemployment is likely due to a 1% increase in the labor force. Miller believes that the rise in real wages and decrease in inflation at the end of 2023 may have motivated people who were not working or looking for work to rejoin the labor force.
Mary Willoughby, Mississippi Department of Employment Security chief economist, said that Mississippi’s unemployment rate has historically been above the national number but for the past few years it has been below. For Willoughby this is an encouraging sign.
“Mississippi’s labor market is in good shape. It’s very stable and doing a good job,” said Willoughby.  
Labor force participation, those 16 and older either employed or actively seeking employment, has been a major concern for the state. Mississippi goes back and forth with West Virginia for lowest participation rate in the nation. Over the past year it has gone from 54.5% to around 56% for the past few months, a positive sign that more people are in the labor market. 
 ”It’s increasing, which means that more people think that they have the opportunity and there are opportunities within the state to get,” said Willoughby.
However, there is some concern that the market is slowing.
Nationwide, payroll employment, the number of positions companies have on their payroll, has not changed significantly since April 2025. This is a  trend that is also seen in Mississippi where payroll employment has remained around 1.2 million since January.
“I think employers are reluctant to let any employees go right now, because they had to work really hard to get people back into the labor force,” said Miller. “At the same time, they’re a little apprehensive about trying to hire people because of just a lot of uncertainty in the economy with different policy changes.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/06181219/AP_21150599687344-scaled.jpg,,,2025-08-20 13:57:18.553607

Susan Collins.  Most of the candidates running against Collins so far are political newcomers like Graham, but his splashy campaign launch in the The New York […]","Sullivan resident Graham Platner, a veteran and oysterman, announced his bid for the Democratic nomination to challenge U.S. Sen. Susan Collins on Aug. 19, 2026. (Photo courtesy of Graham for Senate)A largely unknown oysterman and military veteran, Graham Platner garnered widespread attention this week when he launched a U.S. Senate campaign to try to unseat long-time Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins. 
Most of the candidates running against Collins so far are political newcomers like Graham, but his splashy campaign launch in the The New York Times and team of progressive strategists with records of successfully running against establishment Democrats has set him apart. 
While running on progressive ideas — universal healthcare, raising the minimum wage,  strengthening unions — Platner is clearly trying to appeal to Maine’s independent thinking, rejecting the label of liberal while embracing a working man’s pitch to appeal to supporters of President Donald Trump.  
It’s also unclear what his candidacy now means for national Democrats’ efforts to convince Gov. Janet Mills to run. 
The governor, who is termed out next year, gained a national profile after she told Trump in February “see you in court” over Maine’s law that allows transgender athletes to compete on girls’ sports teams. Now, some are hoping she’ll run for federal office, but she hasn’t decided yet. 
Earlier this month, Mills, known locally as a moderate Democrat, said she was “assessing everything” and “would think seriously about it.” According to CNN, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York has personally spoken with Mills about the race. 
Without an explicit answer, some other potential Democratic candidates for U.S. Senate are holding out on entering the race, including Speaker of the Maine House Ryan Fecteau and the owner of Maine Brewing Company, Dan Kleban.
Not all Democrats are waiting. Six lesser-known names filed to run before Platner — including Jordan Wood, a progressive former congressional aide, and David Costello, who unsuccessfully tried to unseat Maine’s other U.S. senator, independent Angus King, in 2024. 
“All of the other higher profile Democrats have, at least so far, decided, ‘Well, we’re going to run for the open governor’s [seat],’” said Mark Brewer, chair of the political science department at the University of Maine. The 2026 gubernatorial race has received far greater action with 18 official candidates already and others contemplating bids.   
“Part of that is Mills freezing the field, so to speak,” Brewer said. “But it’s not just that.”
Democrats thought they had Collins last time, Brewer pointed out. Her Democratic opponent, Sara Gideon, then-Speaker of the Maine House, far outspent Collins and polls had Gideon leading. Then Collins won by almost 9%. Brewer said he thinks the fact that prominent Maine Democrats opted for gubernatorial bids rather than Collins’ seat “speaks to the fact that she’s going to be tough to take down.” 
Eyeing a sixth term, Collins is facing pressure from both sides

Collins told Maine Morning Star in the spring she intends to run for reelection in 2026. Although she has yet to officially launch a campaign, she raised $2.4 million to close the quarter with more than $5 million on hand. 
When asked in the spring why she thinks she remains the best person to represent the state, Collins highlighted her record of delivering for Maine, primarily financially. That ability has been increasingly tested and upended during Trump’s second term. 
As for a primary challenge, Maine Republicans and Trump have rejected the idea, though someone familiar with the conversation told Politico recently that the president would love to see a “better option.” Brewer said, in his view, “it’s hard to envision another Republican winning statewide in a two-person race besides Collins.” 
So far, two little-known Republicans are running. One independent candidate has also thrown his hat in the ring. 
The candidate field 
With 15 months until the election, Democrats in the running for Collins’ seat include Platner, Wood, Costello, Tucker Favreau, Andrea LaFlamme, Natasha Alcala and Daira Rodriguez, according to Federal Election Commission filings.  
Platner was born in Blue Hill and raised in Ellsworth and Sullivan, where he launched his campaign on Tuesday. He enlisted in the Marine Corps after high school and served three deployments to Iraq. After attending George Washington University on the G.I. Bill, he then enrolled in the Army National Guard and served in Afghanistan. 
Following his service, he started working on an oyster farm on Frenchman Bay, which he now runs. He is also chair of the planning board and harbormaster in Sullivan.  
Platner wasted no time critiquing Collins during his campaign launch. In his video announcement, which was produced by Morris Katz, a top admaker for New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani, he said, “I’m not afraid to name an enemy. And the enemy is the oligarchy. It’s the billionaires who pay for it and the politicians who sell us out. And yeah, that means politicians like Susan Collins.” 
Other candidates have also made similar pitches about Collins, including Wood, who said the senator “hasn’t fixed the system — she’s become part of it,” in a statement last month in which he announced his fundraising totals so far. Aside from Collins, he’s raised the most — $1.6 million as of June 30. He’s had the most public campaign presence so far, hosting town halls across the state. 
Wood, a Bristol resident, previously told Maine Morning Star his top priorities will be anti-corruption reform and getting big money out of politics. 
Wood spent about a decade working in politics in Washington, D.C, including as chief of staff to former Democratic U.S. Rep. Katie Porter of California. He helped lead democracyFIRST, an organization aimed to combat threats to free and fair elections, and End Citizens United, a political action committee working to reverse the U.S. Supreme Court decision that enabled corporations and other outside groups to spend unlimited money on elections.

The sole independent candidate, Rench of Waterboro, has raised the next most, just over $54,000.
Rench owns Ossipee Hill Farm and Observatory. He was a former senior engineer at Elon Musk’s SpaceX, though he told Maine Morning Star he now has no association with Musk or the company aside from stocks he was awarded as an employee. He returned to Maine in 2020 to raise his children and build a produce farm. He also sat on the board for the Maine Space Corporation from June 2023 until June 2025. 
Other candidates have raised little to no funds so far, in part because their recent announcements fell close to the end of the quarter.  
Costello, who announced his bid in June and has no contributions filed with the FEC so far, is a familiar face in past U.S. Senate candidate pools. 
He unsuccessfully ran for independent Sen Angus King’s seat in 2024. He was active in state and federal government campaigns before spending several years working for the U.S. government abroad through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which Trump dismantled earlier this year.
Favreau, who also filed to run in June, has raised $4,724 in contributions so far. Born in Brunswick, Favreau enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2009 after high school and eventually commissioned as an officer in the recently established cyber branch. Since moving back to Maine following the end of his service in 2021, he has continued to work in cybersecurity at Cisco Talos. 
LaFlamme of Bangor is the chapter president for adjunct faculty of Maine’s Community Colleges with the Maine Service Employees Association, Local 1989 of the Service Employees International Union, and an adjunct professor at the University of Maine, teaching courses in Women’s Studies, particularly Women’s Health and the Environment and Reproductive Health. 
Alcala of Madawaska is a fashion designer who moved to Maine from California about four years ago. She has degrees in international relations and criminal justice and is a U.S. Navy veteran. Alcala previously filed to run against U.S. Sen. Angus King in 2024 but withdrew before the primary. 
Little is known about Rodriguez, who just filed with the FEC on Aug. 15 and lists an address of a Washington, D.C. PO Box. 
LaFlamme, Alcala and Rodriguez all have zero contributions filed with the FEC so far. That’s also the case for the two Republicans who have filed to run.  
Calabrese of Kennebunkport moved to Maine five years ago from Florida and is a driver for Walmart and former small business owner. Smeriglio of Frenchville runs the rightwing Voice of the People USA radio and activist group. He is a U.S. Army veteran and former police officer, according to his website.

McCuskey on Wednesday filed emergency motions to transfer and consolidate the two cases: Joshua Hess and Marisa Jackson vs. the state Department of Health and Miranda Guzman vs. the state and the Raleigh County Board of Education.  
Hess and Jackson, two parents of immunocompromised students, are suing in Kanawha County Circuit Court over the health department’s issuance of religious exemptions to the state’s vaccination law. They’re represented by the ACLU of West Virginia and Mountain State Justice. The organizations refiled the complaint Friday after Circuit Judge Kenneth Ballard dismissed the first complaint in July for procedural reasons. 
Guzman and two other families of students issued a religious exemption to the state’s vaccination law are suing the boards of education for defying Morrisey’s executive order. The state board has said it would continue to instruct county boards to accept only medical exemptions to the state vaccination law. 
In the motion, filed Tuesday, McCuskey writes that the two cases are “at a crossroads between state mandated public health measures and individual religious liberty.”
“A single, organized judicial response is mandatory,” he wrote. “Identical issues, facts, and legal arguments will be presented throughout both cases, and consolidation is necessary to promote judicial efficiency, avoid duplicative litigation, and ensure orderly disposition of all issues. 
“In contrast, separate yet simultaneous proceedings challenging religious exemptions to West Virginia’s vaccination law risks statewide confusion and inconsistency for school districts, families, and health officials,” he wrote. 
The two cases were filed by parties on different sides of a battle over the state’s vaccination law and an executive order from Morrisey. 
West Virginia has had one of the strongest school vaccination policies in the country. All states require that students be vaccinated for a number of infectious diseases like chicken pox, polio and measles. West Virginia is one of only five states that have not allowed religious or philosophical exemptions for the shots. Earlier this year, Morrisey issued an executive order requiring the state to allow religious exemptions.
The executive order has not been rescinded even though the state Legislature this year voted down a bill that would have inscribed religious exemptions into state code. Morrisey argues that the state’s school vaccination law should be considered along with the state’s Equal Protection for Religion Act of 2023 to mean that religious exemptions should be allowed. 
In the Raleigh County case, Circuit Judge Michael Froble last month granted a preliminary injunction in favor of three families who sued the state board of education after it said it would defy Morrisey’s executive order and instruct county boards to allow only medical exemptions to the school vaccination requirements. The court’s decision applies only to three plaintiffs in the case. 
Froble has scheduled a two day permanent injunction hearing in the case Sept. 10 and 11 to decide a number of issues including what authority the executive order has and whether the court’s ruling should apply statewide. 
Meanwhile, the state board of education filed notice Friday with the state Supreme Court of Appeals that it plans to appeal Froble’s decision.
In the notice, attorneys for the board argue that Raleigh County Circuit Court erred in its ruling in a few ways, including by “grafting an extratextual religious exemption onto the vaccine law,” and when it determined that the vaccine law “substantially burdens” respondents’ exercise of religion.
“The right to free exercise of religion is a vital right, but it is not a boundless right,” the attorney wrote. “The Supreme Court of the United States has long recognized that the right to free exercise of religion does not give a person ‘freedom from compulsory vaccination’ because the ‘right to practice religion freely’ does not include liberty to expose the community or the child to communicable disease or the latter to ill health or death.’’
The board of education has also filed a motion asking the Supreme Court for a “swift review” of the case. 
During the board of education’s regular meeting last week, Board President Paul Hardesty said the board would continue to follow advice of its counsel and not accept religious exemptions. The board’s conflict with the governor’s office should be left to the courts to decide, he said. 
“There’s a checks and balances system in our government,” Hardesty said. “There’s three branches of government. They perform three different functions. I hate it for the people of West Virginia that this issue is not decided before school started. I wish it was, but I don’t control the schedule or the time frame of the judiciary. It takes time. This issue will be decided in the proper venue by the proper people, and we’ll get a decision one way or the other, up or down, and we will comply with that decision.”
In a social media post last week Morrisey promised families seeking religious exemptions that they would ultimately win in court or through legislative action. He again hinted at taking steps to limit the board of education’s power. 
“Religious freedom is a cornerstone of our constitutional system and required under state law — we will eventually defeat this politically unaccountable board,” he wrote. “Nine year board terms are too long and need to be reconsidered.”

Free.,Grants to boost local emergency alert systems in question as public media agency closes,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/grants-boost-local-emergency-alert-systems-question-public-media-agency-closes,,"WASHINGTON — The Corporation for Public Broadcasting will no longer administer a grant program that has so far provided millions of dollars to local television and radio stations to upgrade the equipment they use to send out emergency alerts.The change comes after Republican lawmakers voted last month to defund the corporation, following a request from President Donald Trump to zero out more than $1.1 billion in previously approved spending for the organization.Congress originally formed the Next Generation Warning System grant program in fiscal 2022 and provided the Federal Emergency Management Agency about $40 million during its first year.FEMA then gave that money to CPB to reimburse stations for infrastructure and other improvements meant to get emergency alerts sent through the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System to more Americans.That appears on track to change in the months ahead.FEMA officials wrote in a notice of funding opportunity for the current fiscal year that the grants will now go directly to state and tribal governments that can then award funding to public broadcasting stations that make improvements to their emergency alert systems.Democrats and some Republicans have raised concerns that without funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, local stations wouldn’t be able to raise enough funding to remain in operation, potentially leading to holes in the country’s emergency alert system.‘Rescission consequences’ for local public mediaCPB, which plans to cease operations later this year, announced this week that it would no longer be able to administer the grant funding Congress approved during fiscal 2023 and 2024. The corporation had yet to determine which applicants would receive the funding lawmakers provided for those two years.“CPB has been fully invested in the NGWS program and its mission to protect the American public,” CPB President and CEO Patricia Harrison wrote in a statement. “This is one more example of rescission consequences impacting local public media stations and the communities they serve—in this case, weakening the capacity of local public media stations to support the safety and preparedness of their communities.”That could potentially leave nearly $100 million in grant funding from fiscal 2023 and 2024 that had been working its way through the award process at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in limbo.The White House, Office of Management and Budget and FEMA did not immediately respond to requests for comment from States Newsroom on Wednesday about the grant program.Projects funded so far include:Mid-South Public Communications Foundation in Cordova, Tennessee, which received $1.657 million to “replace a transmitter and two emergency generators to ensure the rural agricultural communities in Tennessee, Mississippi, and eastern Arkansas receive timely emergency communications.”Blue Ridge PBS in Roanoke, Virginia, which received $1.122 million to “replace critical broadcast infrastructure that will strengthen their signal in the mountainous region to reach more rural communities with targeted emergency alerts.”Louisiana Public Broadcasting, which received nearly $2 million to “install transmitters and antennas for KLTL-TV in Lake Charles and KLTM-TV in Monroe and update alerting equipment to enable statewide delivery of alerts and warning messages.”Congress votes to end public media fundsKate Riley, president and CEO of America’s Public Television Stations, released a written statement this week calling CPB’s inability to administer the grant program for FEMA “yet another devastating result of the rescission of public media funding.”She also called on FEMA “to establish a new process for delivering this funding to public broadcasters” and urged “Congress to restore essential direct funding to local stations throughout this country whose communities depend on them for lifesaving public safety services, proven educational resources and essential community connections.”Trump sent Congress a rescissions request in early June, proposing lawmakers eliminate previously approved funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and several foreign aid accounts.The House voted mostly along party lines to approve the full $9.4 billion proposal later that month. GOP senators, except Maine’s Susan Collins and Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, approved a similar bill in July after removing spending cuts to the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. The House voted to clear the revised legislation a few days later, sending the bill to Trump for his signature.",,,,2025-08-20 13:57:18.553607

Facing growing pressure from advocacy groups, lawsuits and climate projections that show hotter days ahead, some state prison systems are moving to install air conditioning and expand cooling measures — though many facilities remain years away from significant upgrades.
But in other states, such efforts have stalled or failed. That may lead to more lawsuits in the future, experts say, even as judges may raise the bar for such cases.

An emphasis on being “tough on crime” and prioritizing other public safety measures may have contributed to less attention on prison conditions in some states. In others, slowing revenue growth and pressure to rein in corrections spending could be making new investments a harder sell.
At least two states this year, Virginia and Texas, considered legislation addressing excessive heat in prisons but neither measure became law. The Texas bill would have required the state Department of Criminal Justice to purchase and install climate control systems in all of its facilities by the end of 2032. About two-thirds of the state’s correctional facilities have only partial or no air conditioning.
The measure passed the House but did not advance in the Senate before the legislature adjourned in June.
In Virginia, lawmakers approved a bill that would have required the state corrections department to install heat and air conditioning in its prisons and to ensure cell temperatures not exceed 80 degrees. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed it, citing the cost of installation and operational burdens. Youngkin also wrote that existing state corrections data “does not substantiate the claims of extreme temperatures or health risks.”
But in Delaware, the fiscal year 2026 capital budget approved last month includes $2 million in funding to install air conditioning at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center.
These changes mark the latest actions in a long-running debate over how correctional systems respond to rising summer temperatures — an issue that affects both incarcerated people and staff. Some of the policy debates and facility updates this year follow years of advocacy and litigation over the health, safety and operational challenges posed by heat in correctional settings.

The problem of excessive heat in prisons has persisted for decades and has unfolded alongside other challenges, including chronic understaffing and overcrowding. In some cases, these problems have led to extended facility lockdowns, even during the summer months.
“There are people working in prisons and they have the right to work in climates that are comfortable,” said Nancy La Vigne, a criminal justice researcher and dean of the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University. “When they’re not, there’s retention issues, and it’s hard to replace staff. And when you don’t replace staff, then you have challenges in maintaining the safety and security of the facility.”
In New York, for example, correctional officers staged a three-week strike earlier this year and many didn’t return to work. Some facilities now are operating with 30%-60% fewer guards than needed, resulting in some incarcerated people getting only an hour or two outside of their cells each day.
A 2023 study published in the peer-reviewed PLOS One journal found that mortality in state and private prisons rose during periods of extreme heat, with deaths increasing 3.5% on extreme heat days and up to 7.4% during three-day heat waves. Between 2001 and 2019, nearly 13,000 people died in prison during the summer months, almost half of them in the South, though the study did not determine how many of those deaths were directly attributable to heat.
Climate change is fueling longer, more intense periods of extreme heat. Exposure to extreme heat can worsen conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and asthma, and has also been linked to worsening mental health and higher suicide rates among incarcerated people.
“Average temperatures are rising, and you’re going to have more and more states around the country where incarcerated people are held in conditions that are not livable because they’re too hot,” said Sharon Dolovich, a law professor and director of the Prison Law and Policy Program at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Some upgrades

At least 44 states lack universal air conditioning within their prison facilities, even in regions known for sweltering summer temperatures, according to a 2022 USA Today analysis. A recent Reuters investigation also found that nearly half of state prisons across 29 states have partial or no air conditioning in housing units.
But some states are investing millions to update their prison facilities.
In North Carolina, corrections officials are working toward their goal of installing air conditioning in all 54 state prisons by 2026. To date, 33 facilities are fully air-conditioned, 17 are partially air-conditioned, and four have no air conditioning, according to its dashboard.
In California, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, which operates 31 adult prisons, has spent $246 million in the past five years on cooling improvements at five prisons, according to a department spokesperson.
Lawmakers this year also approved funding for the Air Cooling Pilot Program at three facilities, with $17.6 million allocated for fiscal years 2025-26 and $20 million for fiscal years 2026-27. It will evaluate the effectiveness of two alternatives prior to a statewide plan to address high indoor temperatures across the California prison system.

The Texas Department of Criminal Justice, as of Aug. 1, is building 12,827 “cool beds,” or prison cells in air-conditioned units, and is in the process of procuring an additional 7,162, according to its dashboard.
Texas is one of the states most closely associated with heat-related deaths in prison. A 2022 study estimated that, on average, 14 deaths per year in Texas prisons are associated with heat. And a Texas Tribune analysis found that at least 41 incarcerated people died during a record-breaking heat wave in 2023.
In March, a federal judge ruled the extreme heat in Texas prisons is “plainly unconstitutional,” but declined to order immediate air conditioning, saying the work could not be completed within the court order’s 90-day window and temporary systems might delay a permanent fix.

‘More miserable’

Sweltering summer heat can turn prisons into pressure cookers. People inside already may have health conditions, limited access to cooling, or take medications that make it harder for their bodies to handle the heat. And research suggests that high temperatures can heighten irritability and aggression, sometimes fueling more conflicts between incarcerated people or with staff.
“It makes you more miserable. … If you to the point of even thinking about suicide, that’s just going to add to it,” said Ronald McKeithen, who spent 37 years incarcerated in Alabama prisons and is now the director of second chances at the Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice. McKeithen recalls feeling “on edge” due to tension among other incarcerated people on hot days.
At the Oshkosh Correctional Institution in Wisconsin, Devin Skrzypchak said the heat worsens his bladder condition, and he often can’t get the incontinence briefs he needs. The heat forces him to drink more water, and on days when ice isn’t available, he’s left drenched in sweat.
“At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating,” Skrzypchak wrote in a message to Stateline through the facility’s messaging platform.










At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating.


– Devin Skrzypchak, who is incarcerated at Oshkosh Correctional Institution in Wisconsin


D’Angelo Lee Komanekin — who has spent about 25 years in and out of different Wisconsin corrections facilities — said prison architecture plays a major role in why temperatures inside climb so high.
“The planet is getting hotter and hotter,” said Komanekin, who relies on a small plastic fan to stay cool. Komanekin also is incarcerated at the Oshkosh Correctional Institution. “They’re doing nothing about the architecture. Some institutions’ windows open, some don’t, but most of the doors have steel doors with trap doors.”
Older prison designs that rely heavily on steel and concrete building materials often trap heat, making it difficult to keep temperatures down in the summer. Aging facilities also are less likely to be equipped for the installation of central air conditioning.
Some state prison systems, including Alabama’s and Wisconsin’s, are adding air-conditioning or air-tempering systems to new prison construction and major renovation projects.

Future legal battles

Legal experts say the issue of excessive heat in prisons is likely to become more pressing as climate change drives longer and hotter summers.
Extreme heat in correctional facilities has already been the subject of litigation in dozens of states, with plaintiffs arguing that high temperatures constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Court rulings in these cases have varied, but some experts say even more lawsuits are likely if facilities do not adapt.
“The conditions are going to worsen. [Incarcerated people are] going to be looking for every possible avenue for assistance they can,” Dolovich, the UCLA law professor, told Stateline.

One of the latest cases comes from Missouri, where the nonprofit law firm MacArthur Justice Center filed a class-action lawsuit in May on behalf of six incarcerated people at Algoa Correctional Center.
The lawsuit alleges that the conditions violate their constitutional rights under the Eighth Amendment. It seeks to require the Missouri Department of Corrections to work with experts to develop a heat mitigation plan that keeps housing unit temperatures between 65 and 85 degrees. If the department cannot meet that standard, the plaintiffs are asking for the release of three of the incarcerated people who have less than a year remaining on their sentences.
Lawsuits such as the Missouri case often focus on claims that extreme heat worsens existing medical problems. To proceed, they must meet two legal requirements: proving the heat poses a serious health or safety risk, and showing prison officials knew about the danger but failed to address it, according to Dolovich, whose work has focused on the Eighth Amendment and prison conditions.
Courts may also raise the bar for proving such claims if judges echo decisions in cases with similar Eight Amendment arguments related to the death penalty and homelessness, Dolovich said. Judges have shifted, she said, toward a “superadding terror, pain and disgrace” standard under the Eighth Amendment — a higher threshold requiring proof that conditions were created with the intent to cause unnecessary suffering.
Dolovich added that some recent court decisions have provided only narrow remedies, such as ordering ice and fans instead of installing air conditioning.
“Prison officials have a moral and a constitutional responsibility to respond to changing conditions. In this case, it means air conditioning. … Anything less than that, to me, is indefensible.” she said.

Erin McCanlies was listening to the radio one morning in April when she heard Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promising to find the cause of autism by September. The secretary of Health and Human Services said he believed an environmental toxin was responsible for the dramatic increase in the condition and vowed to gather “the most credible scientists from all over the world” to solve the mystery.
Nothing like that has ever been done before, he told an interviewer.
McCanlies was stunned. The work had been done.
“That’s exactly what I’ve been doing!” she said to her husband, Fred.
As an epidemiologist at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which Kennedy oversees, McCanlies had spent much of the past two decades studying how parents’ exposure to workplace chemicals affects the chance that they will have a child with autism.

This report was originally published by ProPublica.

Just three weeks earlier, she’d been finalizing her fourth major paper on the topic when Kennedy eliminated her entire division. Kennedy has also overseen tens of millions of dollars in cuts to federal funding for research on autism, including its environmental causes.
For 20 years, Kennedy has espoused the debunked theory that autism is caused by vaccines, dismissing evidence to the contrary by arguing that vaccine manufacturers, researchers and regulators all have an interest in obscuring their harms.
He remains skeptical of the scientists who have been funded by his own agency to study the neurodevelopmental condition. “We need to stop trusting the experts,” he told right-wing host Tucker Carlson in a June interview, going on to suggest that previous studies that found no relationship between vaccines and autism were marred by “trickery” and researchers’ self-interest.
In contrast, Kennedy told Carlson that under his leadership, and with a new, federally funded $50 million autism research initiative, “We’re going to get real studies done for the first time.”
Some autism researchers fear that the effort will manipulate data to blame the condition on vaccines.
“Kennedy has never expressed an open mind, an open attitude towards what are the fundamental causes of autism,” said Helen Tager-Flusberg, a Boston University psychologist who founded a coalition of scientists concerned about his approach to autism. In a June statement, the group said the initiative lacks transparency and that Kennedy “casually ignores decades of high quality research that preceded his oversight.”

As Kennedy promotes his new initiative, ProPublica has found that he has also taken aim at the traditional scientific approach to autism, shutting down McCanlies’ lab and stripping funding from more than 50 autism-related studies. Meanwhile, he has stood by as the Trump administration encourages the departure of hundreds of federal employees with experience studying the harm caused by environmental threats and rolls back protections from pollution and chemicals, including some linked to autism.
Kennedy did not respond to requests for an interview, and an HHS spokesperson did not answer specific questions from ProPublica, including those related to the concerns of the coalition of autism scientists.
“Under the leadership of Secretary Kennedy, HHS is taking action on autism as the public health emergency it is,” the spokesperson wrote. “NIH is fully committed to leaving no stone unturned in confronting this catastrophic epidemic — employing only gold-standard, evidence-based science. The Department will follow the science, wherever it leads.”
Genetic factors account for a significant portion of autism cases. Research like the kind McCanlies and other government-funded scientists have conducted over the past two decades has established that environmental factors have a role, too, and can combine with genetics. Multiple factors can even converge within the same individual. Some of those environmental risks could be reduced by the very measures the Trump administration is rolling back.
Kennedy would have been well positioned to advocate for researchers looking into the environmental causes of autism while sitting on President Donald Trump’s cabinet.
The nephew of President John F. Kennedy and son of his former attorney general, Bobby, Kennedy spent decades as an attorney battling some of the world’s most notorious corporate polluters. Once heralded by Time Magazine as one of the “heroes for the planet,” he railed against actions by the first Trump administration, complaining in his 2017 introduction to the book “Climate in Crisis” that 33 years’ worth of his work was “reduced to ruins as the president mounted his assault on science and environmental protection.”
But recently he has remained publicly silent as the Environmental Protection Agency halts research and weakens regulations on air pollution and chemicals, including some McCanlies and her colleagues have identified as possible factors in the development of autism.
“I don’t think he’s aware of my work,” McCanlies said, “or most of the literature that’s been published on what the causes of autism are.”

McCanlies was studying how a toxic chemical, beryllium, causes chronic lung inflammation in workers when she began to think seriously about autism.
It was 2005, and her college-age stepson had a job shadowing children with autism. As he described helping them navigate playground dynamics, reminding them to return a wave or a greeting, McCanlies wondered whether their behaviors might be tied to chemicals their parents had encountered on the job. Could the exposures have altered genes their parents passed down? Could they have infiltrated the kids’ developing brains through the womb or through breast milk?
The questions remained abstract until McCanlies met another researcher named Irva Hertz-Picciotto, who had a unique data set. She had collected detailed information on the occupations of two large groups of parents: those who had children with autism and those whose kids developed neurotypically. Comparing the groups’ chemical exposures before their children were born could help illuminate causes of the condition, McCanlies realized.
Hertz-Picciotto, an environmental epidemiologist based at the University of California, Davis, was a pioneer in the search for the causes of autism. In 2009, she published a much-cited paper highlighting a sevenfold increase in diagnoses in California. While others had asserted the rise was due to increased awareness and broadened diagnostic criteria, Hertz-Picciotto found those factors could only partially explain it. She and others went on to document additional contributors to autism risk, including parental age at the time of birth, a mother’s fever during pregnancy and more traditional environmental considerations, such as chemical exposures.
McCanlies hadn’t studied autism. But she offered Hertz-Picciotto her experience in genetics and epidemiology as well as the considerable resources of her agency. NIOSH was established in 1970 to investigate the dangers of the workplace, and its statisticians and industrial hygienists were among the world’s experts on the health impacts of chemical exposures.
Their first collaboration, published in 2012, used Hertz-Picciotto’s data to see if parents of children with autism were more likely to have been exposed to chemicals already thought to be dangerous to the developing brain. The work was technical and time-consuming, but the analysis showed a clear relationship: Mothers and fathers of children with autism were more likely than the parents of unaffected children to have been exposed to solvents such as lacquer, varnish and xylene on the job. These solvents evaporate quickly and can be easily inhaled or absorbed through the skin. Chemical plant workers, painters, electricians, plumbers, construction workers, cleaners and medical personnel are among those who may be exposed to these solvents.
The sample size was small — just 174 families. But the results lined up with recent findings showing possible links between autism and exposure to metals and certain solvents during pregnancy or early childhood, including a solvent called methylene chloride. They also tracked with studies linking the chemicals to miscarriage, reproductive problems, birth defects and developmental problems other than autism.
McCanlies and Hertz-Picciotto followed up with a 2019 study that looked at more than 950 families. It showed that women exposed to solvents at work during pregnancy and the three months leading up to it were 1.5 times more likely to have a child with autism than women not exposed to the chemicals. (The study did not find a link for chemically exposed men.)
Their third study, published in 2023, took the link between solvent exposure and autism as a starting point. Using blood samples to examine the genetic makeup of the parents of children with autism, McCanlies and Hertz-Picciotto found that when exposed to solvents on the job, people with specific variants of 31 genes had an especially elevated risk of having a child with autism.
Their genetic makeup appeared to increase the risk that solvents by themselves posed. Some of those 31 genes help cells connect with one another; others play a role in helping cells migrate to different areas so they can grow into the various parts of the brain; still others ensure that cells clear away toxic substances.

Researchers were also making strides under the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, a division of Health and Human Services, which has financed investigations into dozens of environmental contaminants. Several have been linked to autism, including air pollution, certainpesticides, a plastic additive known as BPA and diesel exhaust, which causes “autism-like behavioral changes” in mice.
In 2021, Hertz-Picciotto co-published a study linking “forever chemicals” called PFOA and PFNA with the condition (In 2023, a second paper also found an association with PFNA). Other government-funded research has established a link between autism and another solvent, trichloroethylene, also known as TCE, which has been used for dry cleaning, manufacturing and degreasing machines.
Together, the results have shown that many exposures can increase the likelihood of autism, and that there can be multiple causes for any one person.
At least one exposure can have the opposite effect: A study by a researcher named Rebecca Schmidt — and funded by the NIEHS and NIH — found that a B vitamin called folic acid was associated with a significant decrease in the chances of an autism diagnosis. More than a dozen studies have since confirmed the association.
One problem hung over much of autism research. The sweeping diagnosis includes everyone from people who treasure their neurological differences to those with debilitating symptoms, including repetitive behaviors, excruciating sensitivity to touch and sounds, and difficulty responding to social situations. McCanlies and Hertz–Picciotto wondered whether certain chemicals were linked to the most severe cases or to specific symptoms.
In 2023, they set about finding out.
They were preparing to submit their study for publication when newly inaugurated Trump put Kennedy in charge of America’s health.
Despite having made chronic health conditions the focus of his agenda, Kennedy has quietly abided environmental policies that will exacerbate these problems, including autism.
The Environmental Protection Agency, under Administrator Lee Zeldin, is rolling back rules and regulations that will result in an increase in air pollution, which multiplestudies have linked toautism. The agency is in the process of reversing bans on several chemicals, including TCE, one of the solvents associated with the disorder, and has told a federal court it won’t legally defend certain aspects of a ban on methylene chloride, another of the solvents linked to autism.
It also began dismantling its Office of Research and Development, which has funded research into the environmental conditionscontributing to autism. According to an EPA spokesperson, more than 2,300 workers have so far elected to leave the agency through Trump administration programs encouraging early retirement and resignation.
The EPA also began canceling grants, including one it had given to Schmidt, the researcher who studied the protective effect of folic acid. Schmidt had been awarded $1.3 million to determine whether air pollution from wildfires might increase the risk of various neurological conditions.
Schmidt and her colleagues had just done preliminary analysis and found that there was a significant association between wildfire pollution exposure and autism when she received a letter saying that the grant was terminated because the project was “no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.”
After a judge ruled in a class-action lawsuit on behalf of University of California researchers alleging their funding was unlawfully terminated, her grant was reinstated last month. But the EPA has appealed the judge’s ruling, leaving Schmidt unsure about the fate of the project.

Schmidt said there is an urgent need to finish the study and warn people about how to avoid the dangers from wildfire smoke by staying indoors and using air filters and N95 masks. “Millions of pregnant women are getting exposed as we speak,” she said.
Meanwhile, Kennedy has presided over his own gutting of research. Known for sharing videos of his bare-chested workouts, he likened his agency’s cuts to getting rid of “unhealthy fat,” but his plan to reduce the staff of HHS by 20,000 amounts to slashing the workforce by roughly a quarter, including veteran scientists.
Among the divisions Kennedy eliminated was one that studied air quality and collected data on chemicals found in human blood. Some workers in the division were subsequently reinstated. After a lawsuit and pressure from Congress, HHS has also rehired some NIOSH workers, though none at the division where McCanlies worked. Those whose jobs have not been reinstated remain on administrative leave.
The reorganization plan for HHS involves consolidating the remnants of these parts of the agency, along with several others, into a new division called the Administration for a Healthy America. Asked about the transition, an HHS spokesperson told ProPublica in an email that the reorganization would save taxpayers $1.8 billion a year and that “critical programs will continue.”
Meanwhile, a ProPublica review of federal data found that more than $40 million in grants awarded by the National Institutes of Health for dozens of autism-related research projects were canceled under Kennedy’s watch. Some had been awarded to universities the administration is now targeting, while others ran afoul of Trump’s “anti-woke” priorities by mentioning gender and other verboten terms.
Among them was a grant to Harvard University to use data on nearly half a million Israeli children to evaluate whether men’s exposure to air pollution affects the risk of having a child with autism (A small number of grants have been recently reinstated). A survey of researchers conducted by the Autism Science Foundation, which tallied cuts to training grants and the anticipated cuts to future grants over the next few years, estimated that the total loss of funding could be tens of millions more.
“We’re talking about probably decades of delays and setbacks,” said Alycia Halladay, chief science officer at the Autism Science Foundation. “To take money away from all these areas of need to focus on a question that the HHS director considers high priority seems not scientific and not the way that science is done.”
Trump excludes 12 Louisiana chemical facilities from new EPA pollution rule

Housed under the National Institutes of Health, Kennedy’s new $50-million Autism Data Science Initiative is looking to fund two- to three-year research projects that plumb large public and private datasets to find “possible contributors to the causes of autism” as well as conduct research on existing treatments.
With the deadline for his promised discovery fast approaching, Kennedy recently acknowledged that his initial six-month timeline was overly optimistic. He told Carlson he should have “some initial indicator answers” about the causes of autism by September, his original deadline, and promised unqualified answers within another six months.
While the NIH typically releases the names of the scientists on the committees that review grant applications and the criteria they use to review them, it has not done so in this case. Nor has the agency clarified what role NIH staff will have in awarding the grants, who will make the final selection, or what terms and conditions researchers must agree to if they receive funds.
HHS did not respond to ProPublica’s questions about who will make the final grant selection and why the agency has not yet made this information public, but a video NIH created for applicants of the funding acknowledges that reviews of the proposals “do not follow the traditional NIH review process.” According to the video, the process was “designed to ensure integrity, fairness and transparency.”
Hertz-Picciotto, who laments the fact that Kennedy is “shutting down good studies,” is among the researchers in her field who have decided to apply for the funding. “Some of his agenda is really ridiculous and very counterproductive,” she said. “But if something good can be done with this money, I’d like to be part of that.”
If her project is approved, she plans to hire McCanlies to consult on it.
McCanlies said she agreed to work on the project because she has complete confidence in her longtime colleague, if not the health secretary. “I don’t trust him at all,” she said.
McCanlies had never paid much attention to Kennedy — or to politics. Throughout the seven presidential administrations that governed while she had been at NIOSH, her work had been utterly uncontroversial. But weeks after his confirmation, she knew her job was in peril. She had deleted the first email she received from Trump’s Office of Personnel Management. The tone was so strange and disrespectful, hinting that she might be punished if she didn’t respond by confirming her email address, that she assumed it was a phishing attempt. By the time she received a second, suggesting that she find a “higher productivity” job in the private sector, firings and budget cuts were rolling across federal agencies.
The 58-year-old, who has short, greying hair, hazel eyes and three graduate degrees, hadn’t been ready to leave NIOSH’s Health Effects Lab in Morgantown, West Virginia, a place where she had mentored young colleagues, taught a lunchtime meditation class and helped conduct several yearslong research projects. The lab is also where she met Fred, her husband, another Ph.D. scientist who studied workplace chemical hazards. She reluctantly put in for early retirement just days before the entire lab was dissolved.
McCanlies spent her final days at NIOSH finishing her last paper, which explores the association between workplace chemicals and the severity of autism. Normally, she would have her supervisor sign off on her submission to a journal, but he had already lost his job. The rest of her colleagues were gone, too, and the lab’s hallways were empty as she gave the manuscript a final edit.
She felt proud of the study, which answered some of the questions she and Hertz-Picciotto had posed years ago. There were indeed links between exposures and the severity of autism. Parents’ exposure to plastics was “consistently and significantly associated” with lower cognitive scores in their children who had autism, increases in “aberrant behaviors” and deficits in basic life skills, the study found. The exposure was also linked to particular symptoms of autism, including social withdrawal, hyperactivity and repetitive behaviors such as hand flapping and body rocking. Higher autism severity scores and weaker daily living skills were also linked with ethylene oxide. Last year, the EPA imposed stricter limits on the chemical, which is used as a sterilizer. But the agency is now reconsidering those restrictions, and, in July, Trump exempted some of the biggest polluters from them.
The paper, which is now available as a preprint, recommended that regulatory agencies “consider increasing awareness of these hazards and make clear recommendations for implementing protective measures at the worksite.”
Having just watched so many occupational health experts forced to leave their jobs, McCanlies suspected their advice was unlikely to be heeded anytime soon.

(Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)This week, the Trump administration’s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced an effort to check the immigration status of people who get their health insurance through Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.
Medicaid is the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. For families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford private insurance, CHIP is a public program that provides low-cost health coverage for their children.
The feds will begin sending states monthly enrollment reports that identify people with Medicaid or CHIP whose immigration or citizenship status can’t be confirmed through federal databases. States are then responsible for verifying the citizenship or immigration status of individuals in those reports. States are expected to take “appropriate actions when necessary, including adjusting coverage or enforcing non-citizen eligibility rules,” according to a CMS press release.
States scramble to shield hospitals from GOP Medicaid cuts

“We are tightening oversight of enrollment to safeguard taxpayer dollars and guarantee that these vital programs serve only those who are truly eligible under the law,” Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who oversees CMS as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said in a press release announcing the new program.
As of April, roughly 71 million adults and children nationwide have Medicaid coverage, while another 7 million children have insurance through CHIP. Immigrants under age 65 are less likely to be covered by Medicaid than U.S.-born citizens, according to an analysis from health research organization KFF.
Immigrants who are in the country illegally aren’t eligible for federally funded Medicaid and CHIP. Only citizens and certain lawfully present immigrants — green card holders and refugees, for example — can qualify.
But some states have chosen to expand Medicaid coverage for immigrants with their own funds. Twenty-three states offer pregnancy-related care regardless of citizenship or immigration status, according to KFF. Fourteen states provide coverage for children in low-income families regardless of immigration status, while seven states offer coverage to some adults regardless of status.
The tax and spending package President Donald Trump last month cuts federal spending on Medicaid by more than $1 trillion, leaving states to either make up the difference with their own funds or reduce coverage. But the new law also includes restrictions on coverage for certain immigrants, including stripping eligibility from refugees and asylum-seekers.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Beth Zigmund: President Donald Trump wants to undo the Environmental Protection Agency’s ability to protect our climate and air — and we must speak up.","This commentary is by Beth Zigmund, MD, of South Burlington.


Severe heat, abnormally dry weather, and wildfire smoke have assailed Vermont and much of the U.S. throughout this summer, a testament to the growing menace of climate change. Despite this  — and adding to a long list of assaults on public health — President Trump is now using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to aim its sledgehammer at the endangerment finding, the rule which gives the EPA the authority to regulate air-polluting, climate-warming gases.
If President Trump succeeds, Vermonters will be sicker and poorer for generations to come. Now is the time to use our voices to protect this critically important rule.
The endangerment finding
The endangerment finding was issued by the EPA in 2009 to protect the public by regulating six planet-warming gases. The rule rests on a 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision finding that greenhouse gases are pollutants, leading the EPA to make a science-based determination that they endanger public health under the Clean Air Act. The endangerment finding underpins long standing safeguards, including critical vehicle and power plant emissions standards.
Seemingly unaware of the EPA’s mission to protect public health and the environment, President Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office directing the EPA to review the endangerment finding, arguing that regulating planet-warming fossil fuel emissions is too expensive for the industries causing the pollution. On July 29, the EPA fulfilled the President’s order, and the rule is now under review.
Vermonters should be alarmed by this reckless proposal to place industry profits above the interests of our communities, loved ones and future generations.
The costs of ignoring climate science
The consequences of fossil fuel-driven air pollution and climate change are not theoretical. Air pollution from burning fossil fuels causes between 5–10 million deaths per year globally. Recent floods in Vermont and other states have devastated whole communities. Smoke from climate change-driven wildfires has become a regular feature of Vermont summers, carrying toxic particulate matter linked to premature births, exacerbations of lung and heart diseases, increased risk of dementia and some cancers and premature mortality. Heat-related deaths are expected to increase as extremely hot days become more common. Warmer, more humid weather in our state is creating a vast utopia for dangerous, vector-borne illnesses while also lengthening and intensifying the allergy season. 
Poorer mental health is at the nexus of all these climate impacts.
According to the EPA itself, the consequences of climate change and air pollution are disproportionately borne by children, pregnant women, older adults, people with disabilities, low-income communities, people of color and indigenous populations.
Health threats aside, economic facts pour cold water on the Trump Administration’s claim that regulating planet-warming gases is too expensive. The inflation-adjusted economic costs of climate-related events are staggering, totaling $462 billion in the U.S. from 2022-2024.      
The American Lung Association estimates that by switching away from fossil fuels to cleaner energy, the U.S. would generate $1.2 trillion in health benefits, while averting 13 million lost workdays, 110,000 premature deaths, and 3 million asthma attacks by 2050. According to the US Department of Energy, moving away from fossil fuels to renewable energy would spur job growth and could position the U.S. as a global leader in designing, manufacturing and deploying renewable energy technologies.
The public wants stronger protections
President Trump’s proposal to gut the EPA’s pollution-regulating authority is wildly out of step with public opinion. People know they sit in the crosshairs of weak public policy on climate change. Polling consistently shows that about two-thirds of Americans believe the government is not doing enough to protect us from climate change. Three-quarters want stricter limits on air pollution. Meanwhile, “climate denialists” are dwindling in number, representing only about 15% of Americans. Vermonters are among the most concerned about climate change in the country.
Despite accelerating climate impacts, broad-based public support for regulating health-damaging climate-warming gases and air pollution, and the rapidly mounting costs of climate-related disasters, the Trump Administration is boldly proceeding with its attack on the endangerment finding and attempting to undo decades of scientific consensus.
Fortunately, there is time to act. The EPA public comment period is open through September 15, 2025. Anyone can comment, no matter what your background. Authentic personal stories about how climate change is affecting you are the most powerful.      
For those who want to provide oral testimony, a virtual public hearing will occur from August 19 to August 22, 2025, recently lengthened due to a very high number of registrants. Anyone can sign up to provide oral testimony; oral comments are limited to three minutes or approximately 450 words.
Every written and oral testimonial must be considered in the EPA’s decision. And, if the EPA rescinds the endangerment finding, testimony will serve as evidence in legal challenges to the EPA’s decision.
Please use your voice to protect this vitally important rule, which stands as a bulwark between public health and dangerous, unregulated fossil fuel pollution.

Energy efficiency is a proven, practical and immediate way to make energy more affordable. Facing economic uncertainty and climate challenges, it’s the solution we can’t afford to ignore.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Peter Walke: Efficiency is our first, best tool for lower energy bills.","This commentary is by Peter Walke, of Montpelier. He is the managing director of Efficiency Vermont.


Vermonters feel it every time we get an energy bill or fill up at the pump: Costs are high and unpredictable. 
Global markets swing wildly. Storms knock out power. Heating our homes in the winter takes a bigger bite out of our paychecks than it used to. 
We cannot control global fuel prices, but we can control how much energy we use. That’s why energy efficiency is the single most powerful, affordable tool we have to keep costs down.  
Efficiency Vermont is now planning our next three years of programs to help Vermonters save energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It’s a moment to reflect on the importance of efficiency in our state. It’s also an opportunity for Vermonters to take our survey and share your feedback on our programs and services. 
When a business replaces outdated lighting or upgrades to efficient equipment, it lowers its bills and strengthens its bottom line. When a home is weatherized, insulated and air-sealed, it uses less fuel to keep us warm in January and less electricity to keep us cool in July. These are not just small savings. They add up. Over the past two decades, Vermonters have saved more than $3.3 billion thanks to efficiency improvements. 
Efficiency is also our cheapest energy resource. It costs far less to save a unit of energy than to produce one. Every kilowatt-hour of electricity we don’t need is one we don’t have to generate, transmit across expensive power lines and pay for. This means lower costs for utilities, more manageable peaks when demand surges and, over time, more affordable bills for ratepayers. 
It’s also a homegrown solution. When we cut our energy use, we reduce our reliance on imported fossil fuels and keep more money circulating in Vermont’s economy. That’s energy independence in action — something that benefits every household and business in the state. 
The benefits don’t stop at the wallet. Efficient appliances and heating systems improve indoor air quality. A well-weatherized home is more comfortable, quieter and healthier. And every bit of energy we save means fewer greenhouse gas emissions, helping us meet Vermont’s climate commitments while protecting communities from the devastating impacts of a warming world. 
Some may think of energy efficiency as a “someday” solution — something to get to after tackling other home projects or business priorities. But it really should be the first step. Vermont can build new renewable energy sources, modernize our grid, and electrify our vehicles and heating systems. But if we don’t streamline how we use energy in the first place, we’ll need to spend more on generation and infrastructure, driving up costs. Efficiency makes all those other investments work better and cost less. 
The bottom line: Energy efficiency isn’t just about using less — it’s about living better for less. It’s a proven, practical and immediate way to make energy more affordable for all Vermonters. In a time of economic uncertainty and climate challenges, it’s the common-sense solution we can’t afford to ignore. 
When it comes to energy, so much happens in a global market that’s beyond our control. But we can control how we use energy and we can choose to use energy wisely. When we do, Vermont becomes stronger, more resilient and more affordable for everyone. 
As Efficiency Vermont looks ahead, we want your help in improving the work we do together to make Vermont’s energy more affordable. Please join the thousands of Vermonters who have taken 10 minutes to fill out our survey by calling 888-921-5990 or visiting our website.

(Photo by Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Former Rep. RJ May’s trial on accusations of distributing videos and images of children being sexually abused should begin in October, a federal judge decided Wednesday.
May, a West Columbia Republican and founding member of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus, resigned his House seat earlier this month. He has pleaded not guilty to the 10 counts he faces of distributing child sexual abuse material, commonly referred to as child pornography, following his June arrest.
Jury selection is scheduled to take place Oct. 8, with opening arguments beginning the following day.
The trial was initially set to begin with jury selection Sept. 10, but public defender Jenny Smith asked for a delay because of the “tremendous amount of data to go through,” she told a judge.
Prosecutors expect to spend six days building their case, in which they will accuse 38-year-old May of sending photos and videos of children being sexually abused over the course of five days in April 2024.
May wore an orange-and-white striped jumpsuit during Wednesday’s hearing. He was shackled at the wrists and ankles. He spoke only to say he had agreed to the new trial dates.
According to investigators, they were alerted by messaging app Kik that an account named “joebidennnn69” had sent videos of child sexual abuse.
Investigators tracked the account to May’s home internet and personal cellphone, a special agent for the Department of Homeland Security said during May’s detention hearing.
The account sent more than 1,100 messages, mostly explicit in nature, during the five days it was in use, and had saved 220 different videos and images depicting child sexual abuse, an investigator testified.
A previous defense attorney, who no longer represents May, suggested in a hearing soon after his arrest that a political enemy may have accessed his home internet using a password in the background of a photo May’s wife posted on Facebook.
Smith is also fighting to have the search warrant thrown out that investigators used to seize 35 electronics from May’s home last August, she said Wednesday.
Smith did not give a reason for the motion, but U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie will hear arguments on the issue next month, she said.
If convicted, May could face between five and 20 years in prison for each of the 10 charges he faces, Currie said.
Convictions on all 10 counts could mean a minimum prison sentence of 50 years and a maximum of 200 years. If released, May could spend between five years and the rest of his life under supervision, Currie said.
May could also have to pay thousands of dollars in fines if a jury finds him guilty. Each count could come with a penalty of up to $250,000, as well as additional fines of $5,000 and up to $35,000 for each count on which he is found guilty, Currie said.
A judge could waive any additional fines if May is convicted, depending on his income and ability to pay. Whether May would be able to pay additional fines is unclear.
A public attorney was assigned to represent him after he told a federal magistrate his wife owned their home and his only asset was a pickup truck.
Regardless, May would have to pay something if found guilty, since a penalty of at least $3,000 is required in all cases involving child sexual abuse material, Currie said.
“There are significant financial issues here in these cases,” Currie said.
May remains in the Edgefield County Detention Center, where he is being held without bond.
The election to fill May’s seat will take place Dec. 23. Filing will open Aug. 29, and a primary election will take place Oct. 21, if necessary, according to the state Election Commission.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_0994-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-20 12:57:47.440786

A Kansas City man riding his bike along the Trolley Track Trail felt his initial fear confirmed when a Waldo area construction site came into view.
He saw handcuffed laborers, men he assumed to be Latino, being questioned by other men in tactical gear.

“My full intent was to stop and let them know that someone was watching,” said the man, who didn’t want to be publicly identified.
He wasn’t the only one who saw what many assumed was an immigration raid in the heart of Waldo in mid-July.
Others shared their outrage on social media. And the man riding his bike took photos and a video that showed some of the men wore tactical gear marked U.S. Marshals Service.
But was it an immigration raid?

The construction workers were released when a small crowd of bystanders gathered, some drawn from businesses along Wornall Road. Tensions quickly escalated as bystanders began yelling and cursing. At least one agent who identified himself as a U.S. marshal cursed back, said the man who took photos.
The incident is now part of a growing list being documented by local advocates for immigrant rights. They’re tracking dozens of possible immigration actions, watching for patterns and trying to tamp down unsubstantiated rumors before they spread.
The Waldo incident has not been confirmed as an immigration raid.
So far, only about a dozen incidents in the Kansas City area have been verified as immigration enforcement actions since President Donald Trump took office in late January, according to Advocates for Immigrant Rights and Reconciliation, or AIRR.
Many more reported incidents could not be verified, or simply turned out to be someone receiving a ticket for a traffic violation, with no issues involving immigration.
 The value of the ‘silent observer’

Amid the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign, civil rights advocates nationally and locally are emphasizing training for bystanders and a heightened attention to nonviolent protests.
Janet Murguía understands that Latinos and other allies are angry about reports of federal officials arresting people at workplaces, in their homes and even when they go, as directed, to immigration court.
“But that outrage needs to be targeted in the right ways,” said Murguía, the president and CEO of UnidosUS. “It cannot give more fuel to this administration to … bring in more law enforcement.”
UnidosUS is the nation’s largest Latino civil rights and advocacy organization. The group held its annual convention in Kansas City Aug. 4-7.
Training in nonviolence while advocating for immigrant rights was a recurring theme during the conference.
The actions of even one rambunctious protester can quickly escalate and incite others. Often unsubstantiated rumors spread quickly via social media.
The Department of Homeland Security reports escalating numbers of attacks on federal immigration agents and other federal partners, which can include the U.S. Marshals Service.
A June DHS release following the outbreak of protests in Los Angeles said there had been a 413% increase in assaults against federal agents from the same time last year. It also said that agents and their families had been doxed, which has been a reason that the government has given to defend the use of face masks.
The fact that a bystander had a child present during the July arrests of 11 workers at two area El Toro Loco restaurants was also called out in a Homeland Security statement.
“ICE was carrying out a criminal federal search warrant to rescue victims of human trafficking. Extremists and activists, one with their child in tow, tried to interfere with law enforcement by storming the restaurant, calling law enforcement Nazis, and attempting to keep officers from leaving the scene,” said DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin.
“Unfortunately, these types of smears and obstruction to law enforcement operations are becoming more and more common. Our brave ICE law enforcement are facing an 830% increase in assaults against them as they carry out operations.”
Statements by Homeland Security consistently highlight the administration’s goal of targeting violent criminals.
But the government’s own data shows that less than half of people arrested from late January through late June had been convicted of a crime, according to information gathered by the Deportation Data Project through Freedom of Information Act requests and analysis by news organizations like Stateline.
And among those who do have criminal convictions, for many it was for a less serious issue, like a traffic conviction.
Only 7% had been convicted of a violent crime, according to Stateline.
A person’s immigration status is a civil matter.
In training sessions, Kansas City area organizers seek to redirect those who might become agitated when interacting with federal immigration agents or other law enforcement.
If a volunteer demonstrates a fervent desire to fight fascism, or to accuse people of being Nazis, they probably need to reassess before becoming involved.
There’s more at stake with local organizing than what some people who want to lend support as an ally might realize, said immigrant rights advocates and immigration attorneys.
For example, videos taken by bystanders could be useful in legal cases challenging the constitutionality of the tactics being used by federal agents during arrests.
But videos with people screaming slurs at federal agents can be less useful.
Such actions can also undercut the philosophy of nonviolence.
Civil rights struggles require a consistent, long-term strategy to succeed, said Trinidad Raj Molina, an organizer with Advocates for Immigrant Rights and Reconciliation.
Dramatic actions might feel good in the moment, Molina said, but aren’t a part of strategies designed to bring significant social change.
“Being a silent observer is important,” said Molina.
 Lessons on nonviolence

Murguía is leaning into her friendship with the late civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis for guidance.
Through the years, she heard the Georgia congressman speak about nonviolence to groups large and small, often emphasizing lessons he learned over a lifetime fighting for voting rights, desegregation and so much more.
“I remember repeatedly hearing him say that civil disobedience requires courage,” she said. “And that the part of courage that people don’t understand is being brave enough not to respond with violence, and how critically important it is to understand the role of nonviolent civil disobedience and peaceful protests.”
UnidosUS is partnering with other national organizations like the National Urban League to call for more immigrant rights training sessions around such disciplines and to learn from the civil rights legacy of the African American community.
Martin Luther King Jr. taught that nonviolence is not passive. It focuses on injustice, rather than individuals. It’s a way of life, not a tactic.
People today might not realize how much training was involved in some of the most famous civil rights actions of the 1950s, Murguía said.
Murguía is especially aware that protesters today might be goaded to react, which can then be used as a pretext for a more militarized response by government officials.
Congress recently authorized more than $170 billion for increased immigration enforcement, which is more than the combined budgets of all other federal law enforcement agencies, Murguía said.
That point was also underscored by labor rights leader David Huerta, who said it is imperative that people who protest are disciplined and committed to nonviolence and understand how to deescalate situations.
Huerta spoke on a panel during the UnidosUS conference in Kansas City.
“When you do see violence, you have to deescalate it,” he said. “Because it can escalate so quickly.”
Huerta is president of the Service Employees International Union of California and first came to prominence through the Justice for Janitors campaign.
Huerta was recently arrested during immigrant rights protests in Los Angeles, spending three days in jail before being released on bond and charged with conspiracy to impede an officer.
He said it is too easy for government officials to “flip the narrative” on people who protest immigration arrests.
“We can’t let this sense of intimidation keep us from doing what we have to do,” Huerta said. “But we definitely have to be intelligent and smart about it, and we have to be really disciplined and always engaged in nonviolence.”
AIRR doesn’t want to dissuade people from getting involved as allies. It strives to empower immigrants, in particular.
All reported information is helpful, advocates said. For instance, AIRR has noted that more foreign cars are now being used in enforcement actions.
There are also instances of federal agents being seen driving around apartment complexes in Olathe in the early morning hours, and in neighborhoods in the Northeast section of Kansas City.
The assumption is that they might be searching for people to arrest on their way to work.
More than 2,400 people have been trained regionally in know-your-rights sessions. There are also guidelines on what to do if you believe you are witnessing a raid, including how to document it, while staying safe.
Local training sessions are similar to those made available by UnidosUS and other national organizations.
In the case of the Waldo worksite, a wrought iron fence separated the half-dozen people who tried to confront the U.S. Marshals Service.
One woman, who had come from a nearby gym, was very angry, said the man who photographed the incident.
He doesn’t regret his role. But he did worry that he might end up getting arrested as the tensions escalated.
Still, he felt an obligation to speak up as an African American, knowing that his community also had to fight for basic civil rights.
“I just felt like it’s happening right in front of my face now,” he said. “We might have kept those people from getting kidnapped.”

(Photo via Getty Images)The announced merger of companies that own local TV stations will have a huge impact around the country, but especially in Des Moines where the combined company would own three local stations, including two of the top three.
Nexstar already owns the largest number of local television stations in the country, more than 200. It owns WHO-TV Channel 13 in Des Moines. It announced plans Tuesday to buy Tegna, which owns 64 stations, including WOI-TV Channel 5 and KCWI-TV Channel 23 in Des Moines.
(For context, Tegna, is a 2015 spin-off from Gannett, which owns the Des Moines Register. Back then, newspaper profits had slumped so badly they were dragging down the value of Gannett’s profitable TV holdings, prompting the company to split its print and broadcast divisions.)
If regulators approve, Nexstar would grow to a huge portfolio of about 265 stations. It would also blow right past ownership limits that the FCC has placed on stations for decades.
Existing rules prohibit any station owner from reaching more than 39% of U.S households. The rules also prohibit any company from owning two of the top four rated stations in any market. A super-sized Nexstar will need federal approval to own both WHO and WOI, the second- and third-rated stations in Des Moines.
The TV business has changed
Station owners have been demanding an end to the limits for years. They argue tech giants like Meta and Google have sucked up so many advertising dollars that it’s unfair to artificially limit TV station consolidation.
Ted Stephens, retired general manager at KDSM-TV in Des Moines, told me television streaming has siphoned off many viewers. “The broadcast business model has completely deteriorated over the last few years,” Stephens said. “Station mergers like Nextstar/Tegna are inevitable in order for the majority of lower-rated stations to survive.”
But media consolidation critics say these mergers come at a real cost to local communities, where fewer independent stations mean fewer unique voices, especially when it comes to local news.
President Donald Trump’s Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr has been advocating removing or at least loosening these so-called ownership caps. Now he has the chance to do it.
Possible outcomes
Here are three possible outcomes if Nexstar is allowed to keep WHO, WOI, and KCWI:
1. The FCC says no: Regulators could decide that’s simply too much, and require Nexstar to sell off one of the stations to a different company.
2. Business as usual. Nexstar could continue to operate all three stations independently, maintaining separate staff, programming, and newsrooms.
3. Consolidation: Nexstar could find ways to combine station operations in some ways and trim expenses. It could decide to end WOI’s newscasts and simply simulcast WHO’s news on WOI. It could also do something short of that, like keep separate anchor teams and studios, but have reporters in the field produce stories for both stations’ newscasts.

That last scenario would impact news consumers the most. Although WOI’s newscasts have historically garnered much lower ratings than KCCI or WHO, it’s still an independent voice in the community. If you, your company or your organization have a story to tell, and KCCI or WHO decline, there’s a chance WOI might do the story. Under scenario #3, that would disappear.


A single owner of WHO, WOI and KCWI could also work in tandem to increase advertising rates in the market, which your local car dealer or grocery store would not be happy about.
And let’s not forget the dreaded blackouts. When cable or streaming companies (like YouTube TV) can’t reach a deal with station owners, stations go dark — sometimes for weeks or months. WOI was off Mediacom for a full year over a retransmission dispute.
With all three stations under one roof, Nexstar would have even more leverage in these negotiations. If those negotiations go south, viewers could lose not just one channel — but three.
To be clear, none of this is guaranteed. Multiple regulators will need to approve the Nexstar-Tegna deal. But the pressure is mounting — from broadcasters who want to consolidate, from regulators debating old rules in a digital age, and from viewers and businesses who may be caught in the crossfire.
This likely is only the first of what could be a significant wave of deals. The media landscape in Des Moines — and across the country — could soon look very different.

Nancy Mace of being a sexual predator has been charged with domestic violence in a case unrelated to the congresswoman’s accusations.
Sullivan’s Island police arrested Eric Bowman, a 45-year-old software developer, on felony charges Wednesday stemming from a 2016 in-home video in which a man can be heard hitting a woman.
  Eric Bowman turned himself in to police on Tuesday, April 8, 2025, on domestic violence charges. (Photo courtesy of Charleston County Sheriff’s Department)
Bowman was booked at the Charleston County jail at 6:22 a.m.
He could not be immediately reached through his lawyer.
The video surfaced as part of another investigation, The Post and Courier reported.
It was released with the victim’s consent, according to Mace.
“This video is hard to watch. It’s gut wrenching,” the 1st District congresswoman wrote Monday.
Mace posted his arrest on social media Wednesday.
“May he be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” she wrote.
For most of the nine-minute video circulated on social media, the room is dark. An unseen man and woman can be heard arguing followed by a slapping sound.
“Ow! Oh my God!” the woman is heard saying. “What the f*** is wrong with you?”
A second slapping sound is heard followed by the woman saying the man, who she calls Eric, had kicked her in the face for putting a blanket on him. The two continue arguing and the man yells at the woman to leave the room.
The woman is heard coughing and crying as the man keeps telling her to leave.
The lights come on and the two appear nude. The man takes the woman’s phone. She tries to get it back and stop him from leaving the room. The man appears to grab her by the hair and push her to the floor. He then walks out. When he returns, he tells her that her phone is in the middle of the street.
Later in the video, she says he kicked her, punched her, choked her, hit her in the face and threw her into the wall.
“Why did you do this?” she asks.
“I didn’t do s***,” he responds.
1 of the 4 men accused by Mace in floor speech arrested on other charges. He denies them.

Bowman already faces a harassment charge following his April arrest in a case involving his estranged wife.
In that case, he is accused of placing a tracking device on his wife’s car, the SC Daily Gazette previously reported. A separate charge of stalking in that incident was dismissed at an Aug. 18 preliminary hearing.
Bowman, who lives on Sullivan’s Island, has denied those allegations.
Mace filed a defamation lawsuit against Bowman in May, accusing him of “repeatedly and maliciously” damaging her reputation following her hour-long speech in February. She is separately being sued for defamation by another man she named.

The months ahead could feature court battles, a hefty signature-gathering effort and a bruising campaign to sway voters. 
The post Rent control measure triggers ballot eligibility debate appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","STATE HOUSE, BOSTON, AUG. 19, 2025…..The months ahead could feature court battles, a hefty signature-gathering effort and a bruising campaign to sway voters. And with all of that still on the horizon, supporters and opponents of reviving rent control are already waging an opening battle over ballot eligibility.
A constellation of think tanks and real estate industry groups wrote to the attorney general’s office last week, urging officials to block a proposed initiative petition that would bring back caps on rent increases.
At the same time, the measure’s backers laid out a case for why the ballot question should be allowed to advance to the next milestone along the lengthy road to the 2026 ballot.
If organizers can clear the numerous and steep hurdles ahead, the measure seeking to impose a limit on rent increases statewide could represent one of the most intense political fights in recent years.
Opponents are fighting the proposal by seeking to have it tossed at the first juncture, lodging arguments that question backers dubbed “erroneous.”
On behalf of a trio of powerful real estate organizations, legal firm CEK Boston wrote to Campbell’s office last week arguing that the measure should not be certified because it would “deprive individuals of their right to receive compensation for their private property” and would touch on religion.
The section of the state Constitution outlining the initiative petition process prohibits any measure “that relates to religion, religious practices or religious institutions.” CEK Boston, which is led by former First Assistant Attorney General Tom Kiley, noted in its memo that the proposal would exclude “dwelling units in facilities operated solely for educational, religious, or non-profit purposes” from rent control.
“On its face, therefore, Petition 25-21 relates to religion, religious practices or religious institutions,” said the memo prepared on behalf of NAIOP, the Massachusetts Association of Realtors and the Greater Boston Real Estate Board.
The Pioneer New England Legal Foundation and the Fiscal Alliance Foundation filed their own letters with Campbell’s office on Friday urging officials not to certify the measure as ballot eligible. They similarly argued that the introduction of a statewide cap on rent increases would deny landlords or mortgage bondholders of their right to return on property investment.
The Fiscal Alliance Foundation pointed to a 1998 Supreme Judicial Court decision invalidating a ballot question that would have scrapped Massachusetts Turnpike tolls, in which justices concluded that it would have improperly eliminated part of bondholders’ security interest backed by toll revenues.
PNELF also argued that the question improperly combines disparate topics — a frequent line of attack for ballot question opponents — by simultaneously proposing a limit on rent hikes as well as a system of penalties for violations of the proposed law.
“The Initiative Provision yokes a limitation on rent increases with Chapter 93A punishment, a law permitting treble damages and attorneys fees with no clear standards for whether a minor or unintentional violation will result in the imposition of such monetary punishment,” the organization wrote.
It’s not uncommon for both opponents and proponents to make their cases directly to the attorney general’s team before certification decisions are issued. The office encourages feedback, and memoranda of law were due by Friday, though it’s unclear exactly how many comments officials received on other proposals this cycle.
While officials wade through the arguments for spiking the rent control measure, they also have in hand a case for certifying it as meeting constitutional requirements.
Proponents in their own memo to the AG’s office contend that “a plain reading” of the measure “makes clear that it does not cover any excluded topic,” such as religion, judges or courts, or appropriating state dollars.
They also rebutted the argument opponents raised about infringing upon the right to receive “compensation for private property appropriated to public use.”
“Though the language of the petition makes plain there is no ‘appropriation of property for public use,’ some opponents have suggested that any attempt to regulate rent increases amounts to a regulatory taking and therefore violates this principle,” wrote the Mass. Law Reform Institute’s Andrea Park and Mark Martinez and Joel Feldman of the firm Heisler, Feldman & Ordorica. “This assertion is erroneous as well as misleading, as courts have consistently determined that regulations on rent increases do not constitute regulatory takings. Indeed, Massachusetts has had, and continues to have, numerous rent regulations that have survived judicial scrutiny, including challenges to prior rent control schemes as well as current manufactured housing rent control laws.”
The question being pushed by the advocacy group Homes for All would limit annual rent increases for most units to either the annual Consumer Price Index increase or 5%, whichever is lower.
Backers say skyrocketing housing costs are putting excess strain on many Bay State tenants, preventing younger residents from saving enough to purchase a home or displacing older adults on fixed incomes.
Voters in 1994 narrowly approved a ballot question prohibiting rent control across the state.
Two years ago, the attorney general’s office certified a rent control question as eligible to advance. That measure would have revived the practice as a local option rather than a blanket policy statewide, and its sponsors pulled the plug before the deadline to file voter signatures.
The attorney general’s review, which is set to be complete by Sept. 3, is the first hurdle for the 47 proposed laws and constitutional amendments filed this cycle. Once a question is deemed eligible, its backers will need to collect signatures from nearly 75,000 registered voters and file those with local elections officials by Nov. 19, a tall task that typically whittles the field down.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Gov. Dan McKee’s campaign manager has left the job less than three months after he was hired.
“The McKee campaign and Rob Silverstein have mutually agreed to part ways,” Mike Trainor, a spokesperson for the campaign, said in a statement shared via text message Tuesday. “Both sides wish each other well. The governor remains focused on serving the people of Rhode Island and continuing to run a strong reelection campaign to keep delivering results for working families.”
Trainor did not provide additional details on the reason for the split.
Silverstein also declined to comment when reached by phone Wednesday except to confirm that he was no longer working for McKee.
Silverstein was unveiled as McKee’s new campaign manager in early June alongside a campaign finance director, both of whom McKee lauded for their experience. A New York native, Silverstein came to Rhode Island from a policy director post with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, whose 2022 campaign also featured Silverstein. At the time of Silverstein’s hiring for McKee’s campaign, Hochul called Silverstein a “key” and “trusted” member of her team and critical to helping the Democratic Party in New York.
McKee was already grappling with poor polling numbers when Silverstein was hired. Criticism was further cemented by a pair of new polls in July which put the governor’s approval rating at 25%.
McKee remains the only declared candidate for the 2026 gubernatorial race, though his 2022 primary rival, Helena Buonanno Foulkes, is widely expected to mount a comeback challenge next year. Other names floated, but unconfirmed, for the race include House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and 2022 Republican candidate Ashley Kalus.
Both Foulkes and Shekarchi continue to trounce McKee in fundraising, based on second-quarter campaign finance reports submitted to the Board of Elections on July 31. Shekarchi ended the quarter with $3.8 million cash on hand — the largest balance of any state elected official — while Foulkes finished with a $2.1 million balance. McKee ended the same quarter with $879,000 cash on hand.

(Getty Images)New Jersey could save hundreds of millions of dollars each year by slimming generous public worker health plans or by increasing members’ share of costs, but no other proposals would alone save enough to achieve a $200 million cut called for by language in the state budget, the state’s actuary said.
Proposals pitched by the Murphy administration to reduce costs could generate verifiable savings, said Aon, the state’s actuary, but the same could not be said of nearly every competing cost-saving proposal submitted by unions. The few labor proposals that would generate verifiable cost savings fell far short of the reduction levels called for by the budget, Aon said.
New Jersey’s public worker health plans are in distress, their premiums driven up by inflation, growing utilization, and municipal departures in its local government part that increase risk and push premiums yet higher.
Aon said a recent administration proposal to eliminate all existing public plans and replace them with ones that carry lower actuarial values — the share of medical spending paid for by a health plan, rather than workers — could save the state between $135 million and $304 million a year across active and retired populations, depending on which new plans were chosen.
“We appreciate the plan actuary’s analysis of both the State and Labor’s savings proposals and look forward to continuing our work with all parties to reach an agreement,” said Tyler Jones, a spokesperson for Gov. Phil Murphy.
Existing New Jersey health plans carry actuarial values between 93% and 98%, though most members are enrolled in plans at the higher end of that range, according to a Treasury report released in May. The state’s proposed plans would carry actuarial values between 88% and 94.5%.
The plans supported by the Murphy administration typically feature higher deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums and in many cases would set copays at a higher level than under existing public worker health plans.
A 2023 plan comparison conducted by Aon found comparable large public employee health plans in the mid-Atlantic region had actuarial values between 93.6% and 96.9%.
Language in this year’s state budget requires labor and administration officials to submit proposals that would reduce costs by at least $100 million in the first six months of 2026, annualized to $200 million a year. The budget calls for savings to be identified only in the state worker part of the State Health Benefits Program, not in the part of the program that covers local public employees.
An administration proposal that would raise members’ in- and out-of-network copays by $1,000 could also achieve significant savings, actuaries said. That change alone would save the state $213 million each year, according to Aon.
For a range of reasons, Aon said it could not weigh the cost savings of nearly every proposal submitted by unions, a fact union officials said should anger New Jersey taxpayers.
“It’s no surprise that the actuary hand-picked by the State would sign off on their own recommendations, ignoring or outright attempting to discredit good-faith proposals we’ve made to put a stop to this,” said Billy Gallagher, assistant to the vice president at CWA District 1 (the CWA is the largest union of state workers).
The actuary identified cost savings for only two union proposals: one that would encourage members to move to lower-cost, high-deductible plans by offering lower contribution rates, and another that would raise copays for anti-obesity GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy to $35 or $50.
Aon said moving 10% of enrollees to higher deductible plans would save between $4 and $7 million annually, though they warned the incentives needed to encourage that movement would denude any budget benefits.
“These additional costs could significantly offset the projected savings,” the actuary wrote.
Raising copays for GLP-1 drugs would save $4 million or $20 million a year, depending on whether copays moved to $35 or $50, Aon said.
For every other solution raised by unions, the actuary said a lack of information, the limited time it was given to review proposals, existing contractual obligations, or the uncertainty of future circumstances left it unable to accurately predict savings.
Aon said the unions’ proposal for reference-based pricing — a policy long-sought by labor that would set health care prices to 200% of Medicare rates — could generate savings if properly implemented, but warned many health care providers were not contractually obligated to accept those rates and could seek higher payments.
Other administration proposals would reduce costs by smaller amounts that, by themselves, would not be enough to reach the required level of cuts, Aon said.
Increasing prescription drug co-pays and requiring members to use generic drugs could save $47 million a year, while excluding coverage for GLP-1 drugs in almost all cases would reduce plan costs for active members by $48 million annually.
“Every idea that shifts costs to workers while propping up the insane price increases charged by the carriers and (pharmacy benefit managers) — those ideas were scored favorably,” Gallagher said.
Requiring public worker spouses to pay $50 to enroll in the State Health Benefits Program could save $26 million, and a proposal to eliminate all but a handful of existing public plans would achieve the same savings, according to Aon.
An administration proposal to limit annual physical therapy and chiropractic visits would save just $6 million a year, Aon said.
The committee tasked with designing State Health Benefits Program plans is due to meet to vote on the proposals next week, but that body’s membership is equally split between administration and union members, and the panel is likely to deadlock. If it doesn’t reach an agreement by Sept. 30, the decision falls to state lawmakers.
But if legislators pass no bill addressing health benefit costs by Dec. 1, a single representative from the unions and administration would be tasked with cost savings. The nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services must select a tiebreaker if no agreement is reached by Dec. 15.

(Courtesy of Nebraska Department of Correctional Services)LINCOLN, Nebraska — This state’s version of the so-called “Alligator Alcatraz” federal immigration detention center is being created in the roughly 7,500-resident city of McCook, Gov. Jim Pillen confirmed.
His announcement Tuesday was part of a multi-pronged push to support the Trump administration and U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s ramped-up approach to deportation.
“We want President Trump to know that Nebraska is supportive and grateful for his ongoing, critical work with Secretary Noem to arrest and deport” migrants who commit crimes, Pillen said in a statement.
 Sparks criticism

He said the assistance Nebraska offered to the Trump administration from the state and its law enforcement agencies was about “keeping Nebraskans and Americans across our country safe.”
Others, including some Nebraska lawmakers, criticized the state’s participation.
State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha, whose district includes the food plant where a high-profile immigration raid on June 10 arrested 76 undocumented workers, said she was furious at the prospect of Nebraska becoming a home to a facility modeled after Alligator Alcatraz, the name given by Florida Republicans to an Everglades detention center.
She pledged protests all over the state, adding: “I don’t feel that’s an appropriate way for the immigrants to be treated. I’m pissed.”
State Sen. Dunixi Guereca of Omaha said the Governor’s Office had not shared details with him, including the type of funds or labor force numbers involved. Guereca said he saw better uses for the funds, wherever they might originate.
“We need to focus on building a stronger Nebraska for all,” he said. “Instead we’re ripping families apart and wreaking terror and havoc on a hard-working community that just wants to provide a better life for the next generation of Nebraskans.”
 No state expense

State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee, said he was privy to a quick briefing on the state’s immigration enforcement efforts. He said he learned the federal government will fully reimburse Nebraska for costs, with reimbursement rates anticipated to exceed the daily costs.
Costs wouldn’t be passed on to Nebraskans, he said, adding that it’s still too early to quantify any potential savings through reduced state spending.
“I’m supportive of the president enforcing the law,” Clements said.
He said he was told the facility was to be used for low- to medium-security risk detainees.
“I was pleased that the McCook people wouldn’t be exposed to a higher level of security than what they currently have,” Clements added.
State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil, who represents the McCook area, told the Examiner he was informed about the ICE plans “as soon as the governor knew.”
Murman said the people in his district are “generally in support of what the president is doing,” but said he figures some people “have some concerns.”
“President Trump does move quickly on everything he does. … He’s moving quickly to get his policies in place,” Murman said. “And that includes what he’s doing out here with the facility in McCook.”
A Homeland Security news release labeled the facility the “Cornhusker Clink” and said it would house criminal ICE detainees — “the worst of the worst.”
“This agreement was made possible by the One Big Beautiful Bill,” the statement said. “This law fully funded the 287(g) program and provided funding to secure 80,000 new beds for ICE to utilize when detaining and deporting the worst of the worst.”
It went on to say: “Thanks to Governor Pillen for his partnership …. If you are in America illegally … Avoid arrest and self deport now using the CBP Home App.”
 Midwestern hub for ICE

Nebraska’s Correctional Services Director Rob Jeffreys, in a news conference at the Capitol, said the facility won’t house the “worst of the worst” but would be used for detainees at the “low level and medium.”
Jeffreys said the facility would be the Midwestern hub for ICE. He added that the nearby McCook Ben Nelson Airport could be used for deportations, but the logistics are still being worked out.
A handful of protesters gathered outside of the press conference that included Jeffreys, Nebraska State Patrol Superintendent Bryan Waugh, and Nebraska National Guard Maj. Gen. Craig Strong.
“It’s incredibly frustrating that no matter how much it looks like people are saying, ‘Stop’ — no one actually in power is doing what needs to be done and stopping it,” said Jaci Vetro, a Lincoln resident.
Nebraska U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., said he views the move as a way to support the local community and keep jobs in McCook. “I support President Trump’s actions to protect our communities and Gov. Pillen’s work to bring DHS investment to Nebraska,” Ricketts said in a statement.
The Homeland Security statement said that the Nebraska facility marks the third state partnership to expand ICE detention space “following Alligator Alcatraz and Speedway Slammer.”
Speedway Slammer is their nickname for ICE’s new facility in Bunker Hill, Indiana, referencing the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, which is about 75 miles away.
 More partnerships

In addition to the McCook center, Pillen announced two other state-federal partnerships with Homeland Security.
For one, the Nebraska National Guard will provide about 20 soldiers to help Nebraska-based ICE agents carry out their duties. Training is to begin within the next week.
Also at Pillen’s direction, the Nebraska State Patrol announced it would sign a 287(g) agreement that empowers state troopers to help ICE arrest migrants in the country without authorization who break the law.
So named for its section of immigration law, the often-controversial program delegates state and local law enforcement officers authority to perform immigration officer functions under the federal agency’s direction and oversight.
Pillen turned to an arrest earlier this summer in Omaha when Nebraska law enforcement agents worked with ICE to arrest a person ICE described as a “drug-trafficking kingpin and murderer.”
“This stuff hits close to home — and hits every corner of this state and country,” he said. “Government’s most important job is to keep us safe, and that’s why the State of Nebraska, under my leadership, is partnering with President Trump.”
Three Nebraska county sheriff’s offices are authorized for the 287(g) program — Brown, Dakota and Wheeler.
 280 beds

The Homeland Security and Pillen confirmations of the Nebraska ICE facility revealed that the existing Work Ethic Camp in McCook would be converted and provide capacity for 300 migrants. It was built to house up to 200 people in a medium-security facility operated by the Nebraska state prison system.
Pillen, who also held a press conference in McCook, and was greeted by a group of anti-ICE protesters, said that about 85 workers employed by the Corrections Department at the Work Ethic Camp would remain under the contract arrangement that pays the state.
He said migrants held at the facility would likely be there five to 50 days and that there would be “a lot of activity” at the nearby airport removing people from the United States.
Gene Weedin, a McCook City Council member, said he was still learning details and forming an opinion about the center coming to his city. Nebraska owns nearly 45 acres at the McCook site.
Weedin said Pillen was in McCook with Corrections Director Jeffreys over the weekend talking to various local officials. Weedin’s understanding is that the state prison facility would stop operating in its current form, start functioning as the federal immigration detention facility, and that those now in the facility would be transferred to other places.
He said the people housed at the center have contributed to the community by picking up trash, putting up annual Christmas decorations, and doing other public service.
“There are just a lot of questions,” said Weedin.
 Staffing shortage

Nebraska has historically struggled to hire enough staff to use the McCook center as it was originally intended, to reform younger men who’ve committed crimes by assigning them jobs and tasks. The camp focuses its counseling and other efforts on encouraging behavior changes to reduce recidivism.
It is the least crowded of Nebraska’s overcrowded adult prison facilities, running a daily census of about 184 in Fiscal Year 2025. But it is also one of the prison facilities with the greatest need for additional staffing. The department’s census says it was staffed to house an average of about 125 people in FY 2025.
State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North Omaha said on social media that Nebraska “prisons are already overcrowded and inhumane. “
“And our state faces a budget crisis. We cannot afford this,” he said.
Cristine Schwartz, the public information officer at the McCook Work Ethic Camp, referred calls to a state Correctional Services spokeswoman, who did not immediately return calls.
State Sen. Teresa Ibach of Sumner, who represents part of west-central Nebraska outside of McCook, said she only just learned about the ICE effort and was “still gathering more information.”
The state has been working around the Douglas County Jail in Omaha no longer actively participating in ICE detentions. Detainees from eastern Nebraska have been sent to Council Bluffs, Iowa, and as far away as the Lincoln County Jail in North Platte — where the 76 workers arrested in the high-profile immigration raid at Omaha’s Glenn Valley plant were transported. Many are still there.
 Other ICE contracts

ICE also plans to contract with jails in eastern Nebraska’s Sarpy and Cass counties for 30 beds each and the Washington County Jail for 15, according to ICE documents the Washington Post obtained.
Pillen’s announcement is apparently Nebraska’s contribution to a plan that the federal documents showed would open or expand 125 immigration detention facilities this year.
In its detention expansion strategy, the Trump administration has revived other dormant prisons, repurposed military bases and secured partnerships with private prison contractors, local sheriffs and Republican governors to house its record number of detainees, the Post reported.
By January, the documents indicate, ICE would have capacity to hold more than 107,000 people, up from close to 50,000 now. The documents, last updated July 30, reflected ICE intentions to rely increasingly on makeshift “soft-sided” structures that could be built in a few weeks and taken down as easily. The government also plans to make more room for detaining parents and children.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska is among critics of the Pillen plan, calling it “a new low point and way out of step with where most Nebraskans are on this issue.”
“Imagine hearing about the cruel rights violations happening in other states’ ICE detention sites and thinking that we need our own heartland horror,” said Mindy Rush Chipman, executive director of ACLU Nebraska.
Nebraska Democratic Party officials described creation of the detention facility in McCook as a “bend the knee” moment by top Republicans in Nebraska, and the governor’s participation as disgusting.
“They promised to go after criminals and instead have locked up hardworking moms and dads who contribute their skills to our agricultural economy,” said Jane Kleeb, state party chair. “Creating fear and division … does not have to be the Cornhusker way.”
Nebraska Appleseed called the governor’s cooperation part of a “harmful, dangerous and rapid expansion” of detainment camps that “repeat a deeply ugly pattern of history.”
Darcy Tromanhauser, the advocacy agency’s immigrants and communities program director, urged officials instead to update immigration laws.
“Nebraskans want policy change, not punishment,” she said.
Earlier this month, Noem revealed in an interview with CBS News that Nebraska was being considered as a home to one of the state-run, federally funded migrant detention centers that the Trump administration hoped to launch across the country in the likeness of the one dubbed Alligator Alcatraz.
Noem said she had already appealed to governors and state leaders. Strimple acknowledged the possibility at the time, saying the governor would “make details public at the appropriate time.”

The rates are consistent with Internal Revenue Service mileage rates for business, moving, medical and charitable purposes, according to an agency press release. The 2025 rate is 70 cents per mile driven for business use, 21 cents for medical and moving purposes, and 14 cents per mile driven in service of charitable organizations. 
The rates apply per mile for deductible expenses paid or incurred on or after Jan. 1, 2025. They reflect costs associated with operating a vehicle, including gas prices, vehicle maintenance, insurance and depreciation, according to the release
Act 614 of 2025 grants DFA the authority to revise these rates via a proclamation. The new state law prohibits the per-mile deduction from exceeding $1 per mile and requires DFA’s secretary to set the per-mile amount as close to the per-mile deduction most recently set by the IRS “as is fiscally responsible without causing an undue hardship on taxpayers.” 
The law also requires the secretary to issue a proclamation no later than 30 days after the IRS deduction is changed. DFA issued its proclamation on Aug. 14, according to the release.

Josh Stein urged residents subject to evacuation orders to leave before conditions deteriorate. (Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)Gov. Josh Stein warned coastal residents of North Carolina to “take action now before it’s too late” Wednesday to prepare for the arrival of Hurricane Erin, and to follow any evacuation orders.
Stein declared a statewide state of emergency on Tuesday in anticipation of the storm, currently a Category 2 hurricane, and local states of emergency are in effect in Dare, Hyde, and Currituck counties. In addition, residents of Ocracoke and Hatteras islands are subject to mandatory evacuation orders.
“If you are under an evacuation order, take action now before it’s too late,” Stein said Wednesday morning. “You can find shelter at the state-operated disaster shelter located at 113 Wilcox Street in Warrenton, North Carolina. Pets are allowed at the shelter.”
While the center of the hurricane is forecast to remain over the Atlantic, the National Hurricane Center projects that tropical storm-force winds will hit the North Carolina coast as soon as 2 p.m., but likely closer to 8 p.m. Much of the coast is subject to a Tropical Storm Warning, with winds of up to 35 to 45 mph forecast and wind gusts of 50 to 55 mph possible.
The hurricane can also generate tornadoes, and produced a minor EF0 tornado on the beach in Brunswick County on Monday. The most severe of the storm’s impacts to North Carolina are predicted to come Wednesday evening and Thursday morning, Stein said.

Emergency Management director Will Ray warned residents not to attempt to cross flooded roadways, as it is not possible to judge the speed or depth of floodwaters, which can easily be powerful enough to sweep cars off the road.
“Hurricane Erin is already creating extremely dangerous and life-threatening rip currents for all of the North Carolina coast that will linger throughout the week,” Ray said. “We’ve seen a high number of rescues along the coast, and you should avoid swimming anywhere on the North Carolina coast right now.”
Stein echoed his warning: “No one should be in the ocean,” he said.
Ray said “extremely large, dangerous waves” around 20 feet high are anticipated to hit the coast as well as a storm surge of 2 to 4 feet on top of the surf. Coastal roadways in particular will likely be inundated and made impassable, especially N.C. Highway 12 and along the Outer Banks. Beaches could also see significant erosion, the officials said.
Residents can monitor the status of roads and highways on drivenc.gov, but should avoid driving through any flooding even if not reflected on the website. For information on storm conditions, evacuations, and related weather events, information is available at readync.gov/Erin.
The state has mobilized 200 members of the North Carolina National Guard and has positioned three swift water rescue teams, trained to render aid in flood conditions. The state has also received Chinook heavy-lift helicopters from Georgia if it becomes necessary to fly food and water in to stranded residents, Stein said.
Even with the resources in place, Stein urged residents to prepare disaster kits with enough food and water for three to five days for all members of the household as well as batteries, flashlights, and a battery-powered radio. He also advised residents to be wary of potential misinformation on social media, and to only follow official sources. “Please be sure to have multiple ways to receive weather alerts, especially during the overnight hours,” Ray said.
In addition, Stein said residents on the coast should have “go-bags” ready with cash, prescriptions, phone chargers, and any important personal and financial documents, in case a sudden evacuation is required. “Take photos of whatever you own that is valuable in case it gets destroyed,” he said.
Erin is the fifth named storm of this Atlantic hurricane season.

Bryant ruled last week that the cases in front of him should await an appellate court decision. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — CoreCivic and the city of Leavenworth will continue their fight over development regulations in front of a Kansas appellate court after a Leavenworth district judge decided to wait for a decision in that case.  
Judge John Bryant on Friday said the primary issues being argued in his court would be significantly affected by the case that’s being appealed. 
“The court believes that due to the pending appellate review and ongoing federal case, the court has no choice but to stay certain decisions pending the outcomes of those matters,” Bryant wrote in his decision. “The legal issues in those matters overlap the issues pending before this court to such a degree as to make them unable to be parsed.”
CoreCivic and Leavenworth city officials are arguing about the reopening of the CoreCivic prison facility, which closed in 2021. CoreCivic signed a contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to open the vacant facility to house immigration detainees. 
However, Leavenworth told CoreCivic that it needed to go through the city’s updated development process and apply for a special use permit, which would require multiple steps and include public hearings. CoreCivic contends the permit is not needed.  
Bryant also said that if the city is successful in the federal case, it would make “any decisions in this matter moot.” 
However, Bryant did dismiss one of the four counts in the case, in which Leavenworth says the CoreCivic operation creates a public nuisance. While Leavenworth “goes to great lengths to paint Defendant CoreCivic in a negative light,” Bryant said he finds those arguments are based on past complaints about the prison’s operation. 
“There can be no question that as Defendant CoreCivic’s facility currently sits, it is not a nuisance and Plaintiff pleads no facts that would portray it as such,” Bryant wrote.
Leavenworth and CoreCivic continue to stand firm in their opposing views that led them to court. 
The city believes the case is important because it needs to ensure development processes are followed, said city manager Scott Peterson. 
“That is the core argument of the City Commission,” he said. “They want to ensure that the city of Leavenworth has the right to govern development within its city limits, and that anyone looking to open a business in Leavenworth follows the process as outlined in the adopted city ordinances.”
The city doesn’t have the financial resources of CoreCivic, Peterson said. 
“However, the City Commission has made it clear that ensuring Leavenworth’s ability to govern development and hold companies like CoreCivic accountable to the City’s development regulations is money well spent,” he said. 
CoreCivic could “save all of us a lot of money” by applying for the special use permit, he added. 
The national private prison company, through spokesman Ryan Gustin, said only that it is pursuing all avenues to successfully end the legal matters so it can fulfill the ICE contract. 
“CoreCivic respects the entire judicial process, both at the state and federal level, and we welcome the opportunity to present our position to the courts,” Gustin said. 
Hearings in the appellate court case, filed by CoreCivic, have not been set. The case names the city of Leavenworth, the mayor, the mayor pro tem and three members of the city council, and it will be heard by District Judge Toby Krause. 
In its complaint, CoreCivic alleges the city is violating the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution. That clause sets federal laws as supreme over state laws.
By denying the company the ability to fulfill its ICE contract, Leavenworth is interfering with the operations of the federal government, CoreCivic’s initial filing said. 
The complaint also alleges that CoreCivic, as a contractor for the United States, is “clothed in the Federal Government’s intergovernmental immunity under the Supremacy Clause.”
Such immunity, the complaint said, stops states from regulating or discriminating against the federal government or “those with whom it deals.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Judge-John-Bryant-20250806_101143-1024x597.jpg,,,2025-08-20 11:58:40.105005

Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.



Erin McCanlies was listening to the radio one morning in April when she heard Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promising to find the cause of autism by September. The secretary of Health and Human Services said he believed an environmental toxin was responsible for the dramatic increase in the condition and vowed to gather “the most credible scientists from all over the world” to solve the mystery.
Nothing like that has ever been done before, he told an interviewer.
McCanlies was stunned. The work had been done.
“That’s exactly what I’ve been doing!” she said to her husband, Fred.
As an epidemiologist at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which Kennedy oversees, McCanlies had spent much of the past two decades studying how parents’ exposure to workplace chemicals affects the chance that they will have a child with autism. Just three weeks earlier, she’d been finalizing her fourth major paper on the topic when Kennedy eliminated her entire division. Kennedy has also overseen tens of millions of dollars in cuts to federal funding for research on autism, including its environmental causes.
For 20 years, Kennedy has espoused the debunked theory that autism is caused by vaccines, dismissing evidence to the contrary by arguing that vaccine manufacturers, researchers and regulators all have an interest in obscuring their harms.

He remains skeptical of the scientists who have been funded by his own agency to study the neurodevelopmental condition. “We need to stop trusting the experts,” he told right-wing host Tucker Carlson in a June interview, going on to suggest that previous studies that found no relationship between vaccines and autism were marred by “trickery” and researchers’ self-interest.
In contrast, Kennedy told Carlson that under his leadership, and with a new, federally funded $50 million autism research initiative, “We’re going to get real studies done for the first time.”
Some autism researchers fear that the effort will manipulate data to blame the condition on vaccines. “Kennedy has never expressed an open mind, an open attitude towards what are the fundamental causes of autism,” said Helen Tager-Flusberg, a Boston University psychologist who founded a coalition of scientists concerned about his approach to autism. In a June statement, the group said the initiative lacks transparency and that Kennedy “casually ignores decades of high quality research that preceded his oversight.”
As Kennedy promotes his new initiative, ProPublica has found that he has also taken aim at the traditional scientific approach to autism, shutting down McCanlies’ lab and stripping funding from more than 50 autism-related studies. Meanwhile, he has stood by as the Trump administration encourages the departure of hundreds of federal employees with experience studying the harm caused by environmental threats and rolls back protections from pollution and chemicals, including some linked to autism.
Kennedy did not respond to requests for an interview, and an HHS spokesperson did not answer specific questions from ProPublica, including those related to the concerns of the coalition of autism scientists. “Under the leadership of Secretary Kennedy, HHS is taking action on autism as the public health emergency it is,” the spokesperson wrote. “NIH is fully committed to leaving no stone unturned in confronting this catastrophic epidemic — employing only gold-standard, evidence-based science. The Department will follow the science, wherever it leads.”
Genetic factors account for a significant portion of autism cases. Research like the kind McCanlies and other government-funded scientists have conducted over the past two decades has established that environmental factors have a role, too, and can combine with genetics. Multiple factors can even converge within the same individual. Some of those environmental risks could be reduced by the very measures the Trump administration is rolling back.
Kennedy would have been well positioned to advocate for researchers looking into the environmental causes of autism while sitting on President Donald Trump’s cabinet.
The nephew of President John F. Kennedy and son of his former attorney general, Bobby, Kennedy spent decades as an attorney battling some of the world’s most notorious corporate polluters. Once heralded by Time Magazine as one of the “heroes for the planet,” he railed against actions by the first Trump administration, complaining in his 2017 introduction to the book “Climate in Crisis” that 33 years’ worth of his work was “reduced to ruins as the president mounted his assault on science and environmental protection.”
But recently he has remained publicly silent as the Environmental Protection Agency halts research and weakens regulations on air pollution and chemicals, including some McCanlies and her colleagues have identified as possible factors in the development of autism.
“I don’t think he’s aware of my work,” McCanlies said, “or most of the literature that’s been published on what the causes of autism are.”

McCanlies was studying how a toxic chemical, beryllium, causes chronic lung inflammation in workers when she began to think seriously about autism.
It was 2005, and her college-age stepson had a job shadowing children with autism. As he described helping them navigate playground dynamics, reminding them to return a wave or a greeting, McCanlies wondered whether their behaviors might be tied to chemicals their parents had encountered on the job. Could the exposures have altered genes their parents passed down? Could they have infiltrated the kids’ developing brains through the womb or through breast milk?
The questions remained abstract until McCanlies met another researcher named Irva Hertz-Picciotto, who had a unique data set. She had collected detailed information on the occupations of two large groups of parents: those who had children with autism and those whose kids developed neurotypically. Comparing the groups’ chemical exposures before their children were born could help illuminate causes of the condition, McCanlies realized.
Hertz-Picciotto, an environmental epidemiologist based at the University of California, Davis, was a pioneer in the search for the causes of autism. In 2009, she published a much-cited paper highlighting a sevenfold increase in diagnoses in California. While others had asserted the rise was due to increased awareness and broadened diagnostic criteria, Hertz-Picciotto found those factors could only partially explain it. She and others went on to document additional contributors to autism risk, including parental age at the time of birth, a mother’s fever during pregnancy and more traditional environmental considerations, such as chemical exposures.
McCanlies hadn’t studied autism. But she offered Hertz-Picciotto her experience in genetics and epidemiology as well as the considerable resources of her agency. NIOSH was established in 1970 to investigate the dangers of the workplace, and its statisticians and industrial hygienists were among the world’s experts on the health impacts of chemical exposures.
Their first collaboration, published in 2012, used Hertz-Picciotto’s data to see if parents of children with autism were more likely to have been exposed to chemicals already thought to be dangerous to the developing brain. The work was technical and time-consuming, but the analysis showed a clear relationship: Mothers and fathers of children with autism were more likely than the parents of unaffected children to have been exposed to solvents such as lacquer, varnish and xylene on the job. These solvents evaporate quickly and can be easily inhaled or absorbed through the skin. Chemical plant workers, painters, electricians, plumbers, construction workers, cleaners and medical personnel are among those who may be exposed to these solvents.
The sample size was small — just 174 families. But the results lined up with recent findings showing possible links between autism and exposure to metals and certain solvents during pregnancy or early childhood, including a solvent called methylene chloride. They also tracked with studies linking the chemicals to miscarriage, reproductive problems, birth defects and developmental problems other than autism.
McCanlies and Hertz-Picciotto followed up with a 2019 study that looked at more than 950 families. It showed that women exposed to solvents at work during pregnancy and the three months leading up to it were 1.5 times more likely to have a child with autism than women not exposed to the chemicals. (The study did not find a link for chemically exposed men.)
Their third study, published in 2023, took the link between solvent exposure and autism as a starting point. Using blood samples to examine the genetic makeup of the parents of children with autism, McCanlies and Hertz-Picciotto found that when exposed to solvents on the job, people with specific variants of 31 genes had an especially elevated risk of having a child with autism. Their genetic makeup appeared to increase the risk that solvents by themselves posed. Some of those 31 genes help cells connect with one another; others play a role in helping cells migrate to different areas so they can grow into the various parts of the brain; still others ensure that cells clear away toxic substances.
Researchers were also making strides under the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, a division of Health and Human Services, which has financed investigations into dozens of environmental contaminants. Several have been linked to autism, including air pollution, certain pesticides, a plastic additive known as BPA and diesel exhaust, which causes “autism-like behavioral changes” in mice. In 2021, Hertz-Picciotto co-published a study linking “forever chemicals” called PFOA and PFNA with the condition. (In 2023, a second paper also found an association with PFNA.) Other government-funded research has established a link between autism and another solvent, trichloroethylene, also known as TCE, which has been used for dry cleaning, manufacturing and degreasing machines.
Together, the results have shown that many exposures can increase the likelihood of autism, and that there can be multiple causes for any one person.
At least one exposure can have the opposite effect: A study by a researcher named Rebecca Schmidt — and funded by the NIEHS and NIH — found that a B vitamin called folic acid was associated with a significant decrease in the chances of an autism diagnosis. More than a dozen studies have since confirmed the association.
One problem hung over much of autism research. The sweeping diagnosis includes everyone from people who treasure their neurological differences to those with debilitating symptoms, including repetitive behaviors, excruciating sensitivity to touch and sounds, and difficulty responding to social situations. McCanlies and Hertz–Picciotto wondered whether certain chemicals were linked to the most severe cases or to specific symptoms.
In 2023, they set about finding out.
They were preparing to submit their study for publication when newly inaugurated Trump put Kennedy in charge of America’s health.

Despite having made chronic health conditions the focus of his agenda, Kennedy has quietly abided environmental policies that will exacerbate these problems, including autism.
The Environmental Protection Agency, under Administrator Lee Zeldin, is rolling back rules and regulations that will result in an increase in air pollution, which multiple studies have linked to autism. The agency is in the process of reversing bans on several chemicals, including TCE, one of the solvents associated with the disorder, and has told a federal court it won’t legally defend certain aspects of a ban on methylene chloride, another of the solvents linked to autism. It also began dismantling its Office of Research and Development, which has funded research into the environmental conditions contributing to autism. According to an EPA spokesperson, more than 2,300 workers have so far elected to leave the agency through Trump administration programs encouraging early retirement and resignation.
The EPA also began canceling grants, including one it had given to Schmidt, the researcher who studied the protective effect of folic acid. Schmidt had been awarded $1.3 million to determine whether air pollution from wildfires might increase the risk of various neurological conditions. Schmidt and her colleagues had just done preliminary analysis and found that there was a significant association between wildfire pollution exposure and autism when she received a letter saying that the grant was terminated because the project was “no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.” After a judge ruled in a class-action lawsuit on behalf of University of California researchers alleging their funding was unlawfully terminated, her grant was reinstated last month. But the EPA has appealed the judge’s ruling, leaving Schmidt unsure about the fate of the project.
Schmidt said there is an urgent need to finish the study and warn people about how to avoid the dangers from wildfire smoke by staying indoors and using air filters and N95 masks. “Millions of pregnant women are getting exposed as we speak,” she said.
Meanwhile, Kennedy has presided over his own gutting of research. Known for sharing videos of his bare-chested workouts, he likened his agency’s cuts to getting rid of “unhealthy fat,” but his plan to reduce the staff of HHS by 20,000 amounts to slashing the workforce by roughly a quarter, including veteran scientists. Among the divisions Kennedy eliminated was one that studied air quality and collected data on chemicals found in human blood. Some workers in the division were subsequently reinstated. After a lawsuit and pressure from Congress, HHS has also rehired some NIOSH workers, though none at the division where McCanlies worked. Those whose jobs have not been reinstated remain on administrative leave.
The reorganization plan for HHS involves consolidating the remnants of these parts of the agency, along with several others, into a new division called the Administration for a Healthy America. Asked about the transition, an HHS spokesperson told ProPublica in an email that the reorganization would save taxpayers $1.8 billion a year and that “critical programs will continue.”
Meanwhile, a ProPublica review of federal data found that more than $40 million in grants awarded by the National Institutes of Health for dozens of autism-related research projects were canceled under Kennedy’s watch. Some had been awarded to universities the administration is now targeting, while others ran afoul of Trump’s “anti-woke” priorities by mentioning gender and other verboten terms. Among them was a grant to Harvard University to use data on nearly half a million Israeli children to evaluate whether men’s exposure to air pollution affects the risk of having a child with autism. (A small number of grants have been recently reinstated.) A survey of researchers conducted by the Autism Science Foundation, which tallied cuts to training grants and the anticipated cuts to future grants over the next few years, estimated that the total loss of funding could be tens of millions more.
“We’re talking about probably decades of delays and setbacks,” said Alycia Halladay, chief science officer at the Autism Science Foundation. “To take money away from all these areas of need to focus on a question that the HHS director considers high priority seems not scientific and not the way that science is done.”

Housed under the National Institutes of Health, Kennedy’s new $50-million Autism Data Science Initiative is looking to fund two- to three-year research projects that plumb large public and private datasets to find “possible contributors to the causes of autism” as well as conduct research on existing treatments.
With the deadline for his promised discovery fast approaching, Kennedy recently acknowledged that his initial six-month timeline was overly optimistic. He told Carlson he should have “some initial indicator answers” about the causes of autism by September, his original deadline, and promised unqualified answers within another six months.
While the NIH typically releases the names of the scientists on the committees that review grant applications and the criteria they use to review them, it has not done so in this case. Nor has the agency clarified what role NIH staff will have in awarding the grants, who will make the final selection, or what terms and conditions researchers must agree to if they receive funds. HHS did not respond to ProPublica’s questions about who will make the final grant selection and why the agency has not yet made this information public, but a video NIH created for applicants of the funding acknowledges that reviews of the proposals “do not follow the traditional NIH review process.” According to the video, the process was “designed to ensure integrity, fairness and transparency.”
Hertz-Picciotto, who laments the fact that Kennedy is “shutting down good studies,” is among the researchers in her field who have decided to apply for the funding. “Some of his agenda is really ridiculous and very counterproductive,” she said. “But if something good can be done with this money, I’d like to be part of that.”
If her project is approved, she plans to hire McCanlies to consult on it.
McCanlies said she agreed to work on the project because she has complete confidence in her longtime colleague, if not the health secretary. “I don’t trust him at all,” she said.
McCanlies had never paid much attention to Kennedy — or to politics. Throughout the seven presidential administrations that governed while she had been at NIOSH, her work had been utterly uncontroversial. But weeks after his confirmation, she knew her job was in peril. She had deleted the first email she received from Trump’s Office of Personnel Management. The tone was so strange and disrespectful, hinting that she might be punished if she didn’t respond by confirming her email address, that she assumed it was a phishing attempt. By the time she received a second, suggesting that she find a “higher productivity” job in the private sector, firings and budget cuts were rolling across federal agencies.
The 58-year-old, who has short, greying hair, hazel eyes and three graduate degrees, hadn’t been ready to leave NIOSH’s Health Effects Lab in Morgantown, West Virginia, a place where she had mentored young colleagues, taught a lunchtime meditation class and helped conduct several yearslong research projects. The lab is also where she met Fred, her husband, another Ph.D. scientist who studied workplace chemical hazards. She reluctantly put in for early retirement just days before the entire lab was dissolved.
McCanlies spent her final days at NIOSH finishing her last paper, which explores the association between workplace chemicals and the severity of autism. Normally, she would have her supervisor sign off on her submission to a journal, but he had already lost his job. The rest of her colleagues were gone, too, and the lab’s hallways were empty as she gave the manuscript a final edit.
She felt proud of the study, which answered some of the questions she and Hertz-Picciotto had posed years ago. There were indeed links between exposures and the severity of autism. Parents’ exposure to plastics was “consistently and significantly associated” with lower cognitive scores in their children who had autism, increases in “aberrant behaviors” and deficits in basic life skills, the study found. The exposure was also linked to particular symptoms of autism, including social withdrawal, hyperactivity and repetitive behaviors such as hand flapping and body rocking. Higher autism severity scores and weaker daily living skills were also linked with ethylene oxide. Last year, the EPA imposed stricter limits on the chemical, which is used as a sterilizer. But the agency is now reconsidering those restrictions, and, in July, Trump exempted some of the biggest polluters from them.
The paper, which is now available as a preprint, recommended that regulatory agencies “consider increasing awareness of these hazards and make clear recommendations for implementing protective measures at the worksite.”
Having just watched so many occupational health experts forced to leave their jobs, McCanlies suspected their advice was unlikely to be heeded anytime soon.

Rep. Chris Murphy submitted his “irrevocable resignation” to House Speaker Murrell Smith, with an effective date of Jan. 5. That’s one week before the 2026 session starts.
“While this decision is bittersweet, my retirement will allow me to spend more time with my loved ones and to focus on my work outside of public office,” reads his letter, dated Tuesday.
The 57-year-old attorney, first elected in 2010, was absent for much of the 2025 session.
Before his election to the Statehouse, Murphy spent eight years on the Dorchester County Council, including one year as chairman.
In the House, he spent two years as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Following his re-election in 2022, which came shortly after a six-week stint in rehab for alcoholism, he was reassigned to the Ways and Means Committee.
The former prosecutor is the fourth legislator in two weeks to resign.
Three legislators resigned under vastly different circumstances Aug. 11.
That’s the date Smith’s office received Rep. RJ May’s resignation letter, though it was dated four days earlier. The West Columbia Republican remains in jail, where he’s been since his arrest in June on accusations of distributing videos and images of children being sexually abuse.
He has pleaded not guilty. He appeared in federal court Wednesday for a hearing to set dates on his upcoming trial.
Sen. Roger Nutt, a Spartanburg County Republican, resigned following an Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis, he wrote in his letter. Rep. Bobby Cox, a Greer Republican, then announced he will run for Nutt’s seat. He resigned from the House the same day, he said, to spare the cost of multiple special elections.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Summer heat is bearing down on U.S. prisons, where temperatures in uncooled cells can climb well into the triple digits.
Facing growing pressure from advocacy groups, lawsuits and climate projections that show hotter days ahead, some state prison systems are moving to install air conditioning and expand cooling measures — though many facilities remain years away from significant upgrades.
But in other states, such efforts have stalled or failed. That may lead to more lawsuits in the future, experts say, even as judges may raise the bar for such cases.
An emphasis on being “tough on crime” and prioritizing other public safety measures may have contributed to less attention on prison conditions in some states. In others, slowing revenue growth and pressure to rein in corrections spending could be making new investments a harder sell.
At least two states this year, Virginia and Texas, considered legislation addressing excessive heat in prisons but neither measure became law. The Texas bill would have required the state Department of Criminal Justice to purchase and install climate control systems in all of its facilities by the end of 2032. About two-thirds of the state’s correctional facilities have only partial or no air conditioning.
The measure passed the House but did not advance in the Senate before the legislature adjourned in June.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In Virginia, lawmakers approved a bill that would have required the state corrections department to install heat and air conditioning in its prisons and to ensure cell temperatures not exceed 80 degrees. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed it, citing the cost of installation and operational burdens. Youngkin also wrote that existing state corrections data “does not substantiate the claims of extreme temperatures or health risks.”
But in Delaware, the fiscal year 2026 capital budget approved last month includes $2 million in funding to install air conditioning at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center.
These changes mark the latest actions in a long-running debate over how correctional systems respond to rising summer temperatures — an issue that affects both incarcerated people and staff. Some of the policy debates and facility updates this year follow years of advocacy and litigation over the health, safety and operational challenges posed by heat in correctional settings.
Stifling prison heat used to be just a Southern problem. Not anymore.

The problem of excessive heat in prisons has persisted for decades and has unfolded alongside other challenges, including chronic understaffing and overcrowding. In some cases, these problems have led to extended facility lockdowns, even during the summer months.
“There are people working in prisons and they have the right to work in climates that are comfortable,” said Nancy La Vigne, a criminal justice researcher and dean of the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University. “When they’re not, there’s retention issues, and it’s hard to replace staff. And when you don’t replace staff, then you have challenges in maintaining the safety and security of the facility.”
In New York, for example, correctional officers staged a three-week strike earlier this year and many didn’t return to work. Some facilities now are operating with 30%-60% fewer guards than needed, resulting in some incarcerated people getting only an hour or two outside of their cells each day.
A 2023 study published in the peer-reviewed PLOS One journal found that mortality in state and private prisons rose during periods of extreme heat, with deaths increasing 3.5% on extreme heat days and up to 7.4% during three-day heat waves. Between 2001 and 2019, nearly 13,000 people died in prison during the summer months, almost half of them in the South, though the study did not determine how many of those deaths were directly attributable to heat.
Climate change is fueling longer, more intense periods of extreme heat. Exposure to extreme heat can worsen conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and asthma, and has also been linked to worsening mental health and higher suicide rates among incarcerated people.
“Average temperatures are rising, and you’re going to have more and more states around the country where incarcerated people are held in conditions that are not livable because they’re too hot,” said Sharon Dolovich, a law professor and director of the Prison Law and Policy Program at the University of California, Los Angeles.










At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating.


– Devin Skrzypchak, who is incarcerated at Oshkosh Correctional Institution in Wisconsin


Some upgrades
At least 44 states lack universal air conditioning within their prison facilities, even in regions known for sweltering summer temperatures, according to a 2022 USA Today analysis. A recent Reuters investigation also found that nearly half of state prisons across 29 states have partial or no air conditioning in housing units.
But some states are investing millions to update their prison facilities.
In North Carolina, corrections officials are working toward their goal of installing air conditioning in all 54 state prisons by 2026. To date, 33 facilities are fully air-conditioned, 17 are partially air-conditioned, and four have no air conditioning, according to its dashboard.
In California, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, which operates 31 adult prisons, has spent $246 million in the past five years on cooling improvements at five prisons, according to a department spokesperson.
Lawmakers this year also approved funding for the Air Cooling Pilot Program at three facilities, with $17.6 million allocated for fiscal years 2025-26 and $20 million for fiscal years 2026-27. It will evaluate the effectiveness of two alternatives prior to a statewide plan to address high indoor temperatures across the California prison system.
State prisons turn to extended lockdowns amid staffing shortages, overcrowding

The Texas Department of Criminal Justice, as of Aug. 1, is building 12,827 “cool beds,” or prison cells in air-conditioned units, and is in the process of procuring an additional 7,162, according to its dashboard.
Texas is one of the states most closely associated with heat-related deaths in prison. A 2022 study estimated that, on average, 14 deaths per year in Texas prisons are associated with heat. And a Texas Tribune analysis found that at least 41 incarcerated people died during a record-breaking heat wave in 2023.
In March, a federal judge ruled the extreme heat in Texas prisons is “plainly unconstitutional,” but declined to order immediate air conditioning, saying the work could not be completed within the court order’s 90-day window and temporary systems might delay a permanent fix.
‘More miserable’
Sweltering summer heat can turn prisons into pressure cookers. People inside already may have health conditions, limited access to cooling, or take medications that make it harder for their bodies to handle the heat. And research suggests that high temperatures can heighten irritability and aggression, sometimes fueling more conflicts between incarcerated people or with staff.
“It makes you more miserable. … If you to the point of even thinking about suicide, that’s just going to add to it,” said Ronald McKeithen, who spent 37 years incarcerated in Alabama prisons and is now the director of second chances at the Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice. McKeithen recalls feeling “on edge” due to tension among other incarcerated people on hot days.
At the Oshkosh Correctional Institution in Wisconsin, Devin Skrzypchak said the heat worsens his bladder condition, and he often can’t get the incontinence briefs he needs. The heat forces him to drink more water, and on days when ice isn’t available, he’s left drenched in sweat.
“At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating,” Skrzypchak wrote in a message to Stateline through the facility’s messaging platform.

D’Angelo Lee Komanekin — who has spent about 25 years in and out of different Wisconsin corrections facilities — said prison architecture plays a major role in why temperatures inside climb so high.
“The planet is getting hotter and hotter,” said Komanekin, who relies on a small plastic fan to stay cool. Komanekin also is incarcerated at the Oshkosh Correctional Institution. “They’re doing nothing about the architecture. Some institutions’ windows open, some don’t, but most of the doors have steel doors with trap doors.”
Older prison designs that rely heavily on steel and concrete building materials often trap heat, making it difficult to keep temperatures down in the summer. Aging facilities also are less likely to be equipped for the installation of central air conditioning.
Some state prison systems, including Alabama’s and Wisconsin’s, are adding air-conditioning or air-tempering systems to new prison construction and major renovation projects.
Future legal battles
Legal experts say the issue of excessive heat in prisons is likely to become more pressing as climate change drives longer and hotter summers.
Extreme heat in correctional facilities has already been the subject of litigation in dozens of states, with plaintiffs arguing that high temperatures constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Court rulings in these cases have varied, but some experts say even more lawsuits are likely if facilities do not adapt.
“The conditions are going to worsen. [Incarcerated people are] going to be looking for every possible avenue for assistance they can,” Dolovich, the UCLA law professor, told Stateline.
Prison abuse, deaths and escapes prompt calls for more oversight

One of the latest cases comes from Missouri, where the nonprofit law firm MacArthur Justice Center filed a class-action lawsuit in May on behalf of six incarcerated people at Algoa Correctional Center.
The lawsuit alleges that the conditions violate their constitutional rights under the Eighth Amendment. It seeks to require the Missouri Department of Corrections to work with experts to develop a heat mitigation plan that keeps housing unit temperatures between 65 and 85 degrees. If the department cannot meet that standard, the plaintiffs are asking for the release of three of the incarcerated people who have less than a year remaining on their sentences.
Lawsuits such as the Missouri case often focus on claims that extreme heat worsens existing medical problems. To proceed, they must meet two legal requirements: proving the heat poses a serious health or safety risk, and showing prison officials knew about the danger but failed to address it, according to Dolovich, whose work has focused on the Eighth Amendment and prison conditions.
Courts may also raise the bar for proving such claims if judges echo decisions in cases with similar Eight Amendment arguments related to the death penalty and homelessness, Dolovich said. Judges have shifted, she said, toward a “superadding terror, pain and disgrace” standard under the Eighth Amendment — a higher threshold requiring proof that conditions were created with the intent to cause unnecessary suffering.
Dolovich added that some recent court decisions have provided only narrow remedies, such as ordering ice and fans instead of installing air conditioning.
“Prison officials have a moral and a constitutional responsibility to respond to changing conditions. In this case, it means air conditioning. … Anything less than that, to me, is indefensible.” she said.

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)If you’ve ever attempted to observe your own thoughts, even for a moment, maybe you noticed how easily the mind can move between grace and grievance. Natural restlessness is the universal engine of that movement, and the way restive energy is released determines its short- and long-term social value. 
When aligned with grace, restlessness not only emerges as kindness but can also help drive human advancement — in science, medicine, equality, and all manner of exploration, for example. But aligned with grievance, that innate quality of general unease typically manifests as a dark contagion — of selfishness and isolation, cruelty and oppression. Sometimes worse.
The great lesson of politics is that one end of the spectrum is an easier place to harvest votes, and unfortunately for all of humanity it’s not the field of grace.
Here’s how that plays out in modern American politics: The core, unchanging position of the Republican Party — unwavering fealty to large corporations and top earners — is not on its own a winning strategy. That shouldn’t be surprising, unless you are one of those people still standing with palms to heaven awaiting Ronald Reagan’s promised trickle. But there’s data, too: A Pew Research Center poll from the spring, for example, found that 63% of Americans (including 43% of Republicans) believe taxes should be raised, not lowered, for large businesses and people who earn more than $400,000 a year. 
Most voters are wise to the fact that the corporate tax breaks never make it to the workers, despite conservatives’ promises. The Congressional Research Service, in the aftermath of President Donald Trump’s original 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that reduced the tax on corporate profits from 35% to 21%, found that by the end of 2018 $1 trillion of corporations’ increased funds due to the cut had gone to record-breaking stock buybacks, further financially distancing executives from the workforces they lead. Meanwhile, about 2% of the corporate rate cut made its way down to the workers — about $28 per American employee.
Do you remember what you spent your windfall on?
Eight years later, Trump promised more of the same if elected, this time through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, and a plurality of American voters obliged. New Hampshire Republicans have consistently drifted to State House victory riding the same dubious current, swearing that the best way to reduce the burden on regular Granite Staters is to leave as much money as possible with corporations and the wealthy. The highest price — in reduced services, new fees, and more restrictive eligibility for support programs — is always paid by those with the least. 
The question in all of this is why. Why, if more than 6 in 10 Americans favor tax increases for large corporations and the wealthy, do they keep electing candidates who above all support the policies driving extreme wealth inequality?
The answer is grievance. Cultivated grievance.
Restlessness realized as grace pushes a person toward empathy. It leads to questions like: In a nation as rich as our own, why are 43% of all families unable to meet their basic needs, and why is that percentage even higher among Black (59%) and Hispanic (66%) families? And why, in New Hampshire’s Coös County, in the northern part of one of the richest states in one of the richest nations, are nearly 12% of children living in extreme poverty?
But restlessness realized as grievance pushes them toward the boundless nowhere of retributive politics. What is left of 21st-century American Republicanism when you subtract political, social, cultural, and (un)scientific grievances? One thing, mainly: A sales pitch, discredited by countless studies and decades of math, that everyone benefits when those with the most are given even more.
In one breath the conservative candidate proclaims love for New Hampshire, for America, for all people. In the next, and with each breath after, they identify all who are unworthy of that love and then draft policies, bills, and orders to codify those exclusions. Grievance is how power is won and held by the right, even as its representatives reliably pass one deeply unpopular economic policy after another. 
It’s a strategy not without risk. If the history of human civilization, and vast inequality, has taught us anything, it’s this: Nothing churns societal restlessness so violently as the flight from grace.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/domestatuefoot-1024x686.jpg,,,2025-08-20 11:58:40.105005

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s medical cannabis industry voiced its support for sting operations targeting sellers of hemp products that create a marijuana-like high.
The comments from Jeremiah Murphy, a lobbyist for the Cannabis Industry Association of South Dakota, came during Tuesday’s meeting of the state’s Medical Marijuana Oversight Committee.
Murphy’s association represents the state’s 116 licensed medical cannabis cultivators, manufacturers and dispensaries.
The industry “commends the Pennington County Sheriff’s Office” for its sting operation targeting hemp-based THC products at eight Rapid City-area smoke shops and convenience stores, Murphy said.
Rapid City policing agencies target ‘diet weed’ with compliance checks

Law enforcement bought samples of gummies, THC drinks and other products with “hemp-derived” ingredients. Strains of THC is a family of high-inducing molecules found in large concentrations in the cannabis plant.
The hemp plant is a cousin to cannabis that contains tiny quantities of THC. Hemp-derived intoxicants often get their THC from chemically modified or distilled CBD. CBD is a different, nonintoxicating molecule found in cannabis and hemp.
Hemp is legal to cultivate under the 2018 farm bill, and hemp-derived products are legal under federal law. Since mid-2024, however, South Dakota has barred the sale – but not the possession – of products made with chemically synthesized versions of THC.
The Rapid City compliance check followed a July 10 letter from Pennington County State’s Attorney Lara Roetzel to businesses suspected of unlawful hemp sales.
Katy Urban, spokeswoman for Roetzel’s office, says the agencies are waiting for testing results to determine if any laws were broken. 
Sioux Falls Police Department spokesman Aaron Benson said the SFPD has performed one compliance check, and is waiting on results from a lab test to determine how to proceed with one case. Benson declined to say how many businesses were visited, citing the open investigation.
Committee hears support for compliance
At Tuesday’s medical marijuana committee meeting, Murphy repeated an assertion he’s used for nearly two years now:  The availability of hemp-derived alternatives to medical cannabis puts the state’s highly regulated medical marijuana industry at a disadvantage. 
“Why do I go to a doctor and pay him, and why go pay the state to pay even more money, when I can go to the vape shop, or I can go to the hemp store and they’re selling exactly what I need?” Murphy said.
The number of medical marijuana cards issued in the state stands at around 14,000, but changes slightly every day, Whitney Brunner of the Department of Health told the medical marijuana committee Tuesday. 
“Any data point presented on patient cards is representative of a snapshot in time,” Brunner said.
Cards issuance has picked up slightly since voters rejected a ballot measure to legalize recreational cannabis last fall, but remained at about 14,000 as of this week. A little more than 70% of the cards have been issued to people for the management of chronic pain, Brunner told the committee. 
Medical cannabis purveyors supported the law banning the sale of synthetically altered hemp products, but the law hasn’t led to a crush of cases against sellers. Around 100 charges had been filed as of last month, between juvenile and adult cases, according to the Unified Judicial System. Several of those charges were attached to individual defendants.
Hemp industry sees future beyond consumables
New processing centers raise hopes for South Dakota hemp, tempered by challenges

John Peterson, president of the South Dakota Industrial Hemp Association, said his organization doesn’t have a problem with the rules on consumables.
“They passed the rules, and we want to have only the good players in the game,” said Peterson, whose Dakota Hemp is one of two companies in South Dakota building hemp processing facilities.
South Dakota leads the nation in hemp production. Legally, hemp plants need to be tested and have less than .3% THC. In a typical pre-rolled, smokable cannabis joint, Peterson said, “you’re looking at a 30% THC level.”
“You’re going to want your money back if it’s not that high,” he said.
Peterson said consumable products, with or without intoxicating properties, were among the first to catch on. CBD products, including products like lotions, are often marketed to humans and their pets for their purported health benefits. 
Hemp-derived THC products, made “when somebody will take it and process it down to make an unnatural compound,” took off just a few years ago. 
“That has been the industry that has financially led the way, but as the industry is taking off, we see the grain, fiber and textile areas as leading products into the future,” Peterson said.
Speaking from a booth at Dakotafest in Mitchell, Peterson listed off a dozen products from a hemp association brochure, including building materials like hempcrete and decking material.
As far as consumables, Peterson said, “we’re not going to scream and holler and say, ‘you’ve got to let us have those back.” 
He said he hopes the consumable concerns don’t hamstring the rest of the industry.
“As long as they’re not going out of their way to discriminate against the hemp industry, I’ve got no issues with it.”

Kristin Robbins, R-Maple Grove, a traditional suburban Republican who has raised her profile in recent months by publicizing fraud in public programs, announced Wednesday she’s running for governor.
“Over the last 8 years, (Gov.) Tim Walz has hurt families, businesses, and Minnesotan’s most vulnerable citizens. Under his mismanagement and leadership failures, our state has been heading in the wrong direction,” Robbins said in a statement.
Walz is expected to announce in the coming weeks whether he’ll seek a third term. Also in the race: 2022 GOP gubernatorial nominee and former state Sen. Scott Jensen, and former GOP congressional and gubernatorial candidate Kendall Qualls.
Robbins was first elected to the House in 2018, representing west metro cities like Maple Plain, Maple Grove and Medina. She is chair of the Fraud Prevention and State Agency Oversight Committee, where she’s used the gavel to highlight a wave of fraud that’s beset public programs in recent years, including a pandemic-era food aid program and Medicaid.
A campaign video shows her talking about the good life in the western suburbs, “cheering on soccer, softball and choir, and teaching Sunday school,” before pivoting to the state’s taxes, fraud in safety net programs, sanctuary laws protecting undocumented immigrants, and transgender girls in sports.
Earlier this year, Heartland Signal noted Robbins scrubbed her social media of her support for 2024 presidential candidate Nikki Haley, for whom Robbins served as state chair.
Given the importance of the endorsement of President Donald Trump — and Trump’s long memory when it comes to his vanquished opponents like Haley — Robbins’ biggest challenge will be to persuade Trump and Republican voters that she’s sufficiently obeisant to the president and his agenda.
Republican primary voters tend to follow the party’s convention endorsement, wherein mere hundreds of hardcore activists — often the most ideologically dogmatic — decide the candidates’ fate.
But a campaign too focused on the Trumpiest GOP activists could spell trouble in a general election, where Minnesotans have thrice rejected Trump — and every statewide Republican candidate for nearly two decades.
Indeed, Alliance for a Better Minnesota, a well-funded outside group aligned with Democrats, was ready with a release about Robbins late Tuesday, tying her to Trump: “Robbins is an anti-choice extremist whose record shows she’ll side with Trump and conservatives’ harmful agenda over looking out for Minnesota families every time,” said Marissa Luna, the group’s executive director, in a statement.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/022425-PHOTO-light-rail-floor-01-MJ-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-08-20 10:56:46.104871

In New York, for example, correctional officers staged a three-week strike earlier this year and many didn’t return to work. Some facilities now are operating with 30%-60% fewer guards than needed, resulting in some incarcerated people getting only an hour or two outside of their cells each day.
A 2023 study published in the peer-reviewed PLOS One journal found that mortality in state and private prisons rose during periods of extreme heat, with deaths increasing 3.5% on extreme heat days and up to 7.4% during three-day heat waves. Between 2001 and 2019, nearly 13,000 people died in prison during the summer months, almost half of them in the South, though the study did not determine how many of those deaths were directly attributable to heat.
Climate change is fueling longer, more intense periods of extreme heat. Exposure to extreme heat can worsen conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and asthma, and has also been linked to worsening mental health and higher suicide rates among incarcerated people.
“Average temperatures are rising, and you’re going to have more and more states around the country where incarcerated people are held in conditions that are not livable because they’re too hot,” said Sharon Dolovich, a law professor and director of the Prison Law and Policy Program at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Some upgrades
At least 44 states lack universal air conditioning within their prison facilities, even in regions known for sweltering summer temperatures, according to a 2022 USA Today analysis. A recent Reuters investigation also found that nearly half of state prisons across 29 states have partial or no air conditioning in housing units.
But some states are investing millions to update their prison facilities.
In North Carolina, corrections officials are working toward their goal of installing air conditioning in all 54 state prisons by 2026. To date, 33 facilities are fully air-conditioned, 17 are partially air-conditioned, and four have no air conditioning, according to its dashboard.
In California, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, which operates 31 adult prisons, has spent $246 million in the past five years on cooling improvements at five prisons, according to a department spokesperson.
Lawmakers this year also approved funding for the Air Cooling Pilot Program at three facilities, with $17.6 million allocated for fiscal years 2025-26 and $20 million for fiscal years 2026-27. It will evaluate the effectiveness of two alternatives prior to a statewide plan to address high indoor temperatures across the California prison system.
Public pushes DOC to apply law, reduce the number of people returned to Wisconsin prisons

The Texas Department of Criminal Justice, as of Aug. 1, is building 12,827 “cool beds,” or prison cells in air-conditioned units, and is in the process of procuring an additional 7,162, according to its dashboard.
Texas is one of the states most closely associated with heat-related deaths in prison. A 2022 study estimated that, on average, 14 deaths per year in Texas prisons are associated with heat. And a Texas Tribune analysis found that at least 41 incarcerated people died during a record-breaking heat wave in 2023.
In March, a federal judge ruled the extreme heat in Texas prisons is “plainly unconstitutional,” but declined to order immediate air conditioning, saying the work could not be completed within the court order’s 90-day window and temporary systems might delay a permanent fix.
‘More miserable’
Sweltering summer heat can turn prisons into pressure cookers. People inside already may have health conditions, limited access to cooling, or take medications that make it harder for their bodies to handle the heat. And research suggests that high temperatures can heighten irritability and aggression, sometimes fueling more conflicts between incarcerated people or with staff.
“It makes you more miserable. … If you to the point of even thinking about suicide, that’s just going to add to it,” said Ronald McKeithen, who spent 37 years incarcerated in Alabama prisons and is now the director of second chances at the Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice. McKeithen recalls feeling “on edge” due to tension among other incarcerated people on hot days.
At the Oshkosh Correctional Institution in Wisconsin, Devin Skrzypchak said the heat worsens his bladder condition, and he often can’t get the incontinence briefs he needs. The heat forces him to drink more water, and on days when ice isn’t available, he’s left drenched in sweat.
“At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating,” Skrzypchak wrote in a message to Stateline through the facility’s messaging platform.










At times, it's a living hell . . . It can be very excruciating.


– Devin Skrzypchak, who is incarcerated at Oshkosh Correctional Institution in Wisconsin


D’Angelo Lee Komanekin — who has spent about 25 years in and out of different Wisconsin corrections facilities — said prison architecture plays a major role in why temperatures inside climb so high.
“The planet is getting hotter and hotter,” said Komanekin, who relies on a small plastic fan to stay cool. Komanekin also is incarcerated at the Oshkosh Correctional Institution. “They’re doing nothing about the architecture. Some institutions’ windows open, some don’t, but most of the doors have steel doors with trap doors.”
Older prison designs that rely heavily on steel and concrete building materials often trap heat, making it difficult to keep temperatures down in the summer. Aging facilities also are less likely to be equipped for the installation of central air conditioning.
Some state prison systems, including Alabama’s and Wisconsin’s, are adding air-conditioning or air-tempering systems to new prison construction and major renovation projects.
Future legal battles
Legal experts say the issue of excessive heat in prisons is likely to become more pressing as climate change drives longer and hotter summers.
Extreme heat in correctional facilities has already been the subject of litigation in dozens of states, with plaintiffs arguing that high temperatures constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Court rulings in these cases have varied, but some experts say even more lawsuits are likely if facilities do not adapt.
“The conditions are going to worsen. [Incarcerated people are] going to be looking for every possible avenue for assistance they can,” Dolovich, the UCLA law professor, told Stateline.
One of the latest cases comes from Missouri, where the nonprofit law firm MacArthur Justice Center filed a class-action lawsuit in May on behalf of six incarcerated people at Algoa Correctional Center.
The lawsuit alleges that the conditions violate their constitutional rights under the Eighth Amendment. It seeks to require the Missouri Department of Corrections to work with experts to develop a heat mitigation plan that keeps housing unit temperatures between 65 and 85 degrees. If the department cannot meet that standard, the plaintiffs are asking for the release of three of the incarcerated people who have less than a year remaining on their sentences.
Lawsuits such as the Missouri case often focus on claims that extreme heat worsens existing medical problems. To proceed, they must meet two legal requirements: proving the heat poses a serious health or safety risk, and showing prison officials knew about the danger but failed to address it, according to Dolovich, whose work has focused on the Eighth Amendment and prison conditions.
Courts may also raise the bar for proving such claims if judges echo decisions in cases with similar Eight Amendment arguments related to the death penalty and homelessness, Dolovich said. Judges have shifted, she said, toward a “superadding terror, pain and disgrace” standard under the Eighth Amendment — a higher threshold requiring proof that conditions were created with the intent to cause unnecessary suffering.
Dolovich added that some recent court decisions have provided only narrow remedies, such as ordering ice and fans instead of installing air conditioning.
“Prison officials have a moral and a constitutional responsibility to respond to changing conditions. In this case, it means air conditioning. … Anything less than that, to me, is indefensible.” she said.

,California,2025-08-20 14:34:09+00:00,CalMatters,Why many California Democrats are feeling angst over Newsom’s redistricting,Jeanne Kuang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/08/democrat-redistricting-moral-dilemma/,California voters backed independent redistricting for congressional seats and giving it up to counter President Trump creates a moral conflict even for Democrats.,"In summary
California voters backed independent redistricting for congressional seats and giving it up to counter President Trump creates a moral conflict even for Democrats.


As Republicans lambasted California lawmakers for rushing through their effort to gerrymander the state’s congressional map, Democrats are facing a quieter angst in their own party.
To counter what they call President Donald Trump’s undemocratic power grab for Republican seats in Texas, they’re asking voters to temporarily ditch California’s nonpartisan map-drawing process — touted as a national gold standard for fair elections and good governance — in favor of a politico-drawn map to tilt seats in Democrats’ favor.
At the polls, they’ll have to overcome not just Republican opponents but also some Democrats and independent voters who say California shouldn’t respond to partisan gerrymandering in Texas with the same frowned-upon tactics at home. 
“This is the kind of moral conflict that, if this goes to the ballot, that every California voter is going to be faced with,” said Sara Sadhawani, a political science professor, Democrat and former member of the state’s independent redistricting commission, at a hearing over the measures Tuesday.
Sadhawani helped draw the state’s existing congressional map when she sat on the commission alongside fellow Democrats, Republicans and independents after the 2020 Census. Now she’s one of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s partisan redistricting effort’s most vocal supporters. 
Testifying in favor of the plan on Tuesday, she said lawmakers must respond to the “extreme attacks on our core democratic principles” in Texas and other red states that are considering redrawing their own maps.
“It brings me no joy to see the maps that we passed fairly by the Commission to be tossed aside,” she said. “I do believe this is a necessary step in a much bigger battle to shore up free and fair elections in our nation.”
But even as state- and congressional-level Democrats embrace the plan as their answer to voters clamoring for the party to put up a resistance to Trump, there are misgivings among Democrats statewide.
On the other side of the issue in the hearing rooms weren’t the Republicans who have vowed to fight Newsom through lawsuits and at the ballot box. Instead, opponents presented members of prior nonpartisan redistricting commissions: Jeanne Raya and Cynthia Dai, who are Democrats, and Connie Archbold Robinson, an independent, to testify against the measures. 
“Our citizens in other parts of the country, who are being held hostage by politicians who do not represent their interests, have been looking to California as the alternative, as the model,” Robinson said. “If we gut the great work that we have been doing there, then not only do we lose our credibility, those efforts actually get stalled and get reversed.”
Voters backed independent redistricting
Voters added the nonpartisan process for redrawing California’s political maps to the state constitution by a slim margin in 2008. In 2010 they approved using that same independent system to draw new congressional maps just as Republicans nationally campaigned to flip state legislatures for the purpose of drawing more GOP House seats in states like Wisconsin, North Carolina and Michigan.
Three other states use a similar process as California to draw congressional maps, but just over half of all states give that power directly to their legislatures, meaning the party in power can tilt seats to their advantage.
The current California congressional map gave Democrats a slight advantage. But while Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance have called the map unfair to the GOP,  Republicans in California have been, for the most part, satisfied with it. It maintained competitive districts that the GOP has been able to win or put up significant fights for — districts that will be eliminated under the partisan map voters will likely weigh in on this fall. 
Statewide, Democratic voters outnumber Republicans nearly 2-to-1. Recent polling shows voters favor independent redistricting by about the same margin. 
California vs. Texas
To sell the redistricting measure to the public, Democrats have leaned heavily on framing it as a fight against Trump — and, ironically, in favor of fairer elections nationwide. In the state Senate elections committee, Democrats grilled the former map-drawers on whether it would ever be acceptable for them to draw new districts for political reasons and whether California ought to retaliate to discourage Texas’ efforts. 
“Texas is actively reducing their own competitive seat count,” Sen. Sabrina Cervantes, a Riverside Democrat, said. “So then do you expect our communities to remain silent while their voices are being stripped away from Washington?”
Raya stressed she, too, opposed both the Trump administration and the Republican gerrymandering effort in Texas, which she called “reprehensible.”
“We’re living with … the despair that people have about the current political climate,” she said. “For me, this is not about declaring an emergency, and now, what do we do? This is, every day, we need to be doing something to make the system work and today what we need to do is protect the independent, nonpartisanship of drawing lines.”
But her fellow party members in the Senate said it’s not the time to go high.
“I will speak for myself, the conditions have been met for us to take action,” incoming Senate President Pro Tem Monique Limón, a Santa Barbara Democrat, said to the former commissioners. “I have utmost respect and recognition for the work that all of you do to protect our democracy.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/081925_Redistricting-Hearing_FG_CM_04.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-20 10:56:46.104871

Will Carpenter, R-El Dorado, says he doubts the state can ever build the nursing staff needed to operate state psychiatric hospitals in Larned and Osawatomie. (Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The state of Kansas invests more than $60 million annually to hire contract nursing staff to work at state psychiatric hospitals in Larned and Osawatomie, but the financial boost hasn’t closed job vacancy gaps exceeding 33% at both facilities.
On Tuesday, Kansas legislators on a special committee exploring contract nursing shared disappointment with results of years of stopgap appropriations to hire temporary nurses provided by private companies. The state also has devoted resources to raising salaries and providing bonuses to encourage state-employed nurses to remain at the hospitals.
Lawmakers expressed skepticism Kansas would ever have enough people to fill vacancies at state hospitals serving involuntarily committed or criminally charged individuals with mental health issues, as well as sexually violent offenders detained at Larned after serving prison sentences.
“In my experience, we’re not going to build this staff to take care of the number of people that are out there right now,” said Rep. Will Carpenter, an El Dorado Republican who chairs the Legislature’s interim health committee. “Prove me wrong, because I want to be wrong.”
Carpenter suggested consideration be given to transferring about 100 patients from Larned to other locations so staffing levels could be sustained without contract nurses. In 2027, Kansas is scheduled to open a new 104-bed state psychiatric hospital in Sedgwick County.
Expenditures at Larned State Hospital for nursing contract labor increased from $5.9 million in 2019 to $8.6 million in 2021, $43.1 million in 2023 and $46 million in 2025. At Osawatomie State Hospital, contract costs surged from $233,000 in 2019 to $3.2 million in 2021, $16 million in 2023 and $15.4 million in 2025. The job vacancy rate at Osawatomie stood at 35.5%, while the rate at Larned was 33.5%.
“I’ve been incredibly disappointed on how that’s worked,” Carpenter said.
 Contract labor not answer

Scott Brunner, deputy secretary of the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services, said the agency used state tax dollars to bring in dozens of registered nurses and licensed practice nurses to care for patients who generally had complex medical needs. Some require one-on-one care.
“To keep our bed count open at the levels that they are,” he said, “we have to have enough staff to make sure patients are safe.”
He said the starting salary for a registered nurse at the state hospitals was about $40 per hour. The state paid companies providing contract registered nurses $90 to $100 per hour to take on the same responsibilities, with the nurse receiving approximately two-thirds of the total.
“We certainly don’t think contract labor is a solution,” Brunner said. “It’s a way of addressing the need to keep beds open and keep patients moving through the system.”
He recommended the Legislature pass House Bill 2237, which is hung up in the Senate, to place in state law the ability of state agencies to award employee bonuses in amounts up to $10,000 per year. He urged lawmakers to keep funding cost-of-living and market-rate adjustments to salaries so state hospitals could compete with the private sector for labor. The existing budget for contract nurses needs to be sustained, he said.
In addition, Brunner suggested the state expand college scholarships for nurses, consider providing nursing students with financial support in exchange for post-graduation employment agreements and provide training opportunities for experienced nurses to advance their careers.
 ‘Increase the salaries’

Ashley Byram, superintendent of the Osawatomie hospital, said only half of the facility’s RNs, LPNs and mental health technicians were state employees. Here’s the split between state employee and agency contract workers at Osawatomie: RNs, 16 state and 16 private; LPNs, three state and 13 private; and mental health techs, 39 state and 33 private.
She said Osawatomie contract nurses were asked what it would take for them to accept state employment. The nurses weren’t interested in signing bonuses or housing allowances, she said, but were keen to earn salaries of at least $50 per hour. The average RN at Osawatomie has been paid $44 per hour, or $59 per hour when benefits were included.
“I would increase the salaries,” Byram said. “It’s the current wage gap between agency and state positions that is our primary obstacle.”
If the Legislature prohibited payment of contract nurses to staff the Osawatomie hospital, she said, the facility had enough nurses to make use of 43 beds. She said 116 beds at Osawatomie would be closed if contract nurses were removed and replacements weren’t hired.
Lindsey Topps, superintendent at Larned, said the hospital averaged 400 patients with more than half the total in a sexual predator treatment program.
“We have, I say, no fat on campus,” Topps said. “We’ve maximized the amount of residents or patients to the RNs and LPNs in order to provide safe and good patient care as well as follow the regulations.”
Here is the breakdown between state employees and contract laborers at Larned: Registered nurses, 17 state and 38 private; LPNs, nine state and 27 private; mental health workers or CNAs, 194 state and 179 private.
Topps said debate by the Legislature about reducing contract nursing labor should take into consideration the aggressive, disruptive, suicidal and homicidal conduct of people at Larned. She said most community-based health facilities didn’t have the staff or facilities to deal with individuals who ended up at the state hospital.
“We have some of the most severe mentally ill individuals in the state of Kansas,” Topps said.
 ‘It’s not translating’

During the 2025 legislative session, the House and Senate didn’t approve financing for new spending on contract nursing at the two state hospitals.
“Sometimes we set aside money because that feels good and we think that’s going to to do something,” said Sen. Beverly Gossage, a Republican from Eudora.
Sen. Renee Erickson, R-Wichita, said the state had a handful of initiatives designed to develop a Kansas pipeline of nurses who could fill jobs at state hospitals. She said the state spent millions of dollars so 2,700 high school students could take courses required to become a certified nursing assistant. She said only one-third of those students became CNAs.
“We’re paying to fill that pipeline, but it’s not translating,” she said. “It doesn’t appear like (it’s) actually reducing the demand and getting to the root of the problem. It doesn’t seem to be making the impact it should or we would hope it should.”

A recent National Association of Realtors report found affordability increased slightly from last year, but the typical family is still priced out in the West and Northeast. (Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer)Housing became more affordable this June, as higher incomes and slightly lower interest rates overcame higher prices, according to a National Association of Realtors report.
However, the South and the Midwest are the only regions where a family with typical or median income can afford a median-priced house, according to the report. The group considers a mortgage to be affordable if the monthly payment (principal and interest) is 25% or less of the family’s income.

The affordability gap is highest in the West, where the typical family income is $113,783, just over two-thirds of the $164,832 that would be needed to purchase a median-priced home.
The Northeast, where the typical family makes $114,559, is also unaffordable by this measure, as a median-priced home requires an income of $141,264.
In the Midwest, the median family income is $102,419, more than the $86,256 needed to buy a median-priced home. The same is true in the South, where the median income is $97,812, slightly more than the $96,720 required to buy a typical home.
Nationally, affordability increased slightly compared with June of 2024, with the typical family making $105,431, about 94% of the $111,648 it would need to buy the median-priced home. That’s up from about 92% in June 2024.
In a video posted Aug. 15, Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, said he expects lower interest rates to increase affordability in the months ahead.
“We know that mortgage rates will be coming down and that will bring additional buyers into the market. We just need to make sure we have more supply, more supply to meet that demand,” Yun said.

(Photo by EJ Rodriquez/Getty Images)A Texas House Democrat was confined in the Capitol overnight after she refused a police escort that Republican leaders imposed on lawmakers who participated in a two-week walkout over a GOP mid-decade redistricting plan.
Rep. Nicole Collier, D-Fort Worth, declined on Monday afternoon to sign a slip giving her permission from Speaker Dustin Burrows, R-Lubbock, to leave the House floor with a state law enforcement officer shadowing her.
“I refuse to sign away my dignity as a duly elected representative just so Republicans can control my movements and monitor me with police escorts,” Collier said in a statement Monday. “When I press that button to vote, I know these maps will harm my constituents — I won’t just go along quietly with their intimidation or their discrimination.”
At least four more Democratic lawmakers — Reps. Rhetta Bowers, Cassandra Garcia Hernandez, Penny Morales Shaw and Mihaela Plesa — joined the protest Tuesday, tearing up their permission slips in front of a crowd of supporters chanting, “Don’t mess with Texas women,” and, “Let them out,” as the lawmakers prepared to spend the night on the House floor with Collier. Rep. Senfronia Thompson of Houston joined the demonstration but did not appear to rip up her permission slip.
“Why would we be considered a flight risk if we walked in of our own volition?” Bowers said. “This is a blatant violation of our freedoms as Texans, as Americans and as duly elected officials.”
At around 6:30 p.m. Tueday while Collier and others were on the House floor, the Texas Department of Public Safety evacuated the public from the Capitol after an unidentified individual posted a threat on social media, according to a DPS spokesperson. DPS said the message called on people to go to the Capitol and shoot “those who will not allow lawmakers to leave.”
The Capitol was closed to the public for the rest of the evening, according to DPS. Authorities have not yet identified the individual who posted the threat.
Collier and Rep. Gene Wu of Houston, chair of the House Democratic Caucus, later issued a statement on the situation and thanked DPS troopers for their “swift and professional response to today’s security threat.”
“Violence and threats have no place in our democratic process, and we unequivocally condemn any threats against public servants or law enforcement, regardless of political differences,” the statement read.
Just over two dozen Democratic lawmakers, including Collier, on Monday ended their walkout over a congressional redistricting plan — demanded by President Donald Trump just four years after Republicans last redrew Texas’ map — that is designed to pad the GOP’s slim U.S. House majority in next year’s midterm election.
After the lawmakers returned to the Texas House, Burrows announced they would each be subject to an around-the-clock police escort to ensure their attendance when the chamber reconvenes on Wednesday morning to vote out the map. He added that Democratic lawmakers would be responsible for any state costs incurred in ensuring their attendance.
Most Democrats signed the permission slip required to leave the Capitol with a police officer in tow, even while objecting to the mandatory surveillance and emphasizing that they would not have returned to Austin on Monday if they planned to skip the vote on Wednesday.
Collier filed a lawsuit Monday challenging the chamber’s authority to put members under police surveillance.
“They exercised control, and they tell us we can’t leave unless we do exactly what they say,” she said in a video Monday. “We’ve had enough. We’ve had enough of them taking all of our rights away, and so I’ve taken a stand. I’m pushing back.”
Collier slept at her desk on the House floor Monday night and remained there Tuesday, over 24 hours and counting after first arriving, though she said she’d received permission to go to her office in the Capitol. Wu and Rep. Vince Perez, D-El Paso, stayed with her overnight, with other Democratic lawmakers and staffers coming by to provide moral support, food, clothes, pillows and other necessities.
All of it was captured on a livestream the House Democratic Caucus set up on the House floor, with up to 50,000 viewers tuning in at one point. On Tuesday, Plesa said that former Vice President Kamala Harris was among those who called Collier to express support for her protest.
“Rep. Collier’s choice to stay and not sign the permission slip is well within her rights under the House Rules,” Burrows said in a statement. “I am choosing to spend my time focused on moving the important legislation on the [governor’s special session] call to overhaul camp safety, provide property tax reform and eliminate the STAAR test — the results Texans care about.”
A handful of supporters outside the House chamber were arrested Monday night for “trespassing when the Capitol is closed.” They each received a criminal trespass warning barring them from returning to the building for a year, according to a video of the incident.
The order requiring Democratic lawmakers to keep a police escort is set to expire when the House grants final passage to the congressional map, House Bill 4, later this week.

Service providers say an executive order by President Donald Trump could jeopardize their efforts to help those who are experiencing homelessness. (Lily O'Shea Becker/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Christine English-Baird spends at least one day a week distributing basic supplies to homeless people in Wichita, home to one of Kansas’ largest homeless populations.
“I do that because I can’t even fathom anybody else going through what I did,” English-Baird said. “Feeling invisible. Feeling alone.”
But English-Baird, who was homeless in Colorado and housing insecure in Kansas, says the services that once helped her could be jeopardized by President Donald Trump’s July 24 executive order, which encourages involuntary institutionalization for people in mental health crises and increased criminal pressure on people experiencing homelessness across the United States.
The order makes hefty promises of “fighting vagrancy,” “ending support for ‘housing first’ policies” and “encouraging civil commitment.” Trump followed the July order with another that deployed National Guard troops to police District of Columbia streets, targeting “drugged-out maniacs and homeless people,” he said in an Aug. 11 news conference.
The Trump administration’s approach to homelessness has sparked concern among social service providers, experts and advocates, who say the July order is unspooling decades of progress.
They are skeptical that the order’s provisions will be within reach, especially as cuts to Medicaid and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development are imminent. Plus, institutionalization and criminalization are some of the most expensive and ineffective ways to address homelessness, said Steve Berg, chief policy officer with the National Alliance to End Homelessness.
The threat of being taken into custody “sets people against each other,” Berg said.
“I know one thing really is true about places that have made progress on homelessness is that people are working together,” he said. “And if people are at each other’s throats over things like this, then there’s going to be more homelessness.”
Kansas Senate President Ty Masterson, an Andover Republican who is seeking his party’s nomination for governor, said Trump followed through “on his promise to restore law and order in our Kansas communities.”
“State legislation should focus on mental health and addiction treatment, reducing encampments, and keeping Kansans safe,” he said in a statement. “I’m committed to working with the White House in any way I can to deliver on the President’s agenda.”

Moving backward
English-Baird’s life was a series of revolving doors, beginning with fleeing a violent partner in Denver. She slept in a domestic violence shelter, a transitional shelter, an apartment paid for by her ex, then a rental, a bus stop, sometimes a jail cell and then the streets for three-and-a-half years. At times, she nearly died, she said.
She lost a lot along the way: apartments, her son, sometimes hope.
But English-Baird connected with a friend in Kansas who put her up so she could recover from substance use, build savings and regain hope.
With a lifetime restraining order against her ex and a new life with her husband and son, she now works to influence policies and practices for how homeless people are treated in Kansas through her role on a statewide board.
“Nobody wants to see anybody homeless, regardless of what that means,” English-Baird said.
To her, it means providing people safe, affordable housing, support, a sense of belonging and purpose.
To the Trump administration, it means something else entirely.
During the first Trump administration, there wasn’t much attention on homelessness, Berg said, until the end of Trump’s term, when elected officials began promoting the idea of putting homeless people in camps.
Since then, Berg said, “there’s been a desire to lock people up, I think. There’s no polite way of saying it.”
The executive order takes a four-pronged approach with the stated goal of “protecting public safety.” It cites the most recent national data that estimates how many people were experiencing homelessness on a given night last year in the U.S. — nearly 771,500 people, 274,000 of whom were unsheltered. In Kansas, almost 2,800 people experienced homelessness, which is one of the lowest state totals in the country but is also considered by service providers to be an undercount.
The order directs the U.S. Attorney General to broaden the criteria that governments use to involuntarily commit people, which currently is based on whether someone poses an imminent risk to themself or others. It also asks federal agencies to give funding preference to governments that “enforce prohibitions on open illicit drug use, urban camping and loitering, and urban squatting, and track the location of sex offenders.”
It directs funding to be allocated to “ensure individuals camping on streets and causing public disorder and that are suffering from serious mental illness or addiction are moved into treatment centers, assisted outpatient treatment, or other facilities.” It also deprioritizes Housing First programs, which get people into safe, affordable housing, often in tandem with supportive services.
Donald Whitehead Jr., executive director of the National Coalition for the Homeless, said in a July 24 statement that the executive orders take a punitive approach, which “has consistently failed to resolve homelessness” while exacerbating the challenges faced by people experiencing homelessness, substance use disorders or mental health issues.
“Everyone deserves a safe place to live,” Whitehead said. “These executive orders ignore decades of evidence-based housing and support services in practice.”

Where will people go?
The salient question, according to Randy Callstrom, the CEO of Wyandot Behavioral Health Network in Kansas City, Kansas, is where will people go?
In Kansas, he said, there is no place for people to turn.
“Even if you move people from one part of a community, they will go somewhere else,” he said.
He added: “Unless those individuals are moving into housing, they’re still going to be living in the community unhoused.”
Much depends on how the executive order is actually carried out, he said. Regardless, he said, the order significantly modifies people’s civil liberties.
And he predicts homelessness will get worse. The order moves “things back 35-40 years or longer,” Callstrom said, “and that’s concerning.”
He worries that if the order is enforced, mental health will be stigmatized and local governments, service organizations, hospitals, jails and law enforcement will be strained.
The order misses the mark when it comes to effectively serving people experiencing homelessness, Callstrom said.
“(A) longtime misperception around people who are homeless is that it is a moral failure,” he said, “that these are individuals who are less than, that we just want to push them out of line of sight and wish the problem will go away, when the reality is, you know, in many, many cases, the people who end up living unhoused have experienced many traumas in their life.”
He leads a community mental health center, which he said doesn’t have enough resources to fulfill the order’s demands. At the only public psychiatric hospital in eastern Kansas, Osawatomie State Hospital, a waitlist of 30-50 people has remained constant for the past decade, he said. A publicly available report indicated the waitlist was at 37 people in early August.
Kansas must build new facilities or convince current facilities to take on more people, Callstrom said.
Kansas has budgeted for roughly 710 beds in public psychiatric facilities, said Cara Sloan-Ramos, a spokeswoman for the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services. More than 660 of them are occupied, according to data from the department. More than 2,500 adults and more than 1,500 children use services at private psychiatric institutions.
According to a publicly available database containing regular updates of bed availability at public and private psychiatric facilities across the region, no beds were available at state hospitals.

‘Failed programs’ earn trust
In the order, the White House argues federal and state governments “have spent tens of billions of dollars on failed programs that address homelessness but not its root causes, leaving other citizens vulnerable to public safety threats.”
Agencies at all levels of government across the United States have implemented Housing First policies. Once housed, supportive services address people’s mental health, substance use, employment, familial connections and other reintegration efforts.
The order mimics the anti-Housing First efforts of the Cicero Institute, a Texas-based conservative think tank, which has pushed states for years to ban homelessness. Kansas Republicans in 2023 entertained the group’s proposal at a legislative hearing, where a Cicero Institute fellow was the only proponent.
English-Baird said she is “a firm believer” in Housing First. She has seen it work on both sides — as someone in need of housing and as someone offering aid and crafting policy on a board for the Kansas Statewide Homeless Coalition. When implemented correctly, she said, the approach gains people’s trust.
“Without a stable environment, you can’t address mental health. You can’t address addiction,” she said.
Eliminating funding for organizations, especially rural ones, “literally takes away all the progress we’re making,” English-Baird said. Forcing people to be institutionalized, as the order encourages, “doesn’t do anything to get people housed,” she said.
Institutional beds are scarce, anyway, she added.
The order also bars grant funding from being used for harm reduction efforts, such as safe injection sites.
Harm reduction focuses on reducing the adverse outcomes of drug use, which can include distributing naloxone, sterile syringes and fentanyl test kits, along with first aid, treatment resources and educational materials on overdose prevention.
Harm reduction offers people supplies to stay alive and as disease-free as possible, said English-Baird, who experienced substance use and addiction. She now offers mutual aid to people experiencing homelessness in the Wichita area. Harm reduction is key, she said, to expanding treatment options and connecting people to needed mental health services.
“But we can’t do that if they’re dead,” she said.
In Kansas, illicit drug possession and distribution carry criminal penalties, as does use or possession of drug paraphernalia. Cities across the state have passed ordinances to restrict unauthorized camping on public or private land, including Lawrence, Leavenworth, Topeka and Wichita. Some also regulate panhandling and loitering.
Berg, with the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said he also thinks the order will result in more people experiencing homelessness.
If “the states that want to do the cost-effective solutions to homelessness can’t get the money to do it because they’re not punitive enough, then that’s going to mean more homelessness,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/man-and-bikee-1024x641.jpeg,,,2025-08-20 09:57:47.798993

State regulators are asking Newport residents to weigh in at a 6 p.m. meeting Wednesday night at Innovate Newport. The event kicks off an exploratory review over the abstract prospect of banning new gas hookups on the Island.
Energy regulators have spent years wrestling with this hypothetical, prompted by Rhode Island Energy’s plan to expand an existing liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage and equipment facility on Old Mill Lane in Portsmouth. 
The $33.5 million expansion project on the Portsmouth-Middletown line aims to prevent future gas outages on Aquidneck Island, which relies on a single, six-inch gas pipe to funnel the state’s main gas supply to Island customers.
Rhode Island Energy Facility Siting Board agreed to the utility company’s plan, granting a conditional license in August 2024. 
Construction to accommodate extra storage space and equipment began in April, and is expected to be completed in November. The 70,000 gallons of LNG the company plans to store at a permanent facility is projected to be enough to provide gas to the Island for 37 continuous hours, or three days of up to six hours per day when considering capacity constraints. 
But the quest for alternative solutions continues. Energy regulators made clear in their authorization for the project that the prospect of a natural gas moratorium was still on the table.
There is no set timeline for a decision, nor a guarantee that one will happen at all. Next steps will be determined after the public comment hearings, Patricia Lucarelli, administrator for the state Public Utilities Commission, which issued an advisory opinion on the LNG proposal, said in an email. The utility panel is in the midst of a separate deep dive into how the state should plan for, and spend on, natural gas expansion given its mandate to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
Environmental groups like the Conservation Law Foundation and the Rhode Island Attorney General’s office pointed to this parallel review of the future of state dependency on natural gas as a potential contradiction to Rhode Island Energy’s LNG expansion plan. Others suggested a moratorium on new gas hookups as a better way to address the island’s gap between gas supply and demand.
Rhode Island Energy railed against any guardrails on new gas customers, warning that it would spike heating bills for area residents. Company attorneys also said state regulators lack legal authority to limit new connections.
Neighbors and municipal leaders featured prominently in the debate too, with objections focused on the noise and traffic from expanding the storage site. As the people most directly affected by a potential kibosh on new gas connections, state regulators insist their feedback is critical.
“The Board has not made any decision regarding a moratorium, nor has any party made a specific proposal, but the issue remains ripe for consideration, including weighing the benefits of a moratorium against the impact on residents and businesses who may wish to have the option to seek new gas connections in the future and the economy on the island,” the meeting notice states.
A handful of local residents submitted written comments to regulators already. Several noted the string of hotels that have opened in Newport in recent years, increasing the strain on the limited supply of natural gas. 
Benjamin Riggs, a retired Navy captain, suggested banning new hookups for hotel and large commercial projects exclusively, noting that the widening gap between supply and demand caused by these projects has already resulted in rising usage rates shouldered by residents.
Connie and Rick Bischoff, of Newport, recalled the 2019 emergency outage that left 7,000 Aquidneck Islanders without heat for a frigid week in January. But, the couple also pointed out that electric heat “costs a lot.”
“We simply need this issue to be looked at more carefully,” they wrote.
A new wrinkle highlighted by William Horan of Middletown in his written comments: the change in Washington D.C., where an anti-renewable energy administration has pulled back crucial incentives needed to help states, including Rhode Island, achieve their dependence on fossil fuels.
The public meeting in Newport will not be streamed, although comments made will be transcribed, Lucarelli said. Portsmouth residents can provide in-person feedback at a second meeting on Aug. 27 at Portsmouth Middle School.

Kennedy Jr. is targeting the government’s Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, without which manufacturers might cease producing shots. (Eric Harkleroad/KFF Health News)Dining under palm trees on a patio at Mar-a-Lago in December, President-elect Donald Trump reassured chief executives at pharmaceutical giants Eli Lilly and Pfizer that anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wouldn’t be a radical choice to head the Department of Health and Human Services.
“I think he’s going to be much less radical than you would think,” Trump said later that month during a news conference at his Palm Beach, Florida, resort.
Eight months have passed, and Kennedy is intensifying his attacks on the vaccine system.
High on his list of targets: a federal vaccine compensation program that settles injury claims. His strategy could bankrupt or diminish the fund, some legal scholars and public health leaders say, saddling pharmaceutical companies with liability risks and costs that would compel them to stop making vaccines altogether.
“It’s a radical agenda,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. “He’s using a bunch of different mechanisms and there really are no guardrails. People are going to catch on but it’s not going to be enough to stop the waves of deaths, and deaths of children.”
Kennedy has said changes to the U.S. vaccine system are needed because, he asserts without evidence, immunizations are linked to autism, neurotoxicity, allergies, and death. He is a leader of the “Make America Healthy Again” movement, an informal campaign that eschews traditional medicine and espouses “medical freedom.” Many adherents oppose vaccines and believe they are unsafe despite scientific evidence to the contrary.
Kennedy has acknowledged he wants to reform the vaccine fund, known as the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, writing July 28 on the social platform X that “the VICP is broken, and I intend to fix it.” HHS is working with the Department of Justice to revamp the program, which shields drugmakers from most liability over injuries.
HHS didn’t respond to a request to speak with Kennedy, but agency officials said he isn’t opposed to immunizations.
“Secretary Kennedy is not anti-vaccine — he is pro-safety, pro-transparency, and pro-accountability,” HHS spokesperson Vianca Rodriguez Feliciano said in an email.
Yet behind the scenes, Kennedy has been laying the groundwork to restrict the availability of widely used immunizations, according to people familiar with internal discussions who asked not to be identified because they’re not authorized to speak on the topic.
A Multipronged Strategy
The strategy began taking shape in the spring. The first step: Raise unfounded questions about the safety of vaccines. At a Cabinet meeting in April, Kennedy told Trump that HHS was undertaking a massive study that would identify the cause of rising autism diagnoses by September.
Kennedy tasked David Geier, a researcher who’s repeated the debunked claim that vaccines cause autism, to oversee the work, according to media reports.
Kennedy then doubled down by questioning the use of aluminum, which is added to many vaccines to help boost the immune response. He linked it to allergies at a July meeting of governors, even though a recent study in the Annals of Internal Medicine found no connection. He’s widely expected to ask a federal vaccine advisory committee to conduct a review.
The autism research and concerns about aluminum were early salvos in the push to go after the compensation fund, according to two of the people.
That fund provides money to people for injuries from vaccines and has paid out more than $5 billion since it was established in 1988, according to the Health Resources and Services Administration.
Before filing a lawsuit in court, injured individuals bring their claims to the program’s nonjury vaccine court, which reviews evidence. The fund provides compensation from a small excise tax on vaccines.
Compensation is determined in part by a table maintained by HRSA and overseen by the HHS secretary. It lists each vaccine and associated injuries and encompasses routine vaccinations recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that are subject to the excise tax. The injuries include anaphylaxis and encephalitis. People who experience such injuries within a certain time after getting a specific vaccine can get money.
Kennedy wants to get autism or allergies added to that document, according to two people familiar with internal discussions and concerns raised publicly by some vaccine developers and former regulators. He could accomplish the goal if HHS-led research blames vaccines for autism, for example, or if a federal vaccine advisory panel recommends against aluminum in vaccines, according to some legal scholars.
“Given the rate of autism, if a lot of cases are brought, that could bankrupt the program,” said Dorit Reiss, a professor at University of California Law San Francisco.
If that were to happen, pharmaceutical companies could stop producing the immunizations, which don’t tend to be very profitable, rather than get entangled in drawn-out, expensive lawsuits from claimants who can’t get money because the federal vaccine injury fund has run dry, some legal experts and vaccine developers said.
“The compensation fund, if it’s gone, would impact decisions to proceed or not to proceed,” said David Dodd, president and CEO of GeoVax Labs, a biotechnology company developing vaccines and immunotherapies.
A federal vaccine advisory panel could also recommend against aluminum in shots, forcing drugmakers to make costly reformulations or exit the market.
Kennedy has placed people around him to execute the strategy. He’s pushed to get vaccine skeptics in decision-making positions at the CDC, which recommends vaccines, and the Food and Drug Administration, which approves them.
He also tapped leaders in the anti-vaccine movement to vet candidates for him.
The outcome has been regulatory and policy decisions that have winnowed vaccine access and development.
HHS this month said it was halting $500 million in grants and contracts for the development of mRNA vaccines, including an improved, more durable covid mRNA vaccine.
The federal government stopped recommending covid shots for healthy pregnant women and children, bypassing input from a vaccine advisory committee that traditionally would have weighed in.
And Kennedy reconstituted that committee with his own handpicked members, including vaccine skeptics, and removed the American Medical Association, American Nurses Association, and other industry groups that served as committee liaisons. The modified panel recommended against flu vaccines containing a preservative erroneously linked to autism.
The White House Calls
Kennedy’s determination to keep vaccine skeptics in oversight positions played out in a deal he recently made with Trump and his staff, according to two people familiar with the situation. The arrangement came together on a Sunday night in July when Kennedy got a call from the White House.
The subject was Vinay Prasad, a top vaccine regulator at the FDA. He had recently touched off a wave of industry criticism for playing a role in the agency’s decision to ask biotech company Sarepta Therapeutics to halt shipments of a gene therapy over safety concerns.
Social media posts and conservative commentators whipped up a furor. Laura Loomer, a far-right provocateur, said July 21 on X that Prasad should be fired and called him “a self-proclaimed progressive liberal and Bernie Sanders fanboy,” referring to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Congressional lawmakers began peppering the White House with questions.
The furor reached Trump, who wanted Prasad out, according to the people. But Kennedy was concerned about losing Prasad. He felt he needed a critic of immunizations overseeing vaccines at the agency.
So Kennedy struck a deal. Prasad would be asked to resign as head of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which regulates vaccine products and biologics such as gene therapies. And the center would be divided into two operations, with Kennedy empowered to select the person overseeing vaccines.
Some public health leaders publicly shared details of the arrangement and raised concerns about its potential impact. Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in an Aug. 1 interview on CNBC that he thought it “would be very destructive to the agency.”
After leaving the agency in July, Prasad is now returning, though it is unclear if his role has changed.
Recently, Kennedy was sued by Ray Flores, senior outside counsel for Children’s Health Defense. An anti-vaccine group founded by Kennedy, Children’s Health Defense is funding the suit, which claims Kennedy failed to launch a task force to study vaccine safety that it says is required to report findings to Congress. But Kennedy and his allies view the lawsuit as friendly, according to one person familiar with the matter, because it is seeking an outcome that he wants.
HHS on Aug. 14 announced it was reviving a federal panel, disbanded in 1998, to provide oversight of pediatric vaccines.
Kennedy’s work against vaccines has triggered unfriendly lawsuits too, including one brought by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other public health groups. His recent decision to halt funds for mRNA vaccine development yielded a swell of social media criticism.
“This is reckless. This is dangerous. This will cost lives. We must fight back,” Sen. Edward Markey (D-Mass.) said Aug. 5 on X.
“I’ve tried to be objective & non-alarmist in response to current HHS actions – but quite frankly this move is going to cost lives,” Jerome Adams, who was U.S. surgeon general during the previous Trump administration, said Aug. 5 on the same platform.
Kennedy and his backers remain undeterred. In a counterpunch, his supporters are launching an unprecedented public relations campaign to promote the HHS secretary, spurring speculation that he may be mulling a 2028 presidential run.
The nonprofit MAHA Action held a call in July to energize Kennedy supporters and initiated a six-figure ad campaign extolling Kennedy and Trump administration health initiatives.
“Make no mistake, this is a revolution that will change the face of public health policy,” Tony Lyons, president of MAHA Action, said in a statement. “Americans are demanding radical transparency and gold standard science.”

The company that now operates Badami, Cook Inlet Energy, improperly flared natural gas over a six-month period, state regulators say. (Map provided by Alaska Division of Oil and Gas/Alaska Department of Natural Resources)A small energy company operating a North Slope oil field has been ordered to pay a $357,905 fine for illegally flaring natural gas over a six-month period.
The Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission assessed the fine against Cook Inlet Energy in an order issued on Aug. 14.
Cook Inlet Energy flared over 51 million cubic feet of natural gas at the Badami field between last October and March, according to the commission.
The fine’s dollar amount is equal to twice the market value of the gas lost to flaring, as specified by state law, the AOGCC said in its order.
Cook Inlet Energy could reduce the fine amount if it upgrades or replaces the vapor recovery unit that had been inoperable at the time the gas was flared, the AOGCC order said.
The commission initially proposed the fine in May. The company disputed the commission’s initial findings of violations, arguing that the flaring was necessary for safety because the Badami vapor recovery unit was unexpectedly inoperable, that there was no backup system and that a power outage compounded the problem, according to the order.
Cook Inlet Energy pointed out that it had duly reported the gas flaring, and it argued that the flaring was legal under a rule that allows natural gas to be burned off in that way in emergencies or other special circumstances. The company cited a 2022 AOGCC order that allowed flaring at a well drilled by Great Bear Pantheon LLC.

	However, the AOGCC found that those special circumstances did not apply in this case, according to the order.
Cook Inlet Energy raised other issues in its arguments against the commission’s finding. One company argument cited the lack of a market for North Slope natural gas; because there is no market, the company argued, no royalties were lost to the state through the flaring.
However, the commission said it considers the flaring to be a waste of a state-owned natural resource, nonetheless.
“Resource conservation, including that of reducing or eliminating gas flare volumes, is of utmost importance to the State of Alaska, with lack of a current export path or current unrealized royalties being immaterial,” the AOGCC order said.
A small amount of gas flaring is allowed in Alaska, despite Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s repeated claims that oil producers in the state do not flare any natural gas. However, Cook Inlet Energy’s flaring well exceeded what would be allowable, according to the AOGCC order.
Cook Inlet Energy has a year to pay the fine, and it can credit the costs of a vapor recovery unit upgrade or replacement against the assessed $357,905, according to the order. The company also has the right to appeal the commission’s findings.
Cook Inlet Energy is a subsidiary of Glacier Oil & Gas, a privately held independent company. Until recently, a different Glacier Oil & Gas subsidiary, Savant Alaska, operated the Badami field.
Badami, located on the eastern side of the North Slope, was originally brought into development by BP. Production there started in 1998.  A decade later, BP formed a partnership with Savant that established the latter as Badami’s operator.
Badami’s production has fluctuated. It was about 2,000 barrels a day from April 2024 to March 2025, but in the year prior to that period, it averaged less than 900 barrels a day, according to the Alaska Division of Oil and Gas. The increase in production was largely attributed to a new well.

(Photo courtesy of Iowa State University)Iowa State University is working with a U.S. Defense Department-backed organization to develop facilities that could make the university and its community a national destination for biobased product testing.
BioMADE, a Manufacturing Innovation Institute focused on bioindustrial manufacturing and supported by the U.S. Department of Defense, announced it has partnered with ISU and the ISU Research Park to create and operate a multiuse fermentation facility.
The $40 million project, funded with contributions from the Iowa Economic Development and Finance Authority, BioMADE and Iowa State, will be housed at the university’s BioCentury Research Farm outside of Ames.
Kevin Moore, chief technology officer of the Biobased Products team in the office of the vice president for research, said the announcement brings to fruition work that was started by the state to strengthen biosciences industries in Iowa. He expects the program to be up and running in early 2028, and the new facility will utilize existing infrastructure to operate.
“This is why the state has invested money in this kind of effort, is that so we would have resources that could go after this opportunity,” Moore said. “And that’s what we did, and we’re going forward.”

The Biobased Products team at ISU was created as part of a statewide biosciences initiative, Moore said, with the goal of promoting economic development in related industries. Much of Moore’s job is working with ISU faculty to commercialize ideas or products they’ve developed through startup companies, he said.
Fermentation is best known for its role in the beer-making process, Moore said, but it also has a hand in making enzymes that can be found in detergents and other items, natural products like vitamin C, bioplastics and more.
The university already has fermentation abilities, Moore said, but on a much smaller scale. The ISU Center for Crops Utilization Research houses a fermentation facility with equipment that goes up to 1,000 liters, where companies can test products on a small scale and complete “proof of concept” work, but the new space will scale capabilities up to 10,000 liters.
Moore said the goal behind the new facility is to bring in companies to test their products before they have to decide whether to invest in customized, full-scale facilities of their own to mass-produce it.
“The key purpose of the announced facility is to de-risk investment decisions so that we can diversify the products that are made from corn, and also enable all of the various technologies that are being developed via fermentation, allowing them to come to reality,” Moore said.
As Iowa has plenty of feedstock and the need to diversify how corn is used, Moore said, and this new partnership provides opportunities to address both of these facts.
As the facilities will be managed by BioMADE and aimed at industry development, Moore said it is unlikely much research coming from ISU will be conducted there. Companies based in Iowa like Cargill and Kent Worldwide are expected to make use of the facilities, Moore said, as well as national and international partners of BioMADE.
“We do envision that some faculty members and their startup companies could be users of the facility, but really we view this as a national resource,” Moore said.

President Donald Trump on Monday rehashed his disdain for mail-in voting — a method that Trump has often attacked as part of the reason he lost the presidential election in 2020. 
During a meeting with Ukraine’s president, Trump said that lawyers are working to draft an executive order to end mail-in ballots before the 2026 midterm elections. That same day on social media, Trump said, without evidence, that mail-in ballots and voting machines are a scam and “a complete and total disaster.” 
But in a state where vote-by-mail has been available by default for all Californians since 2021, can Trump really do that? 
Though the U.S. has allowed people to vote by mail since the Civil War, its usage and accessibility ramped up in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts say that while voting by mail does increase the risk of fraud compared to in-person voting, mail-in voting fraud is still exceedingly rare.
Voters are more likely to get hit by lightning than to commit mail ballot fraud, said California Secretary of State Shirley Weber, citing one analysis.

Weber: “The president himself has voted by mail in his home state of Florida, so we know he has trusted the system enough to use it himself. He has won elections and lost elections with mail-in votes being counted.”

Though some California Republicans in Congress supported Trump’s unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud, state GOP leaders have embraced mail voting. Of the more than 16 million votes cast by Californians during the 2024 general election, more than 13 million, or nearly 81%, was through vote-by-mail.

State Sen. Sabrina Cervantes, a Riverside Democrat and chairperson of the Senate elections committee: “Mail-in balloting gives voters who may experience challenges, such as health or even distance from voting centers, their right to vote.”

In addition to putting the Republican party and strategists in a bind, Trump’s pledges to eliminate mail-in voting by the end of next year is also unlikely. Congress has the authority to oversee federal elections, and should the president move ahead with his plan, “we will fight to defend our democracy,” said Assemblymember Gail Pellerin, the chairperson of the Assembly elections committee.

Pellerin, a Santa Cruz Democrat: “While I understand that Trump has a difficult time understanding the Constitution and the limits of his power, the truth is that he does not have the authority to do this.”

Speaking of the 2026 elections, a group of Republican legislators said Tuesday that they are suing to stop the state from advancing Gov. Gavin Newsom’s mid-cycle redistricting plan, reports CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller. 
The emergency petition, filed with the California Supreme Court, relates to a three-bill package that Democrats in the Legislature are scrambling to pass that would enable voters to accept or reject redrawn congressional maps during a Nov. 4 special election. 
The GOP lawmakers said that Democrats are violating the state constitution by sidestepping a rule that requires legislation, with some exceptions, to be publicly available for 30 days before lawmakers can vote on it.

In their first formal response since the Trump administration undercut a handful of California’s climate policies during the past few months, state regulators unveiled guidelines Tuesday that aim to reaffirm California’s clean energy initiatives, write CalMatters’ Alejandro Lazo and Alejandra Reyes-Velarde.
The proposals include recommending more private investment, asking the Legislature to backfill electric vehicle incentives and rewriting clean car rules. Several state agencies developed the recommendations as a joint effort in response to Newsom’s June executive order directing regulators to double down on transitioning away from fossil fuels. 
Though the chairperson of California’s Air Resources Board said “California … will not give up on cleaner air and better public health,” some climate experts said the suggestions weren’t aggressive enough.

Daniel Sperling, a former air board member and current director of UC Davis’ Institute for Transportation Studies: “I’m puzzled, actually, because they had acted like they were really going to do something significant.”

A spokesman for the governor said Newsom would review the proposals.

Fran was a truly wonderful man who had a kind word for everyone he met and genuinely believed it when he would say, “Life is Good”!
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Francis Walter Kazak.","Born Feb. 7, 1942
Springfield, Vermont
Died Aug. 9, 2025


Francis Walter Kazak was born in Springfield Vermont on February 7, 1942.
As the son of Veronica Janowski and Walter Kazak, he grew up in Springfield and Cavendish in the heyday of the machine tool industry where the extended family of Polish Russian heritage were hard working individuals as farmers, manufacturing plant workers, and grocery store owners. His maternal grandfather worked in the mill at night and tended his small farm and cows in Cavendish during the days.
Fran was proud of the Springfield community where he grew up and sang the praises of all the resources that they had for young people. A fond memory he had as a young boy was of walking down the steep hill from his home to the center of town to drop off the bill payments for his parents and pick up 2 loaves of Polish bread from the local bakery. He would carry them back home as fast as he could, so they were still warm for butter. During his high school years, he especially enjoyed the block dances and working as the rope tow attendant at the local ski hill. He was the designated “weeder” in his father’s extensive garden where they would grow vegetables by the basketful, bring them home where he, his sisters, and mother would prepare them for freezing. He also helped his grandfather in Cavendish haying and tending to the cows.
In high school, he attended the co-op program at Springfield High School with several weeks in academic studies followed by a set of weeks in the in the manufacturing plants to learn the skills and tools of all the trades involved. The plan was for him to be prepared to transition into a good job after finishing high school. Fortunately, his high school teachers, along with an observant guidance counselor recognized Fran’s academic ability and told his parents that, “this young man should be going on to college”. Following that advice, Fran went off to Boston and attended Franklin Institute on an ASTME scholarship to finish up requirements in order to apply for college. He attended UVM School of Engineering and when he graduated was immediately recruited by IBM. There he thrived in the demands of his job and the freedom to use his creative mind for new innovations in the chip manufacturing industry.
At IBM, he met Lorraine Elizabeth Hurst, the love of his life, and introduced her to his extensive family of aunts, uncles, and a multitude of cousins. Lori and Fran married on June 20, 1969. Together they built a home in Westford, VT and welcomed their son Christopher Michael in 1979, and then Corey Joseph in 1982. Later they relocated to Essex Junction. As a devoted father, Fran involved the boys in outdoor activities, the cub scouts, took them to the mountains for family skiing, and was there for them as they pursued their passions for playing soccer and running cross country and track. For many summers he and Lori and the boys would join with other family members on the coast of Maine for camping or renting a big beach house for lots of beach time, lobsters, and summer fun. Fran’s large extended family was his social network and support system for his whole life, and he maintained close connections with his cousins.
As the turns of life go, Fran and Lori entered into a 13-year battle when she was diagnosed with cancer. He was with her every step of the way on this marathon trying everything to beat the odds that ended in the summer of 2003 when she passed away. He continued his devotion to Chris and Corey as they journeyed through college, spent time living and working in Boston, establishing their careers and moved on to finding and marrying their wonderful spouses. Fran especially enjoyed traveling to Boston to go to the Red Sox games with them. He was so proud of them and delighted in having daughter in-laws and three wonderful grandchildren.
Fran is survived by his sons Chris and his wife Devon, Lorraine (6) and Nolan (3), and Corey, his wife Natalie and their 4-month-old son, Colton, a sister, Janice and two nieces in NY, a sister, Jean and husband Bob and a niece in North Carolina, and a nephew in Maine and his partner of 20 years, Maura O’Brien.
Fran and Maura, also of Westford, reacquainted in 2006 and soon it became clear that they would become partners for life. Fran often said that he was blessed with the two greatest loves of his life. Fran and Maura recognized the passion in the love each had for their own families and Fran welcomed Maura’s son, Benjamin, and daughter, Anna along with her husband Bill and daughters Elsa (14) and Alice (11), into his circle of love. He delighted in attending the girls jazz band nights, dance performances and the McCloy and OBrien family gatherings. Fran and Maura had a mutual love for the outdoors, jazz music and music of the 50’s 60’s. They relished every opportunity to dance including in the kitchen on Saturday nights to the “My Place” music on VPR. Together, they loved touring the art galleries in Vermont, Cape Cod, Boston, DC and NYC , historical museums, and especially loved musical theater productions. They shared similar reading interests especially in history and often had long discussions on issues related to social justice. They loved cooking together, especially finding great recipes and planning gourmet meals with each other. For many years they gardened together on the ‘lower four’ as Fran called the property where they had garden beds and boxes. Together, they took the ‘trip of the lifetime’ and spent a month in Africa touring Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Johannesburg, and South Africa. They continued to revisit the trip in the photos and memories they shared.
Fran’s passions and pastimes were reading, music, and Radio Controlled (RC) planes. He was a voracious reader. Every day he consumed several national and local news publications. There were always at least two books on his chair side table; one with a historical focus, and another, an action-packed thriller. In recent years, he discovered enjoyment in reading poetry. As a lover of music, he catalogued and downloaded his favorite music on to all his devices. For many years, he focused on building, fine tuning, and flying RC planes; mostly the fine-tuning and creating adaptations for a better flight. He did everything with scientific precision from creating the right compost for the garden, to designing a new gate for the deck for the grandchildren, experimenting with weights and measures in his passion for making bread, finding the best lens for his many cameras, and researching and practicing restoration and storage of family photos. He loved watching the birds and came up with all sorts of technological improvement to bird feeders to attract them, especially the Baltimore Orioles and hummingbirds this past Spring. Fran was a truly wonderful man who had a kind word for everyone he met and genuinely believed it when he would say, “Life is Good”!
Over time, Fran volunteered for the Burlington Food Shelf and recently he became a proud member of the Essex Rotary Club. Many heartfelt thanks go to the extraordinarily compassionate nurses and doctors at UVM Medical Center Cardiac Care unit. In lieu flowers, please consider a donation the Essex VT Rotary Club.

CalMatters intern Sarah Calixto shares what she learned while working at CalMatters, and what journalism students can take away from her experience.


This summer, I had the incredible opportunity to work as an intern on CalMatters’ audience engagement team. As my time comes to an end and I prepare for my senior year of college, here are the lessons I learned that could help other journalism students or those starting out in their careers. 
1. Readers need to know how big news affects their lives 
Newsrooms need to find ways to break down how “big” news will affect their local audience. During my internship, I saw reporter Kristen Hwang break down how the federal government’s new budget made significant changes to Covered California, which experts and insurers both said would make health insurance cost more for consumers. The spending bill had thousands of repercussions to dissect and discuss, but zeroing in on how it would affect one crucial part of people’s lives helped CalMatters cut through the noise. I then “translated” Kristen’s story into an accessible, easy-to-digest Instagram post in order to reach even more Californians where they are, and focused on highlighting tangible details from the story, like how premiums are expected to increase by 66% or $101 per month starting next year. 
2. Influencers can be an advantage for newsrooms 
For my internship, I worked on the early development of a project to better use social media as a way to build deeper connections with a younger audience. For the project, I spent hours scrolling and researching the profiles of users on TikTok and Instagram. I focused on finding people based in California that had a platform related to the content of a news story, had news centered posts, or the perfect combination of both. From there, I debated whether the influencer would be a good fit within CalMatters and what it stands for, as well as if the influencers themselves would agree and benefit from a partnership. 
As I spent hours on social media platforms, I got a bigger glimpse of how useful social media and influencers today can be to news outlets. For example, I found profiles of young people who built their platforms on discussing news in a more relatable and digestible manner to a younger audience. I also found professionals that used their knowledge to dismantle misinformation on social media and provide the actual facts. Regardless of the actual content, those who had a following in the platform, made themselves a foundation to stand on and made sure to carve out an unique space for themselves within their content bubble. 
3. There’s room in journalism for a sense of humor
During my internship I had the opportunity to create a vertical video post for reporter Lynn La’s story about how California could enact a first-in-the-nation ban on plastic glitter in cosmetics. 

        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by CalMatters (@calmatters)

As someone who watches beauty and style videos on TikTok regularly, I read her story and knew that it could translate really well in several different TikTok “trends.” With that in mind, I recorded and edited three ideas that could work within the TikTok platform: a “Get Ready With Me” video, the “Shock Horror” trending sound, and a simple educational skit. In the end, my editors published the less risky explainer skit (they are elder millennials, after all), but I still felt accomplished in being able to report the news with humor and a glitter face filter. This is something I would absolutely try again in future newsrooms, especially if I’m thinking about reaching and connecting with a younger audience.
Overall, I’ve grown and learned a lot this summer, both as a professional and as a journalist. I’m moving forward with a new comprehension of what journalism means today, and how I can be the best reporter for readers and any newsroom I work for in the future.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/052825_CalMatters-Office-File_MG_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-20 08:56:24.401154

GoFundMe.org has teamed with an Inland Empire non-profit to distribute air conditioners and air and water purifiers to those in need just as the temperatures are predicted to rise to near 115 degrees in the desert. 


As the Inland Empire braces for an extreme heat warning this week, a community group is helping residents in the hottest parts of the desert manage scorching weather.
The nonprofit Comité Civico del Valle has distributed air purifiers, air conditioning devices and water purifiers to families living around the Salton Sea, through a weather resilience program that GoFundMe.org launched.
“This program’s about fairness, safety and dignity for our residents,” Luis Olmedo, executive director of Comité Civico del Valle said at a press conference last week. “It’s not just about handing out equipment. It’s about making sure that vulnerable residents, especially seniors, people with health conditions and low-income families are not left behind when extreme heat strikes.”
The National Weather Service is warning of extreme weather conditions in inland desert areas this week, with temperatures forecast at 106 to 115 degrees Fahrenheit. Weather conditions, it stated, will be “dangerously hot” and pose a “major heat risk” of illnesses including heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke.
But triple digit temperatures are the norm in summer for desert communities in eastern Riverside and Imperial County.
And aging homes aren’t equipped to protect against those conditions. Many families live in mobile homes, including old, aluminum trailers without insulation that are “like being inside a can,” said Esther Bejarano, director of health programs for the organization.
“Imagine living inside that trailer where it’s 30, 40 years old, and you have a non-working inside window unit… to cool the house,” she said.
In 2022 Imperial County had more than 100 heat-related emergency room visits per 100,000 residents: the highest rate in the state. Last year the county recorded 196 heat-related medical incidents, including 11 deaths. This year so far it has reported 65 illnesses and no deaths.
Neighboring Riverside County, which also includes parts of the Salton Sea, recorded 1,627 emergency room visits and 65 deaths due to heat-related illness in 2024 and 550 heat-related emergency department visits and two deaths this year. 
GoFundMe.org introduced a pilot program to reduce those risks. It provided half a million dollars to Comité Civico del Valle to provide the devices to people who lacked air filtration or cooling systems, or couldn’t afford to use them. 
“I knew people who lived in manufactured homes, which they called trailers. They had to go to the Circle K, the Arco, or the public library, to get cooled off, because they didn’t have air conditioning,” said Rodrigo Palma, a 72-year-old Brawley resident, who received help through the program.
The goal was to provide 100 families with updated cooling systems. So far the program has installed 72 cooling systems, 389 air purifiers and four reverse osmosis water filters, said Amanda Brown Lehrman, executive director of GoFundMe.org.
“While these interventions do not replace the need for systemic change, they do provide families with tools to protect their health and manage the everyday challenges a little bit more faithfully and a little bit more affordably,” Lehrman said.
The weather resilience program hit some snags, Bejarano said. The cooling systems, called mini-split air conditioning units, are ductless systems designed to cool individual rooms quickly and efficiently, she said.
“They’ve been very popular and sales have skyrocketed, because people cannot afford to turn on the AC if they do have one to cool the entire house,” she said.
But contractors hired to install them found that permits cost as much as $900 per unit, she said.
“We’ve had a lot of hurdles with the very high cost of permits for these homes and families that need it the most,” she said. “That’s something we need to do some policy work on.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/081925-Brawley-Farm-RS-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C592&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-20 08:56:24.401154
,California,2025-08-20 12:15:00+00:00,CalMatters,California has a fallback plan for Trump’s clean car attacks. Does it go far enough?,Alejandro Lazo and Alejandra Reyes-Velarde,,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/climate-change/2025/08/trump-climate-counter/,"Amid a legal fight over California’s power to regulate car and truck pollution, state agencies are suggesting policies that need stable funding, legislative action, or lengthy rulemaking.","In summary
Amid a legal fight over California’s power to regulate car and truck pollution, state agencies are suggesting policies that need stable funding, legislative action, or lengthy rulemaking.


California regulators, responding to the Trump Administration’s attacks on the state’s climate policy, propose to fight back in part by asking lawmakers to backfill electric vehicle incentives, recommending more private investment, and beginning to write clean car rules — again. 
“Clean air efforts are under siege, putting the health of every American at risk,” said Air Resources Board chairperson Liane Randolph. “California is continuing to fight back and will not give up on cleaner air and better public health. We have a legal and moral obligation.”
Several state agencies jointly made the recommendations in response to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s June executive order calling for California to double down on efforts to transition away from fossil fuels. 
Proposals unveiled Tuesday also include replacing expiring federal EV tax credits — a tough ask in a tight budget year—and restoring carpool lane access, which would require federal approval. One recommendation seeks to expand vehicle charging access by streamlining utility hookups and simplifying permits for new stations. 
The air board is advancing just a few regulatory ideas: one to enact stronger consumer protections for clean car owners, and another to curb diesel pollution from freight hubs such as ports and warehouses. Randolph also said the board would begin work on a new clean cars rule.
A spokesman for the governor said he would review the agencies’ report. 
The recommendations reflect the hard shift the state has experienced from a supportive Biden administration toward a hostile one under President Trump, said Guillermo Ortiz, senior clean vehicles advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council.
“When you have your federal government using every tool at its disposal to attack its own state …how are you able to see every attack angle, every vector, everything that this administration is willing to do to harm California?” he said. “That’s difficult.” 
Other experts also said they expected more. “Folks familiar with this kind of policy will read it and feel…underwhelmed,” wrote Earthjustice lawyer Adrian Martinez in an analysis of the plan.
“Nothing jumps out at me as being particularly aggressive,” said Daniel Sperling, a former Air Resources Board member who is the director of the Institute for Transportation Studies at UC Davis. “I’m puzzled, actually, because they had acted like they were really going to do something significant.”
Trucking deal collapses
California offered the remedies as a fallback after the Trump Administration announced it would cancel federal waivers issued under the Clean Air Act that have long allowed the state to set more aggressive car and truck standards.
Attacks on the state’s climate policies escalated last week, centered on the Clean Truck Partnership, a voluntary deal between major truck manufacturers and the state that would continue advancing zero emission truck technology even if the waiver programs fell through.
Last week, four manufacturers filed a lawsuit, seeking to dissolve their commitments under the partnership. The Federal Trade Commission, after launching an investigation into California’s program, declared the partnership unenforceable. 
Days later, Trump’s Justice Department intervened in two lawsuits, arguing that the decision whether to ban internal-combustion engines in heavy-duty trucks rests ultimately with the federal government.
California’s climate policies matter most in communities near ports, warehouses and railyards, where diesel pollution chokes the air, said Ortiz of the Natural Resources Defense Council. Truck exhaust is a major source of cancer risk and drives respiratory and heart disease. 
Without authority to make aggressive rules or strong voluntary measures like the Clean Truck Partnership, experts say the transition to less-polluting trucks could slow down.
A call for bolder action 
Experts who called for bolder action said the state has more power than its executive and legislative branches are using. 
Sperling said the state could better disincentivize gas-powered cars with a “feebate program,” which could charge fees on high-polluting vehicles in order to pay for clean-car rebates. 
“If you really want to put your money where your mouth is, I think really supercharging those programs to advance transportation electrification could be a massively successful strategy,” said Martinez, who directs Earthjustice’s campaign toward that goal. 
Martinez said that the state could better structure existing state programs including the Low Carbon Fuel Standard and the state’s Cap and Trade program to pay for electric cars and trucks.
“California shouldn’t blink” as the Trump Administration moves “aggressively,” he added.
Ethan Elkind, who directs the climate program at UC Berkeley’s Center for Law, Energy and the Environment, said a statewide rule tightening controls at warehouses and other pollution magnets could achieve similar aims to the truck mandates. 
Elkind previously has pushed to go further. If the federal government is getting out of the business of regulating tailpipe emissions and making climate policy, he added, California could fill that vacuum in the future. 
“The state could take a pretty aggressive approach here,” he added.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)President Donald Trump this week vowed to “lead a movement to get rid of” voting by mail ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. 
“WE WILL BEGIN THIS EFFORT, WHICH WILL BE STRONGLY OPPOSED BY THE DEMOCRATS BECAUSE THEY CHEAT AT LEVELS NEVER SEEN BEFORE, by signing an EXECUTIVE ORDER to help bring HONESTY to the 2026 Midterm Elections,” the president said in a post on Truth Social Monday. 
Trump, who has long opposed voting by mail, continued to claim, without evidence, that it’s fraught with fraud. 
Utah has been the only red state among eight that have conducted universal by-mail elections, including six Democratic strongholds and one swing state — a fact that some conservatives here have balked at, while others have defended the state’s by-mail system as a popular, convenient and safe voting method. 
After Trump’s post, Utah’s top election official, Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, a Republican, issued a short statement on social media without addressing the president directly. 
Utah Legislature approves bill to require voter ID, phase out automatic voting by mail by 2029

“The constitutional right of individual states to choose the manner in which they conduct secure elections is a fundamental strength of our system,” Henderson said. 
The president, however, asserted that states should do what the federal government wants. 
“Remember, the States are merely an ‘agent’ for the Federal Government in counting and tabulating the votes,” Trump said. “They must do what the Federal Government, as represented by the President of the United States, tells them, FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY, to do.”
Another high-ranking Republican and member of GOP legislative leadership — Senate Majority Assistant Whip Mike McKell, R-Spanish Fork — disagrees. 
McKell told Utah News Dispatch in an interview Tuesday that, like Henderson said, states have the right to choose how to administer their elections, and that he’d push back on an effort to completely undo voting by mail. 
“In Utah, we’re in a good place. I think there’s strong support for vote by mail. There’s also strong support for security,” McKell said.
He added that’s “the needle we tried to thread” earlier this year when the 2025 Utah Legislature passed a bill that he sponsored to require voter ID and eventually phase out automatic voting by mail in this state by 2026. The aim of that bill, he said, was to preserve voting by mail as an option for Utah voters while also adding a new layer of security. 
Even though local polls have shown a vast majority of Utahns remain confident in their elections, Gallup polling shows trust nationally has decreased especially among a faction of Republican voters since 2006 as elections have become more polarized. After Trump lost the 2020 election, he ramped up rhetoric to cast doubt on election security and voting by mail. 
Asked about Trump’s comments this week, McKell reiterated it’s a matter of states rights.

“It is a federalism issue,” he said. “If it’s not enumerated in the (U.S.) Constitution, it’s reserved for the states. That’s article 10. I think states have the right to dictate how they run their elections.” 
McKell also defended Utah’s track record as a state that has used voting by mail for years, starting with optional pilot programs that counties opted into before moving to universal voting by mail. 
“In the state of Utah, Republicans have done really well with vote by mail. We elect Republicans,” he said, also noting that Trump in 2024 won the red state handily. “There’s generally broad support for vote by mail, especially among rural voters and elderly voters in Utah.” 
He added that “it’s OK if there’s some tension between the federal government and state government,” but he argued the Constitution clearly reserves elections for states to control and administer. 
Pressed on how he’d respond to pressure from the Trump administration to get rid of voting by mail, McKell said, “I would resist a movement that didn’t originate in the state,” adding that he responds to his constituents, not the federal government. 
“If there’s a movement to change vote by mail, it needs to come from — it must come from — the state,” he said. “It’s a state issue. The states need to be in control of their own elections. Right now, I don’t feel like there’s a reason to eliminate vote by mail. I think we do a good job.” 
Utah election audit finds no ‘significant fraud,’ but raises concern over voter roll maintenance

Not all Republicans in Utah embrace voting by mail, however, Earlier this year, McKell’s bill was the result of a compromise between the House and Senate to more drastically restrict the state’s universal vote-by-mail system. 
Asked whether Trump’s comments could further inflame skepticism around the security of voting by mail in Utah, McKell said it’s nothing new. “We saw these comments before, and even going into the last legislative session, there were folks that opposed vote by mail.” 
But McKell said multiple state audits “have shown that our elections are safe and secure,” while legislators have also made efforts to continually improve the system where issues have cropped up, like in voter roll maintenance. 
It remains to be seen whether Trump’s comments could fan some Republican lawmakers’ appetite to go after voting by mail during their next general session in January, but McKell said typically every year there’s a slew of election bills for legislators to sort through. 
Asked whether he plans to make any tweaks to his 2025 bill, McKell said he’s still talking with clerks about any possible changes. 
“I feel like we did strike a really appropriate balance, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t look at ways to make it better,” he said, adding that he doesn’t have any specific proposals yet, “but that could change as we get closer to the legislative session.”

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)About a month and a half into Hal Nash’s term as chair of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles, civil rights and criminal justice reform groups say they’ve seen changes to the board’s operations and decision-making.
Officials of the ACLU of Alabama said at an event in Montgomery on Saturday that since Nash took over in July, members of the board appear to be speaking to each other more and questioning witnesses in parole hearings more closely.
“You all should be very hopeful,” said Nichelle Cunningham, a paralegal with the ACLU of Alabama who is spearheading the organization’s efforts to reform the state’s parole system. “You have a decent board that is going to be fair, that is going to be united, they are not going to be pitted against each other in their decision making. If your loved one is denied, I personally feel there is something that is lacking in that file.”

Gov. Kay Ivey appointed Nash, a former Jackson County corrections deputy, to the position in July, replacing former chair Leigh Gwathney.
Gwathney came on board after the Alabama Legislature passed new laws changing parole after the mistaken release of Jimmy O’Neal Spencer on parole in 2017. Spencer went on to kill three people, including a seven-year-old child, in a series of robberies in Guntersville.
The legislation established the director of the Alabama Bureau of Pardons and Paroles and made it a cabinet-level position. They outlined more strict rules for granting parole for people who committed violent crimes and established guidelines that the parole board may follow when deciding to grant parole.
Members of the parole board had granted parole to more than 50% of the applicants as recently as 2017. However, the parole rate began to decline steadily shortly into Gwathney’s tenure as chair. In 2023, the parole rate decreased to 8%, its lowest point before it increased to about 26% in 2025.
Civil rights groups criticized Gwathney for consistently voting against applicants seeking parole throughout her tenure. Legislators on the Joint Prison Oversight Committee also expressed disapproval after she was unable to answer their questions concerning the parole guidelines at a meeting in October.
The ACLU of Alabama has been sending witnesses to observe the parole board hearings for the past few years after the organization expressed concerns after the rate that the parole board granted parole plummeted.
Since Nash succeeded Gwathney, parole rates have gone up. From the beginning of the year through Gwathney’s departure in early July, the board granted parole almost 18% of the time while Gwathney. In the cases that have come before the board since Nash became chair, the parole rate increased to almost 30%, according to the Alabama Reflector’s calculations using information obtained from the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles.
“I think that he has come in with an open mind,” Cunningham said in an interview on Saturday. “He explains that this is going to be open and fair. ‘We are going into this hearing open-minded.’ It is going to be fair, and he is going to give it all his attention.”
In two successive rounds of parole board hearings on Tuesday, Nash opened the proceedings by telling attendees the board was interested in their testimony.
The parole board denied parole for the applicants in the first round, all with offenses considered violent and whose loved ones presented little evidence of any programs completed while incarcerated.
In the second round, the members granted parole to two applicants. The mother of one of the applicants spoke on his behalf at the hearing and was asked about the living situation should he be released.
“What would your answer be if he were paroled?” Nash asked the applicant’s mother.
The mother said that her son, who is on the autism spectrum, would come to live with her and that she would help ensure he would take his medication and undergo therapy.
Members also granted parole for another applicant whose sister said that the applicant earned his GED, completed an anger management program as well as obtaining his commercial driver’s license. He also drives a van to transport others who are incarcerated.
“They seem to listen, and they seem to want what is actually best for people who were there,” said Veronica Johnson of the Alabama Justice Initiative, who also spoke during the panel. “One person in particular, called the families back up to get some clarification.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_7336-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-20 08:56:24.401154

NV Energy is asking federal regulators for permission to let renewable energy clients out of their transmission agreements without penalty following President Donald Trump’s evisceration of clean energy tax credits for projects on federal land.  
Trump’s policies, according to NV Energy’s July 28 waiver request, “may have created significant challenges for solar and wind developers, especially for projects on land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management.”
“The request suggests that developers may abandon renewable energy projects that are no longer feasible,” Utility Dive reported Tuesday. “Projects with solar or wind components make up nearly 80% of NV Energy’s interconnection queue.”
In a filing Monday with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), two trade groups, Solar Energy Industries Association and the Interwest Energy Alliance, said NV Energy’s requested waiver would “encourage now-uncertain projects to withdraw from the queue or terminate their projects quickly, without penalty and with rapid return of their commercial deposits.” 
NV Energy is seeking a one-time, 60-day window to allow interconnection customers to withdraw without penalty. 
The waiver sought by NV Energy is necessary, the utility and the trade groups argue, because of  Trump policies such as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and an executive order and Department of Interior memo issued in the wake of the bill’s passage. 
The OBBB, billed as a cost-cutting measure for Americans, eliminates or phases out a number of clean energy tax credits enacted by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, and is expected to increase energy prices and reduce investment in renewables.
As a result of Trump’s policy, Nevada’s annual gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to “shrink by $1 billion in 2030 and $1.5 billion in 2035. Between 2025 and 2034 – the Reconciliation budget window – cumulative GDP would shrink by $8 billion in Nevada,” according to a state-by-state analysis from Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank. 
The July 15 DOI memo requires that both the deputy secretary and secretary of the Interior personally review “every decision, action, consultation, and other undertaking” related to solar and wind development on federal land under BLM management, which is most of the state, NV Energy wrote. 
“The purpose of this waiver request is thus both to clear the queue to the extent possible and avoid unneeded disputes, by providing a benefit to those willing to leave the queue,” the utility said in its filing. 
Trump’s phasing out and elimination of clean energy credits could leave a void in NV Energy’s anticipated load for Greenlink, a $4.2 billion transmission line project regulated by FERC. The utility hopes its effort to clear the decks of unworkable projects could pave the path for those that remain viable. 
“The rapid return of commercial deposits may also allow renewable developers to focus their development efforts on their projects that may be able to obtain tax credits, are not solar or wind and sited on federal land, or on their projects that remain viable because they are needed to meet state renewable standards, regardless of the changed economics.” 
NV Energy did not respond to questions about the impact of scrapped energy projects on Greenlink. 
solar projects deep in the project pipeline have been frozen
Earlier this month, Gov. Joe Lombardo wrote to Secretary of the Interior Doug Burghum complaining that “solar projects deep in the project pipeline have been frozen” by the administration’s announcements. The governor mentioned three NV Energy solar projects in the works that would “immediately support our growing economy and electrical grid reliance.” 
Lombardo, who singled out the energy needs of Nevada’s mining and data center industries, told Burghum he’s confident the two can work to “ensure Nevada’s ability to tap into one of its most abundant energy resources – solar energy – while meeting the Trump Administration’s goal of avoiding preferential treatment in federal permitting processes.”

Michigan’s State Board of Education is closer to filling the top education post after choosing Lisa Coons, Glenn Maleyko, and Judy Walton as finalists to be the next state superintendent.
Over two days, the board interviewed seven candidates to find the best applicant to succeed State Superintendent Michael Rice, who announced in April that he is retiring effective Oct. 3. Rice has been in the role since 2019.
The board interviewed four candidates on Monday but ended up selecting as finalists all three of the applicants who interviewed on Tuesday. They are:

Lisa Coons, former state superintendent in Virginia and former chief academic officer for the Tennessee Department of Education.
Glenn Maleyko, superintendent for Dearborn Public Schools
Judy Walton, superintendent and curriculum director for Harrison Community Schools

The three finalists will come back next week for a final interview with the board.
The four semifinalists that didn’t make it to the next round were Paul Salah, superintendent for Huron Valley Schools; John Severson, executive director of the Michigan Association of Intermediate School Administrators; Thomas Ahart, an education consultant and former superintendent of Des Moines Public Schools; and Christopher Timmis, superintendent for Dexter Public Schools.
Some of the board members noted that they had a strong field of semifinalists.
“We’ve heard from an incredible group of educators who are doing amazing work across the state and beyond,” board president Pam Pugh said.
Board member Tom McMillin, a Republican from Oakland Township, advocated for Timmis and was disappointed he wasn’t a finalist.
“He’s a change agent,” McMillin said, citing what Timmis said about moving away from what he described as a system that rewards seat time toward one that rewards student engagement and attainment of knowledge and skills.
“If we don’t get him, someone else will,” McMillin said.
He voted no on the finalists and fellow Republican Nikki Snyder, who is from Goodrich, initially passed on voting but then said, “You’re welcome to put it as a no.” Snyder and McMillin had advocated for including Timmis as a fourth finalist, but the consensus was to go with three candidates. The six Democrats on the board voted in favor of the finalists.
Here’s what they heard from the candidates, as well as their application materials:
 Maleyko: Working together will make it happen

Maleyko, the Dearborn superintendent, said his vision for public education in Michigan is aligned with what the State Board of Education and the Michigan Department of Education, or MDE, have already established as goals toward improving education. Among those eight goals are expanding early childhood education, improving early literacy achievement, increasing graduation rates, increasing the number of certified teachers in areas where there are shortages, and providing adequate and equitable school funding.
“These are all things that we know other states have been successful … at implementing,” Maleyko said.
But academic performance has struggled in Michigan, and other states are showing more improvement on a rigorous national exam.
Maleyko said Michigan needs stronger collaboration between the state and local districts, the business community, students, and other stakeholders to move the state forward.
“We know there’s strengths in Michigan, but there’s also areas where we can improve, and I think together, we can do that, and I’m steadfast in my belief that working together will make that happen,” he said.
Candidates were asked about how their experiences as educators shaped their approach to leadership. Maleyko, in his response, talked about when he was a first-year third-grade teacher at Salina Elementary School in the Dearborn district. A young boy had drawn a picture in his journal of someone being shot. Maleyko, concerned, consulted his principal and the school social worker. The parents, who spoke little English, came in. Through translation, the meaning behind the drawing became clear.
“It turned out that that student saw his uncle get shot … in Iraq after the first Gulf War in the 90s,” Maleyko said. “It was eye-opening, because here’s the thing, I grew up middle class. I didn’t have to deal with what that student had to deal with.
“But the one thing as an educator is that I could work my hardest to make sure that that student will receive the highest possible, best education they could, so that they would be successful in society. That has stood with me throughout my career.” That student’s story has stuck with him for years, and it helps him remember that many other students are dealing with challenges.
 Walton: We must grow the ‘future stories’ of students

The school year that began this week in Harrison Community Schools is the fourth one that has had a “future stories” theme. Superintendent Judy Walton said her vision for public education is to expand that theme across the state.
“We want to grow their future stories,” Walton said. “That has to be our vision, and we can’t do anything along the way that takes options off the table for them. It’s their job to write that story, and it’s also our job to sometimes help them see that future, even when they can’t because of things that are impacting them.”
In order to invest in those future stories, she said, Michigan will need to ensure there is “sustainable, equitable funding that recognizes the uniqueness of districts.” Each district has its own challenges and opportunities, and they vary in size and location, she said. In a small rural district like hers, she said, there is less red tape, but there are also fewer opportunities for competitive grants because of their size.
“Overall, it still matters the ZIP code of a child as to what kind of education you get, and that’s still not okay.”
Walton said there needs to be more of a connection between the MDE and districts, teachers, and students. The state education department, she said, must be the leader in making those connections happen and to build on “the great work that’s been happening.”
“We need to be out in front, making those connections, helping districts network with each other, because great ideas are everywhere in the state. But if we can’t connect people to them, they sit in silos, and a silo will be the death of great education across the state.”
When it comes to students, Walton said the Michigan Merit Curriculum, which outlines what classes students need to take for high school graduation, affected how many opportunities students had in school.
“It really impacted elective choices and things like [career and technical education] and things like work-based learning. … I think it also really dampens some of the creativity and love of learning that our kids have. And so I think we have to provide more choices for them, not let go of rigor, not saying we don’t want you to be able to compete. We’ve got to figure out more ways to help have more of their own voice heard in their path to a diploma.”
 Coons: Improving early literacy is a key priority

Coons spoke extensively about her experiences in Tennessee and Virginia and described herself as passionate about literacy. When she became executive officer of priority schools in Nashville, at a time when a growing number of struggling schools were at risk of a state takeover, it became imperative to “walk through every single classroom to see what was happening.”
As they walked through second grade classrooms, one troubling theme emerged. “No one was teaching reading. In every single second grade classroom I walked through, they were coloring. Not only were these students having a lot of challenges outside of the classroom, they weren’t having the opportunity to learn to read inside the classroom.”
When she sat down with the principal and second grade teaching team, she asked why they weren’t teaching reading. “And they said, ‘Our children can’t sit still. We are not able to teach.”
Thus began an intensive approach to turn around that school.
“We started with teacher training, instructional materials, partnered with a nonprofit to give deep, deep coaching for our teachers on classroom management and how to implement strategies, but also to our school leaders so they could track the data and understand data,” Coons said.
She told the board that the goal to improve early literacy must be the biggest priority and that Michigan needs to ensure that school districts across the state receive the resources and support they need. She said that how MDE partners with districts will be different in different parts of the state.
“It’s an incredibly important space for us to be over the next five years, to make sure that, first and foremost, our students have the opportunity at the end of third grade [to learn to read], because we know that opens doors for their futures.”
Coons said the MDE goal to increase the percentage of students who graduate from high school is also an important part of the state’s vision for improving education.
“As a student walks the stage, if they’re only ending with graduation, we haven’t served their next step. It’s incredibly important for us to think about what are those post-secondary opportunities that they’re having in high school that help them solidify their steps after they graduate?”
Michigan, she said, has a lot of different opportunities for high school students, such as early college programs and workplace readiness programs.
The goal should be that as students graduate, they’re not asking ‘What’s next?’ but are instead thinking, ‘This is where I’m headed.’

,California,2025-08-20 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s finances face a perfect storm. It could eventually lead to another tax hike,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/08/tax-increase-california-budget-storm/,"The structural deficit afflicting California's budget is fueling preliminary cogitating over a tax increase of some kind, which would probably have to be ratified by voters this decade.","A perfect storm of economic, fiscal and political trends is battering California’s already deficit-ridden state budget, leading public employee unions and other interest groups dependent on money from Sacramento to explore hefty tax increases.
The budget has what fiscal authorities call a “structural deficit,” meaning that its revenue system, dominated by personal income taxes, cannot generate enough income to fully finance all services and programs in current law.
Estimates of the chronic shortfall range from $10 billion a year to as much as $30 billion. Last fall, the Legislative Analyst’s Office calculated that state spending was increasing by about 6% a year while revenue was rising by only 4%.
The current budget, enacted in June, had a $12 billion deficit that was closed by tapping into the state’s emergency reserves, borrowing from special funds, postponing some payments and adopting some bookkeeping gimmicks. For instance, the budget eliminates payments to reduce the state’s ever-growing unfunded obligations for retiree health care which reached $91.5 billion, up $6.3 billion from a year earlier, Controller Malia Cohen recently revealed.
The permanence of the deficit is one factor that’s fueling preliminary cogitating over a tax increase of some kind, which probably would have to be ratified by voters.
Another is the reduction of federal aid to states by President Donald Trump and Congress. Federal funds are more than a quarter of California’s $321 billion state budget and the cuts mostly hit health and welfare programs, such as Medi-Cal. Many are looking to Sacramento for money to offset federal reductions.
Finally, a surtax on incomes of California’s wealthiest families, approved by voters in 2012 to deal with an earlier budget deficit, was supposed to last only a few years, but a 2016 ballot measure extended it to 2030. Its backers — public employee unions particularly — are planning to seek either another extension or permanent status.
The Franchise Tax Board says revenue from the surtax spiked to more than $16 billion in 2021 — thanks to the odd economics of the COVID-19 pandemic — but returned to a more normal $9-10 billion a year since.
Californians already bear one of the nation’s highest tax burdens. Wallet Hub has calculated that California’s major state and local taxes are the fourth-highest of any state with an 11% total tax burden. 
So what kind of tax increase might be proposed? There aren’t a lot of options.
Another income tax hike would be unlikely since maintaining the surtax on high-income taxpayers is already virtually certain to be on the ballot, probably in 2028. Increasing the sales tax, already hovering around 10%, would hit low-income families the hardest.
That leaves corporate income taxes as the most likely target — a source that the California Budget & Policy Center, a left-leaning research nonprofit, has been touting for years. Citing federal aid reductions and cuts in federal taxes on corporations and wealthy taxpayers, the organization is trumpeting the closure of what it views as loopholes in the corporate tax system.
“Given the immense harms that will be done as a result of the recently enacted federal budget bill, state leaders must develop plans to significantly raise state revenues … in order to balance the state budget and protect California residents that are vulnerable to serious harms from the federal cuts to health care, food assistance, and other federal policies,” the organization declares in a compilation of federal reductions.
Clearly something has to give. California cannot continue to run up budget deficits as the reduction of federal aid compounds the state’s already precarious finances.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/042924-State-Capitol-Session-MG-CM-33.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-20 08:56:24.401154

MOUNT PLEASANT, S.C. — Tariff uncertainties dented cargo numbers at the Port of Charleston last month, although the drop was in line with State Ports Authority expectations.
And, overall, the maritime agency finished its most recent fiscal year with an increase in containers.
“We’ll see,” Barbara Melvin, the authority’s president and CEO, said when asked about the impact of the Trump administration’s wide-ranging and on-again, off-again tariffs on foreign imports.

“There has certainly been a responsiveness in importers to watch the implementation of tariff deals as well as what might come in the future,” Melvin said. “I think, just as in any economic cycle that we have endured, the port — because of our infrastructure investments — will come out on the strong side of that.”
The port finished fiscal 2025, which ended June 30, handling a little more than 1.4 million containers of all sizes – up 2.3% from the previous 12-month period.

But in July, the first month of the new fiscal year, the port moved 117,059 cargo containers of all sizes through its terminals. That’s a nearly 6% drop from the same month a year ago.
Containers that arrived at the port loaded with goods declined by 7.5% year-over-year.
How all of that translates into money for South Carolina’s economic driver is unclear. The port’s financial numbers for the fiscal year will come out next month.
“I think that, obviously, there’s a substantial amount of uncertainty that we’re seeing” among shippers, Phil Padgett, the authority’s chief financial officer and vice president of administration, told the agency’s board of directors during a meeting Tuesday.
Depending on how tariffs play out, the port could see cargo levels land somewhere between an 8% loss and a 6% gain by the time the current fiscal year ends next June, according to an analysis by Joey Von Nessen, a research economist at the University of South Carolina.
The authority is projecting containerized cargo will be flat year-over-year.
Melvin said Charleston’s port could see import growth in the coming months as retailers look to stock their shelves with holiday-related merchandise. A 90-day pause in tariff hikes on Chinese goods, announced earlier this month, will likely help those numbers.
“Chinese imports have stayed steady during the first quarter of our fiscal year,” Melvin said.
Another boost could come from two new container line services that will start stopping at Charleston’s port in September.
Mediterranean Shipping Co. will add weekly calls on both its Albatross and Dragon services linking the port with stops in Europe, the Mediterranean and Asia. Ships on those routes can carry up to 15,000 cargo boxes measured in 20-foot equivalents.
The national outlook isn’t as bright. U.S. ports are expected to see a year-over-year 5.6% decline in imported cargo by the end of this year, according to the National Retail Federation and Hackett Associates, a maritime consultant.
“Tariffs are beginning to drive up consumer prices, and fewer imports will eventually mean fewer goods on store shelves,” Jonathan Gold, the federation’s vice president of supply chain and customs policy, said in a written statement. “Small businesses especially are grappling with the ability to stay in business.”
The forecast comes as tariffs on dozens of countries around the world that had been announced, postponed and then finally enacted after months of negotiations and deals began to take effect.
“Friends, allies and foes are all being hit by distortions in trade flows as importers try to second-guess tariff levels by pulling forward imports before the tariffs take effect,” analyst Ben Hackett said in a statement.
Hackett said the result will be “a downturn in trade volumes by late September because inventories for the holiday season will already be in hand.”

This story was originally published by CalMatters.
As Republicans lambasted California lawmakers for rushing through their effort to gerrymander the state’s congressional map, Democrats are facing a quieter angst in their own party.
To counter what they call President Donald Trump’s undemocratic power grab for Republican seats in Texas, they’re asking voters to temporarily ditch California’s nonpartisan map-drawing process — touted as a national gold standard for fair elections and good governance — in favor of a politico-drawn map to tilt seats in Democrats’ favor.
At the polls, they’ll have to overcome not just Republican opponents but also some Democrats and independent voters who say California shouldn’t respond to partisan gerrymandering in Texas with the same frowned-upon tactics at home.
“This is the kind of moral conflict that, if this goes to the ballot, that every California voter is going to be faced with,” said Sara Sadhawani, a political science professor, Democrat and former member of the state’s independent redistricting commission, at a hearing over the measures Tuesday.
Sadhawani helped draw the state’s existing congressional map when she sat on the commission alongside fellow Democrats, Republicans and independents after the 2020 Census. Now she’s one of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s partisan redistricting effort’s most vocal supporters.
Testifying in favor of the plan on Tuesday, she said lawmakers must respond to the “extreme attacks on our core democratic principles” in Texas and other red states that are considering redrawing their own maps.
“It brings me no joy to see the maps that we passed fairly by the Commission to be tossed aside,” she said. “I do believe this is a necessary step in a much bigger battle to shore up free and fair elections in our nation.”
But even as state- and congressional-level Democrats embrace the plan as their answer to voters clamoring for the party to put up a resistance to Trump, there are misgivings among Democrats statewide.
On the other side of the issue in the hearing rooms weren’t the Republicans who have vowed to fight Newsom through lawsuits and at the ballot box. Instead, opponents presented members of prior nonpartisan redistricting commissions: Jeanne Raya and Cynthia Dai, who are Democrats, and Connie Archbold Robinson, an independent, to testify against the measures.
“Our citizens in other parts of the country, who are being held hostage by politicians who do not represent their interests, have been looking to California as the alternative, as the model,” Robinson said. “If we gut the great work that we have been doing there, then not only do we lose our credibility, those efforts actually get stalled and get reversed.”
 Voters backed independent redistricting

Voters added the nonpartisan process for redrawing California’s political maps to the state constitution by a slim margin in 2008. In 2010 they approved using that same independent system to draw new congressional maps just as Republicans nationally campaigned to flip state legislatures for the purpose of drawing more GOP House seats in states like Wisconsin, North Carolina and Michigan.
Three other states use a similar process as California to draw congressional maps, but just over half of all states give that power directly to their legislatures, meaning the party in power can tilt seats to their advantage.
The current California congressional map gave Democrats a slight advantage. But while Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance have called the map unfair to the GOP,  Republicans in California have been, for the most part, satisfied with it. It maintained competitive districts that the GOP has been able to win or put up significant fights for — districts that will be eliminated under the partisan map voters will likely weigh in on this fall.
Statewide, Democratic voters outnumber Republicans nearly 2-to-1. Recent polling shows voters favor independent redistricting by about the same margin.
 California vs. Texas

To sell the redistricting measure to the public, Democrats have leaned heavily on framing it as a fight against Trump — and, ironically, in favor of fairer elections nationwide. In the state Senate elections committee, Democrats grilled the former map-drawers on whether it would ever be acceptable for them to draw new districts for political reasons and whether California ought to retaliate to discourage Texas’ efforts.
“Texas is actively reducing their own competitive seat count,” Sen. Sabrina Cervantes, a Riverside Democrat, said. “So then do you expect our communities to remain silent while their voices are being stripped away from Washington?”
Raya stressed she, too, opposed both the Trump administration and the Republican gerrymandering effort in Texas, which she called “reprehensible.”
“We’re living with … the despair that people have about the current political climate,” she said. “For me, this is not about declaring an emergency, and now, what do we do? This is, every day, we need to be doing something to make the system work and today what we need to do is protect the independent, nonpartisanship of drawing lines.”
But her fellow party members in the Senate said it’s not the time to go high.
“I will speak for myself, the conditions have been met for us to take action,” incoming Senate President Pro Tem Monique Limón, a Santa Barbara Democrat, said to the former commissioners. “I have utmost respect and recognition for the work that all of you do to protect our democracy.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/081925_Redistricting-Hearing_FG_CM_04-1024x682.webp,,,2025-08-20 11:58:40.105005

In the fall of 1925, agronomist Trofim Lysenko arrived on the dusty plains of what is now Azerbaijan, hoping to keep cows from starving to death over the winter. The young scientist, who learned to read as a teenager during the Russian Revolution, dismissed the rapidly advancing field of genetics. He believed nature could be bent to human will.
Lysenko denounced the idea that genes pass traits down as a “degradation of bourgeois culture,” and couldn’t understand why cows bred to produce more milk did so simply because they had “advantaged ancestors.” He attempted to “educate” crops by soaking them in freezing water, thinking that could force them to sprout in winter, and insisted that orange trees would grow in Siberia if exposed to the right stimuli.
Such ideas catapulted Lysenko to the head of Soviet agriculture under Stalin. In the midst of the famine his catastrophic policies helped create, Lysenko banned fertilizers and demanded farmers sow seeds close together, believing that plants of the same species wouldn’t compete.
Lysenko’s pseudoscientific ideas outraged his peers. Nikolai Vavilov, a Russian botanist who founded the world’s first seed bank, openly challenged his rejection of genetics. Lysenko denounced him, and the secret police arrested him in 1940. Vavilov, who had worked to prevent famines, starved to death in jail three years later.
This kind of scientific misinformation and the consequences it can bring now sound eerily familiar to U.S. climate experts like Shaina Sadai. She has been stunned by how quickly politics have overshadowed science since President Trump took office. The most recent government climate report, which the Department of Energy released last month, for instance, so drastically misrepresented the studies it cited that the researchers whose work it drew from publicly decried it. “I’m just really having a hard time with the barrage of apocalypses every day,” she said.
Sadai spent the last several years working international court cases, including a climate case law students from the South Pacific brought to the International Court of Justice. Over 130 countries signed on, and many outlined the existential threats they face from extreme heat, flooding, and other weather phenomena. Some, like Palau — which could see large portions of its land vanish beneath rising seas this century — argued that failing to curb emissions violates human rights under international treaties. Meanwhile, the United States urged the court not to overreach. This galled Sadai, who advised several of the countries supporting Vanuatu’s case, including Sierra Leone and Namibia. “I want so desperately for my country to be on the right side of things,” she said. Instead, Judge Yuji Iwasawa delivered the court’s decision that countries must act on climate change the same day the U.S. moved to weaken one of its primary tools to do just that.
The timing underscored a growing global divide: As the world moves toward greater climate accountability, the United States is pulling back, once again exiting the Paris agreement and undercutting decades of environmental regulations. This retreat comes amid a broader weakening of democratic norms, said Timothy Frye, a professor of post-Soviet politics at Columbia University. When power becomes heavily concentrated, protections begin to fray, something seen with recent revisions to the Endangered Species Act or key provisions of the Clean Water Act. “The U.S. democratic erosion is happening much faster, and along a much wider array of fronts, than a lot of the more recent cases,” like Turkey or Venezuela, he said.
***
One hallmark of this backsliding is how seemingly small changes can accumulate into a system that becomes far more autocratic. The piecemeal approach often borrows the most authoritarian elements from otherwise democratic governments, though each policy may appear initially defensible — a form of governance political scholar Kim Scheppele coined “the Frankenstate.” The Trump administration, for example, has declared an “energy emergency” which allows federal agencies to bypass environmental reviews and fast-track fossil fuel projects. The move is now facing a lawsuit from 15 states, who claim the emergency is fake.
This patchwork strategy makes it easier for politically connected companies to sidestep or shape laws to serve their interests. After soliciting $1 billion in campaign funding from oil and gas companies, for example, Trump has signed $18 billion in tax incentives for the industry and granted at least $6 billion in tax breaks. “The lack of constraints on the executive allow politically connected companies to either get around existing laws or to write laws in such a way that they’re toothless,” Frye said.
Autocratic leaders, he explained, like to build their economies around natural resources because they are easier to control than service or technology industries. Oil and gas firms, for instance, tend to be less transparent and less mobile, making them more susceptible to political pressure. At the same time, Frye noted, the economic clout of natural resource companies often turns into a political advantage.
One of Trump’s biggest donors this year was billionaire Kelcy Warren and his pipeline company Energy Transfer — the firm that sparked mass protests at Standing Rock. In 2025, it contributed $25 million to MAGA Inc., the super-PAC backing Trump. Soon after, the president lifted a pause on liquefied natural gas exports, clearing the way for an Energy Transfer project in Louisiana. The company is also now suing the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, challenging how the agency enforces its rules; a victory could give major Trump donors greater control over how their industries are regulated.
The pattern of placing industry-friendly figures in key roles extends to Lee Zeldin, who leads the Environmental Protection Agency. He also has longstanding ties to the fossil fuel business. Over the years, Zeldin received around $300,000 in campaign contributions from oil and gas companies, and before joining the agency he was a top executive at the America First Policy Institute, a group co-founded and funded by fracking billionaire Tim Dunn. Under Zeldin, the EPA has enacted sweeping changes: In March, it announced its intention to roll back dozens of rules, including limits on power plant emissions, coal ash disposal, and wetland protections, in what Zeldin called “the largest deregulatory announcement in U.S. history.”
Zeldin’s latest target is the EPA’s landmark endangerment finding, a legal basis for regulating greenhouse gases. He claimed repealing it would “end $1 trillion or more in hidden taxes on American businesses and families.” The Clean Air Act clearly says such costs can’t be considered in the process. To do so, the agency would have to reject established climate science and overturn a 2007 Supreme Court case that required the EPA to make decisions based on scientific evidence.
Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican who led the EPA under President George W. Bush, said Zeldin’s approach undermines the agency’s mission. “There’s more leniency for industry now,” she said. “This administration is doing nothing to improve the environment. What they’re doing is improving the bottom line of a lot of corporations.”
This is happening across the federal government, where institutions once trusted to provide objective oversight and data are being reshaped to serve the president’s goals. A nonprofit tracking alterations to environmental regulations on federal websites has recorded 879 revisions, many involving omissions and erasures. The Energy Department, for instance, has taken previous national climate assessments offline and suggested that it would rewrite them. This makes the United States a global outlier: Even in Russia, said political scientist Thane Gustafson, there’s less politicization of climate science, where “the climate change narrative is accepted, all the way from Putin on down.”
***
Much like during Lysenko’s era, when Soviet policies dismissed scientific integrity, political scientists like Frye now worry that American federal institutions are drifting from their foundational principles. There’s a gnawing feeling that the systems meant to protect us are rotting. What once felt stable begins to feel staged. This kind of dissonance has a name: hypernormalization. Coined by anthropologist Alexei Yurchak after studying post-Soviet Russia, it conveys the feeling that governing bodies have been stripped of real power. “That describes the EPA at the moment,” said Whitman.
The old standards of government have been swiftly gutted. Trump officials fired advisory panels that interpret science, overturned longstanding environmental regulations, dispensed with public comment periods, and centralized authority. What’s taking shape now is a shift not just in who holds power, but how that power is wielded.
The White House has a unique authority to manage and share facts. This ability to shape public perception operates largely beyond the reach of the law — as became clear when Trump abruptly fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics just hours after a disappointing jobs report, or when he planned to close the observatory that monitors carbon dioxide levels at Mauna Loa, one of the world’s most important sites for tracking climate change.
Losing belief in government is perilous: It makes disengaging feel like the only choice. “In an ever-changing, incomprehensible world, the masses had reached the point where they would, at the same time, believe everything and nothing, think that everything was possible and that nothing was true,” Hannah Arendt wrote in “The Origins of Totalitarianism.”
As what’s real and what’s purported to be real grows increasingly blurred, controlling the narrative can become more powerful than governing. The White House is taking this principle literally: After Paramount paid President Trump millions to settle his lawsuit against 60 Minutes, the administration approved its merger on the condition CBS install a “truth-arbiter” to monitor its coverage. Anna Gomez, the lone FCC commissioner appointed by a Democrat, objected, saying, “no government — regardless of party — gets to decide what is true, who gets heard, or which voices are silenced.” Similar mechanisms of control are being applied to the flow of federal dollars, with political appointees now deciding which research and science projects move forward.
Perhaps the most eerie part of living through the last six months is how these kinds of disquieting developments continue to unfold beneath a veneer of normalcy. While he’s deeply concerned about the country’s future, Frye said that, on a daily basis, competitive autocracies can look quite normal. Though he’s better placed than most to recognize the warning signs, he still has classes to teach, deadlines to meet. “Life goes on,” he said. Looming threats become banal, both impossible to ignore and somehow routine. “It’s usually not the case that there’s one point in time when you can point and say, ‘Ah, this is when we became an autocracy,’” he said.
Sadai, like many, is finding the discord hard to overcome. She’s unemployed and struggling to find a new academic job, thanks to federal budget cuts. She tries to find refuge in taking breaks to spend time in the New England woods that remind her of what she’s trying to protect. But when she returns, her phone lights up with notifications about people being abducted off the streets by masked government agents, or reports of coal-fired power plants receiving exemptions from air regulations. “It’s become so much harder to put everything aside for a few minutes and not have just a barrage of intrusive thoughts.”
“I just have to sit there, and break down, and then pull myself together,” she said. Though it often feels inadequate, she’s spending her days working through publication reviews and job applications, clinging to the hope that her life’s work might still contribute to climate policy, even as her elected leaders turn away.
Naming the collapse is the first step toward resistance. The question is whether we can see the failure clearly enough to imagine what comes next. “I don’t know what else to do but keep trying,” Sadai said.

(Photo courtesy of Ørsted)When the federal government earlier this month tried to stall Maryland’s progress on offshore wind, the Moore administration refused to back down. Instead, they stood firm, defending the state’s permit for US Wind’s clean energy project and refusing to let bureaucratic interference derail one of Maryland’s most promising tools to address surging energy demand and rising energy costs while driving economic growth.
By rejecting pressure from the Environmental Protection Agency, Moore’s team made clear that Marylanders will not let Washington dictate our path to a clean energy future.
As Maryland families and businesses face higher electricity bills driven by increasing demand and limited supply, developing reliable offshore wind with stable, long-term pricing is more important than ever. US Wind’s project will provide a significant influx of homegrown energy to meet the rising demand while acting as a key driver for a rapidly expanding local supply chain and workforce, including their plans to invest more than $300 million to establish Maryland’s first permanent offshore wind manufacturing facility in Baltimore County — Sparrows Point Steel.
Already, Maryland is seeing significant economic benefits from our offshore wind leadership. To date, the offshore wind supply chain has brought over $815 million in investments to the state, which includes millions of dollars to redevelop Baltimore County’s industrial waterfront for offshore wind steel manufacturing and component staging, a high-voltage cable manufacturing facility in Baltimore City, an additional $25 million in public funding to strengthen the state’s union workforce, and $11 million toward environmental research through the University of Maryland.

These investments are more than just numbers. They mean thousands of jobs and long-term economic resilience across the state. Baltimore is becoming a hub for heavy industry again, with manufacturing sites producing cables, foundations and other steel components for the offshore energy industry.
Ocean City is the natural home to operations and maintenance facilities that will support the industry for decades to come. Tradepoint Atlantic is growing into a key asset in the development and deployment of offshore wind projects across the East Coast. Crystal Steel Fabricators invested in upgrades at their facility and employs skilled machine tool operators, pipe fitters, 6G pipe welders and coating craftsmen to build boat landings and other secondary steel components at its Federalsburg facility.
More than 70 companies with offices, factories, or warehouses in the Old Line State already have contracts in the offshore wind industry, including those supplying fabricated steel, personal protective equipment, customs logistics and consulting services. These companies represent just a fraction of the 543 businesses with Maryland locations, employing hardworking Marylanders, and paying Maryland taxes registered in Oceantic Network’s Supply Chain Connect database that have expressed interest in joining the growing offshore wind supply chain — a supply chain that spans 40 states and supports $25.5 billion in domestic investments.
This pipeline of businesses will only continue to grow as more components of the offshore wind economy take root in Maryland, creating thousands of well-paying, family-supporting jobs in communities across our state.
Moore’s commitment comes at a critical moment. With global supply chains under pressure and clean energy goals looming, states that move decisively will become national leaders.
Maryland is already ahead of the curve, building one of the strongest offshore wind supply chains anywhere in the United States. By holding the line and ensuring progress on offshore wind, Moore is not only fighting for Maryland’s clean-energy future, but also protecting a critical economic engine for our state.
Press headlines have declared offshore wind “officially” dead, but it is not 6 feet under. The bureaucracy is maddening, but it isn’t fatal. We’re simply stuck in a loop of recycled roadblocks dressed up as breaking news.
Yet, while the paperwork shuffles and the fingers steeple, steel keeps hitting the water. Five utility-scale projects – nearly 6 gigawatts – are under construction right now from Virginia to Massachusetts, a build pace that rivals other global markets.
And here in Maryland, offshore wind is on track to supply thousands of jobs, hundreds of millions in investments, and enough clean, homegrown energy to power millions of homes and businesses for decades to come.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Block_Island_five_turbines-1-1024x798.jpeg,,,2025-08-20 07:56:20.330810

(Photo courtesy of City of Rochester)The Trump administration is once again pressuring liberal cities and states to cooperate with deportation efforts, despite previous setbacks in court.
Attorney General Pam Bondi sent letters last week telling sanctuary states, cities and counties that “you better be abiding by our federal policies and with our federal law enforcement, because if you aren’t, we’re going to come after you,” she said in a Fox News interview. She demanded the areas answer her by Tuesday.
Cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies generally refuse to assist with immigration raids or accede to requests for local jails to hold prisoners for deportation. Those that responded to Stateline’s questions about the letters said they were not inclined to change their positions about cooperation with immigration authorities.
“It’s the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they’re not going to intimidate you,” Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.
The Trump administration is attempting to force more cooperation with immigration arrests. But it suffered a serious court reversal on July 25, when a federal judge dismissed a sanctuary policies case against Illinois, Chicago and Cook County.
The state and local policies reflect a “decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law — a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment,” Judge Lindsay Jenkins wrote in an order now under appeal.
Bondi’s letters follow the Justice Department’s Aug. 5 release of a list of sanctuary jurisdictions including 12 states, the District of Columbia, four counties and 18 cities. That’s fewer jurisdictions than the 14 states and almost 500 counties and cities that appeared on an earlier list, which the agency withdrew after criticism that it included conservative counties that were fully cooperating with immigration enforcement.
The states on the new list are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington state. The list also includes some counties and cities in those states as well as in Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New Mexico.


It’s the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they’re not going to intimidate you.


– Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha 


Other federal courts have issued injunctions to at least temporarily stop Trump administration from withholding unrelated federal funding from governments that don’t cooperate on immigration. Cities, counties and states have filed lawsuits challenging Trump’s executive orders targeting sanctuary policies, including a February order that federal payments to states and localities must not “by design or effect, facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration, or abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”
“The executive orders are directing agencies to basically take a maximalist approach to putting pressure on local governments to cooperate with immigration [enforcement], even though they’re not required to do so by federal law,” said Jonathan Miller, one of the attorneys working on the California case for the Public Rights Project, a California-based group promoting civil rights protections for states and cities.
One city on the administration’s list was Rochester, New York, which disciplined some police officers for helping federal agents make a March arrest in the city. The city already faces a lawsuit brought by the Trump administration that prominently mentions the arrest of three men from Guatemala; one of whom has since pleaded guilty to re-entering the United States after a previous deportation.

A spokesperson for the city, Barbara Pierce, said in a statement to The Guardian that, “Nothing in Attorney General Bondi’s letter is new and none of it has legal merit.”
“The letter reiterates many of the frivolous arguments that the federal government has already made in its pending suit against the city of Rochester,” she added. “These same arguments were levied against the city of Chicago and were dismissed by the federal district court for the eastern district of Illinois nearly a month ago.”
Ally Sullivan, a spokesperson for Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, said in a statement that Colorado “is not a sanctuary state. The Governor continues to be frustrated by this mistaken and incorrect label.” In a televised interview earlier this year, Polis pointed out that Colorado fully cooperates with federal authorities on criminal matters. Immigration, he said, is a civil matter.
“In Colorado, we are improving public safety, apprehending dangerous criminals, cooperating with federal law enforcement on criminal investigations, and keeping our communities safe,” Sullivan said.
Nevertheless, Colorado faces a federal lawsuit brought by the administration over its alleged sanctuary policies. Polis signed a measure in May that limits local law enforcement’s communication with federal immigration authorities and restricts where federal authorities can operate within schools, child care facilities, hospitals and libraries without a judicial warrant.

Connecticut Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont in a statement said the state’s Trust Act, which the Trump administration has targeted as a sanctuary policy, was passed with bipartisan support and helps ensure local police concentrate on serious crimes. The Trust Act, passed in 2013 and expanded in 2019, limits information sharing and compliance with requests to detain immigrants for federal immigration authorities.
“Nothing about this makes Connecticut a sanctuary in any legal or practical sense — it makes our state one that upholds the Constitution, respects the rule of law, and prioritizes the safety and well-being of our communities,” Lamont said.

Mike Braun took 11 helicopter trips with ISP over the last six months. (Indiana State Police)Sunday, May 26 was a pretty special day for Indiana Gov. Mike Braun. The state’s top executive spent his time at “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing,” punctuated by an appearance on Fox and Friends to recap his first legislative session as governor.
But rather than returning to the Governor’s Residence in Indianapolis, just a 20-minute drive from the track, Braun apparently drove to his Jasper family home two-and-a-half hours away.
And the next day, he took a helicopter ride to get back to the state capital.
The trip was one of 11 flights between March 13 and August 1 chronicled in response to a public records request submitted by the Indiana Capital Chronicle, totaling $23,880. The state said that it would have “incurred” those costs whether or not Braun had used the Indiana State Police helicopter, because those flight hours were necessary “to satisfy (the Federal Aviation Administration’s) mandated hours requirements.”

Though the FAA has established standards for pilots to maintain their licenses, the Indiana State Police has its own requirements for pilots to regularly travel on top of that.

“The Indiana State Police expects 1-3 hours of flight time per week per helicopter pilot,” said Griffin Reid, a spokesperson for Braun’s office. “Transportation decisions are made based on a number of factors.”
Eight of those trips ended at Braun’s southern Indiana home in Jasper, where the state paid $1,745.55 to install a 20-foot-by-20-foot gravel pad earlier this year. The remaining three flights transported the governor from Jasper to Indianapolis.
A member of his security detail accompanied him on every trip while his wife, Maureen, joined on only one trip.
Though Braun never flew on Sundays, he used the transit option at least once on every other day of the week. Each flight hour cost approximately $1,200.  A helicopter flight between Jasper and Indianapolis takes roughly 45 minutes, according to the office.
Braun is the first governor to reside outside of central Indiana as governor in recent history. Former Govs. Eric Holcomb and Mike Pence made the governor’s residence in Indianapolis their primary home — with Pence selling his Columbus home after becoming governor — while former Gov. Mitch Daniels split his time between that building and his home in Carmel.
But where did he go?
Braun first flew from Indianapolis to Jasper on March 13, one day before the Indiana Capital Chronicle publicized the taxpayer-funded helipad at his Jasper home. Two weeks later, also on a Thursday, he again used a helicopter to get from Indianapolis to Jasper.
His April 16 flight to Jasper was preceded by several public appearances the day before, including a press event with U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., signing the state’s effort to reform property taxes into law and the Perry Township Lincoln Day Dinner.
But neither his public releases nor his social media indicates his plans for April 16, the day he flew. The next day, a Thursday, he met with the Borden High School girls’ basketball team, the 2025 state champions, and attended another Lincoln Day Dinner in New Albany.
He flew two more times in April, starting both trips in Jasper and ending in Indianapolis. The first was Monday, April 21 — the day after Easter — while the next, on Tuesday, April 29, occurred one day before he celebrated 100 days in office.
None of Braun’s social media accounts indicated why he went to Angola in northern Indiana on Saturday, May 3. However, Trine University reports that Braun delivered the keynote address during commencement that day at 10 a.m. He opted to fly back to Jasper, bypassing the four-plus hour drive.
Two weeks later, Braun attended the Brickyard Breakfast in Indianapolis with the First Lady before flying back to Jasper on May 17. His next trip, on Monday, May 26, came one day after the Indianapolis 500.

Braun only flew once each of the following three months: Thursday, June 26; Friday, July 11; and Friday, Aug. 1.
Braun posted about his June visit with Israeli Consul General Yinam Cohen “to explore ways we can deepen collaboration and strengthen ties between Indiana and Israel,” flying back to Jasper later that day.
July 11 was one of the rare trips that didn’t originate in either Jasper or Indianapolis, but rather in the township of Culver. The northwestern township is roughly 64 miles, or just under 90 minutes, where he had a ceremonial bill signing earlier that day in Lake County.
His last trip, on Aug. 1, went from Indianapolis to Jasper with his wife, Maureen, after the governor delivered opening remarks at the Indiana Pork Ham Breakfast and Indiana State Fair Opening Ceremonies.

(Getty Images)Vice President J.D. Vance recently visited Indiana to meet with Gov. Mike Braun and Republican leaders. They discussed a plan to redraw the state’s congressional districts this year, mid-decade, in order to gain one or both of the seats currently held by Indiana Democrats and rig the 2026 mid-terms so Republicans can preserve their very slim House majority.
We are scholars and teachers of U.S. law and politics. And we are deeply troubled by the Trump administration’s attempt to rewrite the electoral rules mid-stream to maximize its power, and by Indiana Republicans’ failure to immediately reject such a transparently partisan move, which would corrupt the fairness of our elections. Whatever our party affiliation, all Hoosiers should care about fairness. We would never support changing the rules in the middle of a basketball game so that our team would gain unfair advantage. We want winners to win fair and square. In sports, and in politics.
Such corruption is possible because the process whereby Congressional districts are created is localized and susceptible to being rigged by those bent on gaining an unfair partisan advantage.
According to the U.S. Constitution, Congress allocates seats in the House of Representatives to states based on population. A census must be taken within every ten years to determine how population shifts may change the number of Congressional districts allocated to each state — a process called reapportionment. The actual shape of Congressional districts in each state is determined by state legislation.
Indiana’s House GOP congressional contingent lines up behind redistricting effort

In 1964, the Supreme Court ruled that Congressional districts must be of roughly equal population and honor the principle of “one person, one vote.”  Since then, Congressional redistricting has almost always been done on the ten-year cycle, except when federal courts have required certain states to redraw their maps to bring them into compliance with federal election law.
But now Texas Republicans are trying to redraw their Congressional map mid-decade. The reason why: because President Trump has very publicly called upon them to do this, telling CNBC’s Squawk Box: “We have an opportunity in Texas to pick up five seats. We have a really good governor, and we have good people in Texas. And I won Texas . . . and we are entitled to five more seats.”
It should be obvious that Trump’s vote total in the 2024 presidential election confers no GOP entitlement to extra House seats, which are not allocated based on presidential popularity (indeed, while Trump only received 56% of the 2024 Presidential vote, the Texas GOP controls 66% of the state’s House seats). If the party wants five more seats in Texas or two more in Indiana, then the correct way to obtain them is to run strong candidates in districts currently held by Democrats, and win the elections in those districts, fair and square.
The administration’s push for Texas, Indiana, and other “red” states to redistrict now has one very clear purpose: to change the electoral map, midstream, so that Trump and his party can retain control of the entire federal government by giving more power to voters they like while taking electoral power away from voters they don’t like.
And that is simply not fair.
Hoosier citizens, and not statehouse Republicans, should choose who they want to represent them in their congressional districts in 2026 and 2028 and 2030. And they can freely choose only if the elections are fair. Any party that tries to try to change district boundaries in advance of an election just so they have a better chance of winning the election is doing something that has a simple name: cheating.
Basketball coach John Wooden, a legendary Hoosier, famously taught his players to “never lie, never cheat, never steal.”
Indiana Republicans should heed coach Wooden’s famous words, politely refuse to do the bidding of the Trump administration, and stand tall, with their Democratic counterparts, and all patriotic Hoosiers, in defense of the fairness of our elections.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/redandbluewhitehouse-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-20 07:56:20.330810

The law, signed by Gov. Mike Kehoe in July, requires school districts to set a policy barring students from using mobile devices except for in emergencies or when instructed by a teacher. And with most students returning to classrooms this week, districts have been warning parents about the new expectations.
“I don’t know any district that’s fighting this,” Susan Goldammer, policy chief for the Missouri School Boards’ Association, told The Independent. “Most of the folks that I’ve spoken to are secretly quite happy that they have a little bit of additional authority to explain to parents why (devices) are not allowed.”

Goldammer wrote the association’s model policy that many Missouri school boards have personalized and adopted within the last month. Districts have asked about details, like exceptions for students with medical issues requiring access to cell phones, but they are largely ready to start the school year with the new policy.
Some Missouri districts already had bans on cell phones, while others were considering adding restrictions. For them, the law is a welcome addition and helps fight any pushback from parents and students.
“I have been surprised at how easy it was for districts to do this, and I can’t help but think that’s because all of the adults now are realizing it is not good to have the kind of electronic connectivity that kids have all the time,” Goldammer said.
The law is more restrictive than other states by banning cell phone usage throughout the entire school day instead of only during instructional time. But it allows for some nuances, giving districts the ability to choose how to enforce the policy and how devices will be stored.
Most districts have told parents that smartwatches are barred, citing the law’s ban of any “portable device that is used to initiate, receive, store, or view communication, information, images or data electronically.”
The Rockwood School District in Eureka, in a message to parents, indicated that it wasn’t completely banning smartwatches but that it expects students “to only use their smartwatch for the purpose of keeping time and not for communication purposes during school hours.”
The North Kansas City School District, though, will restrict all uses of smartwatches. The district included the question “Can my student wear their smartwatch if they aren’t using it for communication?” on its website, telling parents that smartwatches are barred but fitness trackers without message capabilities are allowed.
Districts also have different expectations on how devices will be stowed, though most are allowing students to have their devices turned off in their backpacks.
St. Louis Public Schools’ board of education approved a policy that allows for each school to choose its phone-collection method. 
“This flexibility acknowledges the diverse operational needs and preferences expressed by elementary and secondary staff and families,” Superintendent Millicent Borishade wrote in her August newsletter.
In its Aug. 12 meeting, the board also approved the purchase of locking phone pouches from Yondr for Gateway STEM High School at a cost of $40,000.
Goldammer anticipates that more districts will be considering purchasing phone-storage systems and evolving their policies before next school year. With a little over a month between the law’s passage and the first day of school, districts had time to set policies, but many were not able to make large purchases that quickly, she said.
But for now, administrators will be working on the best ways to execute the policy.
“There will be a learning curve,” Goldammer said. “There will be kids that break the rules. There always are.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/girls-with-phones-scaled-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-20 07:56:20.330810

(Laurel Demkovich/Washington State Standard)A woman who worked previously for Washington’s Department of Natural Resources is suing the agency and former state lands commissioner Hilary Franz, accusing them of allowing a top attorney at the department to carry out a campaign of harassment, intimidation and abuse against her.
Franz is accused of protecting former Department of Natural Resources General Counsel Daniel Teimouri by failing to intervene after Bailey Boyd, then-deputy director of external affairs, reported that Teimouri was abusing her. Teimouri and Boyd were dating at the time. 
Franz is also accused of retaliating against Boyd by drastically reducing her job responsibilities after she reported the abuse. 
Boyd, represented by HKM Employment Attorneys LLP, filed suit against Franz and the Department of Natural Resources in King County Superior Court on July 24. 
Boyd is seeking unspecified compensation for economic damages and for “pain and suffering, mental anguish, emotional distress, and humiliation” as well as reasonable attorneys fees and costs.
A trial is scheduled for July 27, 2026. 
The Department of Natural Resources declined to comment on ongoing litigation. 
Franz denied the allegations in an emailed statement last week. 
“Anyone who knows me and my work representing survivors of domestic violence knows these claims are untrue. I am confident that the truth will prevail,” Franz said. 
Franz served as Washington’s commissioner of public lands from January 2017 to January 2025. In 2023, she began to run for governor, then dropped out of that race and vied unsuccessfully last year for an open U.S. House seat in the 6th Congressional District.
Teimouri served as general counsel for the Department of Natural Resources from October 2022 to May 2024, when he voluntarily resigned to accept another job, according to the lawsuit. 
Teimouri could not be reached through his attorney for comment, but his attorney has previously stated that the lawsuit “contains a multitude of false allegations.”
Boyd was in a romantic relationship with Teimouri between September 2023 and July 2024, according to the lawsuit. 
Boyd described her relationship with Teimouri as physically, sexually and emotionally abusive, with Teimouri frequently threatening to get Boyd fired from her job if she did not comply with his demands. 
The complaint says Boyd reported the abuse to Franz during a dinner event on Feb. 2, 2024 and showed Franz some of the threatening text messages she had received from Teimouri. 
Franz allegedly responded by telling Boyd that Teimouri engaged in similar behavior with his previous girlfriend, who also worked under Franz at the Department of Natural Resources. 
Boyd said she again reported the ongoing abuse to Franz on March 9, 2024, after Teimouri allegedly hit her multiple times. 
Boyd called Franz instead of the police immediately after the incident out of fear of losing her job, according to the lawsuit. Teimouri allegedly took the phone from Boyd while she was on the phone with Franz and threw Boyd down the stairs in retaliation. 
In addition to taking no steps to intervene, Boyd alleges that Franz reduced her responsibilities at the department. 
Teimouri’s job duties, however, were not changed after Boyd reported the abuse, the lawsuit alleges. 
Even after Teimouri left the Department of Natural Resources, he continued threatening to get Boyd fired through his relationship with Franz’s chief of staff, Boyd’s lawsuit claims. 
Franz denied that Boyd ever reported the abuse to her, calling the allegations “false and completely unsubstantiated.” 
Teimouri was arrested for attempting to suffocate Boyd on July 13, 2024, at which point Boyd said she was able to escape the relationship. 
At the time of Teimouri’s arrest, officers documented a black eye Boyd received when Teimouri allegedly assaulted her on July 3. 
Police records indicate that Boyd told officers she didn’t report the July 3 assault to police because “she was afraid it would ruin Teimouri’s career.” 
Boyd reportedly told officers that Teimouri had a history of aggression and violence towards her, saying his abuse increased around December of 2023, when he reportedly stopped using marijuana. 
Teimouri was reportedly drunk at the time of the July 13 incident, which officers noted “may have been a contributing factor to his behavior.” 
When interviewed by officers, Teimouri reportedly described his relationship with Boyd as “good at times and tumultuous at times.” 
Boyd reported that most executive management employees at the Department of Natural Resources expressed sympathy to her about Teimouri’s abuse following his arrest. But Boyd said Franz never spoke to her about Teimouri after his arrest and continued to retaliate against her by not allowing her to travel or join meetings. 
Franz’s retaliatory behavior continued until her time as lands commissioner ended in January, Boyd claims in the lawsuit. 
Boyd left her position with the Department of Natural Resources around the same time. 
She could not be reached through her attorney for comment on this case.
Teimouri pleaded guilty on April 14, in Olympia Municipal Court to one count of fourth-degree assault, domestic violence. 
He was sentenced to 60 days on electronic home monitoring, with an additional 302 days of jail time suspended for five years. 
He was also ordered to pay a $1,358 fine and complete a domestic violence treatment program. 
A no-contact order preventing Teimouri from having any contact with Boyd for the next five years is in effect.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_6443-scaled-e1698268388674-1024x792.jpeg,,,2025-08-20 07:56:20.330810

Like many Minnesotans, I’ve experienced health challenges in recent years. I was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent chemotherapy and radiation. The complications of my cancer diagnosis and treatment left me with severe pain. I have to take medicine seven times a day just to manage that pain. Without Medicaid, I wouldn’t have been able to survive the treatment. And without SNAP, I wouldn’t have had the strength to fight for my life.
For 14 years, I worked at the Salvation Army in Duluth, helping neighbors get back on their feet. Before that, I was a retail worker, a teacher’s aide for kids with autism, and a librarian. I’ve spent my life taking care of people. Now, after everything, it feels like my country is turning its back on me.
With the passage of the GOP mega-law, President Donald Trump and members of Congress are making huge cuts to the very programs that have kept me going. Medicaid paid for my surgeries, doctor visits, and every prescription during cancer treatment. It still covers my medications and regular checkups to keep me healthy and make sure the cancer doesn’t return. Losing that coverage would mean no access to an oncologist, no pain medication and no way to afford the pills that keep me alive.
SNAP helps me access the food my body needs. Since retiring, I’ve lived on just over $800 a month in Social Security benefits. That barely leaves enough to cover rent, food, clothing, and other necessary bills. I receive $113 in SNAP benefits per month, which is about $3.74 per day. It’s not enough, but it helps. I don’t buy junk food and always shop the sales. Still, I spend another $100 of my own money on groceries every month.
When I got cancer, I applied for SNAP so I could afford fruit, vegetables, dairy and meat. The foods that help keep me healthy aren’t cheap. If my benefits are cut again, I’ll be forced to live on less healthy, microwaveable meals. A healthy diet isn’t optional when you’re recovering from cancer. It’s part of survival.
It’s not just me. In Minnesota, nearly 1.3 million people rely on Medicaid. Another 400,000 count on SNAP to keep food on the table every month. These are seniors like me, kids and people working long hours at jobs that barely cover the bills. No one chooses to struggle like this. We’re doing the best we can with what little we have.
Medicaid and SNAP aren’t luxuries. They are the reason I’m still here. I’m grateful for the support I’ve received, but that doesn’t mean I feel safe. Cuts are coming, and with them, the threat of losing everything I’ve fought so hard to hold onto.
I’m not just scared — I’m angry. And now I’m using my voice to speak out. Because the loss of these programs will diminish the opportunities for millions of Americans like me to live with dignity, health and hope.
While thankfully our senators voted against these cuts, U.S. Rep. Pete Stauber of the 8th District is celebrating kicking people off these life saving programs. Now he’s prancing around Minnesota during the Congressional August recess as if he didn’t just throw millions of us under the bus.

(Danielle Richards for New Jersey Monitor)Hoboken is rejecting a call by the Trump administration to rescind its sanctuary policy for undocumented immigrants, saying the White House’s position on this is “egregious” and “distressing.”
The move comes a week after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi told states, counties, and towns nationwide that their sanctuary policies “thwart federal immigration enforcement” and threatened officials who support them with criminal charges. The letter came amid a push by President Donald Trump to detain and deport millions of undocumented immigrants.
“As the nation witnesses the tearing apart of families, inhumane treatment of human beings, and unlawful detention of children, Hoboken will not bend its knee in response to the lawlessness of federal immigration authorities,” Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla wrote Tuesday in response to the Aug. 13 letter from Bondi.
The Department of Justice published a list two weeks ago of jurisdictions nationwide that have passed sanctuary laws and threatened to bring litigation against them. Hoboken, Jersey City, Newark, and Paterson are on the list (all four were already being sued in federal court by the Trump administration over these policies).
At least three of them received Bondi’s Aug. 13 letter, which ordered them to end their sanctuary policies and gave them until Tuesday to confirm in writing their “commitment to complying with federal law” and identify any initiatives they are undertaking to eliminate laws and policies that impede immigration enforcement.

“For too long, so-called sanctuary jurisdiction policies have undermined this necessary cooperation and obstructed federal immigration enforcement, giving aliens cover to perpetrate crimes in our communities and evade the immigration consequences that federal law requires,” Bondi wrote. 
The Trump administration has moved to slash federal funds and grants to jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate. On Monday, New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin joined a lawsuit filed by states alleging the administration is improperly blocking federal grants intended for victims and witnesses of crime because of the states’ sanctuary policies.
Since Trump took office in January for his second term and promised to crack down on illegal immigration, immigration arrests have doubled, and the number of people in detention has skyrocketed.
Bhalla, a Democrat who became Hoboken’s mayor in 2018, issued an executive order then that restricts when city officials and police can cooperate with federal immigration agents, an order known as the “fair and welcoming city” designation. Bhalla said the Trump administration’s claims about it are “completely false and without merit.”
“We will not capitulate to your demand that we rescind our policies, and in this case our morals and values,” wrote Bhalla, who is seeking a state Assembly seat in November.
The city will revise the policies if needed, he added, but only to ensure Hoboken residents are not subjected to unlawful immigration enforcement.  
Jersey City, Newark, and Paterson officials did not respond to requests for comment.
Other cities around the country had a similar message for Bondi as Bhalla. Washington Governor Bob Ferguson said his state “will not be bullied” and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said the city would “never back down.”
The debate over illegal immigration has roiled New Jersey. Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-10) is facing assault charges over accusations that she assaulted officers while they were arresting Newark Mayor Ras Baraka in May. Detainees rioted over poor conditions at Newark’s Delaney Hall, the first immigration detention center to open during Trump’s second term. Acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba has said she is investigating Gov. Phil Murphy and Platkin over the state’s sanctuary order, called the Immigrant Trust Directive. And the White House has placed the blame for a fatal drunken driving crash in Lakewood last month — authorities say an undocumented immigrant is responsible — on Murphy, who supports the state directive.

The problem? That label is based not on what’s happening in classrooms, but on what’s codified in state regulations.
In other words, Missouri scored low not because we lack quality but because our high standards are voluntary, locally driven, incentive-based, and not mandatory.
Missouri’s approach to early learning reflects our values: local control, strategic investment and a belief that collaboration works better than top-down mandates. And that approach is working.
Missouri is one of just a few states with pre-K funding embedded in its K–12 foundation formula. That means our funding is stable, predictable and less vulnerable to political swings or annual budget battles. We don’t rely solely on grants or pilot programs; we’ve made early learning part of the core school funding system.
We’ve also invested in the Missouri Quality Pre-Kindergarten Grant Program, which supports both school districts and private providers. This program incentivizes quality by providing additional funding tied to strong standards based on state statute. It has allowed rural districts and community partners to launch or expand pre-K programs, even in places where resources were once scarce.
Former Gov. Mike Parson created the Office of Childhood to consolidate programs for early learning, child care and family support under one roof. This action allows the state to move towards delivering better coordinated services. While implementation has had its challenges, the potential for reducing silos and improving outcomes remains strong.
We also use a kindergarten entry assessment to understand how prepared students are when they arrive at school, arguably the best real-world indicator of the effectiveness of early learning experiences. This kind of data tells us what’s working and needs improvement, rather than relying solely on policy checklists.
And with our innovative contracting law, Missouri is one of the only states that allows public schools and private providers to formally partner in delivering pre-K. That flexibility is critical in rural and under-resourced areas, where one-size-fits-all models often fall short.
WalletHub may base its rankings on real data, but it tells only part of the story. NIEER’s benchmarks reward what is required, not what is offered or achieved.
In Missouri, we’ve chosen to build a system that rewards participation and performance rather than compliance. Our programs meet high standards and are expanding every year, but because those standards are not mandatory statewide, we don’t get credit in the rankings.
Missouri’s ranking at the bottom of the WalletHub list reflects a methodology prioritizing mandates over actual program quality. Still, we don’t need mandates to deliver high-quality early learning across the state.

(Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Just over a week after state Sen. Rosemary Bayer (D-West Bloomfield) announced she would not seek reelection in 2026, an Oakland County deputy executive has stepped up in hopes of taking Bayer’s place.
Sean Carlson, a U.S. Army and Air Force veteran, former executive director of the Michigan Defense Center and longtime public servant, announced his bid for Michigan’s 13th Senate District, which will play a key role in determining the party control of the Senate in the next legislative session. 
“My priorities are clear: a strong middle class, better pay for public school teachers, comprehensive support for our veterans, safeguarding our water quality and helping small businesses grow. We are at a pivotal moment in Michigan, and this is the time for proven leaders,” Carlson said in a statement. 
Carlson has already secured a potential leg up in the competitive district, with Bayer offering her endorsement shortly after Carlson announced his bid. 
“I am proud to endorse Sean Carlson as the next state Senator to represent our community in Lansing,” Bayer said in a statement. “Throughout his decades of public service to our community, state, and country, Sean has shown time and again that he has the leadership, integrity, and commitment to fight for all of us. Now more than ever, Lansing needs proven leaders like Sean Carlson. I look forward to doing everything I can to support his candidacy.”
Michigan’s 13th District sits in Oakland County and encompasses West Bloomfield Township, Commerce Township, Lyon Township, Milford Township, Keego Harbor, Orchard Lake, South Lyon, Sylvan Lake, Walled Lake, Wixom, the village of Milford and portions of Waterford Township and Novi.

Tammy Baldwin toured La Follette High School in Madison on Tuesday. (Photo by Baylor Spears/ Wisconsin Examiner)Opposition to the Trump administration’s efforts to close the U.S. Department of Education is gaining momentum, Sen. Tammy Baldwin said Tuesday during a visit to La Follette High School in Madison.
Baldwin visited the school, part of the state’s second largest school district, as new educators met for an orientation ahead of the start of the school year on September 3. 
“[New educators are] coming or returning to teaching at a time where we have seen this administration doing devastating things to education and education funding,” Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, told reporters after a tour of the school. “It has proposed the abolition of the Education Department. He wants to dismantle it. He’s called for the end to it, but he also knows that there are some constraints because the Education Department was set up by Congress and it’s funded by Congress.” 
President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March ordering Education Sec. Linda McMahon to “take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return authority over education to the States and local communities while ensuring the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely.” McMahon has said she is “dead serious” about putting herself out of a job.
In June, schools across the country were thrown into uncertainty when the Trump administration withheld over $6 billion in federal funds meant to support English language learners, migrants, low-income children, adult learners, after-school programs and more. The frozen funds included $70 million for Wisconsin. The administration decided to reverse course and release the funds in late July after Republican and Democratic Senators both called on the administration to do so.

Madison Metropolitan School District Superintendent Joe Gothard said that, as of Tuesday, the district had expected $3.4 million and is “still waiting for direct language to ensure that we are going to be reimbursed for the cost that we plan to incur this school year.” 
Without that money, “students would not receive the services they deserve, and that could be by way of reading interventions, it could be some of the outreach we’re able to do with communities, with families,” Gothard said. “$3.4 million out of $6 billion may not seem like a lot, but those are targeted funds at students who need it most.” 
“I’m grateful that we’ve had support for the unfreezing of these funds,” Gothard said, adding that uncertainty of funding “undermines public education and who it’s for.” The lack of certainty is leading the district to rely more heavily on the local community and government for the support the district needs.
“I’ve got a range of students,” Thompson said, adding that the City Center allows for students to “come in and get what they need.”
Baldwin also got to see the school’s music room, library, gymnasium and technical education spaces, including an autoshop. 
“One of my most popular classes is our cooking classes, right, and kids get to learn basic life skills, and then, they actually do cooking for the school,” Thompson said. 
“And nutrition and all that stuff,” Baldwin added. 
“Yeah, you know, everything kids don’t want to hear,” Thompson joked. 
  “One of my most popular classes is our cooking classes, right, and kids get to learn basic life skills, and then, they actually do cooking for the school,” Principal Mathew Thompson told Baldwin before entering one of the classrooms. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)
The Trump administration’s efforts to close the Education Department comes even as some Republican lawmakers are balking at the idea. Politico  reported that Republican lawmakers looking to fulfill Trump’s agenda are considering breaking the process down into smaller bills given the opposition to shutting down the department, especially from those in school districts that have benefited from funding and those that rely on the agency for guidance. 
When it comes to challenging the ongoing federal uncertainty, Baldwin pointed to a recent bill that came out of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health, and Human Services, and Education and was recently approved by the full committee. 
“We have seen him propose to put some of the career and technical education programs in the Labor Department rather than keeping them in the Education Department,” Baldwin said. “He’s talked about putting the IDEA program” — which serves students with disabilities under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act — “into the Department of Health and Human Services, where it would not be suited, and he is defunding programs left and right, so we’re fighting back.” 
According to Baldwin’s office, the bill would provide $79 billion in discretionary funding for the Department of Education  and would put measures into place to limit the ability to downsize the department’s role. The bill includes a requirement to make formula grants available on time and maintain the staff necessary to ensure the department carries out its statutory responsibilities and carries out programs and activities funded in the bill in a timely manner. 
Baldwin said the bill is “wildly bipartisan,” noting it passed the committee on a 26-3 vote at the end of July. 
“We have more work to do. It has to go through the whole process and end up on the president’s desk before its law,” Baldwin said. “I feel like we have momentum in standing up against this president’s plans with education, so when we return to session the day after Labor Day, we’re going to continue to press to restore all funding, and fight back against this idea of abolishing the Department of Education.”

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)An interim legislative task force wrestled with the state’s hundreds of boards and commissions Tuesday, struggling to learn more about their finances and meeting schedules. Such groups can include powerful boards who can grant professional licenses, review an inmate’s parole application and approve utility price increases while others were designed to be one-off planning committees or exist in name only.
“I don’t think it’s a controversial statement to say we have too many,” said Adam Battalio, a senior policy advisor for Gov. Mike Braun. Battalio, whose Tuesday presentation was limited to just boards and commissions, counted at least 224 such bodies with a gubernatorial appointment.

Read the prepared report on all 267 selected boards, commissions and advisory councils here.

For years, leaders have sought to tamp down on the state’s various councils and task forces, most recently in a house bill that ultimately didn’t advance in the 2025 legislative session. Last year, a similar committee scrutinized various groups, which itself came from 2023 legislation. But determining which groups merit keeping — and which to phase out or combine with others — has been more difficult.
Such bodies have roughly doubled in the last 25 years, Battalio said, across Republican and Democrat administrations and legislatures.
“It’s not bad intentions that are behind this growth. In fact, it’s probably important for us to recognize good intentions, over time, grow government,” Battalio said. “… Those same good intentions can help address this problem (and) reshape government to be more responsive, more efficient.”
But some lawmakers were perturbed to learn that the state’s Legislative Services Agency has trouble tracking spending and other activities for some boards and commissions. 
“One of the first things that came out is they almost no visibility on some of these boards and commissions. Can’t track them; can’t see them,” said Sen. Chris Garten, R-Charlestown. “… Which is a problem.”
A “low-ball” estimate pinned those cumulative costs at $700,000, but that doesn’t include per diem or travel costs for legislators, coffee or lunch for members or program funding, Battalio said.
“… you will notice on those (legislative services agency) fiscal numbers … There are no aggregated totals. Part of that is because they’re concerned they can’t see everything, so they’re worried about the accuracies or inaccuracies,” Garten added. 
A better-informed total would be forthcoming, he said.
Measuring boards and commissions
Measuring meeting frequency and outcomes proved more difficult, as 56 boards didn’t have any online information at all. While that category would need further scrutiny, Battalio said, the average for other groups was 12 meetings per year in 2024.
Outliers with dozens — or even hundreds — of meetings included the parole board, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, the Alcohol and Tobacco Commission, and Nursing Board. However, Battalio cautioned against using the data without the full context. 
“Meeting frequently does not make you important; meeting infrequently does not make you unimportant,” Battalio said. 
Battalio also noted that as states reviewed their own groups, including Iowa and Arkansas, some were necessary to draw down federal funds.

The industry's proposals for Wyoming would more than double the state's electrical capabilities, challenging protections for the average ratepayer.
The post Utilities brace for staggering power demands from AI, data centers in Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","A tsunami of demand for artificial intelligence and data computation promises to plant stacks of servers in Wyoming. Those servers will require a volume of electricity that will eclipse the state’s power generation capacity and transform the physical and regulatory utility landscape in and outside the state, some familiar with Wyoming’s utility industry say.
For example, a joint venture — Crusoe and Tallgrass — recently announced plans for a computational campus south of Cheyenne requiring 1,800 megawatts of electricity, then “hyperscale” to 10,000 megawatts. That’s equal to Wyoming’s existing generation capacity, and it’s merely the latest in a series of data center proposals targeting the state.
Prometheus Hyperscale is partnering with others to add 1,200 megawatts of electricity for data centers in southwest Wyoming, while Microsoft and Meta are spending hundreds of millions of dollars on power-thirsty data centers around Cheyenne. Local utilities say they field new inquiries weekly.
Opinions vary about whether Wyoming is prepared to meet the demand and how it might impact “legacy” or regular utility customers in the state.

“How chaotic can this get?” Gillette Republican Rep. Christopher Knapp quipped during a recent Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions meeting. “Eventually it’s going to affect every region and, overall, the state’s typical legacy way of regulating.”
Staggering demand raises questions about regular ratepayers
Wyoming established rules years ago that empower utilities to demand special contracts with “large load” customers like data centers. The intent was to insulate their regular residential and business ratepayers from the risks that big-load customers might pose. 
For example, Cheyenne Light, Fuel and Power, and its parent company Black Hills Energy, trailblazed the concept with Microsoft back in 2015, leading to a successful series of data center additions that continues today, according to the utility’s Governmental Affairs Manager David Bush. Rather than build new power plants to feed Microsoft’s data centers, the utility acquires electricity on the open market, and its contract provides it can “interrupt” the power delivery when necessary — in the case of a major outage or grid-locking spike in power demand during, say, a severe cold snap.
The utility’s regular ratepayers didn’t have to help shoulder the cost for new power plants, and their service remains a priority when the chips are down.

Regulated utilities, as well as nonprofit co-ops and state regulators, mostly agree Wyoming’s large-load rule goes a long way to accommodate data centers while protecting the average ratepayer. But, the scale of the digital goldrush is staggering, some warn, and threatens to overrun all manner of business-as-usual.
Consider this: Wyoming’s electrical generation capacity stands at about 10,200 megawatts. All of the homes, businesses, mines, refineries and manufacturers in the state combined require only about 40% of that power, according to federal data. The rest is exported.

But that “excess” power generation doesn’t mean Wyoming’s megawatts can simply be redistributed to digital cowboys wanting to set up shop in the state. That’s not how utilities work, and besides, data center developers are making similar demands throughout the nation, scouring for whatever new source of electrical generation can be switched on the fastest — be it natural gas, wind, solar or nuclear. 
After more than a decade of relatively flat electrical demand in the U.S., AI queries, digital streaming, bitcoin mining and other computations — along with systems to cool hard-working servers — increased to account for 4.4% of all U.S. electrical consumption in 2023, according to the Department of Energy’s 2024 Report on U.S. Data Center Energy Use. The report estimates that by 2028, those computations will account for 12%.
The demand, whether it’s 50% or 100% — or more — of current electricity output in Wyoming and the surrounding region, is likely to stress regulatory safeguards and, depending on how the systems are designed, water resources and air quality.
State’s efforts
The Wyoming Energy Authority is leading a stakeholders’ working group to try to find consensus on a wise regulatory approach that takes advantage of the economic opportunities without putting regular electric ratepayers — and their providers — at risk. Most involved agree that the party that places any new cost on the system ought to pay that cost. However, nothing in the realm of utilities and regulation is quite that simple, Wyoming Public Service Commission Deputy Chairman Chris Petrie warned.
Some data developers propose bypassing existing utilities, or only relying on them for backup power, by building their own electric generating facilities, or striking a deal with a “third-party” non-public utility power generator that serves only a handful of data customers. But what happens if those plans go awry?
“One way or the other, it all has to be sorted out so that costs get allocated to the causer, and it’s a super complicated, involved affair when you’re actually doing it,” Petrie testified. “But the concept is that if you cause the cost you pay the cost.”
Wyoming Energy Authority Executive Director Rob Creager said stakeholders in the working group have not yet reached consensus on recommendations to lawmakers for how to potentially tweak Wyoming’s regulatory landscape to deal with the issue. The group plans to bring its recommendations to the Legislature’s Corporations Committee in November. 
Meantime, Creager said, Wyoming must grapple with how wide it wants to open its doors to the data industry — accounting for all its benefits and risks.
“What does the state want?” Creager posed to the panel. “What kind of growth and how do we want to supply that growth? Or do we want to supply that growth?”

If the caucus was a herd, it would be full of gomers, columnist Rod Miller says. Its members make a lot of noise, but can’t get the job done.
The post Gomers in the Wyoming “Freedom” Caucus appeared first on WyoFile .","“Gomer” is cowboy slang for a castrated bull, a steer. Gomers are turned out in a cow herd a week or so before breeding season. They have all the bullish instincts, but they can’t do anything about it. They chase cows around, bellow, throw slobber and snot, paw the dust, dry-mount the cows and bother them with their fake masculinity until the whole herd comes into heat and are ready for the bulls to do the real work.

Opinion

After turning gomers into the cow herd, cowboys often sit astraddle their horses and watch the frenzied ineptitude as the neutered beasts try to do something for which they are uniquely unqualified and unequipped. It’s always good for a laugh. Gomers can’t get the job done, but they raise the excitement level in the herd to unfulfilled heights. 
Just like the “Freedom” Caucus.
The most recent display of gomeristic behavior was presented to us by Rep. Chris Knapp, a card-carrying member of the “Freedom” Caucus from Gillette. Here’s what happened.
Tom Lubnau, former speaker of the Wyoming House, who has 40 years of experience on the subject, was invited to address the Legislature’s Joint Corporations Committee on Aug. 15, as the committee worked on amendments to the Wyoming Public Records Act. Tom was willing to share his thoughts, and try to make the committee’s work better.
Tom is also a fine columnist for Cowboy State Daily.

(Mike Vanata)
Knapp, a Republican co-chair of the committee, pitched a hissy fit over Lubnau’s appearance, whining that Tom had written unkind things about legislators in his column. Knapp worried that things would get “out of hand” and that some politician’s feelings would be hurt, and succeeded in having Lubnau booted from the agenda.
To use another barnyard term, this was a chickenshit move.
Knapp’s childish tantrum affirms that, among the freedoms that the “Freedom’” Caucus pretends to cherish, our First Amendment freedoms of speech and petitioning the government are strangely absent.
It also ignores Plank 22 of the Wyoming Republican Party platform, which states, “Freedom of speech is a fundamental right secured by the United States Constitution and the Constitution of the State of Wyoming. Freedom of speech includes the freedom of the individual to express his or her beliefs, ideas and opinions without fear of retaliation, censorship or legal sanction by government.”
Tell me, with a straight face, that Tom’s treatment was anything other than retaliation.
Knapp and his ilk would rather silence citizens than risk having their feathers ruffled by someone criticizing them. That is a succinct definition of political cowardice.

Rachel Rodriguez-Williams. (WyoFile/Ashton J. Hacke) 
And it’s par for the course, given the “Freedom” Caucus’ record of promising great things while delivering only punch lines for political jokes.
Hints of this political impotence have been evident for quite some time. A couple of years ago, Rep. John Bear (at the time the Exalted Grand Poobah of the “Freedom” Caucus and self-styled champion of grassroots Wyoming) wondered aloud during a legislative debate whether small Wyoming towns should even exist, instead of just drying up and blowing away. In retrospect, that hint was prescient.
Fast forward to today, past the litany of “Freedom” Caucus faux pas and stumbles, and we have Knapp’s boneheaded political face-plant.
At the time Knapp pawed the dust, slung snot bubbles and demanded Lubnau’s 86-ing from the Joint Corporations agenda, his co-chair on the Senate side and fellow Republican, Cale Case, warned (and I paraphrase) “OK, have it your way, buckaroo. But things won’t turn out like you expect. This will have traction.”
Knapp should have heeded Case’s advice, because he has experience and legislative wisdom light-years beyond Knapp’s.
Perhaps Knapp was relying on the “Freedom” Caucus’ oft-employed tactic when one of their own does something stupid. They circle the wagons around their embarrassed colleague, excuse the miscreant’s stupidity and call everyone else RINOs.
It’s really difficult to gin up any respect for politicians like Knapp and Bear when they can’t keep their feet out of their mouths. The closest corollary I can come up with is gomers.
And that presents the rest of Wyoming with the question of what to do about these gomers. The answer, from where I sit on my horse watching their goofiness, is to remove them from the herd. We put ‘em in there, and we can take ‘em out.
If Wyoming citizens are as sick and tired of their toxicity as I am, no “Freedom” Caucus incumbent should enjoy the comfort of an uncontested primary in the next election. Nor should they receive a single vote or dollar from any citizen of the Big Empty who truly loves their state.
It will take money, time and effort on our part to cull the gomers from our herd. But if we can get it done, we’ll have a productive ranch again.

This story was originally reported by Mariel Padilla, Grace Panetta and Mel Leonor Barclay of The 19th. Meet Mariel, Grace and Mel  and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
“In my ideal society, we would vote as households,” a pastor tells CNN. “And I would ordinarily be the one that would cast the vote, but I would cast the vote having discussed it with my household.”
Another agrees, saying he’d back an end to a woman’s right to vote: “I would support that, and I’d support it on the basis that the atomization that comes with our current system is not good for humans.”
The discussion of 19th Amendment rights was part of a news segment focused on Doug Wilson — a self-proclaimed Christian nationalist pastor based in Idaho — that was reposted to X by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The secretary is among Wilson’s supporters, and his involvement with Wilson’s denomination highlights how a fringe conservative evangelical Christian belief system that questions women’s right to vote is gaining more traction in the Republican Party.
Kristin Du Mez, a professor of history at Calvin University and author of “Jesus and John Wayne: How White Evangelicals Corrupted a Faith and Fractured a Nation,” said Wilson’s broader vision of Christian nationalism has gotten more attention over the past several years, alongside President Donald Trump’s rise to power.
“He was a fairly fringe figure, but this moment was really his moment,” she said. “And then as part of that, also, I think he signaled and gave permission to others that they didn’t need to hide some of their more controversial views, such as, should women have the vote? And that’s something that you didn’t hear proudly promoted from very many spaces, even just a handful of years ago.”
In the CNN interview, Wilson said he’d like to see the United States become a Christian and patriarchal country. He advocates for a society where sodomy is criminalized and women submit to their husbands and shouldn’t serve in combat roles in the military — a belief Hegseth has also publicly shared in the past though walked back during his confirmation hearings.
Hegseth appeared to support the nearly seven-minute interview with the caption, “All of Christ for All of Life.” Wilson has built an evangelical empire over the past 50 years that is centered in Moscow, Idaho, and now spans more than 150 congregations across four continents — including a new church in Washington, D.C. In July, Hegseth and his family attended the inaugural service at Christ Church, according to CNN.
“The Secretary is a proud member of a church affiliated with the Congregation of Reformed Evangelical Churches (CREC), which was founded by Pastor Doug Wilson,” Sean Parnell, the chief Pentagon spokesperson, said in a statement to The 19th. “The Secretary very much appreciates many of Mr. Wilson’s writings and teachings.”

Du Mez said Wilson built his brand as a vocal critic of mainstream evangelicalism.
“They were too wishy washy,” Du Mez said, referring to Wilson’s view of much of White evangelicalism in the 1990s and early 2000s. “They were too soft. And so he was kind of bringing a harsher biblical truth, and that included things like a much more rigid application of biblical patriarchy. ”
In 2024, only 1 in 10 Americans qualified as Christian nationalism adherents, according to the Public Religion Research Institute.
Ryan Dawkins, an assistant professor of political science at Carleton College, said Christian nationalism hasn’t necessarily gotten more popular in the past 20 years. But there have been   partisan trends.
“While they used to be more evenly divided between the two parties, over the last two decades, Christian nationalists have sorted into the Republican Party at incredibly high rates,” Dawkins said. “Christian nationalism is almost non-existent within the Democratic Party today, at least among White Democrats.”
While it’s still far from a mainstream opinion, several figures within the Republican Party have flirted with the idea of repealing the 19th Amendment.
Paul Ingrassia, who Trump nominated to lead the Office of Special Counsel, suggested approval for the idea in a 2023 podcast. Podcast host Alan Jacoby told Ingrassia that his own wife is the “biggest misogynist this side of the Mississippi, by the way. My wife literally thinks women should not vote.”
Ingrassia responded, “She’s very based,” a term expressing support for a bold opinion.
During the 2020 Republican National Convention, Republicans featured anti-abortion activist Abby Johnson, who has advocated for a new kind of voting system where households, not individuals, would cast votes. Head-of-household voting has historically disenfranchised women and people of color by concentrating power on the male leaders of the home.
In the leadup to the 2016 presidential election, FiveThirtyEight, a political forecasting site, shared data that suggested if women didn’t vote, Trump would win. The hashtag #repealthe19th — a reference to the 19th Amendment, which grants women the right to vote — quickly went viral.
And a former Trump-backed Michigan candidate for the U.S. House who has also held positions in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development was found to have made statements criticizing women’s suffrage while in college at Stanford University in the early 2000s. John Gibbs, now an assistant secretary at the agency, said that the country had been damaged by the 19th Amendment because women’s suffrage had led to an increase in the size and scope of the government. He added that women making up half of the population wasn’t enough reason for women’s suffrage. Gibbs’ 2022 congressional campaign denied he opposed women’s right to vote.
Kelly Marino, associate teaching professor at Sacred Heart University and author of “Votes for College Women: Alumni, Students and the Woman Suffrage Campaign” said that while conservative religious sects adamantly opposed to women’s suffrage have always existed, now there is renewed momentum.
“If you look at the way things played out in the past, we have this very liberal period followed by a conservative backlash,” Marino said. “And that’s what’s going on now. You have this period of liberalism where people were having a more expansive view of gender ideology, ideas about sexuality and women in politics. We had some pretty prominent female politicians that were making it pretty far in the last couple of years. And now there’s a backlash.”
Marino said the conservative backlash is reminiscent of the 1960s and 70s. There were significant progressive movements for civil rights, women’s rights, LGBTQ+ rights and environmental protections. But at the same time, the early 1970s saw the emergence of the men’s liberation movement, which focused primarily on issues like divorce law and child custody.
“There’s some men who are promoting a sort of return to tradition, a patriarchal vision for society,” Marino said. “It’s always sort of there, but it’s gaining traction within mainstream consciousness again. And now, you have all this stuff about soft girls and tradwives — this gender ideal of women being the domestic homemaker within a traditional family structure. There’s been a big push for this radical Christianity and some of its values — it’s become really popular even among younger people.”
Joseph Slaughter, an assistant professor of history at Wesleyan University, said Wilson is having his moment in the spotlight — but it’s important to remember that he does not speak for the majority.
“He delights in upsetting people or saying transgressive, un-PC things,” Slaughter said. “Ten years ago, when he posted a video talking about man’s biblical duties — people just sort of yawned and dismissed him. Now, he’s saying things and they’re gaining more currency because of some of this other new right-wing masculinity and the online manosphere.”
Slaughter said it’s particularly concerning that Wilson’s teachings have found their support in a man as powerful as Hegseth.
“What does it mean for somebody who’s running an organization which has had its struggles over the years integrating women and trying to understand existential questions about women’s role in combat?” Slaughter said. “Are Hegseth’s views reinforced by his religion now? Does this church reinforce his cultural chauvinism? For somebody in his position, it’s certainly fair game to ask.”

A recent National Association of Realtors report found affordability increased slightly from last year, but the typical family is still priced out in the West and Northeast. (Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer)Housing became more affordable this June, as higher incomes and slightly lower interest rates overcame higher prices, according to a National Association of Realtors report.
However, the South and the Midwest are the only regions where a family with typical or median income can afford a median-priced house, according to the report. The group considers a mortgage to be affordable if the monthly payment (principal and interest) is 25% or less of the family’s income.



The affordability gap is highest in the West, where the typical family income is $113,783, just over two-thirds of the $164,832 that would be needed to purchase a median-priced home.
The Northeast, where the typical family makes $114,559, is also unaffordable by this measure, as a median-priced home requires an income of $141,264.
In the Midwest, the median family income is $102,419, more than the $86,256 needed to buy a median-priced home. The same is true in the South, where the median income is $97,812, slightly more than the $96,720 required to buy a typical home.
Nationally, affordability increased slightly compared with June of 2024, with the typical family making $105,431, about 94% of the $111,648 it would need to buy the median-priced home. That’s up from about 92% in June 2024.
In a video posted Aug. 15, Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, said he expects lower interest rates to increase affordability in the months ahead.
“We know that mortgage rates will be coming down and that will bring additional buyers into the market. We just need to make sure we have more supply, more supply to meet that demand,” Yun said.

Supplemental Security Income, the nation’s monthly cash assistance program for low-income and elderly people with disabilities, currently takes into account the financial role an individual’s parent, spouse or other household member plays in determining whether someone qualifies for the benefit and how much they receive. 
Benefits can be reduced by up to one-third, or about $300, if an individual with disabilities gets “in-kind” help from household members, such as living rent-free with a parent or spouse.
Until now, however, the federal government has made an exception for households that receive public assistance, under the assumption that families poor enough to receive food or other public assistance are not able to also help support a disabled family member. 
The administration’s proposed new rule, submitted July 18, would no longer consider Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP, commonly referred to as food stamps, as a form of public assistance that meets the exception. 
The change would mean that the Social Security Administration would begin to count “in-kind” contributions, such as living rent-free, against  people with disabilities living with family who also receive SNAP and reduce or end disability payments.
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, relying on SNAP and Social Security data, estimates that the rule, if adopted, would end disability benefits entirely for 100,000 people nationwide and slash payments to another 275,000. In Tennessee, 7,500 people with disabilities could lose or see reductions in benefits.

(Photo by Getty Images)A group of West Virginia environmental organizations is asking state officials to speak against the Trump administration’s move to end a Biden-era solar program that last year committed more than $100 million for projects in West Virginia.  
The Environmental Protection Agency terminated the $7 billion Solar for All program earlier this month. The program was intended to help pay for residential solar projects for more than 900,000 lower income U.S. households. 
Twelve organizations — including American Friends Service Committee of West Virginia, Appalachian Voices, Christians for the Mountains, and Citizens’ Climate Lobby of West Virginia — sent a letter Tuesday asking Gov. Patrick Morrisey and Attorney General J.B. McCuskey to speak against the program’s cancellation. 
“We urge you to use every tool at your disposal to push back against this unwarranted action that will harm families and small businesses across West Virginia,” the organizations wrote.
The EPA granted the West Virginia Office of Energy $106 million in Solar for All funding last year. It also awarded money to 59 other entities. 
According to the Office of Energy’s website, the grant was to be used to “deploy residential solar roofs, support home energy efficiency, reduce utility costs for low-income residents, and make West Virginia households more energy resilient.”
The program was scheduled to launch and start construction in 2026, according to a timeline listed on the website. 
In a post on the social media platform X on Aug. 7, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said the Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law last month, eliminated the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which included Solar For All.
“In some cases, your tax dollars were diluted through up to FOUR pass-through entities, each taking their own cut off the top!” Zeldin wrote. “The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.
“Today, the Trump EPA is announcing that we are ending Solar for All for good, saving US taxpayers ANOTHER $7 BILLION!,” he wrote. 
Zeldin said in a video that while the program was stood up in 2024, very little of the program’s money has been spent. Recipients are in the “building and planning phase,” and not the construction process, he said. 
A spokesperson for the West Virginia Division of Economic Development, which oversees the Office of Energy, did not immediately respond to an email Monday asking how the local program would be affected by the cancellation and whether or not the state’s grant money had been spent. 
In a news release, Quenton King, government affairs specialist for Appalachian Voices, noted that West Virginia officials applied for the funding in 2023, knowing “the value that solar energy brings” to the state. 
“The Office of Energy was actively working out how to set the program up for success and lower electricity prices for West Virginia households, and it would be a waste to throw away that work now,” he wrote. “I hope that Gov. Morrisey and A.G. McCuskey work with the administration and our congressional delegation to restore the appropriated and obligated funding for this program.”
Representatives for Morrisey and McCuskey did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Tuesday.

Part One described the emergency effort to rescue Washington state’s last population of Snake River spring and summer Chinook salmon, in the Tucannon River.
The Nez Perce Tribe and its collaborators will try to eke out a few more years’ survival for Tucannon River Chinook.  
“But,” Jay Hesse says, “we also had to ask: What about all the other populations? So in 2021, we started modeling quasi-extinction for all the Snake River spring/summer Chinook and steelhead populations listed under the Endangered Species Act. The results are giving us a better picture of real conditions, and a stronger case for the urgency of action.”

Mr. Hesse is the director of Biological Services for the Nez Perce Department of Fisheries Resources Management.
Some years ago, federal scientists at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries developed the “quasi-extinction threshold,” which the NOAA uses in planning.
For Snake River Chinook salmon and steelhead, the threshold is fewer than 50 adult fish in a population returning from the ocean for four consecutive years. Below that floor, the population’s continued existence can no longer be scientifically assumed or predicted. It is an emergency signal, flashing red and near black.
The Nez Perce Tribe is applying this science to management of populations below or near the extinction threshold, as well as to public education and long-term science.   
Nez Perce Fisheries provided me two maps from its upcoming extinction threshold report for Snake River spring/summer Chinook, and steelhead, updated through 2024 fish returns. These maps show some of the findings, but much else in it will deserve attention. 
  Hesse, J.A. and Kinzer, R.N., 2025. Snake River Anadromous Fish Status: Quasi-Extinction Threshold Analysis. Department of Fisheries Resources Management. Version: 09 June, 2025.
The quasi-extinction threshold results are mapped in four colors:  populations at or below the 50-fish extinction threshold four consecutive years; those at or below the 50-fish threshold in the most recent year; those predicted, on current trend, to be at the 50-fish line within five years; and those predicted to be above that threshold five years from now. 
  Hesse, J.A. and Kinzer, R.N., 2025. Snake River Anadromous Fish Status: Quasi-Extinction Threshold Analysis. Department of Fisheries Resources Management. Version: 09 June, 2025.
Together, the first three categories, all in red-orange shades, are what I call the critical list: populations at dire, perhaps irreversible risk now, and those on their way to that same status within five years at current rates of decline.  
Lump those red-orange shades together as you look at the maps. With a little imagination, you will see the near-term extinction trajectory for Snake River salmon and steelhead in geographic motion.                        
As updated through 2024 fish returns, the report shows six Snake River steelhead populations, 27% of the species’ total number, are on the critical list, below the extinction threshold or heading there soon. Ten Snake River spring/summer Chinook salmon populations, 29% of  that species’ total, are on the critical list. The maps show their locations.   
Salmon extinction in motion in Washington’s and Oregon’s Snake River

Populations colored yellowish are all those predicted to be above the 50 fish threshold in 2029. These are in motion too. Current rates of decline, if continued, will put a next batch on the critical list soon. The data underlying the maps suggests which and where those will be.  
It is not scientific news that Snake River salmon and steelhead are going extinct. These findings further confirm the fact, by newly estimating the current rate and trend of decline at population level.  
What’s new, for me, is how extinction threshold analysis, as mapped and made public yearly, allows fish managers, all stripes of salmon people, interested reporters, and Northwest governors and members of Congress to observe Snake River salmon extinction in motion.    
The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife also conducts an extinction threshold analysis for these same Snake River populations, with some differences in methodology and data.  
“ODFW’s quasi-extinction approach is a little more conservative than the Nez Perce Tribe’s,” says Tucker Jones, the agency’s Columbia River program manager. “Our two results so far are slightly different, but both analyses have arrived at largely the same conclusions and same trend.  When you take different approaches, but come to nearly the same conclusions, that provides more certainty we’re on the right track.” 
The department also plans to update its analysis this year.  
The extinction threshold findings can be annually volatile, as one somewhat better bad return re-sets its stringent clock. Thus the main story is the trends, for individual populations and the aggregate species. 
The 2024 Nez Perce Fisheries’ analysis estimates a 6% per-year decline is occurring across the Snake’s spring-summer Chinook populations, and 11% per-year decline across steelhead populations. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife’s trend estimates will be known soon.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
 Snake River salmon and steelhead extinction is in motion

Two distinctions between this scientific work, and my use of it here, should be made.  
First, extinction in motion is my phrase, not Hesse’s or his Nez Perce Fisheries’ co-author Ryan Kinzer’s.
They are conducting a careful, annually-updated estimate, employing both raw fish counts and modeling, of the rates at which extirpation of individual populations are currently proceeding (or not, should the data show that), and thus extinction of the species continues to approach (or not).  
The focus on rates of decline toward extirpation and extinction is a main value this science has now, as salmon scarcity and Tucannon River-like dilemmas multiply. The same science will track the pace and places of salmon recovery, should the actions necessary to produce recovery be taken.   
My phrase combines two facts.

Snake River salmon and steelhead extinction is in motion because current numbers are very low, current distribution badly amputated, and decline is the steady year after year, decade after decade, trend, with a few blips up that were not sustained. And, the Nez Perce Tribe’s quasi-extinction threshold maps allow us to watch this motion, place by place, across years.
Second, except when quoting, I say extinction threshold, without the word quasi. This will not change the Nez Perce Tribe’s, Oregon’s or the NOAA Fisheries’ use of the full phrase in scientific, management and legal contexts where it is a defined, necessary term.  
But for most of us that word just gets in the way. Good scientists have developed a last gasp check-point – 50 or fewer fish returning, four years in a row – to mark the entry, by a steelhead or salmon population, into an extinction momentum that will be very difficult to escape. 
It is an extinction threshold. For the salmon, rivers, watersheds, communities and salmon people facing it, there is nothing quasi about it.
 Salmon risks multiply when numbers plunge so low 

Please look again at the maps.  
Most of these geographies hold from 50 to 150 miles of identified habitat for one or both fish. Thus, at the official 50 fish extinction threshold, one female or male Chinook, out of 25, must find a partner, also out of 25, in 50 to 150 miles of water. 
“That is just a terribly low number of salmon in so much river,” Jay Hesse says.  
A landslide or flood scour could destroy a few salmon redds (nests) and their overwintering eggs, when a few are all that exist. Some eagles, bears and humans will find some returning fish before the fish find each other to spawn.

Such local events, of little harm to healthy populations, are major risks to those so near extinction. More destructive are recurring large-scale events – poor ocean conditions, low flows through reservoirs and dams, extended hot water during their long, obstructed upstream migration – that do outsized damage to populations already scraped so low. 
The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, and NOAA Fisheries, both make the main scientific point. 
The department: The 50 fish or less threshold “is not a milestone on a linear path to extinction.” It is “a tipping point into accelerated extinction risk,” with a “higher likelihood populations will no longer be able to respond favorably to improved conditions.”  
The NOAA: “Quasi-Extinction Thresholds represent tipping points for population collapse, where the actual extinction potential may not be predictable or, in some cases, avoidable … The result can be an extinction vortex …”
An extinction vortex operates something like your sink’s drain operates on the last remaining water. It’s too late.
 Returning salmon drive the ecology

Hesse always reminds his audiences of the contexts for this extinction analysis. 
“Keep in mind that salmon ecology is based on abundance,” he says. “Numbers of returning salmon are not just about salmon. Salmon drive the whole ecology of that population’s geographic area. Fifty or fewer fish signals a total break in that watershed’s ecology, with effects that go well beyond the fish.”  
Some breakage is visible to us; many fewer bears, eagles and people hunt the rivers and creeks in season. Much is still invisible to most of us, though nutrient loss is being documented. Salmon nutrition for the waters, lands and life of the territories on the maps above has been close to nothing for 60 years.
“And the harvest cycle, the cultural cycle, which is based on abundance, is also broken,” Hesse says. “That is important to all salmon people, but particularly to tribes that cultural connection is absolutely necessary.”
Hesse and Kinzer use another map to add more context: past extirpations.
  Hesse, J.A. and Kinzer, R.N., 2025. Snake River Anadromous Fish Status: Quasi-Extinction Threshold Analysis. Department of Fisheries Resources Management. Version: 09 June, 2025.
The colored area is the maps just described. The gray area, north and especially south, is the vast geography, in Oregon, Idaho and Nevada, from which Chinook salmon have already been extirpated, mainly by dams.  
Of an estimated 70 abundant populations of Snake River spring/summer Chinook prior to invasion and settlement, 30 are now extirpated. Of 40 steelhead populations pre-settlement, 16 are now extirpated.   
The scales of what once was, and what now remains, are so disparate it is hard to put both on one graph or graphic. 
In his presentations to public and agency audiences, Hesse experiments with visual ways to relate that not-so-long-ago abundance with today’s plunge to extinction. (Two to six million salmon and steelhead annually is one pre-Caucasian estimate for the Snake River alone.) His most effective way so far is a 16-ounce Starbucks’ Grande cup – the past salmon abundance when filled, today a couple disconnected damp spots on the  bottom of the cup.  
“We cannot lose sight that salmon abundance is our goal,” Hesse says.   
 Salmon, steelhead and people in northeast Oregon

Eastern Oregon’s tributary watersheds to the Snake River are too varied and distinctive for this stranger to ably summarize, ecologically or humanly.  The mountain, valley and canyon topography does intricate wonders with cold mountain waters that birth the Grande Ronde River, and then steadily refresh it on its long course to the Snake River. (The Grande Ronde has crossed into Washington when it reaches the Snake; 92% of the watershed is in Oregon.)

Human works add to and subtract from each river. When my interviewees said the names – Wallowa, Lostine, Minam, Wenaha, Grande Ronde, Imnaha, Joseph Creek – I heard something of the depth the names carry for people who know these streams.  
Some echoed Kevin March, a retired acupuncturist in La Grande: “One thing here is that many of these rivers and stretches are hard to get to. In canyon country, you can always leave people behind.” 
Or John Milbert, a veteran fisherman, gatherer of foods, and writer: “I like to get high in the little tributaries. I enjoy fishing these tributaries because I get to know them intimately from walking and wading them. You get surprises.”  
The extinction threshold data led me first to the upper Grande Ronde River, and its large tributary Catherine Creek. (The upper Grande Ronde is roughly the river’s watershed above the town of Elgin.)  
In both, significant damage to river function has occurred in headwater areas, from past logging, roading and grazing, and, in both, the salmon nurseries in and passages through the big valleys are now mostly disconnected and ditched.               
In the early 1990s, scientists identified eight populations of Snake River spring and summer Chinook in northeast Oregon. Two are deemed extirpated since then: the Lookingglass and Big Sheep populations, in the lower Grande Ronde and Imnaha respectively. Washington’s Asotin population, upstream of the Tucannon, is also extirpated.  
“Though extirpated for now, the Tribe does not want any of these taken off the Endangered Species list,” Hesse says. “We don’t want them forgotten, and over time we want them back.”
The Upper Grande Ronde and Catherine Creek host two of northeast Oregon’s six remaining Chinook populations.  
Retired lawyer David Baum remembers fishing for salmon long ago, far up the Grande Ronde, at Tony Vey Meadows. And as a boy in the 1950s, he made a spearing platform on a bridge across Catherine Creek at his grandmother’s home. 
“A salmon would come up every few minutes in season,” he said. “I had no success, but I saw a lot of salmon going up Catherine Creek.”   
No longer. I will offer some numbers, which need not be retained. Their scale and trend is what matters.
Upper Grande Ronde Chinook, returning to 144 miles of identified Chinook habitat, had an estimated return, 2016 through 2022, of 43, 19, 39, 7, 57, 24, 98 and 19 fish. (The Nez Perce update should include the 2024 estimate.) At 20 returning fish, a Chinook must find at least one of 10 possible mates in 144 miles of stream habitat to secure a next generation. 
The Nez Perce Fisheries’ map projects that, at current rates of decline, this Chinook population will be at or below the extinction threshold, joining the critical list, by 2029.
In Catherine Creek’s 89 miles of Chinook habitat, the estimated range of adult returns, 2016-2023, is 31 to 190 fish. For now, the Catherine Creek population remains among those not projected at or below 50 fish within five years, but it is uncomfortably close.              
The Upper Grande Ronde and Catherine Creek share one steelhead population, with 808 miles of identified habitat. Its return was last above 1,000 in 2016. The 2017-2023 range is 247 to 874. Northeast Oregon wild steelhead are generally in better shape than its Chinook, but are also in decline. Four digit returns become three digit become … is the trendline.

None of the local fishers I spoke with were surprised.  
“If not extinct in Upper Grande Ronde, Chinook must be perilously close,” says John Milbert. “The last carcass I saw was probably 15 years ago.”  
Kevin March is a steelhead fisherman: “I don’t fish the upper Grande Ronde, because those are wild fish and the stocks are too low. And I don’t fish for salmon anywhere in eastern Oregon. There are too few.”  
John Appleton and his wife Anieta own Alpine Archery and Sport, La Grande’s fishing shop. 
“Wild salmon are very low in the upper Grande Ronde; steelhead are better but not good,” Appleton told me.  
As for fishing, “in all of northeast Oregon, Chinook fishing any more is really minimal,” he continued. “There is some hatchery-based coho fishing in the fall.”  
Fall steelhead fishing, on hatchery stocks, attracts people, though that fishery too can be uncertain.  
Kyle Bratcher is district fish biologist for Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. His district includes the lower Grande Ronde from the Wallowa River down, and the Imnaha River. 
“In my territory, the salmon in most trouble are Wallowa/Lostine spring Chinook, and Imnaha spring Chinook,” Bratcher said. “They’re not as bad as in the Tucannon, but it’s clear we need to do more for them.”  
This Wallowa population was last estimated above 1,000 in 2014, its 2015-20 range is 189 to 750 (the Nez Perce and Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife reports should include more recent data), and it has 137 miles of habitat. 
Bratcher and Hesse confirmed the department and Nez Perce Tribe have begun discussion of interim “safety net” actions for Wallowa/Lostine Chinook. Decisions will not be simple.

“Steelhead are depressed in my territory, far below recovery goals, but they are a bit more stable than salmon,” Bratcher added. “Steelhead can use more of our wilderness and inaccessible habitat.” 
The fishing people I spoke with generally have more hope for steelhead in the Grande Ronde and Imnaha than for salmon.  
“Steelhead range more, they can go up the small streams and creeks, to many more places,” Kevin March said. “I know a farmer who sees them in his little creek.”  
Biologist Rick George, now retired from the Confederated Umatilla Tribes, lives in Troy, Oregon, on the lower Grande Ronde. “The Umatilla Tribes are doing some excellent habitat restoration in the Upper Grande Ronde – the McCoy Creek project, for example,” he said. “But I can’t see much hope for salmon in the Grande Ronde with eight dams on the lower Snake and Columbia. We’ve put billions into increasing salmon over several generations of salmon now. I don’t see even a blip of recovery. The systems are pretty empty of salmon, and, without that ocean nutrient freight train, the rivers are more sterile. We have large rivers that look beautiful, but without salmon that is deceiving.”  
“I’ve been on the Imnaha for 30 years,” Joe McCormack told me.  “Watching the natural processes, what I see over those 30 years is less and less naturally spawning salmon and steelhead.”

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado state lawmakers will convene for a special session Thursday to offset a $1.2 billion revenue shortfall caused by changes in the federal tax code, but they will also consider tweaks to the state’s artificial intelligence law, which is supposed to go into effect in February.
Gov. Jared Polis included the AI issue in his call for the special session earlier this month.
“We want to make sure that this is settled sooner rather than later, and give this Legislature a chance to figure that out. What adjustments need to be made or changes need to be made are up to them,” he said.

Colorado passed a first-in-the-nation sweeping AI regulation in 2024 to set anti-discrimination guardrails for businesses that use the technology in decisions on consequential matters such as loans, employment, insurance policies and school admissions. When Polis signed the law, however, he was clear in his desire for lawmakers to fine tune the policy to ensure it does not hinder technological innovation and development.
An issue task force was supposed to create legislative recommendations for reform that lawmakers could consider during this year’s regular session, but bill backers did not reach a compromise in time.
Now, the Legislature has an opportunity to tweak the AI law with at least four bills on the issue.
Focus on developers
A bill from the Democratic lawmakers who ran the 2024 bill would narrow the law. It would focus on required disclosures for developers of AI systems — the companies that actually create the technology, versus the deployers who use it. Those developers would need to inform deployers about potential misuses of the technology and steps they’ve taken to mitigate those risks.
Deployers would need to let someone know they are using AI to make a decision about them if it is related to educational enrollment, employment, financial loans, health care, housing, insurance, legal services or a government service. In practice, that could look like a bank notifying a loan applicant of the use of AI in its decision making; when in the process it plans to use AI; and the developer, contact information and system name of the AI.
The bill, Senate Bill 25B-17, would assign developers and deployers joint liability if an AI system violates state law, unless the developer can prove that a deployer misused the technology.
“We’re going to address some of the issues that were brought up during the process of the task force — why are we putting the burden on the deployers, and should it be more on the developers? They are the ones that really have the ultimate responsibility for what their AI does,” said Rep. Brianna Titone, an Arvada Democrat.
Titone is sponsoring the bill alongside Senate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez and House Assistant Majority Leader Jennifer Bacon, both Denver Democrats.
“We want to make sure that the foundation is good and solid, and we think that the proposal we’re putting out there is going to accomplish that and address the concerns that a lot of people have,” Titone said.
Consumer protection
A bipartisan group of lawmakers will run a bill to clarify that existing state statute around civil rights laws and consumer protections would also apply to AI. That bill, House Bill 25B-13, would empower the attorney general to sue a developer or deployer that uses AI in a way that violates the Colorado Consumer Protection Act. It would also allow an individual to file a complaint against an AI developer if the system violates the state’s anti-discrimination law.
Additionally, that bill would require developers and deployers to disclose to consumers when they are interacting with AI versus a human.
The bill will be sponsored by Rep. William Lindstedt, a Broomfield Democrat, Rep. Michael Carter, an Aurora Democrat, Sen. Judy Amabile, a Boulder Democrat, and Sen. Lisa Frizell, a Castle Rock Republican.
Redefine ‘consequential decision’
Another bill from Rep. Ron Weinberg, a Loveland Republican, would narrow the definition of “consequential decision” in the state’s AI law to include only decisions related to employment or public safety. That would get rid of decisions about school enrollment, finances, government services, housing, insurance, health care services and legal services.
That bill, House Bill 25B-4, would also push the effective date of the law to August 2027, exempt businesses with fewer than 250 employees or less than $5 million in annual revenue, and exempt local governments in towns with fewer than 100,000 residents. It doesn’t have a Senate sponsor.
Repeal
Finally, a bill from Republican Sen. Mark Baisley of Woodland Park would completely repeal the 2024 AI law and update the state’s anti-discrimination laws to prohibit discrimination using any technology. There was no House sponsor for the measure, Senate Bill 25B-12, when it was pre-released on the Legislature’s website.
The special session will likely run into early next week.

This story first appeared at The 74, a nonprofit news site covering education.
Across the country, teachers unions have been challenging the constitutionality of their states’ private school voucher programs in court. And in at least two cases, they’ve won.
Since 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court allowed Maine private schools to receive public funds, at least five lawsuits have been filed by teachers unions, in Wyoming, Utah, Montana, Missouri and South Carolina. Additional legal challenges have been mounted by advocacy groups and parent organizations.
The Supreme Court’s Carson v. Makin ruling, combined with growing interest among parents in alternatives to traditional public schools post-COVID, has fueled the rise of voucher programs and led to a tug-of-war in state courts between public educators and school choice advocates.
Heading into the 2025 legislative session, at least 33 states had some form of private school choice, according to the Georgetown University think tank FutureEd. Most union lawsuits have focused on voucher programs, in which public dollars pay for children to attend private schools —  including religious schools — and cover other education-related expenses such as homeschooling.
In Wyoming and Utah, judges ruled in favor of the unions — at least for now. In South Carolina, the program was retooled after a court declared its previous version unconstitutional.
The Wyoming Education Association, which represents roughly 6,000 public school teachers, landed a win in July after District Court Judge Peter Froelicher granted a preliminary injunction against the state’s universal voucher program. The union and nine parents had sued the state in June on grounds that the Steamboat Legacy Scholarship Act is unconstitutional because it violates a state regulation that it must provide a “uniform system of public instruction.”

Ohio judge rules state’s $700 million voucher program is unconstitutional 




The union decided to sue after lawmakers made the voucher program universal this spring. It was originally created with a family income cap of 250% of the federal poverty level.

“No income guidelines, in essence, means that you could be someone in Jackson who owns an $18 million property, and the state’s giving you money,” said union President Kim Ame. “Our constitution clearly says that we cannot give public money to private entities, so that’s why we challenged that.”
The injunction temporarily stops the distribution of $7,000 scholarships — which are funded from a state appropriation of $30 million — until the court determines the program’s constitutionality. The state has since filed an appeal to the Wyoming Supreme Court.
“I am disheartened at the court’s written order granting the WEA’s injunction. As one of nearly 4,000 Wyoming families, you have had your lives unnecessarily upended through no fault of your own,” Megan Degenfelder, state superintendent of public instruction, wrote in a July statement to parents.
The case is similar to the one in Utah, where a judge ruled a $100 million voucher program unconstitutional in April, following a lawsuit by the state teachers union.

Utah school voucher program ruled unconstitutional in teachers union lawsuit

 




The Utah Education Association sued the state last year, arguing the Utah Fits All Scholarship Program violates the state constitution by diverting tax money to private schools that aren’t free, open to all students and supervised by the state board of education. The Utah Supreme Court is set to consider an appeal later this year.
Lawsuits in other states are still working their way through the courts.
In July, the Montana Federation of Public Employees, which represents the state’s public school teachers, joined a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the statewide voucher program that funds private education expenses for special education students.
“Even voucher programs like [this one] that are targeted to students with disabilities deprive them of crucial legal protections and educational resources,” the plaintiffs said in a legal brief.
In Missouri, the state teachers union is suing over the MOScholars program, which started as a tax credit scholarship in 2021. It currently relies on nonprofits to collect donations that are turned into scholarships. Donors can receive a tax credit amounting to 100% of their contribution, but it can’t exceed more than half of their state tax liability.
This year, Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe dedicated $50 million in taxpayer dollars for the scholarships and $1 million for program marketing, according to the suit. The Missouri National Education Association, which has 28,000 members, sued in June in an effort to block the appropriation.
“The General Assembly has far overstepped its authority and violated five provisions of the Missouri Constitution by using an appropriations bill to construct out of whole cloth a scheme to divert general revenues to what are essentially vouchers for the payment of private school tuition for elementary and secondary school students,” wrote Loretta Haggard, the union’s attorney, in the suit.
On July 30, EdChoice Legal Advocates — part of a national nonprofit that advocates for school choice — filed a motion to join the suit as defendants. Thomas Fisher, litigation director, said in a press release that the program helps Missouri families afford an education that fits their children’s needs.
“The recent expansion of the program is constitutional and will expand education freedom for low-income families and students with learning differences,” he said.
In South Carolina, the state Supreme Court ruled in 2024 that its Education Trust Fund Scholarship Program was unconstitutional following a lawsuit from the state teachers union, parents and the NAACP. The program resumed this year after lawmakers revised it to funnel money from the lottery system instead of the general fund.
Unions have also been involved in school choice lawsuits in Alaska and Wisconsin. In 2023, National Education Association Alaska funded a suit over a state system that sent cash payments to the parents of homeschool students. That same year, Wisconsin’s largest teachers union asked the state Supreme Court to hear its case challenging the constitutionality of the statewide voucher program, but the request was denied.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/teachers_union_lawsuit-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-08-20 06:57:49.355378

States and clinicians are working on getting correct information on vaccines to vulnerable groups amid shifting federal guidance. (Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Heading into the respiratory illness season, states and clinicians are working to encourage pregnant patients to get COVID-19 vaccinations, even though the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services no longer recommends that they should.
Along with being older and having an underlying health condition, pregnancy itself is a risk factor. Pregnant women are more vulnerable to developing severe illness from COVID-19. They’re also at high risk for complications, including preterm labor and stillbirth. The vast majority of medical experts say getting the shot is safe and effective — much safer than having the illness.
But HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in May that the agency would no longer recommend that pregnant women get the vaccine. Before testifying before Congress in June, Kennedy circulated a document on Capitol Hill claiming higher rates of fetal loss after vaccination. But the authors of those studies told Politico that their work had been misinterpreted.
Experts say the federal shift puts the onus on state health agencies to ramp up vaccine guidance and outreach. Clinicians and public health organizations are trying to dispel misinformation and make sure information reaches low-income people and people of color, who had higher maternal death rates during the pandemic. During the first two years of the pandemic, the virus contributed to a quarter of maternal deaths, according to federal data.
“We are severely disappointed,” said Dr. Neil Silverman, a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine. He has studied vaccines and pregnancy for the past 15 years and specializes in high-risk pregnancies.
Silverman called the federal shift a “public health tragedy on a grand scale.”
Vaccinations against COVID-19 help prevent severe illness in pregnant people as well as their newborns, who are too young to get vaccinated, Silverman said. In what’s called passive immunity, vaccinated mothers pass on antibodies to their babies through the placenta and through breast milk.
“State public health agencies are probably going to have to implement vaccine guidance that differs from the federal recommendations. And that’s going to be an interesting can of worms,” said OB-GYN Dr. Mark Turrentine, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.
Turrentine serves on a board of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that focuses on immunization and infectious diseases. He said his recent pregnant patients who had COVID-19 hadn’t gotten the vaccine.
“The change in guidance on the federal level just really makes a lot of confusion, and it makes it very challenging to try to explain to individuals why all of a sudden the difference,” Turrentine said.
A slew of public health organizations have been making a concerted effort to dispel vaccine myths. They include the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization of maternal-fetal experts. At a news briefing the society held this month, clinicians stressed the safety and long-standing science behind COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the shots for RSV and the flu. Cases of RSV and the flu tend to peak in the winter months, while in recent years COVID-19 cases have spiked in the summer and the winter.
Dr. Brenna Hughes, an OB-GYN who chairs the organization’s infectious diseases and emerging threats committee, pointed to survey data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that less than a third of eligible pregnant patients received COVID-19 shots, and only 38% received RSV shots for the 2023 to 2024 season. Less than half — 47% — received flu shots, and 59% received TDAP (whooping cough) vaccines.
CDC data shows that for last year’s and this year’s season, only between 12% and 14% of pregnant patients got the COVID-19 vaccine.
“The complications from the infection are so much greater than the complications and the very few and typically minor adverse events that might occur from the vaccine,” said microbiologist Sabra Klein, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
In June, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and 30 other professional health organizations signed a letter urging insurers to continue covering the COVID-19 shot for pregnant women, and have continued to urge coverage since then.
CVS Caremark, one of the nation’s three major pharmacy benefit managers, told Stateline it will continue covering the vaccine for pregnant women. The Arizona, California and North Carolina state Medicaid agencies also told Stateline they are still currently covering COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women.
Dr. Kimberly Fortner, president-elect of the Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, said during the maternal-fetal medicine briefing that she hopes medical groups’ joint messaging will bolster insurers.
“Hopefully by us linking arms, that can then help develop consistency so that insurers will continue to pay for the vaccine,” she said.
Exacerbating disparities
Dr. Ayanna Bennett, director of the District of Columbia Department of Health, said the federal government’s new stance has upended “a system that’s been stable for a very long time.”
Bennett said her agency used federal pandemic aid to shore up vaccine outreach efforts to communities of color. Now that flow of money is ending.
The changes in federal guidance and funding will “almost certainly exacerbate” maternal health disparities, said Marie Thoma, a perinatal epidemiologist and an associate professor in the University of Maryland Department of Family Science who researches pregnancy and COVID-19.
Black and Indigenous women died at higher rates. The virus exacerbated existing racial disparities in maternal health — and created new ones: Latina mothers, who generally see low rates of maternal mortality, saw deaths surge to 28 per 100,000 in 2021. Their rate was about 12 per 100,000 in 2018, according to federal data.
“We are going in with some exposure already that we didn’t have during the start of the pandemic. So, there will be some protection, but now that will erode,” said Thoma. “If we’re not getting vaccines, or if people are hesitant to take them, we could see some increase.”
Silverman said the administration’s efforts to strip mentions of race from government policies makes it difficult for institutions to reach populations at greatest risk. He called the dismissal of decades of data “saddening and infuriating.”
“The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most,” said Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council.
Many women “are trying to navigate an economic system that’s not always in their favor in terms of also providing access to the kind of educational material that they need,” she said.
Not just COVID-19
In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics.
The change is creating chaos. Some states have vaccine laws, such as mandates for kids and coverage statutes, that are specifically tied to the committee’s decisions.
The Vaccine Integrity Project at the University of Minnesota called on frontline health workers, health officials and professional societies to “counter the spread of inaccurate and confusing vaccine information.”
At a news briefing this month held by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, representatives from Alabama, Connecticut and Washington, D.C., said they will continue to recommend vaccines.
Alabama’s state health officer, Dr. Scott Harris, said clinicians will be instrumental in getting correct vaccination information to patients.
“We don’t think that we necessarily have the same authoritative voice that we might have had a decade ago in trying to guide people in what to do, but we do believe that people trust their health care providers in most cases and are certainly willing to listen to them,” he said at the briefing.
Bennett said she is hopeful that strong, consistent messaging from respected medical organizations will help combat confusion.
“Having established groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics or the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology make very firm recommendations that keep us essentially not changed from where we have been, I think, should reassure families,” she said.

President Donald Trump’s administration has ordered some retiring coal plants to stay online, even as they have struggled to remain economically viable. (Photo by Liam Niemeyer/Kentucky Lantern)Mandates from President Donald Trump’s administration to retain aging coal plants could cause a massive spike in energy costs, according to an independent analysis commissioned by several environmental groups.
Orders from the U.S. Department of Energy to save coal plants from retirement could cost ratepayers more than $3 billion per year, according to a report from Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. It was carried out on behalf of Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council and Sierra Club.
Under Trump, the agency has issued emergency orders to maintain operations at coal plants that were scheduled for retirement. While federal officials say the coal plants need to stay online to avoid blackouts, power plant owners and state regulators planned their closures because they were no longer economically viable or needed for reliability.
“DOE mandates override those well-informed decisions, inflating electric bills for homeowners and businesses and undermining the competitiveness of U.S. factories and data centers,” the Grid Strategies analysis found.
Across the country, coal plants have phased out as they’ve struggled to compete with cheaper renewables and natural gas. A 2023 analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, found that 99% of existing U.S. coal plants “are more expensive to run than replacement by local wind, solar, and energy storage resources.”
But Trump, who has pushed to unleash more fossil fuel development and to stymie wind and solar, has ordered a retiring coal plant in Michigan to stay online, along with an oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania.
“Based on the trend to date and indications that DOE has approached the owners of many retiring fossil power plants about potentially mandating their retention, DOE may attempt to mandate the retention of nearly all large fossil power plants slated for retirement between now and the end of 2028,” reads the Grid Strategies report.
The cost of keeping those plants online would be immense. By 2028, if Trump were to mandate the retention of all fossil fuel plants slated for retirement, the annual cost to ratepayers would be more than $3.1 billion, the analysis found.
The report also considers a number of aging plants that are not yet scheduled for retirement. It finds Trump’s actions could create a “perverse incentive,” causing plant owners to claim they’re planning to shut down, inducing the feds to step in and keep them open, with the cost borne by ratepayers.
Accounting for that possibility, the report found that ratepayer costs could reach $5.9 billion per year to keep the entire aging fossil fuel fleet online. California, Texas and Colorado would see the highest increases in electricity bills.

(Photo of Old Knox County Courthouse: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Knox County Property Assessor Phil Ballard faces one count of official misconduct for, in the words of the Tennessee Comptroller of the Treasury, improperly using a “county vehicle approximately 150 times while receiving a $7,600 annual travel allowance and repaid $2,776.95 after the improper use was discovered.” 
Ballard, who has served as assessor since 2008, and I started together as Knox County commissioners in 2006. In fact, we traveled together, along with fellow new Commissioner Greg Lambert, to training sessions in Nashville for newly-elected county officers. 
He’s has been a guest in my reporting class at the University of Tennessee, and I’d like to withhold judgment on these matters, awaiting the actions of the courts. Instead, I’d prefer to write about the importance of all Tennessee counties having good, clear and enforced policies on county vehicles.
As Ballard, Lambert and I joined the commission, there was a sharp power rivalry between Knox County Mayor Mike Ragsdale and County Sheriff Tim Hutchison.  The two even had separate welcoming and orientation sessions for new commissioners.  Sheriff devotee and Commission Chair Scott Moore once brought up a motion to withdraw the mayor’s county vehicle or reduce his travel allotment. The motion had some merit, but ignored substantial vehicle discrepancies on the sheriff side, so I passed on the vote and explained that Moore’s motion was not comprehensive enough. 
  Knox County Property Assessor Phil Ballard (Photo: knoxcounty.org)
My abstention tied the vote; the motion failed.  Moore rewarded/punished me by appointing me as chair of an ad hoc vehicle committee. The other members were Lambert and Commissioner Mike Hammond.  We held public hearings and sought  documents about which vehicles were held by which county departments, who had access to them, and what were the rules for vehicle use. Hammond looked into GPS and whether it could be used to track use and potential misuse.  Lambert explored vehicles assigned to judges.  I visited the local facility where many county vehicles were fueled, maintained, and repaired. 
I also did some research, starting with the County Technical Assistance Service and the Municipal Technical Assistance Service, part of the University of Tennessee’s Institute for Public Service.  I found vehicle policies from other cities and counties.  I even read through a specialized magazine Government Fleet, and used SurveyMonkey to reach out to those who managed county vehicles
The result was something of a “greatest hits” policy, selecting the best from several thorough county policies from around the country.  I presented a draft to the commission, but knew that several changes would be needed to round up the necessary votes to pass.  I had to exempt schools to avoid potential lawsuits about whether county commissioners were stepping on the authority of the school board. I reluctantly exempted the sheriff’s department (otherwise, the whole effort would have died), even though I suspected several unneeded take-home vehicles resided there. The plan passed.  
However, as the Ballard prosecution shows, the county may have slipped back into some bad habits.
Here are some suggestions for counties large and small about county vehicles:

Take home vehicles should be limited only to jobs that require a daily and frequent presence on the road, and response to emergencies overnight. They should not be used as salary supplements or other perks.
One may not “double dip” using both a government vehicle and a travel allowance, excepting distant travel such as conferences where the county vehicle cannot serve to get the person there.
Some current research looks into state and local electric vehicle policies. Counties should explore this for both environmental and cost savings reasons. The key to such savings will be widely available charging stations, and a fee structure that rewards electric vehicle ownership and does not punish it with fees.
Traditional gas refueling at any county pumps, or from private sources, must have precise records to assure that fuel is not being diverted to personal use related to county vehicles.
Smoking must be prohibited in county vehicles. This reduces exposure to second-hand smoke and helps avoid needless decline in resale value.
County vehicles may not be used for personal trips. 
Cell phone use should be avoided while driving. Communication should be kept to essential messages while opting for hands-free devices.
Any and all accidents, moving violations or traffic/parking citations while using a county vehicle must be reported promptly to one’s immediate supervisor — or in the case of department heads, to both the sheriff and the county mayor.

   Other good policies certainly can and should be added to this starter list, but harsh experience has shown us that enforced policies are needed.

(Photo by Kevin Magee)BOGALUSA  — Less than a mile from a century-old mill that sustained generations in this small town north of New Orleans, 19-year-old Tajdryn Forbes was shot to death near his mother’s house.
She found Forbes face down in the street in August 2023, two weeks before he had planned to move away from the empty storefronts, boarded-up houses, and poverty that make this one of the most troubled places in the nation.
Naketra Guy thought about how her son overcame losing his father at age 4 and was the glue of the family. She called him “humble” and “respectful,” a leader in the community and on the football field, where he shined.
Yet he could not outrun the grim statistics of his hometown. Bogalusa posts some of the worst health outcomes and poverty in Louisiana, a state that routinely ranks among the worst nationally in both. And Bogalusa has endured another indicator of poor public health: high levels of gun violence.
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, gun violence has shattered any sense of peace or progress here. Louisiana suffers the nation’s second-highest firearm death rate — and Bogalusa, a predominantly Black community with 10,000 residents, has seen dozens of shootings and a violent crime rate approaching twice the national average.

Bogalusa’s mayor, Tyrin Truong, was elected in 2022 at age 23 on his promises to fix entrenched challenges: few youth programs and good jobs, and perpetual crime and blight.
“I ran for mayor because I got sick of seeing our city painted as mini-New Orleans,” he said, “due to the high levels of youth gun violence.”
In January, the Louisiana State Police arrested Truong, accusing him of soliciting a prostitute and participating in a drug trafficking ring that allegedly used illicit proceeds to buy firearms. He has said he is innocent. “I still haven’t been formally arraigned,” he told KFF Health News in late July, “and I haven’t been charged with anything.”
Every year tens of thousands of Americans — one every few minutes — are killed by gun violence on the scale of a public health epidemic.
Many thousands more are left to recover from severe injuries, crushing medical debt, and the mental health toll of losing loved ones.
Most headlines focus on America’s urban centers, but the numbers also reflect the growth of gun violence in places like Bogalusa, a pinprick of a town 75 miles north of New Orleans. In 2020, the gun violence death rate for rural communities was 40% higher than in large metropolitan areas, according to Johns Hopkins University.
Firearms are the No. 1 killer of children in the U.S., and no group suffers more than young Black people. More Black boys and men ages 15 to 24 in 2023 were killed in gun homicides than from the next 15 leading causes of deaths combined. Though overall U.S. homicides dropped sharply after the pandemic ended, adolescent gun deaths climbed even higher in the years after, according to research by Jonathan Jay, an associate professor in the School of Public Health at Boston University.
“It has all the markers of an epidemic. It is a major driver of death and disability,” Jay said. “Gun violence does not get the attention it deserves. It is underrecognized because it disproportionately impacts Black and brown people.”

Rather than bolstering efforts to save lives, federal, state, and local government officials have undermined them. KFF Health News undertook an examination of gun violence since the pandemic, a period when firearm death rates surged. Reporters reviewed government reports and academic research and interviewed dozens of health policy experts, activists, and victims or their relatives. They reviewed corporate earnings reports from gun manufacturers and data on the industry’s donations to politicians.
In polling published in 2023 by KFF, more than half of Americans said they or a family member had been impacted by gun violence such as by seeing a shooting or being threatened, injured, or killed with a gun.
American politicians and regulators have put in place laws and practices that have helped enrich firearm and ammunition manufacturers — which tout $91 billion in economic impact — even as gun violence has terrorized neighborhoods already damaged by white flight, systemic disinvestment, and other forms of racial discrimination.
President Donald Trump championed gun rights on the campaign trail and has received millions from the National Rifle Association, to whose members he promised, “No one will lay a finger on your firearms.” His administration has rolled back efforts under President Joe Biden to address the rise in gun violence.
Emboldened in his second term, Trump is pushing to allow more guns in schools, weaken federal oversight of the gun industry, override state and local gun laws, permit sales without background checks, and cut funding for violence intervention.
Trump ordered the attorney general to review all Biden administration actions that “purport to promote safety but may have impinged on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.”
The Biden administration said “a historic spike in homicides” during the pandemic took its greatest toll on racially segregated and high-poverty neighborhoods.
Black youths in four major cities were 100 times as likely as white ones to experience a firearm assault, research showed. Gun suicides reached an all-time high, and for the first time the firearm suicide rate among older Black teens surpassed that of older white teens.
In Bogalusa, the pandemic gun violence spread fear. Among the victims killed were a 15-year-old attending a birthday party and a 24-year-old nationally known musician. Thirteen people were injured at a memorial for a man who himself had been shot. Residents said neighbors stopped sitting in their yards because of stray bullets.
Researchers say communities like Bogalusa endure a collective trauma that shatters their sense of safety. Two years after Forbes’ death, his mother says that when she leaves home her surviving children worry that she, too, might get shot.
Repercussions from the surge will last years, researchers said: Exposure to shootings increases risk for post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, suicide, depression, substance abuse, and poor school performance for survivors and those who live near them.
“We saw gun violence exposure go up for every group of children except white children, in the cities we studied,” Jay said. “Limits on government funding into gun violence research may stop us from ever knowing exactly why.”
Politics of pain
The year before Forbes died in Bogalusa, Biden signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, considered the most sweeping firearm legislation in decades.
In a matter of months, Trump has systematically dismantled key provisions.
Efforts to regulate guns have long proven ineffective against the power of political and business interests that fill the streets with weapons. In 2020, the number of guns manufactured annually in the U.S. hit 11.3 million, more than double a decade earlier, according to the federal government. In 2022, the United States had nearly 78,000 licensed gun dealers, more than its combined number of McDonald’s, Burger King, Wendy’s, and Subway locations, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group.

The Biden administration announced in 2021 it would attempt to reduce gun violence by adopting a “zero tolerance” policy toward firearm dealers who committed violations such as failing to run a required background check or selling to someone prohibited from buying a gun.
The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF, which licenses gun dealers, has the authority to enforce laws meant to prevent illegal gun sales. In issuing an executive order, the Trump administration declared that, under Biden, the agency targeted “mom-and-pop shop small businesses who made innocent paperwork errors.”
From October 2010 to February 2022, the agency conducted more than 111,000 inspections, recommending revocation of a dealer’s license only 589 times, about 0.5% of cases, an inspector general’s report said. Even when it cited serious violations, the ATF rarely shut dealers down.
ATF leaders told the inspector general’s office that recommendations for license revocations increased after Biden’s zero-tolerance policy was implemented. In April, the Trump administration repealed it.
Surgeon General Vivek Murthy last year declared firearm violence a public health crisis. Within weeks of Trump’s inauguration, his administration removed the advisory. Of the 15 leading U.S. causes of death, firearm injuries received less research funding from the National Institutes of Health for each person who died than all but poisoning and falls, according to an analysis in 2024 by Brady, an anti-gun violence organization. Trump is trying to cut that funding, too.
Trump’s Department of Justice abruptly cut 373 grants in April for projects worth about $820 million, with a large share from gun violence intervention.
“We are going to lose a generation of community violence prevention folks,” said Volkan Topalli, a gun violence researcher at Georgia State University. “People are going to die, I’m sorry to say, but that is the bleak truth of this.”
Asked about its policies, the White House did not address questions about public health considerations around gun violence.
“Illegal violence of any sort is a crime issue, and President Trump has been clear since Day One that he is committed to Making America Safe Again by empowering law enforcement to uphold law and order,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said.

Trump administration officials “want safer streets and less violence,” Topalli said. “They are hurting their cause.”
Garen Wintemute, an emergency medicine professor who directs the violence prevention program at the University of California-Davis, was among the first in the nation to consider guns and violence as a public health issue. He said race plays a significant role in perceptions about gun violence.
“People look at the demographic risk for firearm homicide and depending on the demographics of the people in the audience, I can see the transformation in their faces,” Wintemute said. “It’s like they’re saying, ‘Not my people, not my problem.’”
Eroding gun restrictions
Trump’s incursions against public health efforts to contain gun violence are backed by lobbying power.
Firearm industry advocacy groups made millions of dollars in political donations in recent years, mostly to conservative causes and Republican candidates. That includes $1.4 million to Trump, according to OpenSecrets, which tracks campaign finance data.
The assassination of civil rights icon the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. helped lead to the passage of the federal Gun Control Act of 1968, which imposed stricter licensing rules and outlawed the sale of firearms and ammunition to felons.
While it remains the law of the land, over time, federal and state government actions have significantly weakened its protections.
Most states now allow people to carry concealed weapons without a permit or background check, even though research suggests the practice can increase the risk of firearm homicides.
In Louisiana, Democratic former Gov. John Bel Edwards, in office from 2016 to 2024, vetoed a bill that would have allowed people to carry concealed firearms without a permit.
Elected in 2023, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed a law to allow any person over age 18 to conceal-carry without a permit.
The Trump administration has created a task force to implement his executive order to end most gun regulations and which would allow more people with criminal convictions, including for domestic abuse, to own guns.
Figures vary, but some researchers estimate as many as 500 million guns circulate in the U.S. Sales reached record highs during the pandemic and publicly traded firearm and ammunition companies saw profits jump.
Donald Trump Jr. this summer joined the board of GrabAGun, an online gun retailer that went public in July under the stock ticker PEW. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the company, which markets guns to people ages 18 to 44, cited “gun violence prevention and legislative advocacy organizations that oppose sales of firearms and ammunition” as threats to its sales growth.

Dave Workman, a gun rights advocate with the Second Amendment Foundation, said firearms are not to blame for the surge in pandemic shootings.
“Bad guys are going to do what bad guys are going to do regardless of the law,” Workman said. “Taking away gun rights is not going to reduce crime.”
David Yamane, a Wake Forest University sociology professor and national authority on guns, said the U.S. firearm debate is complex and the industry is often “painted with too broad a brush.”
Most guns will never be used to kill anyone, he said. Americans tend to buy more guns during times of unrest, Yamane added: “It’s part of the American tradition. Guns are seen as a legitimate tool for defending yourself.”
‘A low level of hope’
Once called “the Magic City,” Bogalusa has become a grim symbol of deindustrialization.
Bogalusa emerged as Black people formed their own communities in the time of Jim Crow racial segregation at the turn of the 20th century.
Racism concentrated Black people in neighborhoods that became epicenters of poor health, reflected in high rates of cancer, asthma, chronic stress, preterm births, pregnancy-related complications — and, over recent decades, firearm violence.
Thousands flocked to Bogalusa after the Great Southern Lumber Company built one of the world’s biggest sawmills, establishing Bogalusa as a company town. Racial tensions soon followed.
Members of the local Deacons for Defense and Justice gained national attention in the 1960s for protecting civil rights organizers from the Ku Klux Klan, a hate group that burned houses and churches, terrorizing and killing Black people.
As the mill changed hands over the decades, Bogalusa’s fortunes slid. In the mid-20th century, the population surpassed 20,000, but it is now about half that.
International Paper, a Fortune 500 company based in Tennessee, runs the mill as a containerboard factory, employing about 650 people. In 2021, the state announced incentives for the company that included a $500,000 tax break, saying the move would help bring “prosperity.”

Businesses remain boarded up along the main drag. Houses still bear damage from Hurricane Katrina, and many streets are eerily quiet.
Nearly 1 in 3 people in Bogalusa live in poverty — 2½ times the national average.
Bogalusa’s violent gun crime rate reached 646.1 per 100,000 people in 2022, higher than Louisiana’s and 1.7 times the national one, according to the nonprofit Equal Justice USA, citing FBI Uniform Crime Reporting data.
In many rural towns across the South, “there is a level of desperation that is more apparent” than in other parts of the U.S., said Luke Shaefer, a University of Michigan professor of social justice and public policy.
“They don’t have the same infrastructure to have robust social services. People are like, ‘What are my life chances?’” Shaefer said. “People feel like there is nothing that can be done. There is a low level of hope.”
Missed opportunities
Mayor Truong lamented the violence in Bogalusa after Forbes was killed, writing on Facebook, “When are we as a community going to come together and decide enough is enough?”
The federal government had offered one path forward.
The Biden administration provided billions of dollars to local governments through the American Rescue Plan Act during the pandemic. Biden urged them to deploy money to community violence intervention programs, shown to reduce homicides by as much as 60%.
A handful of cities seized the opportunity, but most did not. Bogalusa has received $4.25 million in ARPA funds since 2021. None appears to have gone toward violence prevention.

The Louisiana legislative auditor, Michael Waguespack, found that Bogalusa used nearly $500,000 for employee bonuses, which his report said may have violated state law. In some cases, the report says, payments were not tied to work performed.
Bogalusa officials did not respond to a public records request from KFF Health News seeking detailed information about its ARPA money.
Former Mayor Wendy O’Quin-Perrette, who served from 2015 through early 2023, told Waguespack in a June 2024 letter that the city used ARPA money to improve streets and pay the bonuses. “We would not have done it without being sure it was allowed,” she said.
O’Quin-Perrette did not respond to requests for comment.
In a 2023 letter to Waguespack, O’Quin-Perrette’s successor, Truong, wrote that Bogalusa officials didn’t know how the federal money was spent. When he took office, Truong alleged, officials discovered “tens of thousands of dollars of checks and cash” stashed “in various drawers and on desks” in city offices.
Truong defended his stewardship of ARPA funds, saying that about $1 million remained when he assumed office but that the money was needed for more urgent sewer infrastructure repairs. “I wish we could have invested more, invested any money in gun violence prevention efforts,” he said.
In an interview, Truong said the city has been “intentional” about bringing down gun violence, including through a summer jobs program. He pointed to statistics that show homicides decreased from nine in 2022 to two in 2024. “If you keep them busy, they won’t have time to do anything else,” he said.
Asked about his January arrest, Truong said he has political enemies.
“I’m the only Democrat in a very red part of the state, and, you know, I’ve made a lot of changes at City Hall, and that ticks people off,” Truong told KFF Health News. He said that he ended long-standing city contracts with local businesspeople. “When you’re shaking up power structures, you become a target.”
Josie Alexander, a Louisiana-based senior strategist for Equal Justice USA, said city officials missed an opportunity when they didn’t use ARPA funds for gun violence prevention. “The sad thing is people here can now see that money was coming in,” she said. “But it just wasn’t used the way it needed to be.”
‘Too much trouble here’
Truong said the city is still reeling from the pandemic spike in violent crime. He said he was at Bogalusa High School’s homecoming football game in 2022 when one teen shot another. Shots rang out, Truong said, and he grabbed his 3-month-old son and “laid in the bleachers.”
“It’s not a foreign topic to hardly anybody in town, whether you’ve heard the gunshots in the distance, whether you have attended a funeral of somebody who passed due to gun violence,” he said. Many still grapple with trauma.
In December 2022, Khlilia Daniels said, she hosted a birthday party for her teenage niece, praying no one would bring a gun.
The hosts checked guests for weapons, she said.
Yet gunfire erupted, Daniels said. Three teens were shot, including 15-year-old Ronié Taylor, who died, according to police.
“When someone you know is killed, you never forget,” said Daniels, 32, who held Taylor until emergency responders arrived.

Tajdryn Forbes was planning his future when he was killed, likely because of a dispute that started on social media over lyrics in a rap song, Guy said.
In a Facebook post in January, Bogalusa police said they had arrested someone in connection with Forbes’ killing. Authorities had previously announced the arrest of a teen in connection with the homicide.
Forbes had been a high school football standout, like his late father, Charles Forbes Jr., who played semipro. When Forbes scored a touchdown, he would look to the sky to honor his dad.
The school praised Forbes for his senior baseball season in a social media post: “This young man makes a difference on our campus and on the field with his strong character.”
When hopes for a college football scholarship did not pan out, Forbes worked as a deckhand for a marine transportation company. He saved money, looking forward to moving to Slidell, a suburb of New Orleans.
“He would always say, ‘There’s too much trouble here’” in Bogalusa, Guy recalled.

But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.
The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.
Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.










When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances. 


– Minnesota Democratic Secretary of State Steve Simon


The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.
Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
GOP pressure
Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.

After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
Unreliable data?
But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.
A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.
Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

Case in point is NorthWestern Energy’s plan to provide power to gigantic data centers. With great ballyhoo across the state, NorthWestern Energy announced it signed a “letter of intent” to provide as much as 1,000 megawatts of electricity to Quantica Infrastructure for its proposed data center. That’s more than their current total electric load of 760 megawatts. That amount of power would use all of NorthWestern’s existing generation capacity.
You would think that this monopoly business and its top brass would be satisfied with its current situation. In exchange for providing power to its current customer base (that’s us), they receive a virtual guarantee they will not lose their investment for any reason. They also get a guaranteed rate of return on their investments that hovers around 10%. That is for the entire life of the facility regardless of economic conditions or competition.
In exchange for running this sleepy little monopoly, which is headquartered in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, their current CEO, Brian Bird, received $4.8 million in 2024. The 2023 corporate proxy statement lists Board Chairwoman Linda Sullivan receiving an annual retainer of $150,000 plus 3,750 shares of stock. Current price per share is around $55. For comparison, the manager of Flathead Electric Cooperative, the largest public power provider in Montana, receives just under $550,000 per year.
But now NorthWestern wants to take on a lot of risk building new facilities and making investments betting on the latest fashion trend to come down the pike — data centers. And if they miss their bet, we all suffer the consequences. Maybe the business booster crowd needs a history lesson.
In 1971, the Bureau of Reclamation released the North Central Power Study. The plan called for massive coal development on the northern plains. In Montana alone, they envisioned 17 coal plants roughly the size of the Colstrip plants. Of course, the Montana Power Company (NorthWestern Energy’s predecessor) and other corporate interests in Montana were all for it. For them, the environmental degradation and negative impact on existing ag producers and others were worth the cost.
But ranchers, Native tribes, and many others were not convinced. They organized to oppose the massive development being proposed by the coal and utility industries. In the end, only four plants were built and owned by a consortium of utilities. It also spawned two of the most powerful citizen groups in the state — The Montana Environmental Information Center and Northern Plains Resource Council. To this day, they remain actively engaged in protecting Montana’s people and environment from corporate interests seeking a quick dollar.
Fast forward to 1997 and the electric deregulation fiasco. Management of the Montana Power Company became bored with the stodgy old regulated utility business. So they decided to sell off the power plants and power lines they owned. They took all of that money and dumped it into Touch America, a fledgling telecommunications company. In short order, Touch America went bankrupt and all of that money evaporated. Montana suffered through years of economic chaos. We went from some of the lowest customer rates in the country to some of the highest rates in the Northwest. NorthWestern is now proposing significant rate increases on a regular basis, while still trying to acquire worn out, expensive coal plants in the Colstrip complex.
In the emerging world of huge data centers serving everything from artificial intelligence to cryptocurrency ponzi schemes, NorthWestern sees a new shiny object on the horizon: Huge electric loads required by data centers. Unfortunately, this confronts us when the national government is run by delusional ideologues. Here in Montana, billionaire tech moguls and far-right legislators are running state government. The Public Service Commission, which should be protecting us from the greed of corporate CEOs, looks more like the clown show in a three-ring circus.
Strap in and hold onto your wallets, folks. It’s gonna be a wild ride.

(Photo by Chris Dorst | Charleston Gazette-Mail)In 1894, Charleston celebrated a milestone: the dedication of the city’s first synagogue on Virginia Street. It was more than a religious occasion. Gov. William A. MacCorkle attended, alongside the state treasurer and Christian clergy. Rabbi Isaac M. Wise — one of the most influential Jewish leaders in American history — spoke to a sanctuary filled with neighbors of many denominations.
This wasn’t unusual for West Virginia in that era. Across the state, the dedication of a synagogue was a civic moment — a declaration that Jewish life was part of the community’s moral and cultural landscape.
Consider Wheeling just a few years earlier. On June 1, 1891, children from the nearby Clay School played among the foundations of the new Eoff Street Temple before the cornerstone ceremony began. Their names — along with those of the synagogue’s Sunday school students — were placed inside the cornerstone, sealed alongside other mementos marking the occasion.
When the cornerstone was laid, “not nearly all those present were of the Jewish race,” the Wheeling Intelligencer reported. Prominent citizens, including at least one Christian minister, stood shoulder to shoulder with the congregation. Some lingered afterward to offer congratulations on “their good fortune in having gotten so well along on so pretty a house of worship.”
Nearly a year later, when the temple was dedicated, Christians again filled the pews. Representatives came from First Presbyterian, St. John’s German Evangelical and Zane Street Methodist Churches. They gathered not because of crisis or obligation, but in joy — affirming their neighbors’ dignity across lines of faith.
Two decades later, in Martinsburg, that same spirit of public celebration took the form of a street procession. In September 1912, Beth Jacob, the city’s new synagogue on East Pennsylvania Avenue, was dedicated over the course of three days. The highlight came on the afternoon of September 10, when a Torah scroll — handwritten by a scribe over hundreds of hours — was carried from Rabbi Morris Levin’s house on East Liberty Street to the synagogue, which had previously been home to the First United Brethren Church.
A band played at the head of the line. Members of the Jewish community walked alongside friends and onlookers from other traditions. The Evening Journal reported that it was “a sight that aroused much respect along the route of the march.” The Torah itself had traveled from Baltimore, connecting Martinsburg to a wider network of Jewish life even as the city’s own residents made it a local occasion.
These moments from generations ago still teach lessons for today. In an age before interfaith dialogue was a formal concept, West Virginians practiced it in the most tangible way: by showing up. They saw the construction of a synagogue as a shared investment in the city’s future, worth celebrating whether or not they would ever worship there.
It is striking to think that Charleston’s first synagogue dedication drew the state’s top elected officials, that Wheeling’s temple carried the names of public schoolchildren in its cornerstone, and that Martinsburg’s Torah procession wound its way through city streets accompanied by music. These were not quiet, private milestones. They were public affirmations that a house of worship — whatever the tradition — was a gift to the whole community.
Today, we often hear about religious differences as points of division. Yet our own history shows that they can also be points of connection. The stories of Charleston, Wheeling and Martinsburg remind us that faith communities can thrive when they are embraced — not merely tolerated — by the wider public.
For generations, we have known what it means to stand with one another across lines of difference. Over a century ago, West Virginians did it in joy — carrying forward an American tradition that the opening of a new sacred space strengthens the civic fabric for everyone. That belief is worth remembering — and carrying forward.

Now, she’s leaving",Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/20/mississippi-delta-superintendent-turns-failing-schools-around/,"Davis, a native of the Mississippi Delta, soon learned she had a particular gift for turning failing schools around.","INDIANOLA — The top of the Jeep was down, and Miskia Davis was behind the wheel, leading a parade through downtown Indianola.
It was 2019, just two years after the now 50-year-old Davis became superintendent of Sunflower County Consolidated School District. Back then, she wasn’t sure this moment would ever come. 
She recalled feeling the first cool breeze of October as she waved at people who lined the street, smiling and celebrating.

But it had — the district’s first “C” rating, its first passing grade, and the community had shown up to a parade to celebrate the achievement. Generations of teachers and Sunflower County graduates stood on the sidewalk, proudly cheering the assembly of cars and students.
“It was … Oh my God,” Davis said. “My children were like, ‘We did something.’”
The work hadn’t been easy, but it had been worth it, Davis thought — the number crunching, the doubt and lukewarm welcome she felt from the community, the tough decisions she’d had to make.
Now, she’s ready to move on.
Daughter of the Delta
From starting kindergarten to subbing for elementary classes, Davis’ childhood and career in Sunflower County and her identity as a daughter of the Delta were her strengths in the classroom, she said.
“I grew up in Drew, poor and with two young parents,” Davis said. “We didn’t have elaborate meals, and when I went home, the lights may have been off. But it made me who I am, and these children were experiencing the same things I experienced as a child.”
So Davis was relatable. But as a young high school teacher at Ruleville Central High School, some of her students looked older than her and many were taller than she was. She was forced to learn how to command respect, too. 
One particular child taught her an invaluable lesson. He was a star football player in her biology class, and he was failing the course by two points. He caused trouble in class and Davis was determined to fail him, despite more experienced teachers prodding her not to, to look past her own ego. 
So Davis gave him another chance. She had him do extra work and spent hours talking to him. She learned why he behaved poorly in class — he was one of seven children to a young, single mother. 
“He was angry at the world, and I just happened to be in the world,” she said. “It taught me the power of relationships. I think that’s the most important catalyst in transforming education.”
It was during that time that her superintendent “saw something” in her and pushed her to become a school leader. That kickstarted her journey in administration.

Davis soon learned she had a particular gift for turning failing schools around. Under her leadership as principal, Ruleville Middle School went from failing to an “A” letter grade in three years. 
Her school improvement strategy began to take shape, similar to her teaching style. Davis was both a disciplinarian and someone to whom teachers and students could relate. She prioritized building strong relationships with teachers who were invested in their students. But she didn’t shy away from making controversial decisions, either. In Ruleville, she fired nearly all of the staff when she arrived. 
But as Davis was gaining her footing as an administrator, Sunflower County School District was struggling. 
After consistent failing grades resulted in the state takeovers of Indianola, Sunflower and Drew school districts, the Legislature decided to consolidate the three systems in 2012. 
District consolidation is a massive undertaking for any community, but especially for Sunflower County — smack dab in the middle of the Delta, an under-resourced region with a shrinking population, high poverty rates and a deep history of racial exploitation.
Davis arrived in 2014 to a school district that had lost hope — a district that she didn’t recognize.
All Sunflower knew was ‘failure’
Davis never wanted to be superintendent. 
She spent three years working under the leader of the consolidated district. But when the superintendent was dismissed in 2017, Davis was appointed to the head role in an interim capacity. She got the job in January of 2018 without ever applying.
So with another state takeover looming, Davis went to work. The biggest challenge? The district and the community seemed resigned to failure. 
“We had been failing so long, that’s all we knew,” she said. “No one was even sad.”
Early on, Davis visited a school to discuss recent test results. She was so struck by teachers’ apathy that she stopped the meeting midway and had them tear off a scrap of paper and write “yes” or “no” to a question: Did the teachers believe their school could ever be successful? 
More than half said no.
“They were teaching my children,” Davis said, tearing up. “And they didn’t think they would ever be successful.”
Davis went to the school board to tell members that she wouldn’t be renewing many of those teachers’ contracts. That’s when she realized she didn’t just need to boost test scores — she needed to change attitudes. 

The hashtag #WINNING, pictured here in a parade in October 2019, was coined by Superintendent Miskia Davis.

The hashtag #WINNING was born.
“We started to celebrate every little accomplishment,” Davis said. “We got T-shirts, shades, whatever. That was our mantra.”
Children received certificates for a week of perfect attendance. When students did well on benchmark assessments, teachers were ushered into the hallway to be celebrated by students and colleagues. Davis created the “Killin’ It” awards, given to students and teachers for meeting their testing benchmarks. 
They were just certificates, at the end of the day. But it led to a changed school culture, a renewed belief that they could succeed. 
As an administrator, Davis leaned on what she knew worked as a teacher, relationship-building and strong discipline (she even sent her nephew to alternative school for fighting), and combined it with a data-driven approach and an eagle-eyed focus on testing. 
She put an academic coach in every building, whose sole responsibility was supporting teachers. 
Davis took teacher Dylan Jones out of the classroom and put him in the central office, where he was tasked with tracking district metrics. 
Jones uncovered which consultants were working and which were uselessly costing the district millions. The district went from contracting with 30 firms to just four. 
Jones also created an accountability system for teachers. With one click, Davis could see how each teacher’s students were performing, and she gave everyone access to the data. If teachers weren’t meeting their goals, Davis hosted regular meetings and had them explain — in front of everyone — what they needed to succeed. 
Davis’ methods weren’t popular at first. Educators went to the school board and complained that the system was “punitive.” Some even quit. But Davis was steadfast and implored board members to see the work she and her team could do, if given the chance. 
The district’s rating didn’t budge in 2018. 
But in fall 2019, after Davis’ first full year as superintendent, Sunflower County Consolidated School District had earned its first “C” rating.
What happened after the first ‘C’
Those early years were difficult, Davis remembered, because she felt so isolated, just her and her team “in the trenches.”
She hosted community meetings, imploring local parents, leaders and business owners to support the district. 
“They told me to come back when we were no longer failing,” Davis said.
So after that first “C,” when she started seeing the district’s hashtags on Facebook, when more people started coming to school events, when she started to get invited to speak at the local Rotary Club, it was bittersweet. 
Teachers, too, took a while to come around. Their performance was being closely monitored through the accountability system, but soon they realized that Davis wasn’t giving them mandates outside of improving test scores. She gave them autonomy in their classrooms. Teachers had the final say on how to improve their students’ achievement. That kind of trust isn’t common, Sunflower County teachers told Mississippi Today.
It wasn’t until 2021, when voters passed a $31 million bond issue that would pay for major school renovations, that Davis felt the full support of the community. 
Davis even won over Betty Petty, a local matriarch and fierce advocate for kids and parents. 
“She has actually shown a presence at the schools, constantly meeting with teachers and making sure all children are learning,” Petty said. “We had community meetings where she would actually come out and listen to our concerns.”
Petty attended the ribbon-cutting ceremony at Gentry High School last July. Before renovations, plumbing problems caused flooding when it rained, so students had to wade through water to get from class to class. Davis said she’d never forget the sight of generations of Gentry graduates in the school atrium, looking around in wonder at the new facility.
“At first, I chose the community,” Davis said. “But eventually, the community chose me.”

The legacy she leaves behind
Strong schools make strong communities, but it can take time for results to show. Indianola Mayor Ken Featherstone hopes to see the dividends soon. 
Featherstone took office four years ago, around the same time the district got its first “B” grade. It has maintained the grade ever since, the highest in the entire region.
He, like Davis, was reared in the Delta, but empathizes with her struggle garnering the support of a community deeply impacted by gun violence and low investment from state officials.

“People are very result-oriented,” he said, leaning back at his desk in city hall. “You till the soil, but it’s not until you start your seed breaking the ground do you see other people starting to water it. That’s just human nature.”
He’s hoping the district’s academic gains will be a boon for Indianola’s struggling economy.
“We’re seeing things slowly come to our area,” Featherstone said. “To get manufacturing jobs to come to our area, we have to improve our public school system. Directors and presidents of manufacturing plants … they need to know where their kids are going to attend school.”
Davis announced in October 2024 that she would be leaving the superintendent job at the end of the school year. Now, she travels the state, consulting with other districts on how to replicate what she did in Indianola, as a director of District and School Performance and Accountability for The Kirkland Group, an education consulting firm based in Ridgeland. 
Her departure was a tough blow, Featherstone said, and leaves the district’s hard-fought success hanging in balance. 
Petty and her network of parents are concerned, too. 
“I don’t think any of us know what will happen moving forward,” she said. 
Davis said there was no big epiphany. She just felt her mission was accomplished. She said she’s adamant that the district’s “best days are ahead,” under new superintendent James Johnson-Waldington. 
Johnson-Waldington, who was most recently serving as superintendent of Greenwood Leflore Consolidated School District, is also Sunflower-grown, and he was Davis’ principal when she taught at Ruleville Central High School. He plans on employing strategies similar to Davis: holding teachers accountable and celebrating their achievements. 
After all, if it’s working, why change it?
“I feel a good kind of pressure,” Johnson-Waldington said. “I like challenges, and this is a new challenge for me. I’m not taking a failing school district to success. This is about maintaining and growing, and I accept that challenge for the very reason that this is home. I’m going to work very hard to maintain what Miskia has done.”
Davis leaves behind a legacy, Featherstone said, that makes her hometown proud. He was in the crowd that day at the parade. He remembers the excitement, the pride. 
“Older teachers were there, and you could see the look on their faces that they knew they had reared someone who threw the oar out to a sinking district and brought it back up,” he said. 
“She made us see ourselves in a better light, and we can’t thank her enough.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/16124454/3X0A7632.jpg,,,2025-08-20 06:57:49.355378

(Getty Images)Kentucky advocates for people with Alzheimer’s are excited by new research showing that lifestyle interventions like exercising and learning can slow cognitive decline. 
Published in The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in July, The U.S. POINTER Randomized Clinical Trial showed that being social and keeping the brain active can improve brain health over time. 
The Alzheimer’s Association, which helped fund the trial, says it’s the nation’s “first large-scale, randomized controlled clinical trial to demonstrate that an accessible and sustainable healthy lifestyle intervention can protect cognitive function in diverse populations in communities.” 
Erin Abner, the chair of the department of epidemiology and environmental health at the University of Kentucky  Sanders-Brown Center on Aging, said experts were already communicating to patients the importance of healthy lifestyle choices. 
Now, she said, this new research provides “additional evidence” that those interventions are effective in supporting brain health. 
Report shows effects of Alzheimer’s in KY, the disease ‘you can’t see’ 

Researchers haven’t been able to find a way to cure dementia, Abner said, and are looking for ways to slow cognitive decline or prevent it before it takes hold. 
“What this particular research builds on is the idea, I think, that heart health is brain health, and so how do we maximize our brain’s ability to resist maybe the things that we can’t stop from happening?” Abner said. 
Alzheimer’s disease, which falls under the umbrella of dementia, is characterized by memory loss and is incurable, though treatments exist. 
One of those treatments underwent clinical trials at the University of Kentucky, Lecanemab (brand name Leqembi). This is an antibody that targets — and in some cases, removes — amyloid plaques from the brain, and has shown some success in slowing cognitive decline. Amyloid plaques are proteins that form in the brain and are believed to be a significant driver of Alzheimer’s. Lecanemab was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2023. 
Abner said she was “excited” to learn at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in Toronto this summer that Lecanemab is ”safer than we had hoped.” After two years on the market, she said, “we see less adverse events.” Lecanemab is approved by Medicare and some private insurers. 
Shannon White, executive director of the Alzheimer’s Association’s Greater Kentucky and Southern Indiana chapter, said lifestyle habits and medical treatments “go hand in hand” in managing symptoms.  
“What I am most excited about is that not only are we working on treatments once you are diagnosed, but at the same time, we are also working on how to prevent, slow or stop cognitive decline with brain health and prevention,” White said. “Working on both of those things at the same time is really exciting and proves that you just don’t have to look for a cure, that you can look for ways to improve your quality and length of life and possibly never have cognitive decline with some of these interventions.” 
More than 80,000 Kentucky residents 65 and older live with Alzheimer’s, and an estimated 160,000 people in the state provide unpaid care to their loved ones who have the condition. Those caregivers are providing a service worth $4.9 billion, the Lantern previously reported. 
White believes that if people at risk of dementia engage in these positive lifestyle behaviors, it can lessen this burden down the road. 
“If you do lifestyle interventions that could slow cognitive decline, and then if you do get a diagnosis and you are on treatments that could slow cognitive decline, that makes the caregiver burden less stressful,” White said. 
The U.S. Pointer study 
Over two years, researchers looked at two degrees of lifestyle interventions in more than 2,000 participants ages 60 to 79 who lived sedentary lifestyles and had a family history of dementia. 
“These are people with normal cognition, but at the right age and with the right sort of profile that we would expect them to start declining and developing cognitive impairment and dementia,” Abner explained.

Half of the study’s participants underwent a structured approach to lifestyle changes. Small groups of 10-15 met 38 times over the course of 2 years, went to the YMCA for exercise, got nutrition education, met with an Alzheimer’s Association coach and more. The other half followed a similar path of lifestyle changes, but with “less intensity,” Abner said. The groups with more intensive lifestyle interventions did best, but both groups did well. 
“What (researchers) found was that even with the less intense version of this — of simply helping people, giving them the materials, giving them the knowledge that exercise is important, heart health is important, your diet is important — both of those groups of people did better cognitively as the trial went on,” she said. “And so the people who got that really intense, structured intervention did better. But for me, the really good news is that the lighter intervention group also got better. Their cognition also improved.” 
Interventions will look different person by person, Abner said. It may include reading a book, learning something new like a language or instrument, taking classes, getting out of the house and into social settings, working out and more. People don’t have to go from 0 to 100 either, White said. 
“These are about small, incremental lifestyle changes, such as being more social, making sure you’re not lonely or isolated, having fun, doing brain games like Wordle or reading a book, taking a walk three or four days a week,” White said. “It doesn’t have to be … something that is going to turn your life upside down, but it’s just important to stay active, both mentally and physically, and also be sure that you are having fun and engaged in your community.”

Lexington leads the state with a “dementia friendly” business initiative and is “ahead of the curve,” White said, when it comes to being welcoming for people with Alzheimer’s. More than two dozen businesses, churches, health care providers and nonprofits have recognized the importance of people with Alzheimer’s being out in the community, and have trained employees on how to best accommodate forgetfulness, confusion or other issues that may arise.
“If someplace is dementia friendly,” White said, “then those waiters and waitresses and staff understand that someone might be coming in that has dementia and might need a little bit more time, or might need a little bit more understanding and care, when they’re in that setting.” 
Research makes clear that “being socially isolated is bad for us,” Abner said. Scientists will continue to communicate the wide-ranging benefits of being active and social, she said. 
Meanwhile, research into symptoms management is critical for people with Alzheimer’s and those at risk for Dementia. 
“I think there’s a lot to be excited about from the research that’s coming out now,”Abner said. “I hope that the public, especially the taxpaying public, starts to see some of these benefits and understand why we need to do this work.”

States and clinicians are working on getting correct information on vaccines to vulnerable groups amid shifting federal guidance. (Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Heading into the respiratory illness season, states and clinicians are working to encourage pregnant patients to get COVID-19 vaccinations, even though the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services no longer recommends that they should.
Along with being older and having an underlying health condition, pregnancy itself is a risk factor. Pregnant women are more vulnerable to developing severe illness from COVID-19. They’re also at high risk for complications, including preterm labor and stillbirth. The vast majority of medical experts say getting the shot is safe and effective — much safer than having the illness.
But HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in May that the agency would no longer recommend that pregnant women get the vaccine. Before testifying before Congress in June, Kennedy circulated a document on Capitol Hill claiming higher rates of fetal loss after vaccination. But the authors of those studies told Politico that their work had been misinterpreted.
Experts say the federal shift puts the onus on state health agencies to ramp up vaccine guidance and outreach. Clinicians and public health organizations are trying to dispel misinformation and make sure information reaches low-income people and people of color, who had higher maternal death rates during the pandemic. During the first two years of the pandemic, the virus contributed to a quarter of maternal deaths, according to federal data.
“We are severely disappointed,” said Dr. Neil Silverman, a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine. He has studied vaccines and pregnancy for the past 15 years and specializes in high-risk pregnancies.
Silverman called the federal shift a “public health tragedy on a grand scale.”
Vaccinations against COVID-19 help prevent severe illness in pregnant people as well as their newborns, who are too young to get vaccinated, Silverman said. In what’s called passive immunity, vaccinated mothers pass on antibodies to their babies through the placenta and through breast milk.
“State public health agencies are probably going to have to implement vaccine guidance that differs from the federal recommendations. And that’s going to be an interesting can of worms,” said OB-GYN Dr. Mark Turrentine, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.
Turrentine serves on a board of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that focuses on immunization and infectious diseases. He said his recent pregnant patients who had COVID-19 hadn’t gotten the vaccine.
“The change in guidance on the federal level just really makes a lot of confusion, and it makes it very challenging to try to explain to individuals why all of a sudden the difference,” Turrentine said.
A slew of public health organizations have been making a concerted effort to dispel vaccine myths. They include the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization of maternal-fetal experts. At a news briefing the society held this month, clinicians stressed the safety and long-standing science behind COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the shots for RSV and the flu. Cases of RSV and the flu tend to peak in the winter months, while in recent years COVID-19 cases have spiked in the summer and the winter.
Dr. Brenna Hughes, an OB-GYN who chairs the organization’s infectious diseases and emerging threats committee, pointed to survey data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that less than a third of eligible pregnant patients received COVID-19 shots, and only 38% received RSV shots for the 2023 to 2024 season. Less than half — 47% — received flu shots, and 59% received TDAP (whooping cough) vaccines.
CDC data shows that for last year’s and this year’s season, only between 12% and 14% of pregnant patients got the COVID-19 vaccine.
“The complications from the infection are so much greater than the complications and the very few and typically minor adverse events that might occur from the vaccine,” said microbiologist Sabra Klein, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
In June, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and 30 other professional health organizations signed a letter urging insurers to continue covering the COVID-19 shot for pregnant women, and have continued to urge coverage since then.
CVS Caremark, one of the nation’s three major pharmacy benefit managers, told Stateline it will continue covering the vaccine for pregnant women. The Arizona, California and North Carolina state Medicaid agencies also told Stateline they are still currently covering COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women.
Dr. Kimberly Fortner, president-elect of the Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, said during the maternal-fetal medicine briefing that she hopes medical groups’ joint messaging will bolster insurers.
“Hopefully by us linking arms, that can then help develop consistency so that insurers will continue to pay for the vaccine,” she said.
 Exacerbating disparities

Dr. Ayanna Bennett, director of the District of Columbia Department of Health, said the federal government’s new stance has upended “a system that’s been stable for a very long time.”
Bennett said her agency used federal pandemic aid to shore up vaccine outreach efforts to communities of color. Now that flow of money is ending.
The changes in federal guidance and funding will “almost certainly exacerbate” maternal health disparities, said Marie Thoma, a perinatal epidemiologist and an associate professor in the University of Maryland Department of Family Science who researches pregnancy and COVID-19.
Black and Indigenous women died at higher rates. The virus exacerbated existing racial disparities in maternal health — and created new ones: Latina mothers, who generally see low rates of maternal mortality, saw deaths surge to 28 per 100,000 in 2021. Their rate was about 12 per 100,000 in 2018, according to federal data.
“We are going in with some exposure already that we didn’t have during the start of the pandemic. So, there will be some protection, but now that will erode,” said Thoma. “If we’re not getting vaccines, or if people are hesitant to take them, we could see some increase.”
Silverman said the administration’s efforts to strip mentions of race from government policies makes it difficult for institutions to reach populations at greatest risk. He called the dismissal of decades of data “saddening and infuriating.”
“The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most,” said Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council.
Many women “are trying to navigate an economic system that’s not always in their favor in terms of also providing access to the kind of educational material that they need,” she said.
 Not just COVID-19

In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics.
The change is creating chaos. Some states have vaccine laws, such as mandates for kids and coverage statutes, that are specifically tied to the committee’s decisions.


The Vaccine Integrity Project at the University of Minnesota called on frontline health workers, health officials and professional societies to “counter the spread of inaccurate and confusing vaccine information.”


At a news briefing this month held by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, representatives from Alabama, Connecticut and Washington, D.C., said they will continue to recommend vaccines.
Alabama’s state health officer, Dr. Scott Harris, said clinicians will be instrumental in getting correct vaccination information to patients.
“We don’t think that we necessarily have the same authoritative voice that we might have had a decade ago in trying to guide people in what to do, but we do believe that people trust their health care providers in most cases and are certainly willing to listen to them,” he said at the briefing.
Bennett said she is hopeful that strong, consistent messaging from respected medical organizations will help combat confusion.
“Having established groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics or the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology make very firm recommendations that keep us essentially not changed from where we have been, I think, should reassure families,” she said.

That was the subject of a special meeting at the Diocese of Covington Curia on Monday night. Hosted by the Sisters of the Inter-Community Justice and Peace Committee, which is made up of members of the Sisters of Notre Dame, the Benedictine Sisters and the Sisters of Divine Providence, the meeting was the second in a series of meetings for local congregants on the issue of immigration.

This meeting focused on what Catholic social teachings had to say about the issue and gave advice on how local Catholics could get involved.
Bishop John Iffert led an opening prayer, which expressed the central quandary the speakers at the meeting hoped to unpack, namely that Catholic teachings emphasize the dignity of human beings, regardless of their origins, while also granting nations the right to protect their own borders.
“We live in a time where we are caught between high values,” Iffert prayed. “We recognize that God calls us to hospitality, to respect human dignity, to love our neighbor and to welcome even the foreigner as our neighbor. And we gather in the bosom of the Church that recognizes that nations have a right to control their borders, and sometimes we struggle to know how to balance these great values.”
The meeting was well-attended and featured several speakers, as well as some local nonprofits that provide services to immigrants. 
Sister Kay Kramer spoke about the history of anti-immigrant sentiment in the United States and pointed out that many in the room were likely descended from immigrants.
“A lot of what’s happening across the country now is demonizing and degrading human beings who are made in God’s image and likeness, just as we are,” Kramer said.

Hannah Keegan, the director of the Center for Faith, Mission & Catholic Education at Thomas More University, pulled from both modern and classical Catholic writings to describe what is expected of practicing Catholics as it relates to immigrants. 
Keegan emphasized that treatment of immigrants in the community was “not primarily a political question, but a question of justice and mercy. It’s a question of love, ultimately a question of relationship.”
Jessica Ramos, an attorney and the manager of the immigration team at the Legal Aid Society of Greater Cincinnati, discussed the complexities of immigration law, which she characterized as Byzantine and overly punitive. She projected a flow chart up at the front to show how complex immigration processing in the United States could be. 
“I just like to use this graphic to show you that immigration law is extremely complicated,” Ramos said. “I have cases where we have been battling over whether someone is a U.S. citizen for over a decade, right? Just to prove that someone’s a U.S. citizen. I have other cases that it takes two decades to wind through the system.”

“The law in place today is very harsh and punitive compared to centuries past,” Ramos said, “and, honestly, if most of our ancestors tried to come today, they would be denied entry.”
Organizers distributed literature summarizing Catholic social teachings and providing citations, along with information about local organizations that support immigrants. Sister Alice Gerdeman asked the attendees to reflect on the session and consider how they could contribute to the issue, whether through volunteering, donations, or any other way.
“We cannot all do something about everything, but if we want to be hopeful people, we have to find something we can do about some issue because otherwise we get depressed and we lose our energies,” Gerdeman said.

(Photo by Michael G. Seamans/ Maine Morning Star)Since President Donald Trump asked Texas to redraw its congressional maps to find five more Republican seats ahead of next year’s elections, some Democratic states are considering redistricting to counter the effort. 
Maine is not, at least according to Gov. Janet Mills, though an anonymous group tried to encourage the Pine Tree State to intervene earlier this month by flying planes over Augusta with banners that read “Mess with Texas.” 
The state’s constitutional officers, Attorney General Aaron Frey and Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, both Democrats, condemned Texas’ move, and Trump instigating it, as a blatant abuse of power. But, they said Democratic states exploring the avenues legally available to them to redistrict outside the regular schedule is understandable. 
Bellows refrained from any judgement of those counter efforts, while Frey was more critical, particularly due to what he sees as a likely snowball effect. 
“I am lamenting what this might mean for how our politics will continue, in terms of people trying to do the one-upsmanship,” Frey said in a sit-down with Maine Morning Star. “As much as it probably sounds like it’s a critique, it really is more of a concern about this being the evolution of where the politics is going.”
The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, the official party committee dedicated to electing Democrats to statehouses, called on Democrats on Aug. 4 to pursue redistricting opportunities to respond to possible changes to Texas’ congressional map. 
Last week, California was the first state to release a proposal to that aim. Such ideas have also been floated by officials in New York, Maryland, and Illinois — whose governor has already waded into the redistricting battle by welcoming Texas Democrats who fled the state to block a vote on the Republican proposal. They’ve since returned. 
But, Republicans control more state legislatures than Democrats and Vice President JD Vance is touring those states to encourage more gerrymandering. Several, including Missouri, Florida and Indiana, are now considering redrawing their maps to counter the Democrats’ countering. 
“It should be a concern for all of us about what this means for the next time that the next majority is in power,” Frey said. “I am hoping that I would have just as much concern if California would have been the first state to say that they were going to do this as I have about Texas saying that they’re going to do this, even though it may be perfectly appropriate legally.” 
Maine’s process
Redistricting procedures vary state by state but largely happen every ten years following new census data. 
Under the Maine Constitution, the state Legislature must establish a bipartisan advisory commission to draw its congressional and legislative districts every ten years. These maps are then sent to the Legislature for approval, though lawmakers aren’t bound to those recommendations. 
Approval requires a two-thirds vote, and because neither party has held a supermajority in the last decade, this has typically required bipartisan support. The map is then subject to the governor’s approval. 
Maine last went through this process in 2021.
Mills did not respond to multiple requests for comment about whether she supports the actions other Democratic states are considering to redraw their maps in response to Texas Republicans’ attempts. A spokesperson told the Portland Press Herald in early August that she was not considering any actions related to redistricting in Maine.   
If the Legislature is unable to reach the two-thirds threshold, the Maine Supreme Court would draw the maps instead.
“It’s understandable that other states are seeking to fight fire with fire,” Bellows said, echoing California Gov. Gavin Newsom, “but none of what’s happening outside of Maine would change unless the Legislature and the people of Maine decided to pursue a constitutional amendment.”
A constitutional amendment in Maine requires a two-thirds vote, plus approval by the voters, so such a change, especially before the 2026 midterms, is not likely. 
“What’s the end?”
When asked if Maine should get involved in the nationwide redistricting fight, Frey said, “No, not at this point.” 
As the officer representing the state on legal matters, Frey said he doesn’t see an opportunity for legal recourse given that other states drawing congressional districts is a state-level process pertaining to their residents and it doesn’t have a direct harm to Maine.
However, how these maps ultimately shape Congress will inevitably impact Maine, he said, looking at a list on his desk of lawsuits Maine has filed or joined against the Trump administration. Particularly if Trump gets his way in Texas, Frey said it could result in a continuation of a Congress that doesn’t serve as an adequate check to the executive branch.











Some politicians are seeking to choose their voters instead of their voters choosing them.


– Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows



	 
Like other Democrats across the country, Frey and Bellows walked a line to frame their party’s use of redistricting differently than  Republicans’. 
“The Trump administration is trampling all over the norms in our democracy, and it is really important that people stand strong for our values in this moment,” Bellows said. “What’s concerning about what Texas is trying to do is they are basically trying to cheat their way into electoral success in 2026 and 2028, so it’s understandable that some of the larger states that are blue states are thinking about how they might respond.”
Of those clear political aims, Frey similarly said, “There’s no mask to it,” arguing it would be different if Texas had come to a conclusion that redistricting mid-cycle was needed because its districts were no longer representative due to population shifts or another clear reason. 
“Let’s say this was Joe Biden who in 2023 was like, ‘California, Gavin Newsom, you like us, California does a lot of stuff that supports the administration, I need you to go redistrict and get me five more seats in Congress,’” Frey said. “What would people say?” 
But while Frey said Democratic states may be legally within their right to explore counter measures, he doesn’t see it as a productive way to resolve political discord nor address the priority issues of everyday Americans, such as the cost of living. 
“If anything, it’s creating a system that is going to be more unable to meet what it is that, I think, Mainers and the American people are asking for,” Frey said. 
As Trump eyes election changes, Secretary Bellows warns of fallout

Earlier this month Bellows officially responded to the U.S. Department of Justice’s request for sweeping voter data, questioning the federal agency’s intentions and asking that the request be withdrawn. She sees a throughline with that effort, Trump’s executive orders and his push for Texas Republicans to redistrict. 
“Some politicians are seeking to choose their voters instead of their voters choosing them,” Bellows said. “Many of these initiatives seem designed to shrink the population of people who are participating in elections, to spread fear and deter people from participating, or to create artificial barriers to participation.” 
Frey also sees connections. 
The day before speaking with Maine Morning Star, Frey had returned from a trip to Washington, D.C., where he saw National Guard troops and FBI agents gathered on the mall. “They are pushing boundaries to see how far they can get,” Frey said of the administration. 
Pulling up the president’s post on Truth Social ordering the U.S. Commerce Department to start working on a new U.S. Census that does not count people in the country illegally, Frey asked, “What’s the end?” 
He sees all of these moves as a test of the democratic foundation of the country, the U.S. Constitution.
“If enough citizens out there who are protected by this contract decide that they are unwilling to hold the president to the limitations that the constitution places on government action, I mean, at a certain point that contract by both parties is just going to dissolve,” Frey said. 
The book “The Storm Before the Calm” sat on his desk as he added a hopeful nod, explaining the current moment could provide an opportunity to be reminded of the importance of those protections.
The book, by geopolitical forecaster George Friedman, views American history through cycles, enduring upheaval and conflict but, ultimately, increasing in strength and stability. With 2026 on the horizon — when Maine’s governorship, U.S. Senate seat, two U.S. House seats and Legislature are all up for reelection — Frey said, “Maybe there will be an opportunity for renewal.” 
Time will tell how redistricting may play a part in that.

The Trump administration has threatened the city over its sanctuary policies. City officials say some officers violated the policy by assisting in the arrests. (Photo courtesy of City of Rochester)The Trump administration is once again pressuring liberal cities and states to cooperate with deportation efforts, despite previous setbacks in court.
Attorney General Pam Bondi sent letters last week telling sanctuary states, cities and counties that “you better be abiding by our federal policies and with our federal law enforcement, because if you aren’t, we’re going to come after you,” she said in a Fox News interview. She demanded the areas answer her by Tuesday.
Cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies generally refuse to assist with immigration raids or accede to requests for local jails to hold prisoners for deportation. Those that responded to Stateline’s questions about the letters said they were not inclined to change their positions about cooperation with immigration authorities.
“It’s the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they’re not going to intimidate you,” Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.
The Trump administration is attempting to force more cooperation with immigration arrests. But it suffered a serious court reversal on July 25, when a federal judge dismissed a sanctuary policies case against Illinois, Chicago and Cook County.
The state and local policies reflect a “decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law — a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment,” Judge Lindsay Jenkins wrote in an order now under appeal.
Bondi’s letters follow the Justice Department’s Aug. 5 release of a list of sanctuary jurisdictions including 12 states, the District of Columbia, four counties and 18 cities. That’s fewer jurisdictions than the 14 states and almost 500 counties and cities that appeared on an earlier list, which the agency withdrew after criticism that it included conservative counties that were fully cooperating with immigration enforcement.
The states on the new list are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington state. The list also includes some counties and cities in those states as well as in Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New Mexico.

– Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha 


Other federal courts have issued injunctions to at least temporarily stop Trump administration from withholding unrelated federal funding from governments that don’t cooperate on immigration. Cities, counties and states have filed lawsuits challenging Trump’s executive orders targeting sanctuary policies, including a February order that federal payments to states and localities must not “by design or effect, facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration, or abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”
“The executive orders are directing agencies to basically take a maximalist approach to putting pressure on local governments to cooperate with immigration [enforcement], even though they’re not required to do so by federal law,” said Jonathan Miller, one of the attorneys working on the California case for the Public Rights Project, a California-based group promoting civil rights protections for states and cities.
One city on the administration’s list was Rochester, New York, which disciplined some police officers for helping federal agents make a March arrest in the city. The city already faces a lawsuit brought by the Trump administration that prominently mentions the arrest of three men from Guatemala; one of whom has since pleaded guilty to re-entering the United States after a previous deportation.
A spokesperson for the city, Barbara Pierce, said in a statement to The Guardian that, “Nothing in Attorney General Bondi’s letter is new and none of it has legal merit.”
“The letter reiterates many of the frivolous arguments that the federal government has already made in its pending suit against the city of Rochester,” she added. “These same arguments were levied against the city of Chicago and were dismissed by the federal district court for the eastern district of Illinois nearly a month ago.”
Ally Sullivan, a spokesperson for Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, said in a statement that Colorado “is not a sanctuary state. The Governor continues to be frustrated by this mistaken and incorrect label.” In a televised interview earlier this year, Polis pointed out that Colorado fully cooperates with federal authorities on criminal matters. Immigration, he said, is a civil matter.
“In Colorado, we are improving public safety, apprehending dangerous criminals, cooperating with federal law enforcement on criminal investigations, and keeping our communities safe,” Sullivan said.
Nevertheless, Colorado faces a federal lawsuit brought by the administration over its alleged sanctuary policies. Polis signed a measure in May that limits local law enforcement’s communication with federal immigration authorities and restricts where federal authorities can operate within schools, child care facilities, hospitals and libraries without a judicial warrant.
Connecticut Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont in a statement said the state’s Trust Act, which the Trump administration has targeted as a sanctuary policy, was passed with bipartisan support and helps ensure local police concentrate on serious crimes. The Trust Act, passed in 2013 and expanded in 2019, limits information sharing and compliance with requests to detain immigrants for federal immigration authorities.
“Nothing about this makes Connecticut a sanctuary in any legal or practical sense — it makes our state one that upholds the Constitution, respects the rule of law, and prioritizes the safety and well-being of our communities,” Lamont said.

Each week in Kentucky, more than 700 customers share in that ritual at our Fort Thomas Farmers Market in Tower Park. But while food matters, I’ve come to find that it’s the human connection that lives at the heart of it all.

September is National Harvest Month, and this year I’m reflecting not only on my own journey, but on the farmers, volunteers, and makers who, each week, open their booths and hearts to define what farm fresh means. And how tapping into the support of the community is the essential piece to keep this tradition alive.
As the market manager for our farmers market, my mission is simple: Connect local farmers to our community. Since 2009, our award-winning market has become a midweek destination for fresh, locally sourced goods from across the region. While our location is adjacent to a large metro area, we’ve been proud to maintain a rich, small-town feel. 
When you’re passionate about something, it’s only natural to want to share it. For me, I’ll never stop inviting people to experience all the Fort Thomas Farmers Market has to offer. We live in a time where we can no longer depend on just signs across town to promote our space. We have to meet people where they are, which is online.
Today, social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram have become essential tools for communicating what’s in season, sharing upcoming events, and educating our community about why investing in local matters. Thanks to our digital following, we have a great community that supports us as we open our booths every Wednesday. Our social media posts span beyond picturesque produce and share the real stories of the makers.

With a heartbeat behind every booth, it’s been amazing to see how a Facebook reel of a farmer harvesting sunflowers can brighten the day for our 7,000 followers, or how tagging a friend in a comment has led to a fun-filled Wednesday afternoon for the duo. 
We can now share our 30 diverse vendors in real time with customers through Facebook posts to create a bridge of connection with the very makers who dug the dirt, planted the seeds, and baked the goods they’re taking home. 
While each farmer’s story differs, their dependence on their community remains the same. And we’re committed to keeping our farmers market tradition alive through the online tools at our disposal.
We have found that even in a digital age, people crave real connection — and fresh food happens to be the perfect place to start. As we approach harvest, I encourage our fellow neighboring farmers markets to get their faces out there on digital platforms to get even more Kentuckians involved in the great community our markets create. It’s easy to create a Facebook or Instagram profile, and that might be the missing link to connecting with your local community.
To me, it’s not just about food labels; it’s about faces. It’s about relationships. And it’s about celebrating the people who make our community stronger, one market day at a time. This harvest season, my message is simple: Support local, connect deeply and celebrate the story behind your food.

As iGaming makes it possible for users to gamble with a tap on their phone, the tool offers both benefits and hurdles for policymakers considering how to build Virginia’s gambling market. States like New Jersey have already reaped financial rewards, with that state becoming the nation’s largest regulated online gaming market.
Dave Rebuck, a former director of the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, told the Joint Subcommittee to Study the Feasibility of Establishing the Virginia Gaming Commission at its meeting in Richmond about how his home state authorized and launched the nation’s first competitive internet gaming market. 
One key factor Virginia policymakers will need to weigh, Rebuck said, is how to foster cooperation among state and federal leaders, backed by a clear plan.
“Based on my experience, there’s proof in concept to taking a multi-pronged approach to cracking down on the illegal market, with legalization being a critical component to every approach,” Rebuck said. 
“But let’s not fool ourselves,” he added. “Unless we have tremendous support and collaboration between government agencies, including the federal government, the status quo of the illegal market and the offshore sites that are engaged in businesses, in every state, are not going to go away.”
How Virginia is addressing the dark side of gambling

Tuesday’s committee meeting zeroed in on iGaming — online casino games such as Blackjack, Craps, Poker, Roulette, and Slots that can be played on smartphones, tablets, or computers. Lawmakers heard multiple presentations weighing internet gambling’s advantages, drawbacks, and challenges.
Supporters argue internet gaming offers convenience by eliminating the need to travel. But critics note that it presents risks for both consumers and policymakers.
Illegal operators, for example, provide no consumer protections and contribute nothing to Virginia’s Problem Gambling Treatment and Support Fund. They often target minors and self-excluded individuals, according to Keith Whyte, founder and president of Safer Gambling Strategies, LLC.
Whyte added that research “consistently” shows iGaming is tied to elevated risks of gambling addiction, with the highest rates among men between 18 and 35.
Experts further briefed lawmakers on the negative impacts online gaming could have on revenue and jobs at casinos. 
Brianne Doura-Schawohl, founder and CEO of Doura-Schawohl Consulting, also outlined some of the public health and economic concerns tied to online gambling, including higher rates of suicides, substance abuse, and drops in average credit scores, and rising credit card delinquency. 
According to her presentation, individuals with a gambling disorder are 15 times more likely to die by suicide than the general population.
Studies have also found that more teenagers are gambling online through the use of loot boxes in video games.
“I think that the federal government may never come to the table when it comes to addressing the public health issue of problem gambling,” Doura-Schawohl said, urging Virginia lawmakers to take action before considering an expansion of the gambling market.
“There’s too many things that need to be resolved before — if I were in your shoes — I would consider doing this,” she said.
During the last General Assembly Session, lawmakers considered legislation to legalize internet gaming in Virginia. Those proposals ultimately failed to advance out of either chamber, and legislators opted instead to send the issue for further study.
iGaming is currently legal in eight states and available to roughly 14% of the U.S. population, Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, said Tuesday. He added that the industry could generate an estimated $5.3 billion in new taxable revenue during its first five years.
Senate Bill 827, introduced by Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, would have authorized the Virginia Lottery Board to issue licenses to casino operators for online gaming. Like other proposals, the measure was left in committee to allow for additional study.
The subcommittee plans to hold two more meetings before the next General Assembly session begins in January. The next meeting, tentatively scheduled for September, will focus on existing and planned casinos. The final meeting will address broader gaming issues, such as skill games and charitable gaming, all ahead of the 2026 session.
Virginia one step closer to creating single gaming agency

Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania, committee chair, said gambling enforcement remains one of his top priorities. That effort, he stressed, begins with creating the Virginia Gaming Control Agency to regulate the industry.
“We need to get the VGC set up like yesterday and start enforcing the law so we can get a handle on some of these things,” Reeves said. “Personally, I’m not passing any other bills until you all help us get the VGC done, because we’re just creating more mess and every year that we don’t get it passed, creates more and more chaos.”
Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, the committee’s vice chair, echoed Reeves’ concerns.
“Gaming can continue to be a powerful engine for jobs, revenue and community investment, but it’s got to be managed responsibly without streamlined oversight,” Krizek said. 
“The risks multiply predatory practices, inconsistent rules, heightened risk for problem gambling and loss of public trust. The Virginia Gaming Commission is a step we need to preserve the good, address those challenges, and build a fair, accountable and prosperous gaming industry for everyone in the commonwealth.”

After failed attempts in the legislature by lawmakers, the Virginia Board of Health held a special meeting this week and granted a petition to begin drafting regulations — a process that could take two years. 
The board has authority to issue regulations affecting public health. In this case, cisgender student athletes petitioned the board, citing frustrations with losing to transgender women, discomfort sharing facilities, and concerns about safety when people assigned male at birth compete with those assigned female. 
The regulatory process is expected to take 18 to 24 months, a Virginia Department of Health staffer told The Mercury Monday. The next steps include publishing a Notice of Intended Regulatory Action and holding additional public comment periods. 
The petition heard on Monday had already undergone a public comment period in which  54% of respondents opposed the request, while 45% supported it. Three comments were ruled “irrelevant,” and 11 were deemed “unclear.”
While the new rules could take years to implement, Equality Virginia Director Narissa Rahaman emphasized that transgender people have already been under scrutiny. 
“Over the last four years,” she said, referring to Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration, “Virginians and the General Assembly have made it clear that targeting transgender athletes is unfair and unpopular.”
In a statement released after Monday’s vote, Rahaman added: “Virginia’s women and girls face pressing real public health challenges, including HIV prevention and treatment, domestic violence, maternal health, and poverty. Addressing those challenges with urgency and intention should be the priority of the board. Instead of prioritizing the health of Virginians, the State Board of Health voted to prioritize politics.”
The petition stemmed from three college swimmers: former Virginia Tech Olympian Réka György and current Roanoke College swimmers Lily Mullins and Carter Satterfield. 
Mullins said that she and her teammates felt “unsupported, vulnerable and unsafe” after raising concerns with  coaches and administrators about a transgender woman joining the team. 
György, who placed 17th in a 2022 competition, missed qualifying for the next round by one spot. She lost to Lia Thomas, who placed first and became the first openly transgender athlete to win a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)  Division I championship. The University of Pennsylvania, Thomas’ former school, has since revoked her records and now bans transgender athletes.
Earlier this year, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, and Youngkin hosted former athlete Riley Gaines to celebrate a similar legislative push. 
Gaines, who tied for fifth place with Thomas in a competition in 2022, has become a national figurehead in efforts to ban transgender student athletes. Virginia’s latest legislative attempt earlier this year failed. Satterfield is also listed as a plaintiff in Gaines’ federal lawsuit against the NCAA.

Transgender students and student athletes in recent years have faced scrutiny from state laws to  local policies to federal courts. 
Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court decided it will hear two cases over state bans on  transgender athletes this year.  Justices will consider whether such laws violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment or Title IX, the federal statute prohibiting sex discrimination in education. 
The conservative-leaning court has already dealt setbacks to LGBTQ+ protections. In 2024, it struck down then- President Joe Biden’s attempt to use Title IX to protect LGBTQ+ students and upheld state bans on gender-affirming care for minors.
Meanwhile, last summer a Hanover County transgender teen was blocked from joining a sports team despite making it through tryouts. A federal judge later ruled the school system had likely violated both Title IX and the Equal Protections Clause — the same issues now before the Supreme Court. The American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia represented the student, while other ACLU branches are handling the cases bound for SCOTUS.
“Categorically excluding kids from school sports just because they are transgender will only make our schools less safe and more hurtful places for all youth,” Joshua Block, legal counsel with ACLU’s LGBTQ and HIV Project said in a press release. 
“We believe the lower courts were right to block these discriminatory laws, and we will continue to defend the freedom of all kids to play.”

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)Summer heat is bearing down on U.S. prisons, where temperatures in uncooled cells can climb well into the triple digits.
Facing growing pressure from advocacy groups, lawsuits and climate projections that show hotter days ahead, some state prison systems are moving to install air conditioning and expand cooling measures — though many facilities remain years away from significant upgrades.
But in other states, such efforts have stalled or failed. That may lead to more lawsuits in the future, experts say, even as judges may raise the bar for such cases.
An emphasis on being “tough on crime” and prioritizing other public safety measures may have contributed to less attention on prison conditions in some states. In others, slowing revenue growth and pressure to rein in corrections spending could be making new investments a harder sell.
At least two states this year, Virginia and Texas, considered legislation addressing excessive heat in prisons but neither measure became law. The Texas bill would have required the state Department of Criminal Justice to purchase and install climate control systems in all of its facilities by the end of 2032. About two-thirds of the state’s correctional facilities have only partial or no air conditioning.
The measure passed the House but did not advance in the Senate before the legislature adjourned in June.
In Virginia, lawmakers approved a bill that would have required the state corrections department to install heat and air conditioning in its prisons and to ensure cell temperatures not exceed 80 degrees. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed it, citing the cost of installation and operational burdens. Youngkin also wrote that existing state corrections data “does not substantiate the claims of extreme temperatures or health risks.”
But in Delaware, the fiscal year 2026 capital budget approved last month includes $2 million in funding to install air conditioning at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center.
These changes mark the latest actions in a long-running debate over how correctional systems respond to rising summer temperatures — an issue that affects both incarcerated people and staff. Some of the policy debates and facility updates this year follow years of advocacy and litigation over the health, safety and operational challenges posed by heat in correctional settings.
Stifling prison heat used to be just a Southern problem. Not anymore.

The problem of excessive heat in prisons has persisted for decades and has unfolded alongside other challenges, including chronic understaffing and overcrowding. In some cases, these problems have led to extended facility lockdowns, even during the summer months.
“There are people working in prisons and they have the right to work in climates that are comfortable,” said Nancy La Vigne, a criminal justice researcher and dean of the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University. “When they’re not, there’s retention issues, and it’s hard to replace staff. And when you don’t replace staff, then you have challenges in maintaining the safety and security of the facility.”
In New York, for example, correctional officers staged a three-week strike earlier this year and many didn’t return to work. Some facilities now are operating with 30%-60% fewer guards than needed, resulting in some incarcerated people getting only an hour or two outside of their cells each day.
A 2023 study published in the peer-reviewed PLOS One journal found that mortality in state and private prisons rose during periods of extreme heat, with deaths increasing 3.5% on extreme heat days and up to 7.4% during three-day heat waves. Between 2001 and 2019, nearly 13,000 people died in prison during the summer months, almost half of them in the South, though the study did not determine how many of those deaths were directly attributable to heat.
Climate change is fueling longer, more intense periods of extreme heat. Exposure to extreme heat can worsen conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and asthma, and has also been linked to worsening mental health and higher suicide rates among incarcerated people.
“Average temperatures are rising, and you’re going to have more and more states around the country where incarcerated people are held in conditions that are not livable because they’re too hot,” said Sharon Dolovich, a law professor and director of the Prison Law and Policy Program at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Some upgrades
At least 44 states lack universal air conditioning within their prison facilities, even in regions known for sweltering summer temperatures, according to a 2022 USA Today analysis. A recent Reuters investigation also found that nearly half of state prisons across 29 states have partial or no air conditioning in housing units.
But some states are investing millions to update their prison facilities.
In North Carolina, corrections officials are working toward their goal of installing air conditioning in all 54 state prisons by 2026. To date, 33 facilities are fully air-conditioned, 17 are partially air-conditioned, and four have no air conditioning, according to its dashboard.
In California, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, which operates 31 adult prisons, has spent $246 million in the past five years on cooling improvements at five prisons, according to a department spokesperson.
Lawmakers this year also approved funding for the Air Cooling Pilot Program at three facilities, with $17.6 million allocated for fiscal years 2025-26 and $20 million for fiscal years 2026-27. It will evaluate the effectiveness of two alternatives prior to a statewide plan to address high indoor temperatures across the California prison system.
State prisons turn to extended lockdowns amid staffing shortages, overcrowding

The Texas Department of Criminal Justice, as of Aug. 1, is building 12,827 “cool beds,” or prison cells in air-conditioned units, and is in the process of procuring an additional 7,162, according to its dashboard.
Texas is one of the states most closely associated with heat-related deaths in prison. A 2022 study estimated that, on average, 14 deaths per year in Texas prisons are associated with heat. And a Texas Tribune analysis found that at least 41 incarcerated people died during a record-breaking heat wave in 2023.
In March, a federal judge ruled the extreme heat in Texas prisons is “plainly unconstitutional,” but declined to order immediate air conditioning, saying the work could not be completed within the court order’s 90-day window and temporary systems might delay a permanent fix.
‘More miserable’
Sweltering summer heat can turn prisons into pressure cookers. People inside already may have health conditions, limited access to cooling, or take medications that make it harder for their bodies to handle the heat. And research suggests that high temperatures can heighten irritability and aggression, sometimes fueling more conflicts between incarcerated people or with staff.
“It makes you more miserable. … If you to the point of even thinking about suicide, that’s just going to add to it,” said Ronald McKeithen, who spent 37 years incarcerated in Alabama prisons and is now the director of second chances at the Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice. McKeithen recalls feeling “on edge” due to tension among other incarcerated people on hot days.
At the Oshkosh Correctional Institution in Wisconsin, Devin Skrzypchak said the heat worsens his bladder condition, and he often can’t get the incontinence briefs he needs. The heat forces him to drink more water, and on days when ice isn’t available, he’s left drenched in sweat.
“At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating,” Skrzypchak wrote in a message to Stateline through the facility’s messaging platform.











At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating.


– Devin Skrzypchak, who is incarcerated at Oshkosh Correctional Institution in Wisconsin



D’Angelo Lee Komanekin — who has spent about 25 years in and out of different Wisconsin corrections facilities — said prison architecture plays a major role in why temperatures inside climb so high.
“The planet is getting hotter and hotter,” said Komanekin, who relies on a small plastic fan to stay cool. Komanekin also is incarcerated at the Oshkosh Correctional Institution. “They’re doing nothing about the architecture. Some institutions’ windows open, some don’t, but most of the doors have steel doors with trap doors.”
Older prison designs that rely heavily on steel and concrete building materials often trap heat, making it difficult to keep temperatures down in the summer. Aging facilities also are less likely to be equipped for the installation of central air conditioning.
Some state prison systems, including Alabama’s and Wisconsin’s, are adding air-conditioning or air-tempering systems to new prison construction and major renovation projects.
Future legal battles
Legal experts say the issue of excessive heat in prisons is likely to become more pressing as climate change drives longer and hotter summers.
Extreme heat in correctional facilities has already been the subject of litigation in dozens of states, with plaintiffs arguing that high temperatures constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Court rulings in these cases have varied, but some experts say even more lawsuits are likely if facilities do not adapt.
“The conditions are going to worsen. [Incarcerated people are] going to be looking for every possible avenue for assistance they can,” Dolovich, the UCLA law professor, told Stateline.
Prison abuse, deaths and escapes prompt calls for more oversight

One of the latest cases comes from Missouri, where the nonprofit law firm MacArthur Justice Center filed a class-action lawsuit in May on behalf of six incarcerated people at Algoa Correctional Center.
The lawsuit alleges that the conditions violate their constitutional rights under the Eighth Amendment. It seeks to require the Missouri Department of Corrections to work with experts to develop a heat mitigation plan that keeps housing unit temperatures between 65 and 85 degrees. If the department cannot meet that standard, the plaintiffs are asking for the release of three of the incarcerated people who have less than a year remaining on their sentences.
Lawsuits such as the Missouri case often focus on claims that extreme heat worsens existing medical problems. To proceed, they must meet two legal requirements: proving the heat poses a serious health or safety risk, and showing prison officials knew about the danger but failed to address it, according to Dolovich, whose work has focused on the Eighth Amendment and prison conditions.
Courts may also raise the bar for proving such claims if judges echo decisions in cases with similar Eight Amendment arguments related to the death penalty and homelessness, Dolovich said. Judges have shifted, she said, toward a “superadding terror, pain and disgrace” standard under the Eighth Amendment — a higher threshold requiring proof that conditions were created with the intent to cause unnecessary suffering.
Dolovich added that some recent court decisions have provided only narrow remedies, such as ordering ice and fans instead of installing air conditioning.
“Prison officials have a moral and a constitutional responsibility to respond to changing conditions. In this case, it means air conditioning. … Anything less than that, to me, is indefensible.” she said.

KENNETT, MO. — Nestled in Missouri’s Bootheel is the small town of Kennett, the Dunklin County seat. With just over 10,000 residents, it’s a close-knit community where good-natured teasing is a common show of affection.
Once a sprawling swampland, it has since been transformed into an expanse of flat, fertile fields where agriculture stands as the backbone of the region’s economy.
Kennett’s houses don’t get much taller than one story, and as visitors stroll down the main street, they’re welcomed by a mix of restaurants, boutiques and a cozy hair salon. These buildings are dwarfed in size by a silent, boarded-up hospital, its vacancy a remembrance of what the community has lost.
  Unyielding is a University of Missouri School of Journalism project for Investigate Midwest.
It’s the kind of community where if something tragic happens, everyone finds out.
Bobbi Bibbs found this out the hard way. She discovered she had cancer in her colon in December 2023, which then metastasized to her liver, making it a stage four diagnosis.
Bibbs isn’t alone. Dunklin County is among the 10 counties with the highest rates of that type of cancer in the state. This isn’t just a statistic, Bibbs said she can see it and almost can’t fathom it.

“There are so many (cases) where we are from,” Bibbs said. “Like, it’s got to be coming from somewhere.”
Bibbs is surrounded by people who understand her struggles, many of whom work in the agriculture industry. In Dunklin County, there are hundreds of thousands of acres of crops — and most of that land is blanketed by pesticides.
Estimates suggest that thousands of kilograms of pesticides are sprayed over Missouri cropland each year. In some places, wastewater sludge containing “forever chemicals” — per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances — is applied on farmland as fertilizer.
Multiple scientific studies have explored a connection between pesticide use and cancer,  pointing to a silent public health crisis hitting rural communities particularly hard.
The University of Missouri, in partnership with Investigate Midwest, conducted a county-by-county analysis of cancer rates and pesticide use, using the most recently available data for pesticides that are repeatedly cited in research as likely to be associated with cancer risk.
The six counties with the highest use of these pesticides per square mile are all located in the Bootheel, including Dunklin. Four of those counties are in the top 15 for overall cancer rates in Missouri. All counties with the highest rates of cancer are rural.
So in Kennett, there are high rates of chemical usage, high rates of cancer — and the nearest trauma center in the state is more than an hour and a half away.
In other words, it’s a typical rural town in Missouri.

While Missouri has its share of rolling hills covered in trees and wild foliage, much of the land is well developed to suit the needs of farmers and their crops. There are about 27 million acres of Missouri farmland being cultivated and nearly 88,000 farms, according to the Rural Farm & Finance Policy Analysis Center.
The biggest business in the state is agriculture, employing about 460,000 statewide, according to the Missouri Department of Agriculture. Soybeans, corn and wheat are some of the crops that color most of the state’s landscape.
Farming is a dangerous job that requires a good deal of heavy equipment and specialized tools. Those tools include chemicals.
Isain Zapata is a data scientist who researched the relationship between pesticides and the incidence of cancer. He looked at the complex mixtures of pesticides tailored to specific crops that are sprayed in different regions.
“When we look at those pesticides, it’s not just one — it’s all a cocktail,” Zapata said. “It’s the whole rainbow of different colors.”
He found that these colorful combinations are strongly linked to certain cancer rates across the nation.
“Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and leukemias are very intimately associated with pesticide use,” Zapata said. “But we also saw that the overall pesticide use has an effect on all the other non-obvious cancers.”
Other research shows an association between certain pesticides and an increased risk of brain, prostate, breast, kidney and colon cancers.
Pesticides are a classification of substances used to protect crops. This includes killing weeds, insects or even strengthening wood to prevent pests from harming the plant. Farmers typically apply pesticides to crops using methods such as aerial spraying or ground-based equipment.
Serious risks are posed by pesticides because they can harm both human health and the environment. Exposure may lead to short-term or long-term health problems, while also contaminating soil and water, which may disrupt ecosystems and affect wildlife.
But pesticides do what they do best. Zapata emphasizes that without pesticides, agriculture-based economies and the communities tied to them would suffer.
“I am not in favor or against pesticides,” Zapata said. “I know we need them. I don’t like them, but I know why they have to be there.”
He said rural agricultural areas are home to an intense combination of factors that multiply the risk level.
Farmers are under pressure to maintain or increase their productivity, and that comes at the cost of using compounds that carry health risks, Zapata said. Rural areas are often underserved by health care facilities, meaning there are often too few health providers and resources in those areas to monitor and manage the added risk of using pesticides.
“It’s just the perfect storm,” Zapata said. “You combine several factors (heavy pesticide usage, poor regulation and monitoring, socioeconomic disparities), you’ve made it worse.”
The million-acre highway
Mike Milam is a local expert in pesticide application. Based in Kennett, he is a field specialist in agriculture and environment for MU Extension, serving Dunklin, New Madrid and Pemiscot counties.
“I’ve had people tell me, especially the ones who don’t like chemicals at all (that) our bodies weren’t designed to breathe these chemicals,” Milam said. “And they’re right about that.”
The herbicide Roundup is the target of thousands of lawsuits claiming it causes cancer, putting it in the spotlight. Milam listed other chemicals that have caused concern, including paraquat, vydate and dicamba.
Farmers and the workers hired to harvest crops frequently interact with chemicals. From mixing to pouring to spraying, they are there for all of it. They also encounter other farmers’ chemicals when a substance sprayed in one area drifts somewhere it was not intended to be.
“I have known a situation (where) people out in the fields got sprayed, or they sprayed next to them, and then it drifted over. And things like that,” Milam said. “Matter of fact, when I was in graduate school, I was in a field down in Louisiana, and they were spraying right next to us. We actually had to leave the field.”
Direct drift occurs when an applicator applies a pesticide and the wind blows it elsewhere, making monitoring weather conditions an integral part of the process. The stronger the wind, the stronger the potential is for drift.
That said, farmers have a limited window to seed and fertilize their fields during planting season. Fluctuating weather conditions can make this even more difficult. This spring alone, the Bootheel faced tornadoes, dust storms and historic flooding, all of which have the potential to hinder field work.
“We go out here, we can plant a crop, it looks beautiful, a flood wipes it out, and we gotta start back over,” said Sen. Jason Bean, R-Holcomb, a fifth-generation Bootheel farmer.
Milam said that some farmers end up spraying their crops when conditions aren’t ideal.
“The farmers aren’t paying attention or just decide to go ahead and (apply) anyway because they need to get it done,” Milam said. “They are under a lot of stress, they’re trying to get the crops in.”
Jason Mayer, a fourth-generation Bootheel farmer and one of the directors for the Missouri Soybean Association, believes that, nine times out of 10, farmers are doing the right thing. In his mind, it is the “bad actors” going against best practices. Bean compares this to speeding on the highway.
In his analogy, like drivers on the road minding the speed limit, most farmers follow the rules. Just as there will always be that driver blowing past everyone else in the left lane, there will be farmers who break the rules.
Agricultural regulators — such as the Missouri Department of Agriculture or EPA — serve as the cop on the side of the road in the metaphor. They step in when misuse is suspected. Environmental Protection Agency inspectors can show up at any time and ask to see a farmer’s records, Milam said.
With millions of acres of farmland in Missouri, that’s one big highway to watch. So if agencies don’t catch someone breaking the rules, it can fall to local farmers to report their neighbors to the state pesticide control office.
Bean emphasized that proper pesticide application isn’t just about compliance, it’s also in the farmer’s best interest. Misuse wastes costly chemicals, reduces crop effectiveness and decreases consumer trust in locally grown produce.
“I’d say we’re great stewards of the land,” Bean said. “We’re going to continue that, because in the big picture, farmers want to produce for the world the safest, abundant product.”
Milam said the key is to use the chemicals appropriately to minimize exposure. He said wearing personal protective equipment during application is a best practice. So doing things like wearing long pants, long-sleeved shirts, masks and goggles is essential for safe use.
Bean does not believe pesticides cause or increase the risk of cancer. Mayer echoes this sentiment, emphasizing his lifelong experience around crops and chemical applications.
“I’m 42 — knock on wood — today,” Mayer said. “I’m still relatively young, perfectly healthy, and I’ve been on the farm since I was 14.”
Waiting on a waiting room
Striking up a conversation about health care in Kennett is bound to lead to one topic: the hospital.
Kennett doesn’t have one anymore; Twin Rivers Regional Medical Center closed its doors in 2018.
For quick stitch-ups or infection treatment, St. Bernards Urgent Care is open every day. It closes at 7:30 p.m., meaning that Kennett residents have to go elsewhere for their nighttime care.
There are various options in nearby counties, or even in neighboring states, but if someone needs emergency care, for example, it’s a trek.
  The building formerly known as the Twin Rivers Regional Medical Center is seen vacant with its windows boarded up on May 21, 2025, at 1st Street in Kennett, Missouri. After the hospital shut down in 2018, the city of Kennett has been without an around-the-clock healthcare option. (Photo by Michael Baniewicz for Investigate Midwest)
While there’s a Mercy Hospital located in nearby Dexter with a rotation of specialty doctors, the closest Missouri trauma center to Kennett is in Cape Girardeau, about an hour and a half away.
“(If) I have a heart attack at eight o’clock at night, or stroke, and if (the urgent care) was still open, they could give me that little fancy pill and help get me to the hospital to help,” said Cheryl Bruce, the executive director of the Dunklin/Stoddard Caring Council, an organization based in Kennett offering an assistive services program to Dunklin County residents with cancer.
Kennett’s old hospital building is still standing on the town’s main drag. The windows are boarded up, and walking through the halls requires ducking wires and tiptoeing over glass shards.
The current owner is in a zoning battle to turn the hospital into something. They haven’t been able to find buyers yet because they need various approvals from the city to do any work to make the building sellable.
Kennett isn’t alone in facing minimal health care access. Since 2014, 21 hospitals have shut down statewide, including 12 in rural areas, according to the Missouri Hospital Association.
Additionally, the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform’s 2023-2024 report found 26 rural hospitals in Missouri are at risk of closure due to financial strain — nine of them are at an “immediate risk.”
The Twin Rivers CEO said in a 2018 statement that the hospital’s closure was part of an effort to consolidate operations with Poplar Bluff Regional Medical Center, “as health care delivery evolves and medical innovation makes inpatient services less needed,.”  KFVS12 TV reported at the time.
It was a palpable loss for Kennett — people miss the hospital, Bruce said.
“When the hospital closed, all anybody has ever talked about is, ‘Are we going to get another one?’ ” Bruce said.
From 2020 to 2024, the Caring Council’s cancer assistive services program spent $22,650 helping over 400 people with transportation. For cancer care, folks in Kennett often travel an hour to Jonesboro, Arkansas, or an hour-and-a-half to Cape Girardeau in Missouri. Whatever kind of cancer care you need, Bruce said, you’ve got to drive to get it.
The lack of health care providers also means early detection of medical issues, including cancer, can be harder to get.
Some health care transportation programs are available in rural areas, but Bruce said she sees a need in her community for more robust services.
“I’m not asking for a bus system like in St. Louis or Kansas City or Jeff City,” Bruce said. “I’m just asking for access to care, whatever that means.”
Sprayed on all sides
Wherever you go in Kennett, there will be someone who’s called it home their whole life. Kennett’s City Clerk Jan McElwrath is one of those people. Aside from a brief stint at the University of Missouri, she’s spent nearly all of her 68 years in town.
She came back for a classic reason: love. She got married, raised a family and built a life rooted in the same streets where she grew up.
Over the decades, she’s seen businesses open and close, celebrated countless community milestones and weathered natural disasters. Through it all, McElwrath has observed one constant: despite differing beliefs and opinions, the people of Kennett always find a way to come together.
“Our strength is our people, hands down,” she said.
This is especially important when considering the unique challenges of rural living.
An index created by the CDC shows that Dunklin is the county in Missouri least prepared to deal with economic or environmental challenges. According to Feeding America, over 20% of Dunklin County is food insecure, despite the fact that the region is covered in farmland. Milam said that this is largely because the farms in Dunklin are agronomic, which is when crops aren’t always grown for direct human consumption.
“It would help a lot of people if they had fresh vegetables,” he explained.
As manufacturing jobs moved out of many places in the Bootheel, Kennett felt the economic sting. Though Cim-Tek Filtration’s arrival two years ago brought back some manufacturing jobs, Kennett lost its Emerson Motor Company plant in 2006.
One industry that remains is agriculture.
The land is dotted with cotton, soybean and rice row crop operations. McElwrath calls the rows of cotton ready for picking “southern snow,” but to get that snow, farmers usually have to give plants a nudge with defoliants.
Defoliation is a natural process, though it can be artificially induced when chemicals are applied to the plants to get them to open up, making the white cotton easier to harvest.
McElwrath said it’s hard to notice farmers defoliating at first. But then, suddenly, your sinuses sting, your eyes burn, maybe a headache creeps in. It always seems to hit around the same time every year, right when the county fair is going on — with the dust, the dry soil, the demolition derby — everything blending together.
It’s not just that the defoliants make things happen quicker; they help make the cotton a higher grade — that means there is less debris affecting the final product. The grade determines the value.
Many residents of Kennett recognize the need for defoliants and other agricultural chemicals. For some of them, that’s what puts food on the table. But then the time of year creeps around again, and they all experience that familiar sensation.
“We’re surrounded by agriculture,” McElwrath said. “We recognize (chemicals) as a risk, but our economy here is very dependent on agriculture.”

Two Democrats want to prohibit Ohio lawmakers from accepting free or reduced-price tickets for professional sporting events. The proposal comes on the heels of state lawmakers committing $600 million to a new multi-billion-dollar stadium for the Cleveland Browns. The owners of the team, Jimmy and Dee Haslam, are major political campaign donors.
State Reps. Sean Brennan, D-Parma, and Karen Brownlee, D-Symmes Township, argue it’s a conflict of interest for public officials to accept tickets for professional sporting events. The funding mechanism lawmakers established for the Browns is meant to help pay for other sports and cultural facilities in the future. Brennan and Brownlee’s measure creates an explicit prohibition on accepting tickets for the NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB or MLS.
But that doesn’t mean it’s OK to tempt lawmakers with free tickets to a WNBA game or a NASCAR race. Ohio’s ethics law seems broad enough to cover any professional sports ticket already. State law prohibits lawmakers from accepting “anything of value” from an “improper” source.

Definitions
The Ohio Ethics Commission has weighed in where to draw line with gifts repeatedly. A little more than 30 years ago, the commission issued an opinion stating explicitly that city council members couldn’t accept season tickets from professional teams playing in the city.
A Cleveland Plain Dealer story at the time detailed how the Browns and then-Indians had been giving season tickets to all 21 members of the council for roughly 30 years. The Cleveland Cavaliers, which had recently moved from nearby Richfield, gave out several tickets as well.
At the heart of Ohio’s Ethics law are two questions: what’s it worth? And where’d you get it?
Although the statute applies to “anything” of value, the commission states accepting nominal items — a cup of coffee, box of popcorn, etc. — isn’t prohibited. That said, the commission warns that over time several nominal gifts could add up to a substantial one.
In 2001, the Ohio Ethics Commission issued another opinion on whether a public official could accept a free golf outing from an individual that does business with that official’s agency. Again, no.
The commission quoted yet another opinion, this time from the Ohio Supreme Court’s Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline.
“The value of a round of golf or a ticket to a sports event in most instances would be ‘substantial,’ not de minimis,” the commission stated.
The other consideration is a gifts’ source. If the giver is someone doing business with, regulated by, or interested in matters going before the receiver, they would be considered an “improper” source under state law.
Brennan and Brownlee’s bill
As an American government teacher, Brennan worries about the message it could send for lawmakers to show up at games after signing off on the seed money for a franchise’s new stadium.
“I also used to work at the Browns stadium and at the Progressive Field for a season or two,” Brennan said. “And you know, when you see an elected official come in, it always made you wonder, did they pay like everybody else to get in, or did they get a reduced price to get in?”
“I just think it’s a clear ethical violation,” he added. “I think it compromises the credibility of the institution.”
Brownlee said their intent is to cover all professional sports even if a handful of leagues aren’t reflected in the current definition.
“Our thinking was that, especially based on what has happened this year with the budget, that it was imperative to get something clean out very quickly in response to (the) special interest of professional sports,” she explained.
The Haslams gave big donations to Ohio lawmakers, who are now deciding the fate of Browns stadium

Both lawmakers acknowledged the similarities between tickets to some college events and professional ones, but they decided not to go down that road. Even if universities have business before lawmakers, Brownlee said it’s difficult to know where to draw the line. Say lawmakers signed off on funding for a new tennis stadium, she offered. Is an invitation to the inaugural match more like free tickets or more like a ribbon cutting?
Brennan thinks an explicit prohibition on pro sports tickets will clarify questions about which sources are ‘improper.’ He explained some lawmakers already accept tickets and those gifts are reflected on their annual ethics forms.
A review of recent filings from leaders of both parties in the Ohio House and Senate showed only one lawmaker accepting any tickets at all. In December last year House Speaker Matt Huffman accepted two tickets valued at $826 to the Ohio State University v. Tennessee football game in the College Football Playoff. Because it was a college game, Brennan and Brownlee’s measure would have no impact on the gift’s status under state ethics law.
Ohio Capital Journal reached out to Speaker Huffman for comment, but his office did not respond.
“Even if it’s not a huge problem now,” Brennan said, “it’s a way of nipping it in the bud going forward. And again, doing a little part of bolstering public trust in the institution and their elected officials.”

(Photo by Frederick Bass/Getty Images)New Hampshire is not adequately funding its public schools, a superior court judge held Monday — the latest in a string of similar rulings in recent years amid a pair of high-profile lawsuits.
Ruling in the case of Rand v. State of New Hampshire, Rockingham County Superior Court Judge David Ruoff found that local property-tax payers are bearing the burden of paying for much of their local public school budgets due to underfunding by the state, which he called unconstitutional. 
But unlike his sweeping decision in November 2023 in a separate lawsuit, this time Ruoff did not order state lawmakers to change the adequacy formula, instead declaring the current funding unconstitutional and allowing the Legislature to respond. 
The decision came six weeks after the state Supreme Court found that state school funding is inadequate in a separate case, Contoocook Valley School District v. State of New Hampshire, known as the “ConVal” case. In that decision, a 3-2 majority on the court — which featured two substitute justices — stopped short of directing the Legislature to take a specific action. 
There are currently two lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the way New Hampshire funds its schools and the fiscal differences from district to district. The first, ConVal, was brought by school districts that argued the current state funding system is preventing them from running their schools without local taxpayer contributions, a violation of the state’s constitutional duty.
The second lawsuit, Rand, was brought by taxpayers who claimed that the differences in property taxes between wealthy and poor towns is exacerbated by the lack of adequate state funding provided to public schools — and that the result is that taxpayers in “property-poor” towns face unconstitutionally high taxes.
Ruling in Rand, Ruoff agreed with the plaintiffs. 
“The Court concludes that the plaintiffs have successfully proven that the total amount of current Adequacy Funding and the current amount of special education differentiated aid, as provided for in RSA 198:40-a, are constitutionally insufficient,” Ruoff wrote. “The plaintiffs have further proven that school districts must rely in part on local property tax revenues, assessed at varying rates, to bridge these funding gaps.”
Ruoff’s ruling Monday is the first time he has ruled comprehensively on the Rand case, which was filed two years after ConVal, and comes after the case received a full trial with expert testimony. 
It was not immediately clear whether the state would appeal Ruoff’s Rand ruling up to the state Supreme Court, nor whether the Supreme Court would take on the case, given its decision in the ConVal case in June.
A ‘mock budget’
While the ConVal case centered on whether school superintendents are able to sufficiently run public school districts with the state’s per-pupil adequacy payments, the Rand case focused on the effect on local taxpayers.
Plaintiff Steven Rand, a Plymouth resident, argued that the lack of adequate state education funding means that he and other Plymouth residents must pay disproportionate shares of property taxes in order to properly pay for their local schools.
Lawyers for Rand noted that absent sufficient state aid, the local property-tax burden is larger for residents living in towns with lower property values. Those towns have less wealth to tax, and thus must tax residents at higher rates, the plaintiffs said. The plaintiffs argued those higher rates, in turn, violate the findings in the landmark 1997 Claremont II Supreme Court ruling, which held that the state must provide an adequate education and that any tax to do so must be uniform. 
As in the ConVal lawsuit, lawyers for the state have pushed back at this characterization, arguing that the state does provide constitutionally adequate funding. The state has disputed that some of the expenses of school districts, such as facilities costs, count toward the “adequate” definition of education required in state law. And the state has argued that there is a state tax — the statewide education property tax, or SWEPT — that is applied uniformly to residents across the state to help pay for education. 
But plaintiffs in the Rand lawsuit say in practice, towns set vastly different local property tax rates out of necessity in order to allow schools to meet the minimum standards for adequacy, leaving local taxpayers without much choice. 
To make this point at the trial, the plaintiffs brought forward Dr. John Freeman, a former superintendent in Barrington, Pittsfield, and Strafford. Freeman used Pittsfield’s budget numbers to attempt to demonstrate that the state’s per-pupil adequacy funding to the district would not have been sufficient on its own to fund an adequate education.
To do this, Freeman began with the $2.7 million that the district received in the 2018-2019 school year. He then attempted to draw up a “mock budget,” in which he cut all services that could be seen as unnecessary to meet the state’s definition of an adequate education. But even after doing so, Freeman was not able to craft a budget that would fund the district, due in part to teacher salary costs, special education costs, and other expenses such as transportation, heat, electricity, custodial services, nursing services, and administrators. And he testified that even after doubling that mock budget to $5.3 million, he could not do so.
Lawyers for the Department of Justice sought to dismiss Freeman’s testimony, introducing their own witness, Jay Greene, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, who argued that Freeman’s choices of what to include and not include in the mock budget were arbitrary, and argued he should have sought larger class sizes and looked to schools in developing countries in order to bring costs down further.
But Ruoff found Freeman’s exercise useful, and he cited the testimony of the plaintiffs’ other experts to conclude that the state’s funding formula does not provide enough to fund an adequate education, and that the remainder must be made up by local taxes. Those experts included Corinne Cascadden, a former Berlin superintendent and Democratic state representative, who testified that when she was superintendent, even after putting together a “bare bones” budget, the district still relied on local property taxes to keep its schools operating.
A mixed ruling
In his ruling, Ruoff agreed with plaintiffs that the school funding model is unconstitutionally low. But he went further, holding that the “differentiated aid” — the specific per-pupil amounts sent by the state for students receiving free or reduced-price lunches, students with disabilities, and English language learner students — are also inadequate.
“In summary, the plaintiffs have proven a ‘clear and substantial conflict’ between the costs necessary to meet Constitutional Adequacy and current Adequacy Funding and special education differentiated aid funding levels “in all, or virtually all” of New Hampshire’s school districts.
But he said that the plaintiffs had not adequately proved one of their requests: that the court should declare that differentiated aid for children in poverty is not duplicative of aid for children who qualify for special education. Ruling that way could have guaranteed the state would provide more funding, but Ruoff wrote that there had not been enough evidence to suggest that students necessarily require both types of funding. 
And he denied the plaintiffs’ request that he order the Legislature to cease using the current funding system by April 1, 2026. 
Instead, following similar reasoning in the Supreme Court’s ConVal decision in July, Ruoff wrote that such a timeline was unreasonable and that the extraordinary remedy of the court directing the Legislature is inappropriate. In doing so, Ruoff acknowledged that the Supreme Court’s ConVal ruling overturned his 2023 directive that the Legislature must change the adequacy formula to a minimum of $7,356.01 per student. 
“If the Court’s rulings, as outlined herein, are upheld on appeal or otherwise become final, the Court anticipates that the legislature will work diligently to enact a new school funding scheme that comports with the State’s constitutional obligations,” he wrote. “If, however, the plaintiffs form the belief that the legislature is not acting diligently in this regard, the plaintiffs may file a renewed request for injunctive relief.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kidswriting-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-20 05:56:31.988202
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-20 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Murphy calls for CT ban on private equity ownership in health care,Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/20/chris-murphy-prospect-medical-holdings-private-equity/,"Ahead of a bankruptcy auction to sell Prospect Medical's CT hospitals, Murphy called for CT to ban private equity ownership in health care.","U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., called on Connecticut to take a “hard line” and ban private equity ownership of hospitals, citing deteriorating conditions at three facilities owned by Prospect Medical Holdings, a hospital operator formerly backed by private equity investors. 
In a report the senator’s office published Wednesday, Murphy documented conversations with hospital employees in which they described Prospect’s mismanagement of its three Connecticut hospitals: Rockville General, Manchester Memorial and Waterbury Hospitals. 
“The state will be much better off if we just say private equity companies shouldn’t own our hospitals,” Murphy said in an interview with The Connecticut Mirror. The senator said the report was intended to shed light on what happened with Prospect and prevent similar companies from operating Connecticut’s hospitals in the future.
Murphy’s report comes as the state awaits the launch of an auction to find new ownership for Prospect’s Connecticut facilities — one step in the sprawling company’s months-long bankruptcy proceedings. The sale process will be overseen by U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Northern Texas, where Prospect filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January. 
Prospect purchased the Connecticut hospitals in 2016. Since then, the facilities have faced crumbling infrastructure, supply shortages and other challenges, hospital workers told Murphy.
An operating room assistant at Waterbury Hospital said supplies were so scarce after Prospect’s takeover that patients were “sometimes left on the operating table while staff scrambled.” Nurses and technicians reported personally buying food for patients so they wouldn’t go hungry after Prospect stopped paying vendors, according to the report. 
At Manchester Memorial, Prospect reduced staffing to the point that there was no longer a doctor available on overnight shifts. One physician there said the hospital reached a point where he would not recommend his own family members receive treatment there.
At Rockville General, Prospect cut all care except for the emergency department and outpatient mental health services without applying for required state permission to do so.
Deborah Weymouth, CEO of Prospect’s Connecticut hospitals, said Murphy’s report relied on anecdotes that hadn’t been independently verified.
“The concern surrounding private equity in healthcare does not reflect the quality of care being delivered in our hospitals each day. Senator Murphy’s ‘Share Your Story’ initiative is aimed at advancing policy discussions and reform, not evaluating the clinical performance of individual hospitals,” Weymouth wrote in the statement. “Calling out unconfirmed events to make a political point completely undermines the local constituents and their life’s work.”
The Connecticut Department of Public Health and a court-appointed patient care ombuds regularly conduct visits to the Prospect hospitals to ensure patient safety standards are being met, Weymouth added.
In a July 29 report in the company’s bankruptcy proceedings, a court-appointed patient care ombuds found no supply issues at the Prospect Connecticut hospitals and noted that staffing had “significantly improved.”

Murphy isn’t the only elected official calling for an end to private equity ownership of health care in Connecticut. 
During the most recent state legislative session, lawmakers tried and failed — for the second year in a row — to pass any measures to curb it. Two different proposals were considered.
The first, backed by Gov. Ned Lamont, sought to increase oversight of major health care transactions, like hospital mergers and acquisitions. The other would have taken Murphy’s preferred approach, banning private equity ownership of hospitals outright.
In June, Rep. Cristin McCarthy Vahey, D-Fairfield, co-chair of the Public Health Committee, said part of the issue was that lawmakers failed to thread the two proposals together in time to bring a bill up for a vote. But industry financial interests also played a role, she said.
McCarthy Vahey told Murphy that lobbyists “showed up the second to last day or the last day of session … ten of them, or twelve of them, objecting to the current version of the bill.”
The private equity playbook
Prospect came to Connecticut promising to invest in the hospitals. An employee who worked in the emergency room at Waterbury Hospital told Murphy that the company had promised a whole new ER, and even went so far as to post blueprints in the break room. It never came to be.
As hospital employees faced empty promises and deteriorating conditions, investors profited.
In 2018, Prospect took out a $1.1 billion loan and used the funds to pay its executives and shareholders a $457 million dividend, CBS News reported. To repay the loan, Prospect sold the land and buildings from hospitals it owns in Connecticut, California and Pennsylvania to a real estate investment trust for $1.4 billion, then leased back those hospitals from the trust. 
[RELATED: In 2016, Rockville was a bustling local hospital. Then Prospect took over.]
Sam Lee, the CEO of Prospect from 2007 to 2023, “made out like a bandit,” Murphy stated in the report. Lee owned two homes in Los Angeles worth more than $15 million combined, according to Murphy’s report.
“Sam Lee pillaged three Medicaid hospitals in Connecticut so he could have two mansions 11 minutes apart,” the report stated. 
Despite the damage that’s been done, Murphy said he believes it’s possible to rein in private equity in health care. 
“Private equity still only has a small foothold in the acute care hospital setting,” Murphy said. 
“It’s not too late to make a decision collectively, as a state and as a country, that we don’t want these profit-obsessed, rapacious private equity companies owning our most critical health care facilities,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/MURPHY-PE-HOSPITALS-1024x788.jpg,,,2025-08-20 05:56:31.988202

There is an obvious demographic problem here. The number of Americans who can prospectively serve those in long-term care, should they choose this difficult work, will be vastly outnumbered by those needing long-term care.
Immigration reform is the obvious answer to building our caregiving workforce, but we’re now in an immigration freeze. I have seen the facile suggestion from some immigration opponents that providers only need to increase wages and benefits to attract native-born workers. Yet they have already tried this: Federal data shows that wages for non-supervisory workers in long-term care facilities are up over 36% since the COVID-19 pandemic began five years ago, and yet the overall workforce only recovered its pre-pandemic level in January.
Finally getting up to February 2020 workforce levels hardly meets the needs of a senior population that has grown exponentially since then. We have New Hampshire nursing homes with waiting lists because they cannot responsibly admit residents due to staffing, despite having the bed capacity. And the deportation of those with Temporary Protected Status, such as Haitians, threatens to remove existing workers — perhaps 10% of the caregivers in a single Boston nursing home, for example.
Nationally Medicaid is the payor for 63% of all nursing home residents, and Medicaid took huge cuts in the federal budget bill signed by President Donald Trump. Even if the federal contributions to state Medicaid programs were not being slashed, the ability of states, which must live within balanced budgets, to improve Medicaid funding is not inexhaustible. Within limited means, inevitably a generational conflict will be exacerbated between the need for states to fund basic and higher education and the need to fund care for seniors and those with disabilities.
Currently, data shows that immigrants comprise 32% of the home care workforce, and 21% of the frontline caregivers — nursing assistants — working in nursing homes. By 2032 it is projected that home care will lead all occupations in job growth, with software developers distantly trailing in second place. And native-born Americans are not lining up for this work.
Although my wife works in home health, she receives no pay whatsoever when her clients are hospitalized. And while nursing home work is steady, Medicaid funding is precarious. Validating the warning from Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina that federal budget cuts would result in “tens of billions of dollars in lost funding for North Carolina,” Tillis’ state, in response to those cuts and the inability of state legislators to coalesce around sustainable Medicaid funding, recently announced 10% rate cuts for nursing home care.
These types of uncertainties can make recruitment for long-term care employment tough.
No reasonable person can disagree that we had an immigration enforcement problem. It was a leading issue in the 2024 presidential election, and undocumented immigration was creating a humanitarian crisis in cities and border states.
Yet when the public feels we have protected our borders against unlawful entry I see real room in public opinion for immigration reform. Where in 2024 Gallup found 55% of Americans wanting less immigration, the first such majority since 2005, polling now shows only 30% believe that.
In his last speech as president, Ronald Reagan chose to promote immigration, stating that “[t]hanks to each wave of new arrivals to this land of opportunity, we’re a nation forever young, forever bursting with energy and new ideas, and always on the cutting edge, always leading the world to the next frontier.”
We are a much older nation today than when Reagan gave this speech in 1989. And it is because of that fact, and the needs of our older population, that facilitating lawful immigration is more vital than ever.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/caregivingworkforce-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-20 05:56:31.988202

“No student should be punished or excluded from learning because of the way their hair naturally grows or how they choose to wear it to embrace their culture,” Brent said in a news release. “The C.R.O.W.N. Act affirms that every child in Ohio deserves to show up as their full self, without facing bias or discipline because of their appearance.”
This is the fourth legislative session in a row Brent has introduced the CROWN Act. The bill passed the Ohio House in the last General Assembly, but only had sponsor testimony in the Ohio Senate. 
The bipartisan bill prohibits discrimination against someone’s hair texture and protective hair styles such as braids, locs, twists and afros under Ohio’s Civil Rights Laws.
“This is not just a cultural issue — it’s an educational equity issue,” Brent said in a news release. “Bipartisan support for this bill shows that Ohio is ready to take real steps to create safe, inclusive learning environments for all our students.”
If the bill were to become law, a student would be able to bring a civil action lawsuit to court if their school violates HB 415. 
Twenty-seven states and Washington D.C., have already enacted the CROWN Act. A handful of Ohio cities — including Columbus, Akron, Cleveland Heights, Cleveland Heights, and Cincinnati — have already enacted the CROWN Act at the local level. 
Two-thirds of Black children in majority-white schools have faced race-based hair discrimination, according to a 2021 CROWN Act study. Of those children, 86% reported experiencing hair discrimination by age 12.

Sherrod Brown (Photo from Brown's website.)Former Ohio U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown is back, officially announcing on Monday his long-anticipated campaign to reclaim a seat in Congress. Ohio Republicans are ready to fight.
“I didn’t plan to run for office again, but when I see what’s going on, I know I can do something about it for Ohio,” Brown said in his announcement. “That’s why I’m running for Senate. Because even in these challenging times, I still believe if you stand up for workers, treat people with respect and always fight for Ohio, you can actually make a difference.”
Brown, who lost his seat in 2024 to Sen. Bernie Moreno, is returning to the political spotlight, and the stakes are high.
“Ohio could very well be the tipping point state for the entire Senate,” said Ohio Democratic strategist David Pepper.
Ohio Democratic Party members, including Pepper, say that the senator’s history of supporting workers will be key to his campaign.
“I think Sherrod’s message, which really gets sort of the wherewithal of every Ohio family in a time where people are really struggling and stressed, I think it’s gonna really hit home,” Pepper said.
He will face off against Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Jon Husted, whom President Donald Trump and the rest of the Ohio GOP, like party leader Tony Schroeder, are backing.
“Senator Husted’s devotion to the conservative values that we just got done voting for, for President Trump last November, are going to wind up carrying the day,” Schroeder said.
Husted was appointed to his role by Gov. Mike DeWine this January and has already raised $6 million.
“We just got done telling Senator Brown that we didn’t want him to represent us in D.C. anymore, and we’re about to do it again,” Schroeder said. “He’s carried every bit of the woke agenda in D.C. — the open border was a huge issue in Ohio, absolutely huge, and he voted for all of it.”
Brown’s campaign has already begun targeting Husted for his votes to make massive cuts to Medicaid and SNAP.
Husted’s team sent us this statement from spokesperson Tyson Shepard:
“Sherrod Brown’s recent announcement means Ohioans will face a clear choice in 2026. For 30 years, he has imposed Washington’s problems on Ohio, pushing radical liberal policies that have left a lasting burden on the next generation. Jon Husted offers the opposite approach, applying Ohio’s values and solutions to fix a broken Washington. The challenges our nation faces are the same ones Husted has helped our state confront and overcome, championing the values he learned growing up in northwest Ohio: hard work, personal responsibility, family, faith, freedom and patriotism.”
Even though Brown over-performed Democrats all over the country, including Kamala Harris by eight points in Ohio, he lost by four points to Moreno.
Pepper was asked about Brown’s 2024 loss and how he fixes it for 2026.
“I mean it’s a combination of things,” Pepper said. “if you ever lose, you don’t say, ‘Well, we should do everything the same.’ Of course, the Trump turnout mattered. We clearly have to do better in our cities.”

(Photo by Alex Brandon - Pool/Getty Images)Within a year, Kansans will be voting to elect a new governor and fill a U.S. Senate seat, plus four congressional seats, among elections for other offices. Candidates are already announcing for office, and campaigns are getting underway.
Most Republican candidates are fawning at the feet of President Donald Trump. The groveling of these sycophants may be misplaced as Kansas voters recall the toxic remains of Gov. Sam Brownback’s infamous tax experiment, initiated in 2012 and abandoned in 2017 after five years of unfair taxes, deficit spending, and record debt.
Trump’s “one big, beautiful bill” has followed a path that parallels Brownback’s tax experiment and may experience the same result. After six months in office, available evidence suggests that Trump and the bill may become political liabilities for the grovelers.
Take a look at the parallels.
Both Brownback and Trump chose partisanship rather than seeking common ground, and as a result, political liability falls entirely on Republicans. Democrats were shut out of decisions. Both partisan plans had to be forced through with brazen arm-twisting.
When Brownback’s tax bill stalled over disagreements between the legislative chambers, the governor double-crossed state Senate leadership and signed a flawed bill intended for negotiation. Brownback later stood aside as the Kansas Chamber of Commerce PAC effectively purged state senators of the governor’s party who opposed the policy.
Trump issued multiple threats of primary challenges targeted at resistant Republicans to bring them into line on the “big, beautiful bill.” One senator who balked fell victim to the pressure and announced he would not seek reelection.
Both Brownback’s tax experiment and Trump’s bill were Koch inspired. Brownback sought the advice of Arthur Laffer, a Koch-sponsored tax-cut guru, and shortly thereafter embraced “a real live experiment” to eliminate state income taxes. Koch and a handful of well-heeled donors underwrote a million-dollar campaign through the Chamber PAC to elect legislators willing to do their bidding. Their campaign succeeded.
Americans for Prosperity, a Koch political network, called early for Trump to renew and deepen tax cuts and launched a multimillion-dollar campaign to “turn up the heat” on Congress for quick passage.
Both Brownback’s tax experiment and Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” had common intent: Benefiting the wealthy while costing everyone else. Brownback’s experiment tilted the tax burden from rich to poor; it further exempted 330,000 businesses from the income tax and promised the eventual elimination of the tax.
Trump’s law gives households with incomes in the top 10% a break of $12,000 per year while those in the bottom 10% pay an additional $1,600, according to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office. The top 1% are the prime beneficiaries.
Additionally, both Brownback and Trump coupled tax cuts for the rich with measures undermining aid to the needy. Brownback restricted eligibility for income support and food assistance and blocked the expansion of Medicaid.
The budget office estimates the “big, beautiful bill” will slash more than $1 trillion in spending from Medicaid and food assistance for the next 10 years, primarily by restricting eligibility for aid. Ten to 12 million will be cut from Medicaid, and those qualified for food assistance will fall as well.
Brownback’s experiment created red ink as far as the eye could see, and Trump’s plan will do the same. The Kansas Legislative Research Department projected soaring deficits from Brownback’s tax experiment, amounting to $2.5 billion in the first five years. Even after a sales tax increase, the depletion of state balances and the diversion of highway funds, the state faced a mid-year deficit of $300 million in 2017.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates Trump’s law will increase the deficit to $3.4 trillion over the next 10 years and add $4 trillion to the national debt when interest payments are taken into account.
Even so, the rhetoric of both Brownback and Trump soared: Brownback claimed his experiment would provide “a glide path to zero” for state income taxes. And further: “Look out Texas, here comes Kansas!” Trump declares the “big, beautiful bill” would “make this country into a rocket ship. It’s going to be really great. … We’ll have growth in record numbers.”
After five years of unbalanced budgeting, one-sided taxing, and unprecedented borrowing, Kansas voters had seen enough of Brownback’s experiment. The governor’s approval ratings steadily sank to the lowest in the nation among governors. In 2016, voters ousted Brownback’s legislative allies and elected a bipartisan legislative coalition that expeditiously abandoned the experiment and restored sanity to state finances.
In Trump’s first six months, his disapproval ratings have bumped up by 10 percentage points, well above comparable figures for Biden, Obama, and George W. Bush. Recent polling indicates 55% disapproval of the “big, beautiful bill,” compared with 29% approval.
In the upcoming election contests, Kansans will have the opportunity to query incumbents about their choices: shoddy partisan tactics over bipartisanship. Sponsorship by Koch. Support for taxes that benefit the rich and ditch the poor. Votes that swamped the state and nation in a sea of red ink.
We now what they did back in 2016. We’ll see what they decide in 2026.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for the Ohio Capital Journal / Republish photo only with original story.)What Pandora’s Box has Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine opened by joining other Republican-led states in sending hundreds of reinforcement National Guard troops to Washington, D.C. to join the 800 military already mobilized on the streets of the nation’s capital? 
Whatever possessed the lame duck Republican governor to become complicit in Donald Trump’s authoritarian power grab to seize control of an American city with a manufactured “crime emergency” and boots on the ground? 
DeWine must know the bizarre, militarized occupation of D.C. is based on fallacies about rising Washington crime debunked by data that proves otherwise.
Six GOP states send more than 1,000 National Guard to D.C. for Trump crackdown

 To be sure, violent crime is a serious, ongoing problem in D.C. — as it is in other major U.S. cities — but Trump’s hostile takeover of the capital city is not about effective crime-fighting and prevention. It is a distraction. A stunt. Trump has to change the subject about the Epstein coverup with something surreal.
But deployment of National Guard troops in iconic Washington — whose number will nearly double in size after the out-of-state reinforcements arrive — is a gross abuse of power by a would-be autocrat whose favorite tactic is to assert fake emergencies (with no acute crisis) as cover for extreme action. 
Trump has declared 11 of them since January to justify everything from turning the southern border into a military zone (and soldiers into de facto border police) to setting tariffs on every country in the world, promoting fossil fuel production and exerting police power (deploying National Guard troops, federal agents and actual military) in an appalling show of force and weaponry meant to strike fear first in Los Angeles and now in the District.
Tourists on the National Mall are greeted by active-duty soldiers on a domestic mission to surveil Americans and keep them law-abiding. 
The troops have their marching orders from a charlatan drunk on power to look tough on crime as they sightsee in combat fatigues. 
Many will soon be armed against enemy civilians who cross the line — a reversal of initial deployment directives that Guard troops would wear body armor but leave their weapons at the armory. 
Tactical armored vehicles, developed for troops in Afghanistan, are parked throughout D.C. on apparent standby to combat falling crime. Newly erected barricades and random checkpoints conducted by masked federal law enforcement appear out of nowhere.
Outraged local residents have erupted into spontaneous “Free D.C.” demonstrations to protest the insane federal surge of law enforcement flexing its muscle and stopping people for no apparent reason. 
The militarized patrols have had a chilling effect on free speech and the exercise of assembly, but that’s right out of the authoritarian’s playbook. 
Trump uses his unchecked power as a weapon to crush the vulnerable into submission. His stated rationale for excessive use of force in D.C. is to rehabilitate “conditions of law and order,” which is rich coming from a convicted felon who praised and pardoned lawbreakers who violently assaulted police officers, rampaged through the U.S. Capitol and hunted the vice president to hang.  
The performative theatrics of Trump’s military policing of Americans — in the ostensible land of the free — would almost be comical if the unprecedented siege of armed combatants against fellow citizens wasn’t so scary. 
Trump has made no secret of his intentions to squash self-rule elsewhere, too. He has indicated troops could be deployed to other Americans cities such as New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Baltimore where, coincidentally, the mayors are all Black Democrats. 
This is the dystopian hellscape we feared under construction. Trump is desperate to distract his base from his years-long relationship with an infamous pedophile accused of victimizing hundreds of teenage girls, so why not normalize military occupations in America with Republican enablers like Ohio’s governor?
“We’ve been asked by the Secretary of the Army to send 150 military police from the Ohio National Guard to support the District of Columbia National Guard,” read a brief statement from DeWine’s office Saturday night. 
Ohio guard members will “carry out presence patrols and serve as added security,” the press release explained with an odd asterisk that none of the military police from Ohio were “currently serving as law enforcement officers in the state of Ohio.”  
Wait, what? DeWine just dispatched Ohio soldiers to play cops on the beat in Washington but it’s okay?! My friends, we are deep down the rabbit hole.
Would the governor also welcome hundreds of troops to carry out presence patrols in Ohio cities with higher crime rates than D.C., as a few do? 
Would that also warrant hostile federal takeovers by armed military rolling from Toledo to Dayton to restore “law and order” under Trump’s selective application of justice? 
When word spread about DeWine’s decision to send military reinforcements — to be deployed against a nation’s own people — demonstrators gathered at the Ohio Statehouse to protest his offering of homegrown troops “to further militarize D.C.” 
What if Columbus is next?
Could Ohioans count on their governor to be a bulwark against an authoritarian regime leveraging the military for control of Ohio’s “big three” cities, or would DeWine follow orders as a partisan invertebrate to the end and reinforce the takeover with more troops to suppress dissent, maintain power and project strength? 
Ask the 150 Ohio soldiers on their way to D.C.

The Trump administration is once again pressuring cities and states to cooperate with deportation efforts, despite previous setbacks in court.
Attorney General Pam Bondi sent letters last week telling sanctuary states, cities and counties that “you better be abiding by our federal policies and with our federal law enforcement, because if you aren’t, we’re going to come after you,” she said in a Fox News interview. She demanded the areas answer her by Tuesday.
Cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies generally refuse to assist with immigration raids or accede to requests for local jails to hold prisoners for deportation. Those that responded to Stateline’s questions about the letters said they were not inclined to change their positions about cooperation with immigration authorities.
“It’s the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they’re not going to intimidate you,” Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.
The Trump administration is attempting to force more cooperation with immigration arrests. But it suffered a serious court reversal on July 25, when a federal judge dismissed a sanctuary policies case against Illinois, Chicago and Cook County.
The state and local policies reflect a “decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law — a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment,” Judge Lindsay Jenkins wrote in an order now under appeal.
Bondi’s letters follow the Justice Department’s Aug. 5 release of a list of sanctuary jurisdictions including 12 states, the District of Columbia, four counties and 18 cities. That’s fewer jurisdictions than the 14 states and almost 500 counties and cities that appeared on an earlier list, which the agency withdrew after criticism that it included conservative counties that were fully cooperating with immigration enforcement.
The states on the new list are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington state. The list also includes some counties and cities in those states as well as in Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New Mexico.










It's the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they're not going to intimidate you.


– Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha


Other federal courts have issued injunctions to at least temporarily stop Trump administration from withholding unrelated federal funding from governments that don’t cooperate on immigration. Cities, counties and states have filed lawsuits challenging Trump’s executive orders targeting sanctuary policies, including a February order that federal payments to states and localities must not “by design or effect, facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration, or abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”
“The executive orders are directing agencies to basically take a maximalist approach to putting pressure on local governments to cooperate with immigration [enforcement], even though they’re not required to do so by federal law,” said Jonathan Miller, one of the attorneys working on the California case for the Public Rights Project, a California-based group promoting civil rights protections for states and cities.
One city on the administration’s list was Rochester, New York, which disciplined some police officers for helping federal agents make a March arrest in the city. The city already faces a lawsuit brought by the Trump administration that prominently mentions the arrest of three men from Guatemala; one of whom has since pleaded guilty to re-entering the United States after a previous deportation.
States, sheriffs puzzle over Trump’s error-filled list of immigration sanctuaries

A spokesperson for the city, Barbara Pierce, said in a statement to The Guardian that, “Nothing in Attorney General Bondi’s letter is new and none of it has legal merit.”
“The letter reiterates many of the frivolous arguments that the federal government has already made in its pending suit against the city of Rochester,” she added. “These same arguments were levied against the city of Chicago and were dismissed by the federal district court for the eastern district of Illinois nearly a month ago.”
Ally Sullivan, a spokesperson for Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, said in a statement that Colorado “is not a sanctuary state. The Governor continues to be frustrated by this mistaken and incorrect label.” In a televised interview earlier this year, Polis pointed out that Colorado fully cooperates with federal authorities on criminal matters. Immigration, he said, is a civil matter.
“In Colorado, we are improving public safety, apprehending dangerous criminals, cooperating with federal law enforcement on criminal investigations, and keeping our communities safe,” Sullivan said.
Nevertheless, Colorado faces a federal lawsuit brought by the administration over its alleged sanctuary policies. Polis signed a measure in May that limits local law enforcement’s communication with federal immigration authorities and restricts where federal authorities can operate within schools, child care facilities, hospitals and libraries without a judicial warrant.
ICE has a new courthouse tactic: Get immigrants’ cases tossed, then arrest them outside

Connecticut Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont in a statement said the state’s Trust Act, which the Trump administration has targeted as a sanctuary policy, was passed with bipartisan support and helps ensure local police concentrate on serious crimes. The Trust Act, passed in 2013 and expanded in 2019, limits information sharing and compliance with requests to detain immigrants for federal immigration authorities.
“Nothing about this makes Connecticut a sanctuary in any legal or practical sense — it makes our state one that upholds the Constitution, respects the rule of law, and prioritizes the safety and well-being of our communities,” Lamont said.

Brown,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/08/20/religious-exemptions-for-school-vaccinations-have-been-growing-since-covid/,"About 1.7% of the state’s 63,000 kindergartners, or 1,075 kids, were exempted from required vaccinations for religious reasons during the 2024-2025 school year, continuing a steady increase of the last four years, according to new state data.","Despite a growing number of kids getting religious exemptions from required school vaccinations, Maryland still vaccinates a higher percentage of students than the national average. (Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)“No Shots. No School. No Exceptions.” That’s what’s parents are greeted with on the Prince George’s County Public Schools webpage on required vaccinations for the upcoming school year.
But that’s not entirely true. In Maryland, there are exceptions — specifically, families can easily get religious exemptions to opt their kindergartners out of vaccine requirements in any school year.
And more Maryland families have been choosing that route for the last four school years, according to Maryland Department of Health data released this week.
About 1.7% of the state’s 63,000 kindergartners, or approximately 1,075 kids, cited religious reasons to be exempted from required vaccinations during the 2024-2025 school year.
It’s the highest percentage of religious exemptions since the 2019-2020 school year, when the start of the COVID-19 pandemic not only ushered in a new wave of vaccine hesitancy but also disrupted typical school procedures for many families.



Since the 2021-2022 school year, at least 1% of kindergartners in Maryland have had a religious exemption – a couple hundred a year – and it’s been rising since.
While it’s still a relatively small percent of students compared to the rest of the population, and well below the national rate, public health advocates call rising number of unvaccinated kids “concerning.”
“COVID put us behind the eight ball in terms of vaccination levels in kids,” said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.
“It’s a very concerning trend because we need to maintain adequate vaccination levels to maintain herd immunity,” Benjamin said Tuesday. “These childhood diseases are not benign. They’re very dangerous.”
Maryland law requires that children have a handful of vaccinations when they enter kindergarten, in order to protect themselves and their classmates from transmissible diseases, such as measles, polio and chickenpox, among others. Children can be exempted if there is a medical reason they cannot receive a vaccine or a religious restriction against it.
A medical exemption requires a written statement from a physician that vaccination would be harmful to the student. But invoking a religious exemption in Maryland is simple. Parents can just sign a form that says: “Because of my bona fide religious beliefs and practices, I object to any vaccine(s) being given to my child.”
Religious exemptions spiked in 2019-2020 when 2.7% of kindergartners, or 1,641 kids, opted out of vaccination requirements. The COVID-19 pandemic did not go into full swing until spring 2020, so those families would have opted out prior to the pandemic in the United States.
Public health officials and researchers look at nonmedical religious exemptions as an imperfect metric for vaccine hesitancy among families, though tracking such data is a tricky task.
“To the extent that people are looking at ways to opt out of being vaccinated, you will see a higher increase in people taking advantage of … religious exemptions,” Benjamin said.
The rate of religious exemptions varies by school district and can be influenced by population size.


Kent and Garrett counties have the highest rate of religious exemptions in the state, for example, with more than 4% of kindergartners  in those counties getting a religious exemption from vaccines last school year, according to the data.
But Kent County had just 155 kindergartners in the 2024-2025 school year, so if seven kids had a religious exemption, that would account for 4.5% of Kent County kindergarten students.
Similarly, Garrett County had 243 students in its 2024-2025 kindergarten class. The 4.12% receiving a religious exemption from vaccinations represents about 10 kids.
“We have fewer kindergartners,” said Rebecca Aiken, school health services manager for Garrett County Public Schools. “It can really skew the numbers.”
She said that there could be many reasons why some kids are not up to date on their vaccinations or use a religious exemption to opt out of them.
She noted that some kids are homeless or do not have a stationary home life, moving between family members or living with grandparents, which can make record-keeping for immunizations challenging. The county tries to help families in those situations get their vaccinations or find their records.
But with the ease of religious opt-out for vaccines, Aiken said there’s no way to know why someone selects the religious exemption for vaccines.
“We can’t force them to prove their religion, so we have to take it at face value,” she said.
She noted that even if the families opt their kids out of vaccination requirements, the county health officials and school nurses help keep the families informed about communicable diseases.
Sherelle Jones, an official with the Prince George’s County Office of School Health, noted that compliance with the vaccination requirement is down for the upcoming school year, but she has not noticed a rise in vaccine hesitancy specifically.
She’s hearing that some families who do not have health care coverage have struggled to get their kids vaccinated. Prince George’s County Public Schools has hosted vaccination clinics in hopes of closing that coverage gap.
Last school year, Prince George’s County’s schools had about 1.7% of its kindergartners getting a nonmedical religious exemption from vaccinations, on par with the state as a whole.
Jones noted that there is still time for families to comply with the vaccination requirements, as school doesn’t start until Aug. 26 in Prince George’s County.
RFK Jr. ends COVID vaccine recommendation for healthy children, pregnant people

But Benjamin noted that families are coming in with more questions about vaccines, which he says is a result of new messaging at the federal level about when to receive vaccines and at what age.
“There is a very well-organized, well-funded antivaccine community out there,” Benjamin said. “Coupled with some of the mistrust that has been promoted by the current Health Secretary [Robert F.] Kennedy — that has raised the questions in people’s minds about when their kids should get their shots, how many shots they should get and whether they should get these shots.
“My colleagues that are practicing pediatrics are telling me that more and more parents are coming in with more questions about vaccinations,” he said. “I would not equate that to vaccine hesitancy, although there is certainly more of that.”
While the rate of religious exemptions is going up in Maryland, state health officials say that vaccine coverage among Maryland kindergartners is still high, especially compared to the rates nationally. The Centers for Disease Control and prevention said 3.6% of kindergartners nationwide were exempt from vaccinations for the 2024-2025 school year, up from 3.3% the previous year.
“In general, vaccine coverage rates remain high in Maryland. The overall exemption rates remain below the national average and stable at 2.2% compared to the previous school year,” said David McCallister, public information officer for the state health department in a written statement. The 2.2% figure combines both 1.7% of kids who have a religious exemption and the 0.5% who have a medical exemption in the 2024-2025 school year.
McCallister noted there’s been an increase in exemptions, “specifically non-medical exemptions” since the COVID-19 pandemic.
“The Department will continue to monitor school exemption trends very closely, especially with regard to their relationship to vaccine preventable diseases,” McCallister said. “MDH continues to recommend vaccinations for all children.”

(File photo by Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)The company surveying a potential route for the controversial Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project power line is asking a court to provide federal marshals for protection as they try to do their jobs.
In a petition filed Friday with U.S. District Court in Maryland, PSEG Renewable Transmission said that many of the landowners along the potential route of a high-power that would cut across Baltimore, Carroll and Frederick counties been cooperative. But it cites six incidents where property owners “have refused access, threatened armed violence, and engaged in intimidation tactics.”
Local police have indicated publicly that they will not get involved in civil complaints around the power line, leaving workers defenseless, the company said, arguing that the court should assign U.S. marshals to accompany workers in the field to protect them when needed.
In addition to threats of violence in the field, the company said it is “concerned about the safety of its land agents and surveyors given the social media atmosphere in which many individuals are openly calling for violence against the Company’s surveyors and land agents, as well as local law enforcement officials’ public statements of non-involvement,” the petition said.
A company spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the filing Tuesday. But a member of Stop MPRP, the grassroots group of landowners and others who have been fighting the power line for the past year, called the petition little more than a “scare tactic” by a “private, multibillion-dollar company.”
“We don’t believe violence is ever an answer or even threats of violence,” said Betsy McFarland,  who owns 3 acres of land in Frederick County with her husband. “But regardless of that, we understand why people are so upset.
“We’re all donating our time to this cause because we care about our community,” McFarland said. “For this private, multibillion-dollar company to be able to come in and threaten people and take their land is not fair. We want to see the process play out.”
Federal judge grants Piedmont power line company access to land for surveys

McFarland noted that the Maryland Public Service Commission has not granted a key certificate that would allow construction on the power line to move forward.
But PSEG argues that PSC approval cannot come until a route can be mapped. It said it was selected by the regional electric grid operator, PJM Interconnection, and given a deadline of June 1, 2027, to place the 67-mile power transmission line in service — or risk blackouts or other woes due to increasing strain on the electric grid.
The MPRP line is planned to deliver power generated by a plant in southern Pennsylvania, carrying it from northern Baltimore County to southern Frederick County. PJM has said it needs the additional capacity to keep pace with rising demand for electricity at a time when aging power plants in Maryland are set to be retired, and new generation capacity is lagging.
Critics say the project not only presents a threat to private property along the route, but that it would destroy the rural nature of the region, interfere with family farms, harm forests and streams and endanger a longtime youth camp.
Friday’s filing is the latest in a court case that began in May, when PSEG sued more than 100 landowners in the power line corridor who it said were refusing surveyors access to their property for the project.
U.S. District Judge Adam Abelson sided with the company in June, ruling that surveyors had a right to enter a property and “remain … to the extent reasonably necessary to make surveys, run lines or levels, or obtain information relating to the acquisition and future use of the properties in connection with the Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project.” Abelson said the company would first have to provide at least 24 hours of notice of its visits by “taping a notice on the front door.”
Opponents appealed Abelson’s ruling, but the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has not taken the case up yet. In the meantime, PSEG filed suit againts more property owners — a company spokesman said at the time that a lawsuit against a third group of property owners was expected — and began surveying properties in the first group.
The company said most landowners have been cooperative. But in addition to the social media threats, the petition cited six incidents when property owners yelled things to surveyors such as, “Do not come on my property, I have a gun, and I will shoot you,” and “get the [expletive] off my property.” Others threatened to sic dogs on the workers or stopped inches from hitting them with an ATV, the petition said.
The company asked the court to assign U.S. marshals to protect workers when they are threatened, and to set up an expedited process for requesting protection. That petition was filed Friday; Abelson on Monday approved an expedited hearing schedule, giving the property owners until Wednesday to file a response, and the company until Friday to reply.
McFarland said she was not named in any of the lawsuits to date, but said that could change in the near future.
“We’re probably going to get named in a future lawsuit because we’re not letting them on our property either, unless the court requires it,” she said. “I’m going to politely ask them to leave if they try.”

(Photo from the Mississippi Department of Education via The 74 Million)There are many signs of the end of summer in Maryland, and when State Superintendent Carey Wright starts making the rounds of counties to visit schools, it’s a good sign that summer is ending and the school year is starting.
Wright plans to be in Frederick County early Wednesday to see the smiling faces of teachers, faculty — maybe even smiling students — when schools there open for the 2o25-26 academic year. Frederick is one of the first two counties to return tomorrow, along with St. Mary’s County.
Joining Wright will be Frederick County Public Schools Superintendent Cheryl Dyson, the system’s first Black superintendent, now entering her fourth year in the job. Dyson recently received a national award for her work.
Next Monday, Wright is scheduled to visit Baltimore County, one of nine school systems opening on Aug. 25. They will be followed by Calvert, Montgomery and Prince George’s counties on Aug. 25 and Allegany County on Aug. 27. The remaining nine school systems are set to open Sept. 2, the day after Labor Day, according to a state Department of Education calendar.
If it’s any consolation to the kids in Frederick and St. Mary’s counties, the calendar shows that they’re scheduled to be among the first to get out of school next June.
Further information on Wright’s first-day travels was not available as of Monday afternoon.
Lierman scraping for short-term rental scofflaws
Maryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman is looking at short-term rentals in the state.
The effort by the state’s top tax collector has less to do with finding a unique or fun place to stay on vacation and more to do with ensuring that anyone renting out properties in the state is reporting everything on their taxes.
  Comptroller Brooke Lierman (D) said her agency is scraping public data on short-term rental properties in Maryland to ensure each owner “pays their fair share.” (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters.)
This year, the General Assembly passed legislation to centralize the collection of taxes on short-term rentals — think platforms such as Vrbo and Airbnb. Coupled with that are new regulations that have yet to be implemented. Lierman said her agency is already looking at the state’s new law and similar legislation in other states.
“There are probably a couple cleanup things that we’d like to do this year that we’ll talk with the sponsors about, but we care very much about making sure that everybody pays their fair share, and then it gets back to you,” Lierman told the audience at the Maryland Association of Counties meeting last week. “So that will be our central driving force — to make sure that all the taxes are collected and that they are remitted to the appropriate place, and that we’re accounting for that along the way.”
Tangential to that effort, Lierman told the gathering of county officials in Ocean City that her office is now looking for rental owners who might not be honest in reporting their rental income.
Lierman told attendees at the MACo summer conference Saturday that her office has hired a consultant to “scrape publicly available data through Vrbo and Airbnb.”
The data collection is part of an effort to “look at what folks are making and work and then compare that to what they’re reporting their income to us,” Lierman said.
The comptroller said she believes the data collection is the first of its kind in the country.
“So, if I see that you have 10 Ocean City rentals that are rented at $500 a night, nine months of the year. And I don’t see that on your tax return, right?” Lierman said.
‘We told you so’
Members of the legislature’s hard right Freedom Caucus are taking a victory lap after a federal appeals court last week struck down a portion of the state’s digital ad tax.
“The court confirmed what we said from day one: this tax is unconstitutional, reckless, and destined to fail,” said Del. Matt Morgan (R- St. Mary’s), chair of the seven-member group. “Instead of strengthening Maryland’s economy, the Democrat supermajority pushed through a radical scheme to shake down tech companies only to waste millions of taxpayer dollars defending a law that was doomed in the courts.”
The caucus, in letters to Comptroller Brooke Lierman and Attorney General Anthony Brown, both Democrats, demanded to know how much money the state has collected on the tax thus far and how much has been spent defending the law in court.

The 2021 law — the first of its kind in the nation — imposes taxes on large tech companies such as Amazon, Apple and Meta for the digital ads they sell within the state. The law was projected to raise $250 million that would be used to pay for the state’s Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reform efforts.
But the law faces several legal challenges.
On Friday, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued declared one portion of the law unconstitutional. The three-judge panel found that a provision of the law barring companies from itemizing the cost of the tax on invoices to customers violates the First Amendment.
The court compared the law to Colonial-era tax revolts and said preventing a company from telling customers about the tax is a free-speech  violation.
“No doubt, Maryland has prudential reasons not to want the question answered. But as all we have said so far should make clear, keeping out of hot water with voters is not among the interests that can justify a speech ban,” the court said in its decision.
The ruling does not overturn that tax. The appellate judges merely remanded the case back to U.S. District Court in Maryland where a judge will determine an appropriate remedy. Even so, members of the caucus were quick to taunt Democrats.
“We told you so,” the caucus statement concludes.
Lierman anxious to resolve digital ad tax challenges
Republicans are not the only ones watching the various legal challenges to the ad tax and awaiting a final decision.
Comptroller Brooke Lierman, the state’s top tax collector and an attorney, told Maryland Matters Saturday she had not had an opportunity to fully review the appeals court decision issued the night before.
“I do not think it affects the larger part of the law,” she said, referring to whether or not the state can legally impose the tax.
There are several related legal challenges including one in tax court that could — once all the appeals are exhausted — determine whether the 2021 law stands.
Included in those is a challenge in Maryland Tax Court. “We’re awaiting the tax court’s decision,” Lierman said.
When that decision will come remains an open question.
“We do not know. I wish we did. We’ve been waiting for a while,” said Lierman.
Elliott leaves second floor for campaign trail
More change is coming to the second floor of the State House.
Carter Elliott IV, senior press secretary to Gov. Wes Moore (D), announced his departure in an email to reporters Tuesday. The announcement came a day after Fagan Harris, Moore’s chief of staff, announced he has accepted an offer to become the new president and CEO of the Baltimore-based Abell Foundation.

“As my last day in the Governor’s Office comes to a close I just want to reach out to say it was the greatest pleasure of my life to serve in this role and I’m grateful to have gotten to know some incredible people,” Elliott wrote in his brief goodbye note.
“I grew up in a family where the best career that you could follow was being a farmer, a teacher, or a public servant—this had been my dream for as long as I can remember,” added Elliott, who came to Maryland from Virginia.
Elliott has served nearly three years in Moore’s communications shop. Prior to his state service, he spent seven months with Moore’s first statewide political campaign in 2022.
Elliott described his time in the Moore administration as “a hell of a ride.”
But it’s not the end of the trail for Elliott who leaves his government role to join Moore’s reelection campaign.

The Trump administration has threatened the city over its sanctuary policies. City officials say some officers violated the policy by assisting in the arrests. (Photo courtesy of City of Rochester)The Trump administration is once again pressuring liberal cities and states to cooperate with deportation efforts, despite previous setbacks in court.
Attorney General Pam Bondi sent letters last week telling sanctuary states, cities, and counties that “you better be abiding by our federal policies and with our federal law enforcement, because if you aren’t, we’re going to come after you,” she said in a Fox News interview. She demanded the areas answer her by Tuesday.
Cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies generally refuse to assist with immigration raids or accede to requests for local jails to hold prisoners for deportation. Those that responded to Stateline’s questions about the letters said they were not inclined to change their positions about cooperation with immigration authorities.
“It’s the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they’re not going to intimidate you,” Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.
The Trump administration is attempting to force more cooperation with immigration arrests. But it suffered a serious court reversal on July 25, when a federal judge dismissed a sanctuary policies case against Illinois, Chicago, and Cook County.
The state and local policies reflect a “decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law — a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment,” Judge Lindsay Jenkins wrote in an order now under appeal.
Bondi’s letters follow the Justice Department’s Aug. 5 release of a list of sanctuary jurisdictions including 12 states, the District of Columbia, four counties, and 18 cities. That’s fewer jurisdictions than the 14 states and almost 500 counties and cities that appeared on an earlier list, which the agency withdrew after criticism that it included conservative counties that were fully cooperating with immigration enforcement.
The states on the new list are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington state. The list also includes some counties and cities in those states as well as in Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New Mexico.
(Florida law forbids local governments from enforcing sanctuary policies.)










It's the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they're not going to intimidate you.


– Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha


Other federal courts have issued injunctions to at least temporarily stop Trump administration from withholding unrelated federal funding from governments that don’t cooperate on immigration. Cities, counties, and states have filed lawsuits challenging Trump’s executive orders targeting sanctuary policies, including a February order that federal payments to states and localities must not “by design or effect, facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration, or abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”
“The executive orders are directing agencies to basically take a maximalist approach to putting pressure on local governments to cooperate with immigration [enforcement], even though they’re not required to do so by federal law,” said Jonathan Miller, one of the attorneys working on the California case for the Public Rights Project, a California group promoting civil rights protections for states and cities.
One city on the administration’s list was Rochester, New York, which disciplined some police officers for helping federal agents make a March arrest in the city. The city already faces a lawsuit brought by the Trump administration that prominently mentions the arrest of three men from Guatemala, one of whom has since pleaded guilty to re-entering the United States following a previous deportation.
‘Frivolous arguments’
A spokesperson for the city, Barbara Pierce, said in a statement to The Guardian that, “Nothing in Attorney General Bondi’s letter is new and none of it has legal merit.”
“The letter reiterates many of the frivolous arguments that the federal government has already made in its pending suit against the city of Rochester,” she added. “These same arguments were levied against the city of Chicago and were dismissed by the federal district court for the eastern district of Illinois nearly a month ago.”
Ally Sullivan, a spokesperson for Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, said in a statement that Colorado “is not a sanctuary state. The Governor continues to be frustrated by this mistaken and incorrect label.” In a televised interview earlier this year, Polis pointed out that Colorado fully cooperates with federal authorities on criminal matters. Immigration, he said, is a civil matter.
“In Colorado, we are improving public safety, apprehending dangerous criminals, cooperating with federal law enforcement on criminal investigations, and keeping our communities safe,” Sullivan said.
Nevertheless, Colorado faces a federal lawsuit brought by the administration over its alleged sanctuary policies. Polis signed a measure in May that limits local law enforcement’s communication with federal immigration authorities and restricts where federal authorities can operate within schools, child care facilities, hospitals, and libraries without a judicial warrant.
Connecticut Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont in a statement said the state’s Trust Act, which the Trump administration has targeted as a sanctuary policy, was passed with bipartisan support and helps ensure local police concentrate on serious crimes. The Trust Act, passed in 2013 and expanded in 2019, limits information sharing and compliance with requests to detain immigrants for federal immigration authorities.
“Nothing about this makes Connecticut a sanctuary in any legal or practical sense — it makes our state one that upholds the Constitution, respects the rule of law, and prioritizes the safety and well-being of our communities,” Lamont said.

If “Make America Healthy Again” were anything more than a political catchphrase, we’d be talking about how to expand — not gut — programs like SNAP-Ed, WIC, and SNAP. Instead, they’re on the chopping block.

State Rep. Jaime Foster
The latest federal budget bill cuts more than $4.6 million from Connecticut’s SNAP-Ed program alone. Nationwide, that means tens of thousands of families will lose access to community nutrition classes, culturally relevant grocery store tours, and evidence-based support for feeding kids on a tight budget.
Let’s be clear: SNAP-Ed is not fluff. It’s one of the most rigorously evaluated nutrition education programs in the country. Research consistently shows that SNAP-Ed improves diet quality, increases fruit and vegetable intake, and even reduces food insecurity. Every dollar invested in SNAP-Ed saves the healthcare system between $2 and $10 in long-term costs. That’s not a soundbite — that’s peer-reviewed science.
Meanwhile, WIC — another program with decades of data behind it — improves birth outcomes, increases breastfeeding rates, improves infant nutrition outcomes (iron deficiency anemia and obesity rates improve), and ensures children are developmentally on track. Enrollment in the program is also a touch point for families with economically vulnerable kids who qualify for additional wrap-around services. It’s one of the few interventions proven to reduce racial disparities in infant health. Yet WIC’s future funding is uncertain, too.
And then there’s SNAP itself — the foundation of food access for over 40 million Americans. The new budget imposes stricter work requirements, cuts benefits, and shifts administrative costs to already overburdened states. All while ignoring the real math: SNAP not only reduces hunger — it boosts local economies and improves health outcomes, especially for children and older adults.
When the president or HHS secretary tells us they want to Make America Healthy Again — but defund the very programs that make healthy living possible — I have to ask: Was this ever really about health?
Because if it were, we’d be doubling down on prevention. We’d be expanding access to SNAP-Ed in every grocery store, community center, and school. We’d make it easier — not harder — for low-income families to access nutritious food. We’d treat food as the critical determinant of health that it is. We would expand produce prescription programs, increase funding for diabetes prevention programs, and set added sugar and sodium limits on foods in schools instead of distractions like food dyes.
I am here for the removal of food dyes, and I want schools (and society) to serve less processed foods, but let’s first make sure every American has access to enough nutritious food to lead a healthy, productive life.
The elephant in the room is that slogans don’t save lives, but science-based policy does. If we care about making America healthy, we need to fund what works.

The law has had a wide-ranging impact, from helping differently abled individuals seek employment without discrimination, to ensuring buildings that serve the public are accessible to everyone and maintaining accessibility standards for public spaces, schools and transportation systems.  


As the head of a school bus company that specializes in transporting students with special needs in Connecticut and Northern Illinois, I am tremendously proud of our contribution to advancing ADA efforts. Yet even as we celebrate the transformative nature of the ADA this Disability Pride Month, we must be mindful of the evolving challenges we face and remain dedicated to finding creative solutions for the issues confronting the differently abled community.  
For instance, as is the case with many essential, frontline jobs across the country, there continues to be a concerning shortage of school bus drivers nationwide, including in Connecticut. While these types of logistical challenges are never easy to solve, they can disproportionately impact students in the disability community for a variety of reasons.  
The first is simply that providing transportation for students with special needs is more logistically challenging, specialized work, making those jobs even more difficult to fill. On a basic level, picking up groups of students at multiple bus stops is far simpler than the type of personalized, door-to-door “individualized” pickups we provide every day to thousands of students with special needs.  
Additionally, bus drivers who work with special needs students – and the aides who assist them -–require not only more training than typical school bus drivers, but a particular temperament and heightened level of emotional intelligence. While patience is certainly a quality that any school bus driver must possess, we always look to recruit drivers who are especially empathetic, compassionate, and able to exhibit calm in stressful situations to reduce anxiety for our passengers and their caregivers.   
Safety consciousness, consistency, reliability, and trustworthiness are also key attributes that any driver transporting students with special needs must have. While every school bus driver bears a tremendous amount of responsibility for the safety and well-being of the students they transport, special needs students often require – and thrive on – routine, consistency, and structure.  
Many of our drivers will transport the same students for years as they progress through school. The relationships and bonds drivers form with students and their families – and the level of experience, familiarity, comfort, and trust that they establish – are critical to the services we provide. However, finding folks with these specific skillsets adds additional layers to our recruiting, screening, and hiring process, making these jobs tougher to fill when there are already widespread driver shortages.  
Beyond simply finding the right people for this specialized work, the fact is that we simply need more bus drivers and aides than ever before. The number of students with disabilities in public schools has increased steadily since the ADA was signed into law. In 1990, roughly 4.7 million students with disabilities were enrolled in grades K through 12 in the U.S. In 2022, that number increased to 7.3 million. In Connecticut alone, it has been reported that 18% of all students have special education needs, a number that has been increasing steadily by 2.5% each year even as total enrollment has decreased.  
Despite these obstacles, we continue to pursue new avenues to find and recruit the drivers we need and our passengers deserve. To tap into new pools of talent, we are partnering with churches and community organizations to find individuals with the qualities we seek who may never have considered a highly rewarding career as a bus driver for students with special needs.  
As we celebrate the anniversary of the ADA this Disability Pride Month, we must continue to focus on ways to advance the goals that this groundbreaking legislation first codified 35 years ago. That means working together with our communities to recruit new drivers and aides into a career that is both rewarding and plays an essential role in the lives of differently abled young people so we can ensure that all people are afforded the same opportunities, no matter their circumstances.

(Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska State Legislature gaveled in and out Tuesday as a technical step in running down the clock on a special session, slated to end Aug. 31.
Legislative leaders say they’ve already accomplished their priorities — successfully overriding two vetoes by Gov. Mike Dunleavy — and have no interest in taking up further business this month. Dunleavy had called the special session and asked lawmakers to work on education and agriculture measures.
The House and Senate presiding officers — House Speaker Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, and Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak — were both on a morning flight that was delayed due to Juneau fog, pushing back the planned floor sessions for more than an hour. But within minutes, they adjourned both the House and Senate until another session at 10 a.m. Aug 31. That’s also expected to be a brief formality, known as a “technical” session.
“We’re going to stand our ground,” Edgmon said in an interview afterward. “And if he wants to call us back in,” he said referring to the chance of the governor calling another special session, “‘second verse same as the first,’ you know. The results are going to be ‘second verse same as the first,’ too.”
Edgmon and Stevens both confirmed that the governor’s education policy priorities would be considered by a new joint education funding task force, which is scheduled to meet Aug. 25, and in the regular session in January. 
Stevens also pointed to the next session for considering a new Alaska Department of Agriculture, as the Legislature has rejected Dunleavy’s executive order creating one. Dunleavy had asked the Legislature again to act on the order in August.
“If it’s his executive order, we can’t affect that. We can’t amend it. We can’t change it in any way. And so we much prefer to have a bill,” Stevens said in an interview Tuesday. “The advantage of going through the legislative process is that we take the time to study all the issues. We can hear various legislators’ thoughts on it, we can hear from the public, and it just winds up with a better process.”
Sen. Robert Myers, R-North Pole, said by phone on Tuesday that the Republican-led minority caucus supports Dunleavy’s education policy items and would have liked to see them considered. “It was at least an opportunity for us to try to drill down a little further and take some time on different education policies, rather than just talking about the funding that was vetoed and then moving on,” he said. 
Jeff Turner, Dunleavy’s communications director, said by email on Tuesday, “it’s disappointing that the legislature is choosing to kick the can down the road.” 
Asked whether Dunleavy plans to call another special session this fall, Turner replied that if the governor chose to do so, it would be announced in a press release.
Myers said he’s not confident there would be any further work or negotiation if the governor called another special session. “Of course, that’s his prerogative, but the way that the majorities are behaving, I don’t see that anything significant is going to change, which is, again, disappointing. You know, we should be focusing on our outcomes for our students, not on playing these kinds of political games.”
Five legislators attended the technical sessions, including Rep. Chuck Kopp, R-Anchorage, Rep. Cathy Tilton, R-Wasilla, and Edgmon in the House and Sen. Bert Stedman, R-Sitka, and Stevens in the Senate.

Noem announced the administration would paint barriers between the U.S. and Mexico black in order to prevent rust and make them hotter to prevent climbing. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)SANTA TERESA, N.M. — U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced Tuesday that President Donald Trump wants some 600-plus miles of the border barrier with Mexico painted black.
The reasons, Noem said, are twofold. First, it will prevent rust. Second, she said, it will burn the skin of anyone trying to climb over.
“That is specifically at the request of the president, who understands that in the hot temperatures down here, when something is painted black, it gets even warmer, and it will make it even harder for people to climb,” Noem said during an afternoon news conference in which temperatures rose to 92 degrees.
Noem did not answer questions from reporters about the cost or time frame for painting the wall, other than to say not all the work has been contracted yet. She delivered Tuesday’s announcement from behind a podium posed in front of a solitary painted section of the steel barrier. She was flanked by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents on a strip of land sandwiched between rows of empty cattle corrals — a result of the parasitic fly closing cattle trade.

The announcement prompted a rebuke from Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s office.
“Painting a border wall black to injure people who are seeking a better life is, sadly, emblematic of the Trump administration’s cruel approach to immigration enforcement. A more sensible, humane, and economically advantageous solution is to pass comprehensive immigration reform that would benefit both sides of the border,” Communications Director Michael Coleman said in a statement provided to Source NM.
Coleman noted that the governor “for years has requested additional federal assistance to combat drug trafficking and other nefarious criminal activity in the border region, but she strongly opposes the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts that would break up families and harm New Mexico’s economy and communities.”
Earlier Tuesday, Noem toured with state and local officials areas of Ruidoso damaged by repeated monsoon floods, which Coleman praised, saying Lujan Grisham “appreciates Sec. Noem’s visit to Ruidoso, which allowed her to see firsthand the devastation wrought by recent flooding. Federal assistance after disasters like this is crucial to helping communities rebuild.” Noem announced $11.4 million in disaster funds for Ruidoso Tuesday evening. That’s on top of U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency allocation of $2.7 million for damages related to flooding in New Mexico.
Noem then traveled from Ruidoso to New Mexico’s border, where she delivered her announcement about painting the border barrier along its deadliest stretch. The area saw 176 deaths last year, according to border control, mostly due to heat, but the figure also includes falls from climbing over the barriers.
Deaths in the New Mexico desert surge after Texas’ border crackdown reaches El Paso

Border crossings and deaths are down in the area, Walter Slosar, the interim chief for the El Paso Sector of border patrol, said during the news conference. Slosar attributed the decline to the Trump administration’s hard line. Apprehensions are down to 39 people per day across 268 miles of international border in the sector, down from more than 2,400 people in 2023.
“Words and messages matter,” Slosar said. “It is not OK to enter the country illegally, and somebody’s finally saying it, our leadership here in the U.S. government.”
Noem had little to say about the recent expansion of efforts to detain immigrants in military bases, including plans to hold 1,000 people at Fort Bliss, in El Paso abutting the New Mexico state line.
“My goal is not to build hundreds of thousands of beds, my goal is to get people out of this country that are here illegally,” she said. “That’s where our focus is, and so we’ll build as many detention beds as we need to get the job done.”
When asked by Source NM if the Trump administration has any specific plans for detention in New Mexico, Noem was noncommittal.
“There could be, I know New Mexico is having debates going on with their detention centers. We’re planning on keeping our presence there and expanding if possible,” she said.
The governor’s chief counsel recently told state lawmakers Lujan Grisham may consider legislation to ban the presence of federal immigration detention centers in the state in an upcoming, though as yet unscheduled, special session.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Republican Adam Steen, former director of the Iowa Department of Administrative Services, announced his campaign for governor Tuesday, labeling himself as a “faith guy” in the race to succeed Gov. Kim Reynolds.
Steen held a campaign kickoff event Tuesday at Berean Church in Pleasant Hill, starting with a musical performance from Nathan Thomas and the A17 worship band and an introduction from Pastor Gary Pilcher. As he introduced himself, Steen said there had been some speculation online about what type of candidate he would be.
“Let me tell you, from my own lips, who I am: I am the faith guy,” Steen said. “I’m a Jesus guy. I’m a Make America Great Again guy. I’m a common-sense policy, America first, people first guy.”
In addition to being a credentialed minister, Steen said some of his highest profile commitments to faith were as DAS director. The department had canceled a Satanic Temple of Iowa holiday celebration event at the Iowa Capitol in December 2024, with Steen saying the event was denied because it included “elements that are harmful to minors.”
Steen said at the campaign event he was “the guy that stood in front of the Satanists when they blatantly targeted our children, and I’m the guy getting sued by the Satanists for protecting our children.”
He also said there was another event request at the Capitol he denied, for an all-ages, family-friendly drag show. He said this planned event was not as well known, but that he believed it was the right thing to do despite being at risk of getting sued.
Steen, appointed in 2021 to serve as DAS director in Reynolds’ administration, said he led some of the major policies changing state government, like the government agency restructuring signed into law in 2023. Speaking with reporters, Steen said he had discussed running for the seat with Reynolds and came to a “mutual agreement” that he would resign from his position if he ran for the office.
“Today, at 10 a.m., I walked into the governor’s office and I submitted my resignation,” Steen told the crowd. “Today I walked away from a job that I loved. I walked away from a job that I loved, so I could join the fight and defend the state that I love.”
Before leading DAS, Steen was the director of business development at Syverson Strege, a financial services firm, and had previously owned a management consulting firm called 25 Connections. He also was a minor league baseball relief pitcher in 2002, playing for the Philadelphia Phillies and Batavia Muckdogs.
Steen highlighted his commitment to protecting private property rights, but did not go into detail on his views about the use of eminent domain for carbon capture pipeline projects — the subject of a contentious bill that was vetoed by Reynolds this session.
“I was working with her at this time, and I support everything that Governor Reynolds is doing,” Steen said. When asked about his views on the use of eminent domain in these projects, he said “I’m a pro-property rights, pro-private ownership person.”
Steen is the latest Republican to join the field of GOP candidates seeking to take the mantle from Reynolds after she announced she would not run for reelection in 2026. U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra and state Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, currently have “exploratory” committees for governor, while Rep. Eddie Andrews, R-Johnston, and former state legislator Brad Sherman have announced campaigns.

The Nez Perce Tribe first presented its extinction findings for Snake River salmon and steelhead in 2021 at a Northwest Power and Conservation Council meeting. The opening slide featured this call by Nez Perce elder Elmer Crow for human solidarity with the salmon, fellow makers of the circle, who are in trouble and need our care.
Mr. Crow died in 2013 while rescuing a grandson in the Snake River at Buffalo Eddy. One obituary reported that in the 1970s, while between jobs, he, his wife Lynda and their first two boys, “lived off the land for four months throughout Nez Perce Country, from the Blue Mountains to the South Fork of the Salmon River.” The western parts of the Crow family’s traverse, from the Blue Mountains to the Snake River, are locales in this four-part story.

Maps are salmon storytellers
 
The best way to observe Snake River salmon and steelhead extinction, to observe its dire motion, is by map. Salmon extinction is a geographic event, place by place in time. As will be salmon recovery, should it occur.
  This map shows the entire natal, reproductive habitat of Snake River spring and summer Chinook salmon, across the Salmon, Clearwater, Grande Ronde, Imnaha and Tucannon River watersheds. The largest part is now in central Idaho, with most of northeast Oregon and a piece of southeast Washington included.
Anyone who has driven from anywhere to La Grande, Lewiston, Stanley or Salmon has been on this map. Many are on it often, by visit or residence. Distinct local populations of salmon and steelhead have ocean-provisioned its places and creatures for many thousands of years. When you cross through, or stop to linger, you intersect with one or more of these populations, bred by and to the same waters and lands that now draw you.  And, you intersect with one or more active trajectories of population extirpation. The endpoint of population extirpations is species extinction.
My presumptuous wish is that each time you drive, walk, bike, or float on this map’s terrain, you think of the local salmon there with you, whose thousands of years’ provisioning to the land, water and life around you is being dismantled in a relative instant.
The map’s colors are the species’ seven major population groups, which track with watersheds. The names are the 43 geographic populations into which the species has been scientifically sorted by differences in behavior, life history and genetics. Endangered Species Act-listed, and non-listed Clearwater River populations, are both included; I focus here on those listed. These populations – at once local and connected, homebodies and explorers, mountaineers and mariners – are the species: Snake River spring and summer Chinook salmon, the highest-spawning salmon on earth.
Snake River steelhead trout are a different fish than salmon, with different relations to their habitats, so the population boundaries differ some. But on this same base map, there are 26 local populations of Snake River steelhead – the highest-spawning steelhead on earth.
With an active map, you could zoom in on headwater laboratories where differences within and between each population come into being. In a wider view, you could watch lights flicker and go out as populations disappear.
Over 30 populations of Snake River Chinook are already extirpated (locally extinct), by the actions of non-Indigenous homo sapiens. Extirpations have continued since Endangered Species Act listings 33 years ago, and more populations are on the way now.

	I think of Stanley, Idaho – home to a self-chosen few people, hub of a geography loved and hard-used by thousands of Idahoans. Stanley’s local Chinook salmon is the Valley Creek population. How near are Valley Creek’s unique salmon to extirpation?
How near are lower Middle Fork Salmon Chinook, and the seven other populations in the wild Middle Fork Salmon River? How near are B run steelhead, a creature found on earth only in the Clearwater River and lower parts of the Salmon River?
Each population in its geography tells stories, which by the nature of salmon weave fish, rivers, places, peoples, and time. In three parts and a coda, I will follow a salmon thread out from some rate-of-extinction science by the Nez Perce Tribe and Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.
Geographically, I will begin in southeast Washington, then move to northeast Oregon watersheds that descend a wizardry of mountains, valleys and basalt canyons to the Snake River. I will do no justice at all to these waters and lands, or their histories of people and fish.
I will report and reflect on a few conversations, out of many that could be had, with a few local people about their past and present bonds with these fish, and what salmon extinction would mean.

Roots in the Grande Ronde: Two stories
 
“I am descended on my father’s side from Walla Walla and Yakama people, here since time immemorial,” Bobby Fossek tells me.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXMost of their winter villages were on the mid-Columbia and lower Snake Rivers, from which they came up and over each year into the Grande Ronde and Wallowa valleys.





“The Grande Ronde was our Garden of Eden. And not just ours; there was enough to share.”
The Walla Walla, Nez Perce, Cayuse and Umatilla tribes long preceded the existence of Oregon in the Grande Ronde and Imnaha country. In the Cayuse/Nez Perce language, the Grande Ronde was Qapqa’pnim We’ele, “Cottonwood Stream.” Tribal bands moved in seasonal patterns of hunting, fishing, and gathering; assembly, trading and cultural practices; and wintering. The many-fingered Grande Ronde Valley was one of earth’s most bountiful salmon nurseries.
Then came conquest, death and dispossession by soldiers, settlers and state. Despite strong arguments by Cayuse and Nez Perce people, no reservation was established in the Grande Ronde or its tributaries, and salmon nurseries became irrigated croplands. (In 1873, President Ulysses S. Grant issued an executive order setting aside a portion of the Wallowa Valley as a reservation for the Nez Perce. Two years later, he rescinded it.  The forced removal of Nez Perce people from Wallowa country that followed led into the Nez Perce War of 1877, an event that still resounds.)
From the Umatilla Reservation, Fossek’s family kept their Grande Ronde connection alive on fishing trips into the early 1960s. Those ended after The Dalles Dam, John Day Dam and the lower Snake dams were built. Too few salmon remained for the work, time and expense.

	“Our family stopped coming back when the fish stopped coming back,” he said. “The waterways had been engineered, and we had less and less access.”
Mr. Fossek and his own family now live in Cove, on Catherine Creek in the upper Grande Ronde. They are among the tribal people re-establishing in the Grande Ronde.
“We do a lot of driving to the Umatilla Reservation and back,” he says wryly.
Fossek is a conscious restorer and adapter of native rivers, fish, culture, ways and skills at work in a landscape from which his family and many others were removed, and which the United States’ settlement has profoundly altered. Among his projects, he manages an 80-acre restoration on tributaries of Catherine Creek, on land owned by the Episcopal Diocese of Eastern Oregon.

	Joe McCormack lives 12 miles outside the small town of Joseph. He is descended from the Joseph band of the Nez Perce, with homelands mainly in the Wallowa, Joseph Creek and Imnaha country.
When his mother needed to move in 1979, and decided on Joseph, he returned to help her, and stayed. He worked as a fish technician for the Nez Perce Tribe, has a small cattle ranch in the Imnaha, and is a long-time leader to restore lands, waters, fish and tribal use in northeast Oregon while building native and non-native community.
Mr. McCormack capsuled some recent history in the Wallowa Valley.
“Taz Conner was Nez Perce and a navy veteran,” McCormack began. “He worked for the Forest Service here, back when logging and milling collapsed. Wallowa County was a natural resource community. Four or five mills were lost, leaving towns in shambles. It really hurt.
“The county and the Nez Perce Tribe created a salmon habitat recovery plan then, to address the Endangered Species Act listings. It was the first of its kind, by a tribe and a county, in the nation. Taz and some community members in the town of Wallowa started a Friendship Feast, which was first held in the high school, and now is on our own grounds.”
Mr. Conner helped create the Wallowa/Nez Perce Tribe Interpretive Center – now the Nez Perce Wallowa Homeland – to build Nez Perce presence and seek reconciliation with non-tribal people.
“When Taz got sick, I took over for him, and over 20 years a group of us guided the Homeland into the community and region,” McCormack said.  
The Homeland now owns 320 acres in Wallowa, with a mile and a half of Wallowa River frontage plus newly restored side-channels.
“We call it our home. It’s a center for the Chief Joseph Band descendants, whatever reservations they were scattered to,” McCormack said. “We hold a pow-wow, the Tamkaliks Celebration and Friendship Feast, on the third weekend of July. We focus on protecting and securing tribal resources, like salmon. We teach the youth what the elders would have taught them, the skills and resources, in the old days during the winters. Winter was the communal time, in the deep canyons along the rivers. That’s gone now.”
When Fossek and McCormack talk about their peoples’ past, it is present.



The Grande Ronde Valley was our Eden. Everything was there for the people. The Grande Ronde had everything. The camas root was in abundance. When the seasons came there, the people from here went over to the Grande Ronde Valley and dug the camas. Catherine Creek was a main source of salmon and steelhead. There were fishing sites all along Catherine Creek. The Grande Ronde River was one of the main sources from Hilgard to Perry. On down where Elgin is was a main crossroads for the people to travel from Walla Walla over into Wallowa country.

Jay Hesse recalls conversations within Nez Perce Fisheries in 2020: “We knew that NOAA Fisheries [the federal agency with main jurisdiction over salmon] uses a metric in its planning called ‘quasi-extinction threshold.’ But management is our focus, actions to help fish that are not doing well. And we had grown very concerned about the Tucannon population.”
The 60-mile long Tucannon River slides from the south into the reservoir behind Lower Monumental Dam on the lower Snake River. (The Palouse River enters from the north some six miles further downstream. This three-river area will be active tribally, ecologically and popularly if the lower Snake River is restored to free flow.)

	Tucannon Chinook are Washington’s only remaining Snake River Chinook salmon population. An Asotin Creek population is already extirpated.
They face six dams and reservoirs when they go to sea, and six when they return. All other Snake River salmon and steelhead, in Oregon and Idaho, face eight dams and 320 miles of continuous reservoir when they go out to and come back from the Pacific Ocean. (The journey outbound kills far more of both fish than the return trip, but that is not well understood, perhaps because the out-bound young are largely invisible, and the big inbound adults unforgettably the opposite.)
In 2019 just eight wild-origin Chinook spawned in the Tucannon; in 2020, seventeen; and, from 2017 forward, fewer than 50 each year.
Thus the Tucannon population has dropped below what NOAA Fisheries calls a “quasi-extinction threshold” for Snake River Chinook: fewer than 50 adult fish in a population returning from the ocean for four consecutive years.
Below that floor, the population’s continued existence can no longer be scientifically assumed or predicted. It is a critical condition signal, flashing red and near black, a population emergency. I will return to this threshold in Part Two.
On the Tucannon River, the Nez Perce Tribe, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife are responding with a translocation project.
Starting this year and likely for years to come, marked Tucannon-origin, hatchery-born young salmon are being trucked downstream, past all the big dams, to Kalama Falls Hatchery, south of Longview, Washington, for next-spring release toward the Pacific Ocean from there.
Any Tucannon-origin adults that then return to Kalama in after years will be captured, to maintain and build this rescue effort and, it is hoped, eventually return Chinook salmon to the Tucannon River. Any few salmon that might return to the Tucannon itself will also be collected into the project.

  The W.T. Wooten Wildlife Area, pictured, spans approximately 17,000 acres. About 17 miles of Washington’s Tucannon River are located within the area’s boundaries, and elevations range from 4,100 feet on Hopkins Ridge down to 1,800 feet on the lowest section of the Tucannon River, according to the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife’s website.

“The plan is to create an interim living gene bank that is not associated with natural habitat,” Hesse says. “We are taking every Tucannon Chinook out of the river, their natural environment. A fish is at great risk when it can’t use its river. And this kind of action also badly strains tribal cultural and harvest connections to the river. But with so few fish, every action we could take now, including doing nothing, has large risks.”
“Until the transforming action all Snake River salmon need” – he means restoring the lower Snake River’s 140 miles of reservoir to free flowing river again, by removing the earthen sections of four dams – “our collaborative analysis tells us this translocation, with a few other interim actions, will get us more Tucannon adults back” than the sporadic dribble of natural production left. “Our purpose is to keep the behaviors, patterns, and genetics of Tucannon spring Chinook in existence until more permanent remedies are enacted, which must occur soon.”
Hesse calls the approach a “safety net offsite strategy,” whose high-risk choices tribal and state fish agencies now face as Snake River populations drop toward and to double digits.
Some possible actions, tailored to the situation, include translocation, cryo-preservation, captive-rearing assist in part of the life-cycle, perhaps coupled with targeted predator control and replacement of marine-derived nutrients that salmon once provided at no cost every year. The approach is expressly experimental, population-specific, and interim.
Dave Johnson, who just retired as head of Nez Perce Fisheries, puts the situation plainly: “Tucannon spring Chinook are the canary in the coal mine [for Snake River Chinook], and the canary is dying.”
The three collaborators will try to hold on to Washington’s last Snake River salmon population, knowing the risk is high they will fail. Whatever the outcome, the more Washington people keep watch on this last-gasp, high-risk effort – so that its governor, senators, and Congresspeople are led to keep watch too – the better.
The emergency Tucannon effort also presages the near future for salmon and salmon people in northeast Oregon and central Idaho.
Thirty years ago, the fine Northwest-based writer Tim Egan memorably described his home region: “The Pacific Northwest is simply this: wherever the salmon can get to.”
Mr. Egan is not being literal, but he is being truthful to history, experience, and feeling. By his measure, a large chunk of southeast Washington, the Tucannon River watershed, is, for now, no longer in the Northwest.
Let us pray it is temporary, but let’s not look away.

However, the South and the Midwest are the only regions where a family with typical or median income can afford a median-priced house, according to the report. The group considers a mortgage to be affordable if the monthly payment (principal and interest) is 25% or less of the family’s income.



The affordability gap is highest in the West, where the typical family income is $113,783, just over two-thirds of the $164,832 that would be needed to purchase a median-priced home.
The Northeast, where the typical family makes $114,559, is also unaffordable by this measure, as a median-priced home requires an income of $141,264.
In the Midwest, the median family income is $102,419, more than the $86,256 needed to buy a median-priced home. The same is true in the South, where the median income is $97,812, slightly more than the $96,720 required to buy a typical home.
Nationally, affordability increased slightly compared with June of 2024, with the typical family making $105,431, about 94% of the $111,648 it would need to buy the median-priced home. That’s up from about 92% in June 2024.
In a video posted Aug. 15, Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, said he expects lower interest rates to increase affordability in the months ahead.
“We know that mortgage rates will be coming down and that will bring additional buyers into the market. We just need to make sure we have more supply, more supply to meet that demand,” Yun said.

Then they heard about Newsom’s redistricting,Alexei Koseff,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/08/newsom-redistricting-conservative-opponents/,"Conservative opponents dominated the public comment at legislative hearings on Gov. Gavin Newsom’s congressional redistricting plan, though most were at the Capitol for an unrelated rally.","In summary
Conservative opponents dominated the public comment at legislative hearings on Gov. Gavin Newsom’s congressional redistricting plan, though most were at the Capitol for an unrelated rally.


For some of the Republican voters who oppose the partisan redistricting plan moving swiftly through the California Capitol this week, it felt like a divine appointment.
They arrived in Sacramento on Tuesday — thousands of them, by the busload, from Visalia and Riverside and beyond — for an entirely different mission. Pastor Jack Hibbs, the extremely online leader of the Calvary Chapel Chino Hills megachurch, had called his followers to the Capitol to rally against a bill that would expand who can serve as a child’s caregiver when their parents are detained by immigration authorities.
It just so happened, however, that the Legislature also scheduled two hearings that morning to advance Gov. Gavin Newsom’s controversial proposal asking voters to set aside the state’s independent redistricting commission and approve new congressional lines more favorable to Democrats. And as word spread among the flock, dozens of them crowded the halls outside the committee rooms, frustrated and weary conservatives lining up for their precious seconds to publicly denounce another indignity thrust upon them by California’s liberal leaders.
“They’ve been getting away with things for too long,” said Judy Escobedo, a 64-year-old retired teacher from Visalia, as she exited the Assembly hearing where she told legislators that their “childish” effort to override the redistricting commission made her want to move back to Texas. “We voted for that because we want to choose our politicians. We don’t want our politicians to choose their voters.”
Testifying against the redistricting plan was “topping on the cake” for Escobedo, who came for the Hibbs rally with her sisters. “Somebody has to do something,” she said, “and I figured it should be me.”
Despite heated opposition and even legal threats from California Republicans, who could lose more than half their remaining seats in Congress, the Democratic supermajority in the Legislature is poised to approve the plan by the end of this week. Newsom would then call a special election for Nov. 4, when voters would have the final say on the new map. 
A handful of supporters, most of them affiliated with organized labor, showed up at the hearings to speak in favor of what they argue is a necessary step to prevent President Donald Trump from rigging the outcome of the 2026 midterms. Trump is pressuring Republican-led states across the country to undertake an unusual mid-decade redistricting to shore up the narrow GOP majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.

“We are in a moment where we have to respond to an existential threat,” state Sen. Sabrina Certantes, a Riverside Democrat, said during the Senate hearing. “Do you expect Californians to unilaterally disarm ourselves when the Trump Republicans are wielding their control of state governments like weapons against democracy?”
But they were far outnumbered by the serendipitous throng of opponents, many of whom walked right off their chartered buses and into the line for public testimony.
Republicans feel ‘unrepresented’
Some were resigned that they would not halt what has appeared to be an increasing inevitability in recent weeks. Newsom has rallied public support through appearances with Democratic legislators who fled Texas to block a similar gerrymandering effort there.
“I’m not changing these people’s minds,” said David Bolog, a 55-year-old maintenance worker with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Since the coronavirus pandemic, he has been traveling to the Capitol weekly as a “citizen lobbyist” for right-leaning groups like Moms For Liberty.
“We already feel very unrepresented,” Bolog said. He was among a sparse crowd outside the Senate hearing earlier in the morning. “Even though you know it’s not going to stop it, you still have to say no.”
Behind him, Maria Carrillo entertained her children, ages 7 and 5. They left Riverside at 1 a.m. to make the drive to Sacramento for the Hibbs rally. Carrillo, a 36-year-old homeschool teacher, planned to turn their visit to the Capitol into a field trip for her children as well.
Like many Californians, Carrillo, who wore a shirt calling to keep men out of girls’ sports, said she had become politically active during the pandemic fights over shutdowns and mandatory vaccines. She wanted Democratic leaders to hear from some of the millions of Trump voters, like her, who supported the president’s agenda and would be disenfranchised by the new congressional lines.
“What I hope is they do listen to the real people who live in these communities and are affected by these policies,” she said.
Rep. Kevin Kiley voters show up
A contingent from the El Dorado County GOP huddled in a corner, monitoring the hearing but hesitant to testify against a plan they felt certain would be ramrodded through.
“We all know this is a farce anyway,” said Todd White of El Dorado Hills, the club’s chair.
“A redistricting war doesn’t benefit anybody,” said Doug Williams of South Lake Tahoe, the club’s vice chair. He said California was chasing Texas “”to the bottom of the barrel.”
The Democrats’ map moves El Dorado County from a sprawling rural district along the eastern border of California — represented by Rep. Kevin Kiley, a Rocklin Republican — to a new seat that stretches out from the more liberal Sacramento suburbs. Williams feared that the issues facing his mountainous community, such as wildfire preparedness and the declining availability of home insurance, would be overlooked. 
“This is only designed to benefit one person and that’s Gavin Newsom,” White said, alluding to expectations that Newsom will soon launch a campaign for president. White complained that the governor was using taxpayer money to run a special election and “he’s made it all about himself.”
“Why isn’t he doing his job?” club treasurer Heather Masten said. After some deliberation, she stepped into the hearing to deliver a brief comment in opposition.
Then the group wandered over to the Assembly hearing to do it all over again.
“We’ll be here all day,” White said, “just getting oppressed by the majority party.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/081925_Redistricting-Hearing_FG_CM_06.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-19 21:56:20.479207

(Photo by Peter Hall/Capital-Star)The Trump administration has cleared the way for states to resume building electric vehicle charging stations after freezing a $5 billion EV infrastructure initiative earlier this year. 
Pennsylvania is among the leading states in the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, with nearly $77 million in federal funding committed to 90 public-private partnerships to build charging stations along designated routes across the commonwealth. 
With the program’s initial objective achieved, the state is poised to take the next steps with broader deployment of the funds. But, it has been unable to do so since the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) halted the program, a state Department of Transportation spokesperson said.
“Without federal guidelines, we were unable to move forward as quickly as we could have,” PennDOT spokesperson Zachary Appleby said. “The Shapiro administration has consistently pushed for guidelines and a clear path to accessing funds made available to our state by Congress.”
There are now about 20 charging stations built with NEVI funds in operation across Pennsylvania. Over the course of the five-year program, the commonwealth is set to receive more than $171 million.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Citing concerns about its efficiency, the FHWA rescinded the program’s guidelines for a review in February, shortly after President Donald Trump took office. At the time, 84% of the program’s funds were unobligated, which the agency said was “a clear signal of the program’s failure.”
Pennsylvania had expended only $3.1 million of the funds it had received when the program was halted, according the U.S. Department of Transportation.
After a federal judge in Washington ordered the administration to resume the program, the FHWA issued new guidelines Aug. 11 and gave states until Sept. 10 to resubmit plans for the next round of funding. Gov. Josh Shapiro was among 16 governors and attorneys general who sued the Trump administration to release the funding.
Expressing reluctance to proceed with the program, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the new guidance cuts out “red tape” left by the previous administration and gives states more flexibility in how to use the money.

“If Congress is requiring the federal government to support charging stations, let’s cut the waste and do it right,” Duffy said in a statement. “While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress’ will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently.”
The FHWA said its review of the program found the Biden administration wasted time, money and public trust in implementing the program. Under Duffy’s leadership, it said the agency has streamlined the NEVI guidance to align with the Trump administration’s priorities of safety, efficiency and innovation. 
Congress funded the NEVI program in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021. In addition to $5 billion for EV charging infrastructure, it also provides $2.5 billion for other alternative fuels including hydrogen, propane, and natural gas.
Initially, projects funded with the money were to be focused on Alternative Fuel Corridors along designated routes across the country. In Pennsylvania, the corridors follow the commonwealth’s interstate highway network. 
According to PennDOT, the NEVI funded charging stations have provided about 28,000 EV charging sessions and eliminated an estimated 1.56 million pounds of carbon dioxide emissions, which are a contributing factor in climate change.
In addition to the program, the state Department of Environmental Protection paid to build EV chargers as part of the Driving PA Forward program, using some of the $118 million the commonwealth received in a settlement with Volkswagen over its diesel emissions cheating scandal. Those include new chargers at the North Somerset and South Somerset service plazas on the Pennsylvania Turnpike.
PennDOT spokesman Zachary Appleby said Pennsylvania achieved full build-out of its Alternative Fuel Corridors in January and can now use remaining funds to build EV chargers along other state roads. 
“We plan to stay the course with a competitive program that maximizes available NEVI funds to provide a robust EV charging program in Pennsylvania,” Appleby said.
The new  guidelines were issued in accordance with Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order titled “Unleashing American Energy,” which, among other objectives, sought to “eliminate the ‘electric vehicle (EV) mandate’ and promote true consumer choice.”
According to the FHWA, the revised guidelines minimize requirements for state NEVI plans that are not included in statutes or regulations and simplifies the state approval process.

They reduce the requirements to engage with and consulate communities where the projects would be built. The revisions eliminate language specifying engagement with rural, underserved and disadvantaged communities, to ensure diverse views are considered and that EV infrastructure provides equitable access.
The guidelines also eliminate requirements to explain how the state plans will provide opportunities for small businesses, including minority- and women-owned businesses and target at least 40 percent of the program’s benefits toward disadvantaged communities.
They also do away with requirements for states to address consumer protection, emergency evacuation plans, and environmental considerations. 
States would have greater flexibility, however, to determine how far apart chargers should be along alternative fuel corridors, when the corridor requirements are satisfied and to select projects where the charging stations are owned by businesses that host them.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_5282-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-19 20:57:22.941952

This ends now.” 
Bondi sent the letter on Aug. 13, and requested answers from the recipients by Tuesday. She demanded the recipients confirm their “commitment to complying with federal law” and identify “the immediate initiatives” they are taking to “eliminate laws, policies and practices that impede federal immigration enforcement.”

Gov. Jared Polis and Acting Denver City Attorney Katie McLoughlin responded on Tuesday, but neither agreed to change any laws or policies, based on letters obtained by Newsline. Both Denver and Colorado have laws that limit certain types of cooperation between local or state officials and federal immigration authorities for non-criminal matters.
“Colorado has and will continue to comply with federal law,” Polis said in his response letter. “Colorado, like many states, will not allow the federal government to commandeer our public safety resources, and our right to do so is protected by the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution. We do not find any conflict between state and federal law in this matter …”
Polis said that “Colorado is not a sanctuary state,” and added that the state “fully cooperates with federal authorities in identifying, apprehending, and prosecuting criminals — regardless of immigration status.”










Denver is not going to be bullied ... Not by the Trump administration, not by anyone.


– Jordan Fuja, spokesperson with the Denver mayor’s office


The Trump administration, which has pursued mass deportations, has faced setbacks in its attempts to force more local cooperation with immigration arrests, including a court reversal on July 25, when a federal judge dismissed a sanctuary policies case against Illinois, Chicago and Cook County. 
The state and local policies reflect a “decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law — a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment,” Judge Lindsay Jenkins wrote in an order now under appeal.
The Justice Department on Aug. 5 released a list of jurisdictions it deems sanctuaries, including 12 states, the District of Columbia, four counties and 18 cities. Denver and Colorado are on the list, and both jurisdictions face federal lawsuits challenging their immigration-related policies.
“Denver is not going to be bullied,” said Jordan Fuja, a spokesperson with the Denver mayor’s office. “Not by the Trump administration, not by anyone. We have always followed the law and will continue fighting to protect the rights of residents, as well as the federal funding they are entitled to as taxpayers.”

 Crapo says housing was a top concern in Idaho in recent survey

Crapo said Tuesday that his office has been reviewing a housing survey conducted between March 31 and May 31, and noted affordability of housing emerged as a top issue. 
Of the 5,000 Idahoans who responded, many said that local wages did not keep pace with escalating costs of housing, according to a summary of preliminary results from Crapo’s office. Specific numbers were not yet available, Crapo’s staff said. 
The senator said in a later interview with the Idaho Capital Sun that the biggest complaints he is hearing across the state are that there isn’t enough supply and the costs are too high. 
He highlighted the extension and expansion of the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit — which provides tax incentives for developers to build affordable housing units — in the major tax and spending bill Congress passed into law in July. The law permanently boosts the number of credits that will be available for qualifying projects through two types of credits provided in the program. 
One credit program allows developers to write-off around 9% of their construction costs each year for 10 years — this number is capped for each state by a number determined by the Internal Revenue Service each year annually. The law increased each state’s allocation by 12%. 
The program also offers a credit worth 4% of the project cost. While there is no cap on how many of these credits may be allocated per state, there was a requirement that half the project be paid for with a certain type of tax-exempt bond, called private activity bonds, which do have a cap. The bill lowered the bond requirement to 25% of the project. 
“Using the tax code to incentivize the formation of capital around housing is another one of the objectives that we have all in an effort to try to reduce the biggest complaint that we’re picking up on our survey,” Crapo said, “which is the cost of housing and the ability to access affordability of housing.”

Turner, a former NFL player and Texas state lawmaker, said one of his priorities would be to reduce regulations as a way to reduce the cost of building housing. He cited his move to revoke the Biden-era Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule that was meant to tackle housing discrimination.
He said Tuesday that the rule “made Washington, (D.C.), really a national zoning board.” 
Asked about safety codes and regulations, Scott said those would remain. 
“When we talk about bringing out regulations, we talk about bringing down duplicative, burdensome things that cost developers and builders an exorbitant amount of money, which really can be a game changer, whether they do the project or not,” Turner said. 
Crapo said he also supported reducing regulations on builders and that he would encourage local jurisdictions to do the same. 
Turner also served in the first Trump administration heading up HUD’s “Opportunity Zone” program, which is an incentive program focused on “economically distressed communities.” Investments in these areas, which are nominated by state officials and certified by the IRS, are provided tax incentives. 
Turner said he visited a food warehouse built in Twin Falls that was the first opportunity zone project in Idaho, according to Idaho News 6. 
Turner said that 700 new housing units have been built inside opportunity zones in Idaho and 4,000 jobs have been created. 
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which became the major tax and spending law, also made permanent the opportunity zone program.

 Turner has ‘no concern at all’ about effect of proposed time-limits to housing assistance 

During Turner’s nomination hearing he argued that housing assistance, such as public housing or Section 8 vouchers, should have time limits, the Associated Press reported. Turner and the Trump administration have proposed a two-year limit on rental assistance programs for able-bodied adults. 
There are 27,800 Idahoans who used federal rental assistance, according to a January 2025 fact sheet from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Of those who use the assistance, 24% are seniors, 30% are people who have a disability and 49% are people in families with children. 
Research from New York University, as reported by the AP, found that the majority of Section 8 recipients who could lose housing would be those with children. 
Turner told reporters Tuesday “there’s no concern at all” that the proposed time limits will push families out of housing. 
“Government subsidies were never meant to be a hammock,” Turner said. “They’re meant to be a trampoline.”

The Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate have headquarters in northeast South Dakota, with a small portion of the Lake Traverse Reservation in southeast North Dakota. A series of meetings took place at the Dakota Magic Casino near Hankinson.
North Dakota and tribal officials discussed issues such as gambling, health care and tribal tourism.

Rep. Dawson Holle, R-Mandan, chair of the North Dakota Legislature’s Tribal and State Relations Committee, said the committee “is setting the tone that we want to be in conversation with our tribal leaders.”
The Legislature first invited the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate to be part of the North Dakota Indian Affairs Commission in 2007, said Sen. Tim Mathern, D-Fargo, vice chair of the committee. Tuesday was the first time the legislative committee had met on the Lake Traverse Reservation, Mathern said.
“Your presence here today demonstrates respect for our people,” Sisseton-Wahpeton Chair J. Garret Renville told the committee. 
Tuesday was the first meeting of the committee for the 2025-27 interim. Holle said the group plans to meet at each of the five tribal nations that share geography with North Dakota. The committee will meet next in September on the Fort Berthold Reservation with the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation. 
Gov. Kelly Armstrong and other state officials participated in separate meetings with tribal leaders Tuesday. 
Armstrong met last month with officials from the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and earlier this year with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. 
The North Dakota Indian Affairs Commission is facilitating visits by the governor to strengthen relationships with the tribes, according to the Governor’s Office.

By one vote, a legislative committee agrees to consider a draft measure again in November when amendments are possible.
The post Wyoming lawmakers advance bill decriminalizing corner crossing appeared first on WyoFile .","On a 7-6 vote, a legislative panel advanced a bill that declares corner crossing is not an act of criminal trespass or violation of game and fish laws.
The Joint Travel, Recreation, Wildlife and Cultural Resources Interim Committee passed the draft “Corner crossing clarification” for further consideration and potential amendments in November.
The close vote reflects uncertainty about whether the U.S. Supreme Court might consider a lower-court ruling that corner crossing is not trespassing and what effect that might have on a new Wyoming law.
Corner crossing is the act of stepping from one piece of public land to another where they meet with two pieces of private property. Corner crossers do not set foot on private land,but they pass through the airspace above it.
Elk Mountain Ranch owner Fred Eshelman sued four Missouri hunters claiming they trespassed while corner crossing to hunt on public land surrounded by his 20,000-acre wildlife-rich ranch in Carbon County. The hunters did not set foot on his property, and the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of appeals sided with them.
“We know that corner crossing right now is legal.” Karlee Provenza
“We know that corner crossing right now is legal,” Rep. Karlee Provenza, D-Laramie, told the committee. “This is putting in statute that that is the case.”
The Supreme Court could receive the case as early as Sept. 17, the attorney representing the hunters told the committee Tuesday in Casper. Ryan Semerad also said it’s possible the file could be distributed to the justices later, on Oct. 1.
The court could decide on Oct. 10 or Oct. 17 whether to hear the appeal, he said. If justices want the U.S. solicitor general to weigh in and outline his views, that would delay action by a couple of months, Semerad said.
If justices ultimately decide they do want to hear the case, it would be scheduled for the first months of 2026, he said. Inviting the solicitor general’s views could push the case into the summer of next year.
Privatization of public land?
The 10th Circuit decision earlier this year clarifies that corner crossing allows legal public access to public land in the checkerboard area of land ownership in southern Wyoming. Some 2.4 million acres in the state are considered “corner locked” if corner crossing is illegal. The decision also applies to Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas.
A Carbon County deputy in 2021 cited the Missouri hunters for criminal trespass, but a jury found them not guilty. Corner-crossing supporters say prosecuting corner crossers allows private landowners like Eshelman to exclusively enjoy the benefits of public land that his ranch surrounds.
The slim majority of the legislative committee agreed to keep the bill on the table.
“The reason that I’m willing to send it on [is] so that we keep it on the radar screen,” Sen Bill Landen, R-Casper, said, “so that the rest of our legislative friends can get a look at this issue and know that it’s not going away.”
The appeals court used this graphic to depict corner crossing. (U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals)
Semerad explained the measure as one that would remove law enforcement from relatively insignificant trespass claims that might arise out of corner crossing. Landowners could still sue trespassers — not necessarily corner crossers — in civil court.
“I don’t think there is a person who believes that someone should be taken off the public lands in handcuffs because they stepped on the wrong blade of grass,” he said.
He won agreement from Casper Republican Rep. Elissa Campbell. “I think it will reduce the burden on law enforcement, whether it’s our sheriffs or our wardens, … and adds some clarity,” she said. “Clarity is a good thing and needs to be in place, regardless of how this court case shakes out.”
Rep. Andy Byron, R-Jackson, voted to move the bill forward. “This is something that was brought up to us,” he said of grassroots support. “We voted on it as … a priority. People have spoken.”
Provenza made a larger case.
“There were 500 people that showed up at the capitol to tell our federal delegation that their public lands aren’t for sale,” she said, recalling a rally earlier this year. “They did it because they enjoy them, because they want access, because they want to be able to get to those public lands.”
“So this issue isn’t complicated to me,” she said. “Do we want to protect the Wyoming people from unnecessary prosecution for accessing their land?
“My answer is ‘yes.’”
Some skepticism
Six legislators were skeptical. “I don’t know how this gets resolved without it going to the Supreme Court,” Rep. Bob Wharff, R-Evanston, said.
Others raised worries about whether corners are well monumented by surveys, whether cell phone apps that use GPS data are accurate, and the prospect of people using e-bikes and deer carriers while crossing corners, something the 10th Circuit did not condone.
Semerad offered more information regarding the Supreme Court, his outlook and the court’s history.
“We certainly don’t think the Supreme Court needs to take this case at all,” he said. “We think the 10th Circuit got it right.”
If the court does hear the case, the hunters are ready to defend their position, he said.
This law on which the hunters won — the Unlawful Inclosures Act of 1885 — has only been addressed by the Supreme Court four times, Semerad said: in 1890, 1897, 1922 and 1979.
“It is quite literally a once-in-a-generation type issue,” he said.
“It is quite possible that they take it,”

April McClain Delaney (D-6th), Gov. Wes Moore and Westernport Mayor Judy Hamilton speak to reporters In July. The three were part of a meeting to discuss a decision by FEMA to deny federal aid to help areas of the state recover from devastating floods in May. Moore appealed that denial Tuesday in a letter to President Donald Trump. (File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters.)The cost of damage to two Western Maryland counties from a flash flood in May has more than doubled, easily justifying the need for federal emergency aid, state officials said Tuesday.
The new estimates were detailed in a letter from Gov. Wes Moore (D) to President Donald Trump (R). The letter sent Tuesday makes good on Moore’s announcement last month to appeal a denial of federal aid by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“At the time of our original request, local jurisdictions and Maryland state agencies reported an estimated $15.8 million in damages,” Moore wrote in his seven-page letter to Trump.
The governor said in the letter, which was released to media, that state emergency management officials found $17.9 million in additional costs related to the flooding in Allegany and Garrett Counties that are eligible for federal aid, bringing the overall estimate of eligible damages from the May flood to $33.7 million.
“This amount is nearly triple Maryland’s statewide threshold, indicating the need for FEMA Public Assistance,” Moore wrote.
The damage came from “extreme storms” that inundated parts of Allegany and Garrett counties in May.
George’s Creek surged to more than 12 feet above major flood stage. Wills Creek in Cumberland rose 8 feet. The Potomac River also flooded. Areas of both counties were evacuated. Midland, Lonaconing, and Westernport were among the hardest-hit areas.
Lawmakers call denial of disaster assistance for Western Maryland floods a ‘gut punch’

Moore declared a state of emergency in the area. In addition to providing some state aid, an application for federal recovery funds was also submitted.
FEMA denied that request in a brief letter that offered no detailed justification.
Moore’s letter Tuesday makes good on a vow to appeal that denial.
Last month, the governor traveled to Westernport to meet with local officials in a closed-door meeting. Afterward, he noted that an aid request from West Virginia had been approved for a lower amount of damages, and that the denial of federal aid for Maryland “is petty, it is partisan, and it is punishing and is deeply unfair to the people of Allegany and Garrett County.”
“I’ve stopped trying to do the mental gymnastics of trying to understand how this administration is making its decisions, or what to expect when it comes to partnership with them,” Moore told reporters last month.
In his appeal letter Tuesday, Moore made no mention of West Virginia but instead spent seven pages elaborating on damage to public infrastructure, homes and schools left in the wake of the flooding.
While Westernport Elementary School suffered severe first-floor flood damage, Moore said the school will re-open this fall with students attending classes on upper floors as repairs continue.
But the school has no functioning boiler. Moore noted that the mean temperature in the area in September is 66 degrees. Schools typically turn on the heating systems once temperatures fall below 68 degrees. Moore called the lack of a working heating system “a critical issue.”
The flood also damaged the school cafeteria and kitchen. Breakfast and lunch for students will have to be brought in daily from another school.
Moore added that the state and counties are working together to improve data collection using existing weather stations in the area.
“The terrain in the mountains has made forecasting and monitoring in the area difficult, and incorporation of these tools will improve these areas as well as tracking severe weather trends,” Moore wrote. “By identifying and taking corrective actions, post-disaster mitigation can help Allegany and Garrett Counties reduce future financial burden of property and infrastructure damage, recover faster, and take a more proactive stance towards disaster preparedness.”

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser filed a brief Tuesday outlining the state’s arguments defending a 2019 Colorado law that bans conversion therapy for minors in a case before the U.S. Supreme Court.
The case concerns a Colorado state law that bans conversion therapy, the practice of trying to change a person’s sexual orientation, such as to eliminate same-sex attraction, or gender identity. Conservative religious law firm Alliance Defending Freedom represents the plaintiff, Kaley Chiles, a Colorado Springs counselor who argues the Colorado law violates a counselor’s right to free speech by prohibiting certain conversations related to gender and sexuality. 
The named defendant in the case is Patty Salazar, executive director of the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies. The Supreme Court decided to hear the case in March, and will hear arguments in the case during its term that starts in October.

Colorado law protects patients from receiving “substandard care” and that conversion therapy has been regulated in the U.S. for more than a century, Weiser said in a press conference Tuesday. He said the law does not prohibit a provider from “sharing information, content, or viewpoints with a patient,” and therapists are still permitted to tell patients about conversion practices offered by religious entities or others.
“There’s never been a First Amendment objection to protecting patients and prohibiting substandard … care regardless of whether or not the care is carried out through words,” Weiser said. 
About half of U.S. states and Washington, D.C., ban conversion therapy, and the American Medical Association opposes it. The Human Rights Campaign, a national organization that advocates equality for all LGBTQ+ people, says “every mainstream medical and mental health organization” has rejected the practice for decades and that it can lead to depression, anxiety, drug use, homelessness and suicide, particularly for minors. 
The 2019 law prohibits licensed psychiatrists and mental health care providers from “engaging in conversion therapy” with patients under 18 years old. Providers who conduct conversion therapy are subject to disciplinary action from the appropriate licensing board, though Weiser said the state hasn’t taken disciplinary action against any providers since the law went into effect. 
“There have never been any disciplinary actions against the therapist in this case,” Weiser said of Chiles. “None of what the therapist is alleging actually appears to violate Colorado law, because she says that she’s not trying to change a patient’s sexual orientation or gender identity.” 
Chiles’ petition to the Supreme Court says she is a practicing Christian who “believes that people flourish when they live consistently with God’s design, including their biological sex.” It says she views her career “as an outgrowth of her faith” and that many clients come to her because of her Christianity. 
A ruling against the state would open the possibility to challenging other licensing and malpractice processes, Weiser said. The brief the state filed says, “From this country’s infancy, states have exercised their power to regulate professional healthcare treatment to protect patients from substandard care,” and that has always included treatments performed with words like therapy.
“What is at stake is whether or not the Supreme Court opens up a First Amendment exemption to professional licensing and malpractice systems that are designed to prevent patients from suffering substandard care, and that is the core argument we make in our brief,” Weiser said. “The Supreme Court has never created such an exemption before. They shouldn’t do so now.”
According to The Associated Press, the court declined to review a similar challenge in 2023. While the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld the Colorado law, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has struck down local bans on conversion therapy in Florida.

(Micah Drew/ Daily Montanan)Maybe you’ve never heard of it, but this past weekend, some insect-infatuated communities around the county celebrated National Honey Bee Day. Originally established as “Honey Bee Awareness Day” by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 2009, the holiday recognizes the crucial role that more than 2.99 million bee colonies in the U.S. play in pollinating more than $15 billion worth of crops, in addition to producing honey and beeswax. 
In Montana, this year’s Honey Bee Day is a little extra special following a new law expanding opportunities for everyday Montanans to engage in beekeeping. 
House Bill 624, introduced by Rep. Eric Tilleman, R-Cascade, doubled the number of hives that a hobbyist beekeeper may own to 10, and also increased the number of apiary sites per registration from one to five. 
“This bill, at the core, promotes the fundamental values of Montana, conservation, agriculture and self-sufficiency,” Tilleman said during a House Agriculture Committee hearing on the legislation early this year. “Allowing hobbyist apiaries more beehives per person not only produces clean and cheap, delicious honey for their toast, but also for their wild game dishes. It also augments the pollination of the gardens and their neighbor’s gardens.”
According to the Montana Department of Agriculture, the state typically ranks in the top five in the nation for honey production and has a robust commercial pollinating industry. 
The department maintains a registry of all apiary sites in the state with more than 6,700 apiaries, though there are likely even more hives that aren’t registered, according to the state entomologist. 
Beekeepers in the state fall under one of four classifications— commercial yards; landowners; hobbyists; and pollination yards. 
While a vast majority of beehives in the state are commercial hives, there is a growing number of landowner and hobbyist beekeepers. Landowners can register any number of hives as long as they manage the hives themselves, while hobbyists, who can now own 10 hives, can locate them at different properties. 
“Small-scale beekeepers, I think, are one of the big pieces that’s helpful for the state because they form these great communities,” Amy Savage, the state entomologist, told the Daily Montanan. “Most counties have a hobbyist group or club that meets and shares information about beekeeping and the best way to keep bees happy and healthy. They’re also key to helping share information about diseases and controlling pests, which keeps all beehives in Montana safer.”
In the Missoula area, the Big Sky Beekeepers Club boasts roughly 55 active members representing more than 100 apiaries in the area. 
Club president Mike Guess got his start beekeeping more than a decade ago, with two hives on Finley Point on Flathead Lake. His bees didn’t do well in his first two seasons, and he came to the realization that despite robust cherry orchards around the lake, there just weren’t enough resources to provide for his beekeeping operation.
He ended up donating his hives to the PEAS Farm in Missoula, a community-run farm, that’s the “perfect environment for bees.” He has worked as the volunteer beekeeper of that apiary ever since. 
“The insect is just such an interesting creature, to look at, to recognize it’s worth to the plants it’s foraging among, and just evolutionarily — it’s just an incredible creature,” Guess said. “The hive mechanics — one queen, thousands of workers, most which only live for five to six weeks — but just this interspecies knowledge that gets transferred genetically to the next generation… it’s amazing to observe that up close.”
Guess took a certification course at the University of Montana to become a master beekeeper and has been helping manage the local club’s mentorship program. 
The biggest barrier for new beekeepers is the cost, Guess said. Two hives, which is the recommended number to start with, can run $1,000. 
“This is not an inexpensive hobby. Of course, many hobbies have expenses — golf clubs or skis, or tennis rackets and memberships,” Guess said. “But you have to put serious thought into maintaining beehives.”
Another expense barrier all beekeepers deal with is replacing hives after colony deaths. 
Guess said that a critical step to successful beekeeping is treating hives for mites and working with other local beekeepers to track and ward off diseases that threaten the colonies. 
Since the mid-2000s, there has been a well-documented and well-publicized decline of bee colonies, highlighted by “colony collapse disorder.” Many beekeepers reported large-scale losses, including as many as 90% of hives, which were attributed to myriad sources including mites, pesticides, diseases and changes in habitat.

While the year-to-year loss of bee colonies has varied, the last year was “catastrophic” nationwide, according to Project Apis m., a honey bee health research nonprofit. 
According to an April press release, data showed that more than 1.6 million bee colonies were lost. Commercial beekeepers lost an average of 62% of colonies from summer 2024 to spring 2025.
“In January 2025, beekeepers across the country began reporting unexpected large-scale honey bee losses—we now know the largest ever recorded in the U.S.,” said Danielle Downey, executive director of Project Apis m. 
Beekeepers saw similar losses in Montana during the last year, according to Michelle Flenniken, a virologist at Montana State University who specializes in bees. Project Apis m. data shows large- and medium-sized commercial operations in the state lost roughly 60% of beehives.
Guess said that in the Missoula club, losses were close to 50% — another reason he recommends hobbyist beekeepers have at least two hives. If you lose one, you can split your hive the next year to recover. But losing a single hive each year can quickly boost expenses and increased colony deaths could limit the expansion of hobbyist apiaries. 
“The consensus is that this is another honeybee collapse period,” Guess said. “Lots of people agree that if the western honeybee were to disappear from our environment, it could lead to the collapse of the human food supply.” 
With such high stakes, there’s a concerted effort by scientists in independent labs and within the USDA to understand what’s behind the latest die-offs and what could be done to prevent them. 
Flenniken said that research by the USDA that has been submitted for peer review identified high levels of two viruses responsible for colony losses across the U.S. which are spread through parasitic mites. 
“That doesn’t mean it’s the only factor, but viruses and mites are a huge problem for bee colonies and that’s what we study here in our lab using federal grant money,” Flenniken said.
One recent study Flenniken’s lab published this month looked at viruses that do not always have visible symptoms in adult bees, and therefore are hard to detect, including one which was identified in the USDA research as contributing to the national colony loss. Her lab studied the flight speed and duration of infected bees on a “flight mill” (the equivalent of a treadmill, but for bees) and found that different viruses affect the speed and distance the honey bees flew. 
Studies like those conducted in Flenniken’s lab are key to understanding bee health on a large scale and finding ways to control and prevent the spread of diseases. 
“To understand what’s killing the bee colonies, it takes science, it takes federal scientific funding and experts in the fields who can understand the role of pesticides, mites, and other risks to colonies,” Flenniken said. “That’s your federal taxpayer dollars at work, and it’s important to local communities and to commercial agriculture around the country.”
Flenniken said that while adding new beekeepers and expanded opportunities for owning hives can be great for pollinating local communities, hobbyist beekeepers bear a lot of responsibility to understand colony health and how to protect their hives. 
“If new beekeepers don’t control their mites, that can be bad for neighboring operations,” Flenniken said. “It’s not that just more colonies are good; more well-managed colonies are good.” 
Flenniken also noted that the number of hobbyist apiaries, even with additional hives, pales in comparison to the state’s commercial operations and can’t make up for large-scale losses. Department of Agriculture data shows that while 88% of registered beekeepers are hobbyists or landowners, they make up less than 4% of bee colonies statewide. 
Guess said that while he’s seen a growing interest in individuals around Missoula ooking to pursue beekeeping as a hobby, he isn’t sure that the new Montana law will boost existing hobbyist apiary numbers. 
“Most of our beekeepers in the club have 2-3 hives and even folks who have five, might not need an incremental increase of one or two more,” he said. “Ten hives is a strong hobby, in my opinion, almost becoming a small business. I don’t know how many hobbyist beekeepers have the time, energy and money to keep that up.”
Montanans can help the state’s bee population without owning hives — including by growing flowers and pollinator-friendly plants.

Bureau of Information and Telecommunications spokesperson Lisa Rahja said it’s not clear how long the power outage will impact state operations and services, she said. 
“The event affected all state-hosted services and some network communications,” Rahja said in an emailed statement. “The state engineer and BIT technical staff have investigated the root cause and are taking measures to remediate.”
The data center is not a single location, Rahja later told South Dakota Searchlight, but rather the term used by the IT bureau to refer to all the hardware scattered across multiple locations and connected to the state’s communications network.
Rahja said the state was still looking into the cause and extent of the outages. But the situation was not weather-related, she said, and that “there’s no reason to believe there’s any other external factors.”
“We’re trying to really get that back up and running, but we can’t even nail down what part of it is having the issues, because it’s all very large and complex for the entire state.”
An incident command center was launched Tuesday to streamline communications between the bureau and the office of the state engineer as they work to resolve the issue.
Outages across multiple departments
Some websites were entirely down Tuesday, including websites for the secretary of state, attorney general, auditor, treasurer, bureau of finance and management, as well as departments of social services, education, agriculture and natural resources, tourism, tribal relations and public safety. 
The state’s medical marijuana page was down even as the state’s Medical Marijuana Oversight Committee met in Pierre. SD.net, the state-run service that streams government meetings, only streamed portions of that committee’s Tuesday meeting. Coverage was also spotty for the audio stream of the state’s Rules Review committee.
South Dakota’s transparency website, Open SD, and the website that hosts meeting agendas, minutes and calendars for dozens of state regulatory and oversight boards and commissions were also affected.
Calls to the state Department of Health, which maintains the medical marijuana page, were dropped throughout the day. The state Department of Public Safety posted on Facebook that it would close driver’s license exam stations until network service returned. A note on the Department of Revenue homepage said the department and clients were having issues accessing the state’s online filing system.

The state Legislature and Unified Judicial System sites were working, though the UJS homepage said “connectivity issues” might prevent some online features from working, including the state’s eCourts system. 
In a post on X, Attorney General Marty Jackley apologized for a lack of public access to his office’s services
“You may not be able to reach our office at this time,” Jackley said.
Local impacts
Local agencies that rely on South Dakota state network access were impacted on Tuesday. The Minnehaha County Treasurer’s office in Sioux Falls, for example, was unable to access the records needed to issue license plates and vehicle registrations.
“Computer issue — no registrations can be printed,” a sign at the treasurer’s office read. “We can review your paperwork.”
Down the hall at the Minnehaha County Register of Deeds, county employees were unable to access any state records on births, deaths or marriages. People could pay in advance for records they’d need to get at a later date, Assistant Treasurer Vicki Fuglsby said, but only if they paid cash.
The system for accepting credit card payments is tied to the state and wasn’t working, Fuglsby said.
“We had to turn away people looking for marriage licenses,” Fuglsby said.
The Lawrence County Treasurer’s office in Deadwood, like every other Treasurer’s office in the state, was unable to print vehicle registrations on Tuesday. Typically, there’s a mailing fee for customers who ask that records be sent, said Sally Atkinson, the First Deputy Treasurer in Lawrence County.
On Tuesday, attendants took checks and prepared paperwork for registrations, titles and the like, and offered to send the documents without the fee.
“It’s not their fault. They drove up here to get this done, and now they can’t,” Atkinson said.

The Patapsco River channel into the Port of Baltimore was reopened Tuesday afternoon after a fiery explosion on a cargo ship Monday night closed the channel for the better part of a day while the Coast Guard investigated.
The incident began about 6:30 p.m. Monday when the bow of the coal-carrying cargo ship W-Sapphire erupted in a fireball as it was leaving the port, not far from the remaining wreckage of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which collapsed last year. Livestream video footage shows the explosion, followed by black smoke billowing from the ship as it slowly continues its path on the Patapsco River.
The U.S. Coast Guard confirmed to WTOP that there were 23 people and two pilots on board the coal-bearing ship. The Maryland Department of Emergency Management reported on X and the Baltimore City Fire Department reported in a post on Facebook that no injuries to the crew had been reported, and there was no damage found beyond the W-Sapphire, a 751-foot bulk carrier from Liberia.
“Fireboats remain on scene as the Coast Guard and other agencies begin their investigation. The vessel will be moved to a designated anchorage area and held there until cleared by the Coast Guard,” the fire department wrote Monday night.
Key Bridge deconstruction continues as officials eye initial effort for a new span

By Tuesday, the W-Sapphire had been moved and anchored near the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, where the Coast Guard established a safety zone for 500 yards around the vessel.
The explosion blew a hatch off the front of the W-Sapphire and into the river, posing a potential threat to navigation that led the Coast Guard to close the channel for 2,000 yards around the possible resting place of the hatch. By Tuesday evening, that safety zone had been lifted, but the Coast Guard imposed draft restrictions on ships passing through the area and said a 500-yard safety zone could be imposed when recovery of the hatch began.
The explosion occurred not far from the remains of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which collapsed in the early morning hours on March 26, 2024, when the container ship Dali lost power and careened into the bridge, causing most of it to collapse into the river below.
Six construction workers were killed in the collapse. The destruction and extensive recovery efforts raised concerns about the implications to international shipping and commerce — the Port of Baltimore is the ninth-busiest port in the nation. But the channel was cleared and reopened within weeks.
Crews are now involved in removing remaining parts of the Key Bridge in preparation for a higher, longer replacement span, which is expected to be completed in 2028.

A recent National Association of Realtors report found affordability increased slightly from last year, but the typical family is still priced out in the West and Northeast. (Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer)Housing became more affordable this June, as higher incomes and slightly lower interest rates overcame higher prices, according to a National Association of Realtors report.
However, the South and the Midwest are the only regions where a family with typical or median income can afford a median-priced house, according to the report. The group considers a mortgage to be affordable if the monthly payment (principal and interest) is 25% or less of the family’s income.



The affordability gap is highest in the West, where the typical family income is $113,783, just over two-thirds of the $164,832 that would be needed to purchase a median-priced home.
The Northeast, where the typical family makes $114,559, is also unaffordable by this measure, as a median-priced home requires an income of $141,264.
In the Midwest, the median family income is $102,419, more than the $86,256 needed to buy a median-priced home. The same is true in the South, where the median income is $97,812, slightly more than the $96,720 required to buy a typical home.
Nationally, affordability increased slightly compared with June of 2024, with the typical family making $105,431, about 94% of the $111,648 it would need to buy the median-priced home. That’s up from about 92% in June 2024.
In a video posted Aug. 15, Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, said he expects lower interest rates to increase affordability in the months ahead.
“We know that mortgage rates will be coming down and that will bring additional buyers into the market. We just need to make sure we have more supply, more supply to meet that demand,” Yun said.

Greg Gianforte speaks during a ribbon-cutting ceremony for EquipmentShare, a new buisness in Helena, on Aug. 18, 2025. (Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)Montana’s construction industry is growing, and so are investments into it.
Gov. Greg Gianforte helped cut the ribbon Monday at EquipmentShare, a new rental service business in Helena. The company is expected to open four locations in Montana, with an investment of $81 million in the state, according to the Governor’s office. 
The Missouri-based company is also expected to add over 80 jobs to the state, Gianforte said. Its website states it has 6,900 employees across 326 locations.
“We’ve seen remarkable interest in businesses expanding here, in large part because of our pro-jobs, pro-business policies,” Gianforte said during an interview Monday. “We’re excited to see EquipmentShare making this investment in Montana. It’s going to mean our construction industry is more efficient and safer, and means jobs in this business.”
Mark Wallace, a representative for EquipmentShare, explained why the company looks at the state as a place for growth.
“We see Montana as a place that not only has a thriving business environment, but is continuing to develop into the future,” Wallace told the Daily Montanan. “So the goal here is to build the future of construction in Montana with Montanans.”
EquipmentShare rents a variety of equipment, including boom lifts, industrial AC units and earthmoving equipment. Its offerings were on display Monday afternoon, with lifts extended around the yard and buckets of excavators filled with ice and cold drinks.
The company also provides some disaster relief services and rentals.
“We’re veterans in the disaster response category of equipment needs and construction needs, job site needs,” Wallace said. “We’ve unfortunately seen a number of natural disasters around the country, but thankfully, we’ve been in a position where we have a local branch and amazing team members across the country who are willing to jump up and assist the community in any way.”
During remarks at the event, Gianforte expressed optimism at job and economic numbers, mentioning Montana’s low unemployment rate. On Tuesday, the Governor’s Office announced the state’s July unemployment rate was 2.8% — the 10th straight month under 3%. The state ranks in the top five in the U.S. for low unemployment.
EquipmentShare also announced donations on Monday to two causes, including Angel Fund which helps children and families with school supplies.

Practically every call that reached their Tacoma communication center was handled by first responders. “The […],"Dispatchers inside South Sound 911's central Tacoma office are working with counselors on behavioral health calls as part of a new partnership between the Washington Department of Health and providers who oversee the state's 988 mental health hotlines. (Photo courtesy of South Sound 911)During Dianna Caber’s 15-year tenure at South Sound 911 – the public safety answering center for a majority of fire and law enforcement agencies in Pierce County – dispatchers have rarely transferred anyone to a regional crisis and suicide hotline. Practically every call that reached their Tacoma communication center was handled by first responders.
“The only caller we were transferring to a crisis line before was someone who called and said, ‘can I talk to crisis?’” Caber, manager of the center, said. “Outside of that, it was getting entered for a law enforcement or fire department response.”
Practices fundamentally changed two years ago, after trained mental health counselors from the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline embedded themselves inside Sound Sound’s call center under a state pilot program. Large numbers of calls are now diverted, at least partially, away from emergency responders like law enforcement.
The shift is one component of a broader and ambitious effort to overhaul Washington’s behavioral health response system following the launch of 988, which debuted across the country in July 2022 as a replacement for the National Suicide Prevention Hotline.
Changing from the former suicide hotline number, 1-800-273-8255, to an easy-to-remember three-digit replacement drove a significant increase in volume. Record numbers have connected with trained counselors via phone, text and chat since 988 launched. In Washington, calls are up 52% from launch, according to a state report published last December. Text messages rose 923%.
And call volumes have continued to grow monthly, said Courtney Colwell, director of 988 Services for Volunteers of America of Western Washington. Calls were up 37% since last year, and 8% between June in July.
Volunteers of America, based in Everett, is one of three providers handling 988 calls in Washington. VOA handles calls from a vast majority of the state, excluding those in King and six counties near Spokane.
Only about 10% of those calls require any sort of dispatch, Colwell said. About 10% of calls end with a mobile crisis outreach team being deployed, while about 2% might need a response from law enforcement or firefighters.
“A lot of people just need someone to talk to,” she said.
Much of the work being done around 988 is still in its infancy, but has shown promising results, Caber says. Their partnership with Volunteers of America has been a “huge benefit.”
One of the biggest innovations has been conference calls, where a 911 call receiver and 988 counselor are on the line at the same time with a caller – able to give them advice as they wait for first responders. About 16% of calls are now being handled in this format, Colwell said, while the rest are flat transfers.
Being together opens up many opportunities to support callers and maintain a “no wrong door approach,” Caber said. “No matter who you call and where you go, we’re going to get you to the right people.”
 Someone to respond and somewhere to go

From the beginning, Washington officials envisioned 988 as an entry point to a more comprehensive system, adopting legislation to enhance the state’s behavioral health infrastructure to provide help beyond the initial call.
The concept, based on the ideal crisis continuum outlined by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, was that in addition to a crisis line to call, there would be local dispatch services and facilities for people to go for follow-up care.
“At launch, the promise for the future of Washington’s lifeline was threefold: someone to call, someone to respond, and a place to go,” then-Gov. Jay Inslee wrote in a 2024 blog post.
Three years later, many of those initial promises are still a work in progress, said Jolene Kron, executive director of the Salish Behavioral Health Administrative Services Organization. Several state workgroups continue to discuss the future of 988 and its role in the state’s crisis system.
A spokesperson for the Washington state Health Care Authority, the agency tasked with overseeing much of this work, did not make a representative available for an interview by press time.
One of the questions is how 988 fits in with the existing local crisis lines. Salish, one of 10 state-funded regional behavioral health providers, runs its own behavioral health hotline – distinct from and created prior to the launch of 988 – for residents of Kitsap, Jefferson and Clallam Counties.
The Salish Regional Crisis Line and 988 services coordinate with each other. Volunteers of America runs both, but they are separate entities.
Kron said this requires some call transferring between the two lines, in an effort to maintain a no-wrong-door approach. In an emergency, an individual can call either line, she says.
There are few transfers from 988 to the Salish Line, Kron said. Part of that is 988 has historically been used for suicide prevention, meaning most callers are only looking for someone to talk to and their issues are resolved on the phone.


If a call needs an in-person response, it has to be transferred to Salish, Kron said. They are the only ones who can dispatch the mobile crisis outreach team run by the nonprofit Kitsap Mental Health Services. Kron said that is something that could be changed down the road.
Challenges around georouting also exist for 988, to some degree, Kron said. Previously, when some dialed 988, their calls were routed to a call center based on their phone’s area code – not their actual location. That changed for major wireless carriers like T-Mobile, Verizon and AT&T last year, but smaller providers still have this issue.
“Many of the folks we would be serving are probably not on those larger plans, so we continue to support folks using the Salish regional crisis line for most expedient direct access,” Kron said. “There’s not a barrier to using 988, it would just mean an additional call transfer.”

During a news conference Tuesday hosted by the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, the national Democratic Party’s arm focused on electing Democrats to state legislatures, New Mexico House Speaker Javier Martínez of Albuquerque said the Trump administration’s tariffs and trade wars are raising prices of groceries and creating challenges for New Mexico’s small business owners, especially its breweries and coffee roasters, in a state bordering Mexico and where international trade is vital to its economy.
Martínez also pointed to Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s mass deportations’ effects on the state’s entire workforce, especially farmworkers, oil and gas workers and their loved ones.
“We’re the second-highest producer of oil and gas, and a lot of that workforce is either undocumented or in mixed-status families,” Martínez said. “New Mexico is famous for Hatch green chile. Guess who picks that chile: immigrant communities.”
To contrast his party’s policies with those of Republicans, Martínez pointed to New Mexico’s enactment of guaranteed access to child care and early childhood education in the state constitution; tuition-free college; free lunches in public schools and tax cuts for people with lower incomes.
An email and voicemail seeking comment from the Republican Party of New Mexico was not returned on Tuesday. Source NM also asked a spokesperson for the Senate Republican Leadership Office for comment and will update this story as needed.
Illinois House Speaker Pro Tempore Ken Buckner said the tariffs on steel, aluminum and lumber are driving up the prices of housing, food and health care.
“Across the country, families are already stretched to the breaking point,” Buckner said. “And instead of helping, Republicans gave us something that made it all worse: Trump’s tariffs.”
Washington Senate Deputy Majority Leader Manka Dhingra said the tariffs will shrink her state’s robust import and export economy with Canada and raise prices at grocery stores, fuel pumps and car dealerships for everyone. Tariffs on Canadian softwood would hike construction costs for homes and residential buildings, she said.
“This is an artificially created crisis due to the impulse of one man, which will impact the pocketbook of every Washingtonian and American,” Dhingra said.
Dhingra said Democrats are not opposed to tariffs across the board but rather disagree with the way Trump is carrying out his tariffs.
“We can be thoughtful, we can be methodical, we can have conversations and if there are tariffs that need to be imposed, let’s make sure we do it the right way and make sure there’s predictability there,” she said.

Article Summary

The recruiting billboard for a right-wing extremist group, the Proud Boys, was removed in Clinton County after an outpouring of outrage.
The advertising company that put the billboard up near a high school would not say who paid for it.
The Proud Boys has been labeled a hate group and was linked to the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol in Washington, D.C.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

BREESE, Ill. — After strong community opposition, including a county board meeting where dozens of people spoke against it, the Proud Boys billboard that was put up near a high school in Clinton County was removed Tuesday.
A representative from Lamar Advertising’s Collinsville office said the sign was taken down around noon. The company declined further comment.
Clinton County Board Chairman Brad Knolhoff said the county had no legal authority to regulate the billboard’s content, but he and many others contacted the company, expressing their outrage.
“I would say the fact that so many people were reaching out played a large factor” in the decision, he said. “I’m very pleased that the billboard is down because of the animosity it was causing and the angst in the community. It’s not healthy for the community.”
The billboard, up only a few days, was located at Old U.S. Route 50 and St. Rose Road, about 1,000 feet from the entrance to Central Community High School. It listed a local recruiting phone number, but calls went to a voicemail that was full.
The Proud Boys have been labeled a hate or extremist group by multiple organizations and was tied to the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, though the group has been quieter in recent years. Lamar Advertising declined to say who purchased the billboard.
At Monday night’s board meeting, about 70 people attended and more than 30 spoke during public comment, a turnout far larger than usual.

Former judge and state’s attorney Dennis Middendorff reminded the crowd this was not the first time Clinton County had faced such a test. In the 1980s, he recalled, the KKK received a permit to rally at nearby Carlyle Lake.
“I didn’t want to give” the legal advice at the time, he said, but under the First Amendment, they had the right to assemble. Even so, Middendorff told the board Monday night this moment was still an opportunity: “You don’t have to take action to try and stop it. Maybe you can’t stop it, but you can condemn it, and that’s what I’m really asking you to do.”
One by one — teachers, doctors, lawyers, laborers, parents, students — went to the microphone. Most said the same thing: We don’t want it here.
Gene Hemingway, who is Black, said the billboard only made visible what was already simmering. “I heard some years ago, they’re dropping the robes and they’re putting on suits,” he said. “I’m not scared, but I am very aware. Because I know the primary purpose is to eradicate people of my color, the LGBTQ community, anything other than white.”
Naomi Knapp, a recent graduate of Central Community High School, said she was disappointed but not surprised.
“I don’t think a lot of people in this county actually believe the things that people like the Proud Boys are saying,” she said. “But I did hear it in my high school. I did hear racial slurs. … And I can’t even imagine any person of color having to honestly live here. And that’s devastating, because I know that most of us are amazing people who actually believe in family and faith and community.”
At the conclusion of public comments, board member Greg Riechman said he appreciated the concerns raised and thanked the residents for “speaking from their hearts.”  He then introduced a nonbinding resolution condemning “hatred, bigotry, divisiveness or racism of any kind,” which  passed unanimously.
Though the billboard did not include much content beyond a phone number, logo and website for the Proud Boys, many objected to it being an obvious recruiting tool that was placed near the high school.
Knolhoff said he hopes the county can move forward, but added, “We will remain vigilant.”

U.S. Geological Survey analysis using demographic data from 13 Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem elk herds suggests few overall benefits from feeding, including for hunting. 
The post Feedgrounds grow elk herds? Wolves, grizzlies might mop up benefits, study finds. appeared first on WyoFile .","Biologist Brian Dugovich’s colleagues came up with that catchy four-word soundbite — “farming elk feeds wolves” — to sum up one finding from a study he led that investigated the effectiveness of Wyoming’s system of feeding elk in the winter. 
Dugovich’s study, recently published in the journal Ecosphere, initially set out to test some of the assumptions about elk feedgrounds and their benefits. One reason why big game outfitters have been steadfast proponents of elk feeding for generations is a belief that feedgrounds improve elk hunting. But it’s a premise that’s never really been tested in the modern era using data. 
“We thought it would be a good idea to revisit some assumptions,” said Dugovich, a Ph.D. wildlife disease ecologist who published the study while working at the U.S. Geological Survey’s Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center. 
Dugovich and his colleagues examined several demographic indicators for Wyoming’s six fed elk herds, comparing their performance to seven unfed elk herds on the east and north sides of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Specifically, they looked at the rates of calves being recruited in a herd, the population size relative to the acreage of available winter range and the “surplus” of elk, which is essentially the huntable number that could be killed each year without reducing populations. 

Demographic indicators illustrated in these graphs suggest that feeding has little effect on elk herd production in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. (USGS/EcoSphere)
Results varied — the Jackson and Fall Creek elk herds were more stimulated by feeding than the four others —  but overall, the effects of feeding were “small,” said Paul Cross, a USGS research wildlife biologist who collaborated on the research. 
“The question then is, ‘Well, why is it so small?’” Cross said. “We’re proposing that it could be that predators are assuming some of that effect.” 
In scientific terms, Dugovich described it as a “predator subsidization effect.” In regions where elk are fed hay and alfalfa for months during the brunt of winter, herds brought aboard about 5% more calves than elsewhere in the Yellowstone region. But those extra hooves on the ground didn’t necessarily translate to a larger surplus of elk available for hunting, he said. 
“The benefit you might be getting from feeding was being mopped up by the predators,” Dugovich said. “In a more intact ecosystem [that includes large carnivores], the energy you put into the system is going to be harder to get back out again as harvest.”

The dynamics were evident in the raw data, Cross said. But a statistical model that was part of the study corroborated the findings, he said. The model used 26 years of data, included thousands of simulations and took into account factors like winter severity and the presence of predators. 
The USGS research was conducted in collaboration with federal land and wildlife managers, who shared data. Co-authors listed include USGS’ Emma Tomaszewski, the National Elk Refuge’s Eric Cole, Grand Teton National Park’s Sarah Dewey, Utah State University’s Dan MacNulty, Wyoming Game and Fish Department’s Brandon Scurlock and Yellowstone National Park’s Dan Stahler.

Wyoming Game and Fish, which administers 21 winter elk feedgrounds, declined an interview for this story. Its staff was not involved in the study’s analysis or conclusions about the feedgrounds, which are a political hot potato. 
“Game and Fish consistently utilizes the best available data and science to inform wildlife management strategies,” Scurlock, the Pinedale Region’s wildlife management coordinator, said in an emailed statement. 
The USGS has been assisting land and wildlife managers with scientific analyses to help inform what they should do about elk feeding in the long run. Although the feeding system is a century old, the recent arrival of chronic wasting disease projects to change the elk feeding equation significantly.  Wildlife disease experts anticipate that keeping the historic practice going will produce the worst outcomes for the future of elk populations and elk hunting. 
Dugovich’s findings about feedgrounds and elk herd productivity were not included in recent analyses that informed decisions about feeding elk on federal land, according to Cross. 
In early August, Bridger-Teton National Forest Supervisor Chad Hudson made a “difficult” decision to keep feeding elk for at least three more winters on the 35-acre Dell Creek and 100-acre Forest Park feedgrounds. A decision about what to do with elk feeding on the National Elk Refuge also looms. Wyomingite and recently confirmed U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director Brian Nesvik will presumably play a major role in making the decision.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced Tuesday that housing funds the state Legislature approved this year will soon leave state coffers as agencies try to address an affordable housing and homelessness crisis here.
Record number of housing bills introduced this session, but little to show for it, advocate says

Between the last two legislative sessions, the Legislature has dedicated more than $300 million to various housing-related measures at different agencies, including revolving loans for builders, down-payment assistance and anti-homelessness programs. That figure includes $140 million lawmakers approved this session. 
In a news release Tuesday, the governor said that the Office of Housing within the New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions will distribute $120 million of that funding beginning this month. 
“These investments prioritize solving New Mexico’s housing crisis through focused investments in affordable and attainable housing, support for prevention, and proven solutions
 to the challenge of homelessness,” the governor said in a statement. “When we face a challenge of this magnitude, we must take an ‘all the above’ approach.”
According to the news release, the funding includes: 

more than $80 million for housing and homelessness projects in the Albuquerque area 
more than $11 million for housing and homelessness projects in the Las Cruces area
more than $13 million for housing projects in other parts of New Mexico 
$7.8 million for projects to support students experiencing homelessness at public schools in Albuquerque, Las Cruces and Santa Fe

According to recent estimates, the state lacks more than 32,000 housing units. Rents and homelessness have increased far beyond the national average in recent years, especially in Albuquerque, the state’s biggest city. 
The newly created Office of Housing, which was transferred to DWS shortly after the session, is overseeing the spending, according to the news release. DWS Secretary Sarita Nair said the funding will go toward “proven strategies” for tackling the housing crisis.
Amid funding cut threats and homeless camp sweeps, a volunteer loses hope but keeps counting

That means focusing on building more housing, preventing homelessness and ensuring that people who move into homes after living on the street have “wrap-around support and thoughtful interventions,” she said in the news release. 
The governor’s office expects the initial round of funding will result in the creation and support of more than 1,500 affordable housing units, more than 1,500 shelter beds, more than 150 transitional housing units for people leaving shelters and prevention programs to help more than 3,500 families avoid falling into homelessness. 
It will also support street outreach with support services for people who live on the streets, according to the news release.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0147-1024x768.png,,,2025-08-19 18:58:24.336369

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderGeorgia officials discussed eliminating the state income tax Tuesday but provided little detail on how to do so.
Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, who is campaigning to be Georgia’s next governor, helped kick off the first meeting of the Senate Special Committee on Eliminating Georgia’s Income Tax. 
“If we want to continue to stay competitive here in the state of Georgia, and continue to be the number one state to do business, we’ve got to be looking for ways to keep us competitive and make it where we have a competitive advantage over states that we are competing with all the time,” Jones said at the start of the meeting.

The goal, lawmakers discussed in the committee, is to make Georgia more competitive with neighboring states that have no income tax, such as Florida and Tennessee, and states that are in the process of eliminating its income tax, such as Mississippi and North Carolina.
Personal income taxes are estimated to account for 41.6% of Georgia’s estimated revenue for the current budget year, which started on July 1, according to the Governor’s Office of Planning and Budget. With corporate income tax included, which officials indicated would be reduced along with personal income tax, that number rises to just over 50% of all state revenues.
  Sen. Blake Tillery. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Danny Kanso, senior fiscal analyst at the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, said after the meeting that he’d “like to see the math on that.” He said that for most of Georgia’s households, eliminating the income tax would amount to a “massive” tax increase. The state would have to triple the sales tax and expand the sales tax to new products to make up for the deficit, calling it “a very tall order to replace the state’s largest source of revenue.”
“The proposal would have to increase taxes on far more Georgians than it would reduce taxes on, and so it’s a little bit of a solution in search of a problem that would likely cause ripples all across the state and across the economy as well,” Kanso said.
But Grover Norquist, president of the Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative organization advocating for tax cuts, said that it’s possible for Georgia to eliminate its 5.19% income tax rate without increasing sales tax. He argued that eliminating the income tax could still allow the state budget to increase through sales tax revenue as Georgians would have more income to spend.
“When you attract more people into the state and more business into the state and more investment into the state, you end up with both more money for individuals earning it, but also more tax revenue at lower rates,” Norquist said. 
He said that Florida, which does not tax income, “makes more money every year from sales tax and other taxes that aren’t going up. There’s more money because there are more people with higher earnings who have more resources who move to Florida.”
Norquist also said that with tariffs the Trump administration is imposing on other nations to promote domestic manufacturing, eliminating the income tax would make Georgia a more attractive state for industries looking to move manufacturing to the state.
“President Trump put in a lot of incentives for people to invest in the United States. There are still 50 choices,” he said.
  Sen. Nan Orrock. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Sen. Nan Orrock, an Atlanta Democrat, saying that lawmakers are tasked with “meeting the needs of our population,” asked for clarification about how the Legislature could raise revenue at a time when the federal government is shifting the cost of disaster relief and food assistance programs to the states.
“How do you square reducing our state revenues with the needs that we have as a state, and the unknown needs that are going to happen as higher ed and K-12 [and] enormous cuts that are coming down from [the federal government]?” Orrock said.
Norquist did not say how the state could raise revenue but instead pointed to North Carolina, which has lowered its income tax rate but “spending has gone on every year.”
“It is going up because revenue is coming, and they have reduced marginal tax rates and revenue has come in higher than before,” he said.
Kanso called it “wishful thinking,” saying that relying on growth is not a “viable path to raise $19 billion a year and replace more than 50% of the state budget.”
“[It] doesn’t really make sense when you hear we’re going to lower taxes, eliminate sources of revenue, and somehow we’re also going to raise more money,” Kanso said. “That’s not something we’ve really seen work in the past.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSC0051-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-19 18:58:24.336369

Smith Entertainment Group, the owner of Utah’s NBA and NHL franchises, announced on Tuesday a partnership with Live Nation Entertainment to build the new venue, the first of many major announcements for the heart of the state-created downtown sports, entertainment, culture and convention center district.
Smith Entertainment Group unveils one-of-a-kind vision for Delta Center remodel

“Once the transformation of Delta Center was underway, partnering with Live Nation on what a world-class concert venue could look like in downtown became a top priority. Not only will it bring the best artists in the world to Utah, but it will also bring a million people downtown to experience Salt Lake City every year,” Ryan Smith, chair and CEO of Smith Entertainment Group said in a statement.
Both Smith Entertainment Group and Live Nation will commit “considerable financial investment” for the project, Smith said.
The announcement comes after Salt Lake City’s approval of a 0.5% sales tax increase to gather $900 million mostly to renovate the Delta Center to equip it to host hockey games, but also to redevelop three downtown blocks. That was part of a plan drawn by a 2024 law that allowed Salt Lake City to help fund renovations to the Delta Center and an enhanced downtown.
The new development is considerably smaller than its neighboring Delta Center, which is able to accommodate 12,000 to 19,000 attendees in Salt Lake City and will continue hosting concerts and other entertainment events “while the new venue will serve artists seeking a best-in-class, mid-size indoor option,” according to a news release.
Smith Entertainment Group expects to host 200 events a year, including 100 concerts and other corporate, conference and community events.
The venue is also part of a Live Nation national expansion in sports and entertainment districts, adding to the MGM Music Hall at Boston’s Fenway Park and other similar projects in Pittsburgh, Indianapolis and Atlanta.
“Utah is a great market for live music, and Smith Entertainment Group is the right partner to help us deliver a world-class venue to fans in Salt Lake City,” Michael Rapino, CEO of Live Nation said in a statement. “SEG’s incredible vision for the downtown district aligns with our mission to expand access to live music.”

“Vermont does not have any law or policy that impedes the enforcement of federal immigration law. In fact the opposite is true,” the governor said in a letter to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi.

Gov. Phil Scott has responded to the U.S. attorney general’s recent letter which labeled Vermont as a sanctuary jurisdiction, reiterating that the state does not hold that status and does not violate any federal immigration laws.
“I believe this designation of Vermont as a so-called ‘sanctuary jurisdiction’ has been made in error,” Scott wrote to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in an Aug. 19 letter shared with VTDigger.
Scott’s comments refer to an Aug. 13 letter in which the attorney general’s office identified Vermont as a state that “engages in sanctuary policies and practices,” threatening criminal charges, civil action and potentially withholding federal funds if it does not cease.
That letter comes on the heels of the Justice Department announcing its latest list of 35 sanctuary jurisdictions, which includes Vermont, as part of the federal government’s continued effort to target communities it believes are interfering with immigration enforcement.
Scott pushed back on the assertion. 
“Vermont does not have any law or policy that impedes the enforcement of federal immigration law. In fact the opposite is true,” his letter states. “Vermont State law is very clear that the State does not prohibit or impede any public agency from complying with the lawful requirements of 8 U.S.C. §§ 1373 and 1644.”

(Photo by Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montanan)Puget Sound Energy announced on Tuesday that its Beaver Creek wind farm, a 248-megawatt wind project located on the high plains in Stillwater County is now fully operational.
The Beaver Creek wind farm is the latest addition of renewable energy resources that PSE has brought online as it works toward complying with Washington state’s clean energy laws. By 2030, the amount of new, non-emitting generation resources PSE will need to have is more than the utility has accumulated in its 150-year history.
The wind farm has an initial nameplate capacity of 248 megawatts, enough energy to power about 83,000 homes a year. Montana wind has a high production rate that is especially valuable during extremely cold weather in the Pacific Northwest, when high pressure systems mean that Washington wind farms produce less energy.
“The Beaver Creek project moved from construction to full operation in just over a year, demonstrating what’s possible when we combine innovative planning with strong partnerships,” Mary Kipp, president and CEO of Puget Sound Energy, said in a press release. “I want to particularly thank Montana’s state and local officials for their support and collaborative approach that helped make this aggressive timeline possible. Their partnership has been instrumental in bringing this important energy resource online to serve our customers.”
PSE has been a partner in Montana’s energy economy since the 1970s and continues to invest in the state of Montana and its communities. The project uses existing PSE transmission on the Colstrip Transmission System to bring the robust wind energy back to PSE customers. PSE is proud to own and operate the Beaver Creek facility in Stillwater County, employing local workers and supporting the community. The wind farm utilized an estimated 200 to 300 skilled workers during construction and now employs 10 permanent on-site workers for ongoing operations.
“The Beaver Creek Wind project is a great example of how we can harness Montana’s abundant natural resources while strengthening our economy,” Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte in the press release. “This is another important milestone in Montana’s all-of-the-above energy approach. I appreciate this investment in our state, and I look forward to seeing the benefits it brings to families and businesses in Stillwater County and beyond.”
As part of the clean energy transition, PSE continues to partner with energy producers in the state of Montana. Recent examples include power purchase agreements signed with Energy Keepers, Inc., the tribally owned corporation of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes for hydroelectric power, and an agreement with NextEra for power from Montana’s largest wind farm, Clearwater Wind, based in Rosebud, Custer and Garfield Counties. PSE also has a power purchase agreement with Clearway Energy Group to receive clean energy from its Haymaker Wind facility, that will be constructed in Wheatland and Meagher Counties, Montana.

This story by Michael Coughlin Jr. was first published in the Valley News on Aug. 15, 2025.
HANOVER — A former Dartmouth cross country head coach filed a federal lawsuit against the college this week, alleging that the school had “blacklisted” him, damaging his “reputation and his ability to obtain employment.”
Attorneys for Justin Wood, of Quechee, who coached the men’s cross country team and was an assistant track and field coach between 2020 and 2022, filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Concord, seeking an unspecified amount in damages. Along with the college, the suit names as defendant Porscha Dobson Harnden, former director of Dartmouth track and field and cross country, currently living in Auburn, Alabama, according to the lawsuit.
During Wood’s time as coach, he “raised a number of concerns about Defendant Harnden, and his belief that she was leading those programs with a glaring disregard for Ivy League and NCAA policies, along with potential admissions fraud and laxities taken with the health and safety of Dartmouth’s student-athletes,” the complaint states.
A spokesperson from Dartmouth declined to comment on the lawsuit and Wood’s allegations against Harnden.
After “confronting defendants” about his concerns in 2022, Dartmouth offered Wood a severance agreement, according to the suit. Both parties entered into a “Separation Agreement and General Release Agreement” in August 2022, which contained a “non-disparagement” clause.
Over the next couple of months, Wood attempted to secure a position as the head coach of track and field at New York University (NYU). The complaint alleges that during a background check call between NYU and Dartmouth in December 2022, “the individual at NYU who was managing the background check was informed that Wood had been blacklisted.”
“The NYU individual who was managing the background check made a statement that something happened at Dartmouth, and ‘we just can’t,’” the lawsuit states.
The 12-page complaint also contains a screenshot from a post on a LetsRun.com message board in October 2022, which claimed Wood resigned “because he was associated with some inappropriate actions by coaching friends of his and was brought to light in an investigation.”  
The lawsuit goes on to say that when Wood called the manager of the blog “regarding this false and defamatory information, and seeking to have it removed, the manager indicated to (Wood) that he had spoken with Defendant Harnden’s spouse regarding Wood’s departure from Dartmouth.”
Harnden made the statements with “actual malice, in response to Wood’s complaints of her improper conduct, i.e., her glaring disregard for Ivy League and NCAA policies, along with potential admissions fraud and laxities taken with the health and safety of Dartmouth’s student-athletes,” the suit maintains.
The suit also alleges that Harnden, “sometime in the Fall of 2022, told at least one individual and possibly a team captain, a cryptic reason for Wood’s departure. More specifically, there had been an incident or altercation involving Wood and a coach from another college, where the police were involved and the coach from the other school was immediately let go.”
According to the suit, Dartmouth “has taken concrete, retaliatory steps to prevent Wood from securing comparable employment,” by removing him from the college’s 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 men’s track and field rosters, and the 2021 men’s cross country roster. 
This was done, the suit maintains, to “interfere with Wood’s application processes at other institutions,” including Tufts University in Medford, Mass.
Before coming to Dartmouth, Wood was a head coach at the University of La Verne in California. 
Valley News’ attempts to reach Harnden this week were unsuccessful. Dartmouth did not respond to the paper’s inquiry regarding when Harnden left her position.
In August 2024, The Dartmouth, the college’s daily newspaper, indicated that Harnden had not communicated with the cross country team since February of that year and that a job opening for an interim director of track and field and cross country was posted that June.
Wood referred questions to his attorneys at Shaheen & Gordon, a major New Hampshire law firm based in Concord. His attorneys did not respond to a request for comment.

(File/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — A transgender student in Berkeley County will be allowed to use the boys’ bathroom this school year, despite a state law that says otherwise, a federal appeals court decided.
The student, identified only as John Doe in the lawsuit, is suing the state over a clause initially inserted in the budget last year. It puts school districts at risk of losing 25% of their state aid if they let transgender students use multi-occupancy bathrooms and locker rooms that align with their gender identity.
Budget clauses carry the same legal weight as permanent state law. They’re technically one-year laws, but unless legislators vote to take them out, they carry over indefinitely. Legislators made no attempt to remove the rule, titled “student physical privacy,” from the budget that took effect July 1.
Transgender student sues SC to use bathroom of choice

Last week’s court ruling applies only to the student — now a high school freshman — as his case continues to move through the appeals process.
Attorneys for the family had initially asked a judge to block the law entirely, allowing an estimated 3,000 transgender students across the state to use the bathroom of their choosing. But that request was denied last month.
Due to being bullied, the student left his middle school last September. After nearly a year of homeschooling, the ninth grader “cannot wait for relief,” his attorneys wrote in their renewed request to exempt him from the rule.
“As a new school year approaches, his family is now forced to choose between two agonizing options: send John back to public school, where he will experience discrimination, including discipline, or keep him home, where he will continue to miss out on the academic and developmental benefits of an in-person education,” reads the request dated July 10.
The student’s parents opted to send him back to public school. He began ninth grade last Wednesday, one day after the ruling required his Berkeley County high school to let him use the boys’ bathroom, according to legal filings.
The court’s Aug. 12 decision “is a powerful affirmation that every student deserves to be treated with respect and humanity,” said Ronald Patane, board chair of LGBTQ+ rights group Alliance for Full Acceptance, in a statement. “We are grateful the court recognized this young person’s right to exist and learn as themselves.”
After the budget rule took effect last summer, administrators at Cane Bay Middle School in Summerville told the transgender student when classes started that he needed to use the girls’ restroom or the single-stall bathroom in the nurse’s office, according to legal filings.
No student had complained about the student using the boys’ bathroom, according to legal filings.
But the budget clause put Berkeley County School District at risk of losing more than $74 million if administrators didn’t comply, according to state Department of Education data.
When the student continued using the boys’ bathroom, he received a daylong suspension, with the threat of expulsion. To enforce the rule, teachers began monitoring which bathroom the student used, according to the lawsuit.
Other students began bullying the student over his gender identity, causing him to drop out of school and enroll instead in online classes, which he often skipped because he wasn’t engaged with his online courses, his attorneys said.
The student’s parents have been homeschooling him. But he missed the social parts of in-person public school, leading them to reenroll him despite concerns that he wouldn’t be able to use the bathroom of his choosing, according to legal filings.
In their response, the state and school district wrote that the student’s problems were due to disobeying the directive. The district offered the student an alternative, but he chose not to use it, the attorneys argued.
They also argued any bullying wasn’t due to the budget clause. The student had been open about his transgender identity, so his classmates already knew. The bathroom question didn’t reveal anything, according to state and district attorneys.
SC senators approve K-12 mandate that ‘a boy will use the boys’ bathroom’

Attorneys for the student and his family argued the budget clause violated transgender students’ constitutional rights to equal protection, as well as federal laws that prohibit discrimination. The attorneys pointed repeatedly to a 2020 case out of Virginia, in which the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court’s ruling allowing a transgender student to use the bathroom and locker room of his choice.
But in a July 23 order, a federal judge declined to block South Carolina’s law, citing recent and upcoming rulings from the U.S. Supreme Court.
In June, the high court upheld a Tennessee law banning gender-transitioning medical treatments for transgender minors. That brought into question how judges should consider all cases involving transgender youth, U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel wrote last month.
And the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to consider a West Virginia case asking whether transgender students should be able to play sports on the team of their choosing, which could further complicate matters, Gergel wrote.
Justices’ decision on that case “has the potential of bringing clarity and providing guidance” as to how to proceed in the South Carolina case, Gergel wrote. Any decision in the meantime could lead to a “‘yo-yo’ effect,” in which the courts go back and forth based on various rulings, he continued.
Last week’s decision by the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Gergel’s decision for the Berkeley County student only. A full explanation for the decision is pending. It has not yet been filed, according to court documents.
Sen. Wes Climer, who proposed the budget clause, said he was hopeful the U.S. Supreme Court would overturn the appeals court’s decision, or that the court might change its mind.
“The 4th Circuit’s decision is disappointing, but at least it is narrow in its application,” the Rock Hill Republican said.
Climer said he proposed the budget clause to protect students, particularly girls, from having to share a bathroom or locker room with a classmate who’s biologically different. That’s “basic common sense,” he said.
The rule applies to multi-stalled school restrooms and places where students undress, to include “changing facilities” in gyms. It also specifies that during overnight school trips, students of different genders can’t sleep in the same room or use the same multi-occupancy bathroom — unless they’re siblings.
When legislators return to Columbia in January, Climer plans to renew a push for a bill that would make the budget clause permanent state law, he said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/locker-room-.jpg,,,2025-08-19 18:58:24.336369

More specifics on how the plan will roll out are expected before the end of the month, according to Agency of Natural Resources Secretary Julie Moore, who sent an email to her staff on Monday.

As news of an upcoming return-to-office plan reverberated within state government this month, the leader of at least one Vermont agency has looked to quiet the concerns of its employees.
In an all-staff email sent Monday, Agency of Natural Resources Secretary Julie Moore told employees that the expected changes did not reflect on the professionalism or quality of their work. 
But she indicated more in-office time could bring positive changes and urged staff to remain calm while details are developed. 
“I understand this creates real challenges for many, and those concerns are valid. At the same time, this directive comes from the governor’s office as part of broader policy decisions about how state government operates,” Moore wrote. “I need everyone to focus on solutions rather than resistance, understanding that work arrangements can and do change, and our response must remain professional even when changes are unwelcome.”

Earlier this month, Gov. Phil Scott first signaled his intention to bring state employees back to the office on a hybrid basis. That move prompted Agency of Administration Secretary Sarah Clark to write to all state employees, assuring them that the plans are only in their early stages and will develop with input across departments.  
But more details may arrive in the next two weeks. According to Moore, the Agency of Administration plans to share the timeline of the proposal and the number of in-office days expected by the end of the month. 
Covid-19 transformed how the state did business, shifting work from downtown offices to video calls. Years later, some of the state’s more than 8,000 employees have started increasing their in-person presence, but remote work remains prevalent. For many, work location is handled on a case-by-case basis, according to the Vermont State Employees’ Association, the union representing the workforce.
On Tuesday, Steve Howard, the union’s executive director, said members have thus far overwhelmingly opposed the idea of returning to the office. Some people were hired under assurances that they could work remotely, he said, and may live 90 minutes from their potential offices. 
“We’re hearing a lot from people who are saying how am I going to be able to pick my child up from child care,” he said. 
Howard pointed to California, where the state auditor’s office determined a new hybrid return-to-office plan had not been fully studied by the governor, and that partial remote work would save millions of dollars. California’s governor refuted those findings.  
It’s unclear how all Vermont agencies are handling the early stage discussions about a hybrid schedule. A spokesperson for the Vermont Agency of Education said the agency would keep its employees up to date but was still awaiting more details. The Agency of Human Services and Agency of Agriculture did not respond to requests for comment.

Moore said she first communicated with staff about the governor’s proposal earlier this month and welcomed feedback from employees. 
Last week, the Department of Environmental Conservation, which is housed in the Agency of Natural Resources, hosted a “coffee talk” where Moore said she heard from more staff.
“The tone was moving in an unhelpful direction, I felt,” she said.
A more balanced approach to in-office time would strengthen relationships between employees who may work for different teams or departments, according to Moore.  
“For me, there is something that I think we are in the process of losing,” she told VTDigger, adding that the agency also has customer-facing responsibilities that benefit from being in-person, such as reviewing state permits.
Of the agency’s roughly 650 full-time, year-round employees, about two-thirds have telework agreements that allow them to set flexible schedules, working remotely up to 40 hours per week, according to Moore. Generally, teams and programs have at least one in-office day per month, she said. 
Natural resource staff are already making suggestions about how to optimize the changes, Moore said, like increasing Green Mountain Transit buses and designating quiet and collaborative spaces in the office. 
As long as the conversation is constructive, Moore said she’s willing to discuss the impending proposal — just not whether it should be implemented at all.  
“At the end of the day, that’s a decision the governor has made,” she said, “and it’s not up for discussion.”

Stock photo by Greenleaf123/Getty Images)Police did not act improperly when an officer gained access to the phone of an individual detained for kidnapping, sex assault, and other serious charges after watching the man enter his cellphone passcode and committing it to memory, a New Jersey appeals court ruled Tuesday.
Tyrone Ellison, who was arrested and convicted after kidnapping a minor with substance abuse issues from a Newark hospital, had no reasonable expectation of privacy when he unlocked his phone while in police custody and under the supervision of a detective, the court ruled.
“There was no violation of defendant’s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination where defendant voluntarily requested his cell phone, was not compelled to provide the passcode and voluntarily entered the passcode in the officer’s presence,” the judges wrote.
Police could not leave Ellison unattended with his phone without risking him deleting evidence, the ruling adds.
The judges said prior case law that found an arrestee maintained a reasonable expectation of privacy when making a call from a police station without being told that call may be monitored or recorded does not apply to Ellison’s case.
Ellison, the judges wrote, was aware of the detective’s presence when entering his passcode, did not attempt to conceal his password, and was not stopped from concealing his passcode from police.
“There was no deception or trickery used to obtain defendant’s passcode. Nor did the police orchestrate the situation to induce defendant to reveal the passcode,” the court wrote. 
In effect, Ellison’s expectation of privacy vanished when he chose to unlock his phone in the presence of police, the court found.
A divided New Jersey Supreme Court in 2020 ruled in Andrews v. New Jersey that while the Fifth Amendment presumptively protects individuals’ passcodes, they can be compelled to reveal them under the foregone conclusion exception to the amendment. That exception allows the compelled disclosure of documents and passcodes as long as authorities know they exist and the individual subject to the warrant knows and possesses them.
Tuesday’s ruling says another doctrine that allows authorities to use improperly obtained information if it would have inevitably come into their possession through proper channels would have allowed police to use the passcode even if it was initially obtained improperly.
Police obtained a communications data warrant to search the phone and could have obtained an order to compel Ellison to disclose his passcode, the judges wrote.
“Once the passcode was compelled, law enforcement would have been able to access the contents of the phone,” the judges wrote.
The New Jersey Office of the Public Defender represented Ellison. Alison Perrone, deputy of the office’s appellate section, called the ruling concerning and said her office will ask the New Jersey Supreme Court to review the case.
“The ability of law enforcement to observe and later use a person’s private phone passcode while in custody presents serious questions about constitutional rights in the digital era,” Perrone said in a statement.

(Photo by Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird is calling on the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in a joint letter to take emergency action to schedule a drug that has been linked to deaths in the state and across the country.
Bromazolam is described in the letter penned by Sunday and 20 other state attorneys general as a “designer Xanax.” The prosecutors say the drug is increasingly contributing to overdose deaths and posing a growing threat to public health. It is also highly potent and unpredictable, Pennsylvania Attorney General Dave Sunday’s office wrote, especially when mixed with opioids. Narcan, which is used to reverse an overdose, is ineffective against the drug in such emergencies.
Bromazolam is unscheduled under the federal Controlled Substances Act.
“Despite its clear dangers, bromazolam remains unscheduled at the federal level, creating significant challenges for law enforcement and public health officials trying to respond to this emerging crisis,” the attorneys generals wrote. “Without scheduling, this drug continues to evade traditional regulatory and prosecutorial tools, hindering interdiction efforts and enabling continued distribution through illicit channels.”
“Taking emergency action to schedule bromazolam will help law enforcement remove it from circulation, give prosecutors the tools to hold traffickers accountable, and send a clear signal that this dangerous substance has no place on our streets,” the attorneys general wrote.
“Bromazolam, or ‘Designer Xanax’ is a lethal, counterfeit drug with no medical use that is highly addictive and killing Americans,” Bird said in a statement. “It is already an illegal drug in Iowa, and I strongly urge the DEA to take swift and definite action at the federal level to give law enforcement the tools they need to stop this crisis, save lives, and hold traffickers accountable.”

Smith Entertainment Group, the owner of Utah’s NBA and NHL franchises announced on Tuesday a partnership with Live Nation Entertainment to build the new venue, the first of many major announcements for the heart of the state-created downtown sports, entertainment, culture, and convention center district.

“Once the transformation of Delta Center was underway, partnering with Live Nation on what a world-class concert venue could look like in downtown became a top priority. Not only will it bring the best artists in the world to Utah, but it will also bring a million people downtown to experience Salt Lake City every year,” Ryan Smith, chair and CEO of Smith Entertainment Group said in a statement.
Both Smith Entertainment Group and Live Nation will commit “considerable financial investment” for the project, Smith said.  
The announcement comes after Salt Lake City’s approval of a 0.5% sales tax increase to gather $900 million mostly to renovate the Delta Center to equip it to host hockey games, but also to redevelop three downtown blocks. That was part of a plan drawn by a 2024 law that allowed Salt Lake City to help fund renovations to the Delta Center and an enhanced downtown. 



Let us know what you think...


 


The new development is considerably smaller than its neighboring Delta Center, which is able to accommodate 12,000 to 19,000 attendees in Salt Lake City and will continue hosting concerts and other entertainment events “while the new venue will serve artists seeking a best-in-class, mid-size indoor option,” according to a news release.
Smith Entertainment Group expects to host 200 events a year, including 100 concerts and other corporate, conference and community events.
The venue is also part of a Live Nation national expansion in sports and entertainment districts, adding to the MGM Music Hall at Boston’s Fenway Park and other similar projects in Pittsburgh, Indianapolis and Atlanta.
“Utah is a great market for live music, and Smith Entertainment Group is the right partner to help us deliver a world-class venue to fans in Salt Lake City,” Michael Rapino, CEO of Live Nation said in a statement. “SEG’s incredible vision for the downtown district aligns with our mission to expand access to live music.”

(Photo courtesy of Anne Tuchelski)The scale of damage in Milwaukee County left behind after unprecedented flooding last week is beginning to come into view. Over 300 volunteers from the county’s Office of Emergency Management (OEM), Wisconsin Emergency Management (WEM), and local partner organizations have assessed  3,434 homes for property damage from a storm that brought upwards of 10 inches of rain to some areas. As of Monday, 53% of the homes inspected have been categorized as “destroyed” or having sustained “major damage.” Public infrastructure has sustained more than $34 million in damage, according to preliminary evaluations 
Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley thanked local agencies for assisting in recovery and damage assessment efforts in a press statement Tuesday. 
“I joined our damage assessment teams in the community last week and spoke directly with residents affected by flooding,” Crowley said. “I’ve heard your stories, your challenges, and your calls for help. But I also heard your resilience and witnessed neighbors helping one another. That spirit of service is what defines Milwaukee.”

The Wisconsin Department of Military Affairs announced Tuesday that teams from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will arrive Thursday to visit communities, accompanied by state personnel. The teams will verify damage. Teams will interview homeowners, renters and business owners to document property damage and the impact of the storms and flooding. Their work will help determine the extent of damage and inform the state’s request for federal assistance.
“The safety and well-being of Wisconsin residents is our top priority,” said Gov. Tony Evers in a press statement. “These severe storms have caused significant hardship, and we are committed to ensuring that those affected receive the support they need. The collaboration between state and federal agencies through this damage assessment process is critical to unlocking the resources necessary for recovery.”
After FEMA completes a preliminary damage assessment, the agency’s regional administrator will make a recommendation on whether the president should declare a disaster, allowing for federal disaster assistance to be sent to Milwaukee County and other Southeast Wisconsin communities. 
Over 12,000 calls have been made to 211 in Milwaukee County, and residents are encouraged to continue reporting damage to that number or to make an online damage report here. The data will be used to persuade the Trump administration that Milwaukee requires federal assistance. 
Community and local government organizations are continuing cleanup efforts, and volunteers are encouraged to register at Crisis Cleanup, a program providing free service to those in need. Emergency shelters established by the Red Cross have also served dozens of residents displaced by the flood. The Milwaukee Health Department is reminding people to assume any standing water in the street or around homes is contaminated with sewage, and to avoid the spread of mold in homes, which can be harmful to health. 
The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection is also advising that people seek “trustworthy” contractors, and to keep an eye out for scammers. “Vulnerable consumers are often targeted by scammers,” said department Secretary Randy Romanski. “Property owners should stay alert and that quick and easy fixes may be too good to be true.” People should especially be cautious of door-to-door crews which use “high pressure tactics to solicit business”, the department warns.
The rain that  fell overnight on Aug. 9 overwhelmed roads, highways, and neighborhoods. Many people were forced to abandon their cars on the roads as the water rapidly rose. Firefighters worked to rescue people whose homes had become inundated, as residents were forced to brave the downpour to check on vulnerable loved ones.

In Wauwatosa, Hart Park looked as if it was underwater, and wetland habitats in the County Grounds natural area were swallowed by water and became small lakes. The Wisconsin State Fair closed early as rain fell, pooling water to knee or waist level as people waded to their cars. Local dumps have seen lines of cars stretching down the block, and filled with damaged furniture, clothing, and equipment. 
Some Milwaukee residents expressed that they didn’t feel the city was prepared for the level of flooding. Researchers  have long-warned that climate change would bring more intense rainfall and greater risks of floods in Wisconsin. In 2020, it was estimated that 273,400 homes in Wisconsin were at substantial risk of flooding, nearly twice what FEMA estimated. 
Flooding also severely affected other parts of southeastern Wisconsin. State agencies warned that following the floods, the Waukesha County dam was at a high risk of failure, and would need to be reinforced. 
FEMA teams have also been inspecting other communities in southeastern Wisconsin. The Wisconsin National Guard was also deployed to parts of the state, assisting with rescue and recovery efforts, and providing specialized vehicle support. 
Greg Engle, the WEM administrator, said on WISN Channel 12’s “UpFront” program Sunday that federal assistance was likely to take time.

FEMA’s help is “going to be critical because we don’t have a similar program here in the state,” Engle said, adding that, “we want to get that assistance to our families and folks in Wisconsin, but I will say it’s not immediate.” 
Engle said that state teams are working as quickly as they can, and that the FEMA Region 5 team from Chicago has been helpful, and federal personnel have embedded with the state emergency management agency to provide support with planning and training. 
“We expect they’re going to be very supportive, but I cannot guarantee that we’ll get approved for a disaster declaration,” he said. 
Asked Tuesday about the ongoing flood recovery efforts and the possibility of FEMA sending assistance, Sen. Tammy Baldwin replied that “confident and Trump administration are two phrases that I don’t necessarily always put in a sentence together.”
Baldwin said that she believes that “the president has said very disparaging things about FEMA before the start of his term. He even talked about abolishing FEMA and the responsibility should gravitate towards the states after a natural disaster. He’s changed his tune as he’s wont to do, especially after the Texas flooding, so I want to keep his feet on the fire, hold him accountable as we face significant damage in Southeastern Wisconsin.”

After leading the Onion City for seven years, Lott is resigning as of Sept. 15. She said she is expecting her first child and is looking forward to a new chapter in her life.

Winooski’s Mayor Kristin Lott announced Tuesday she would be stepping down as of Sept.15. She is expecting her first child and said she is looking forward to prepare for a new chapter in her life.
“This was not an easy decision — the seven years I have served my neighbors has been the honor of a lifetime,” Lott stated in a press release. 
Deputy Mayor Thomas Renner will serve as interim mayor for the rest of Lott’s term, which ends March 2027. Winooskie residents will elect a new leader next Town Meeting Day.
Lott, 40, who is from Michigan, came to Vermont in 2009 and has lived in the Onion City since, she said. She served on the City Council before she was elected mayor in March 2018, beating fellow council member Eric Covey.
At the time, she said she was excited to be the first woman to be mayor of Vermont’s most diverse city. She draws an annual stipend of $17,000 for the volunteer position.

Lott first got involved in government when she volunteered to be on the housing commission in 2017 “just to be a part of problem solving around housing issues and to be more connected, more engaged in my community,” she told VTDigger on Tuesday.
And community seems to have become the cornerstone of her term there. She has reached out and participated with residents at various levels – from building ties with the local mosque to joining a clean-up crew to pick up dog waste.
“Local government, it’s supposed to be by the people, for the people,” said Lott. She sought to hear directly from constituents and plugged the feedback back into the system to make decisions that benefitted the community, she said.
“Kristine was good about connecting with and listening to a wide range of community members, which is such an important aspect of governing,” City Manager Elaine Wang wrote in an email. “With me, as the Mayor is Council’s liaison to the City Manager and staff, she struck a great balance between acting as a partner while maintaining the authority of Council.”

Wang said she first met Lott for a chat in a local cafe in 2022. Lott had just been hired after a nationwide search but hadn’t started work yet. 
“She signaled a good mix of high expectations, yet interest in being supportive, which was buoying me as a first-time manager,” Wang stated.
The community engagement is what Lott remains most proud of.
In her first year as mayor, Lott said she visited the local mosque to foster a relationship that has lasted, and joined a downtown riverbank cleanup where volunteers cleared dog poop from the area. 
“I was really interested in just doing more community engagement and adding more transparency and outreach. And I think we certainly have made improvements there,” she said. “That has been really rewarding for me, to build more relationships and see more people engaged in local government.”
Mukhtar Abdullahi recalled meeting Lott at the Islamic Community Center of Vermont during her visits, where she always wore a head covering.
“A lot of people come to us, most of the time they’re looking for something,” he said. “For her, she comes in, she makes eye contact, respects the people, listens to them, never interrupts. She’s a wonderful, wonderful human being.”
As a Somali and Mai Mai language liaison in the Winooski School District and a prevention educator at Winooski Partnership for Prevention, Abdullahi said he has crossed paths with Lott many times since, and that she has either helped directly or guided the community in the right direction. 
Lott has always been welcoming, supportive and accessible, even on short notice, he said, so he is sad to see her go.
Renner, who is about to step into Lott’s role, wrote in an email he has enjoyed her mentorship and will miss serving by her in the council chambers.
“Kristine is a dedicated public servant who has spent years working to make Winooski an incredible place to live, visit, and work,” Renner wrote, adding he is happy her expertise is just a phone call away.
Lott highlighted several achievements in Winooski during her term — from closing out the 20-year Tax Increment Financing debt that has helped invest in essential services, to zoning regulations that have led to more affordable and family-friendly housing amid a statewide housing crisis. 
As she leaves behind multiple ongoing projects — the Main Street revitalization that’s expected to be completed this year, for instance — Lott said she feels good about leaving the council and interim mayor “in a good position” to keep advancing this year’s priorities and the upcoming budget process.  
She hopes they will “continue the focus on deep community engagement in the decision making process,” she said.
“While I’ll always care deeply about public service and what comes next for this incredible community I call home, it is the right decision to focus my priorities and energy on family, career, and personal life,” she stated in the release.

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson swiped back Tuesday in response to threats from U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to condition federal funding and potentially prosecute officials if they fail to cooperate with the Trump administration on immigration enforcement.
“You are hereby notified that Washington State will not be bullied or intimidated by threats and legally baseless accusations,” Ferguson, a Democrat, wrote in a sharply-worded letter.
In a letter to Ferguson last week, Bondi wrote that federal, state and local law enforcement have long cooperated, including on immigration enforcement.
“For too long, so-called sanctuary jurisdiction policies have undermined this necessary cooperation and obstructed federal immigration enforcement, giving aliens cover to perpetrate crimes in our communities and evade the immigration consequences that federal law requires,” she wrote.
Her letter threatens to hold back “grants, contract, and federal funds” from jurisdictions that she believes violate federal immigration law. 
She also said officials in these places could be prosecuted criminally. 
Washington is among about three dozen states, counties and cities nationwide that received such a warning from Bondi, who President Donald Trump appointed. Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell also received one. Bondi gave recipients until Tuesday to respond.
Ferguson, the former three-term attorney general, retorted that the threat of prosecution “embarrasses and disgraces” Bondi’s office, adding that he didn’t have this “on my bingo card” as governor. 
He delivered his response in a press conference Tuesday at the state Capitol alongside more than four dozen state leaders and advocates.
The developments of the past week bring immigration tensions between the two Washingtons to a head after months of circling each other on this issue, as Trump has sought to use any means necessary to increase deportations. A spokesperson for the governor confirmed the two letters are the extent of the communication between Ferguson and Bondi on this issue.

The state law at the center of the dispute has also faced scrutiny from congressional Republicans after Attorney General Nick Brown used it to sue an eastern Washington county over allegations its sheriff’s office cooperated with federal immigration agents.
In an interview Monday, Brown said he takes these ultimatums seriously, even if he doesn’t think they have much merit.
“I think we have to also just pause and recognize for a moment that we have the attorney general of the United States and the president threatening independently elected officials,” Brown said. “That’s really scary, and we shouldn’t get numb.”
The law and the backlash
Washington’s Democratic lawmakers passed the Keep Washington Working Act in 2019, limiting information sharing and collaboration between local police and federal immigration enforcement. 
For example, police can’t provide nonpublic personal information to federal authorities investigating civil immigration cases, and can’t interview or detain people solely based on questions about their immigration status. 
Police also aren’t allowed to ask about their immigration status except in rare cases. Democrats say the goal is to focus limited policing resources on local public safety. 
One exception is that the state Department of Corrections is allowed to ask about immigration status and tell U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement when people will be released from prison. In February, Ferguson said he wouldn’t close that gap, despite calls from immigration advocates.
On Tuesday, he said Washington is a welcoming community for immigrants and refugees while also complying with federal law. 
Even with Washington’s barriers, the Trump administration has still sharply increased civil immigration arrests here, according to data culled by researchers. Arrests in June, around 290, were at least double any month since Trump reclaimed the presidency in January. Arrests dropped about 25% in July, the preliminary data shows, but still outpaced the usual rate.
Trump has long threatened to withhold federal funding from cities and states with laws like Washington’s that won’t aid in his vision for mass deportations. He issued similar warnings during his first term in the White House.
Bondi’s Department of Justice has sued Illinois, New York City and others over their policies. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit against Illinois, Chicago and Cook County last month, finding that the Trump administration couldn’t show their sanctuary policies violated federal law.

In another case, a federal judge in California in April ordered the administration to stop denying federal funds over immigration enforcement policies, in a lawsuit brought by Seattle, King County and jurisdictions across the country. That preliminary ruling is now under appeal.
King County is not one of the governments targeted by the Department of Justice’s latest effort.

Brown has also already joined in multiple lawsuits against the federal government over attempts to condition federal funding on assisting in immigration efforts. 
He expects to litigate the Keep Washington Working Act with the Trump administration at some point. Ferguson said he doesn’t know what to expect from the federal government, but told Bondi, if they end up in court, to “be advised that we will defeat you and seek all appropriate costs and fees.”
The first-term governor recalled a walk home from elementary school with his daughter in 2017 as he battled the first Trump administration in court as attorney general. She had heard he could get in trouble for taking on the president.
“Katie, look, we’re lucky to live in a country, right, where your dad, or any American, can speak out against the president,” he recalled telling her, “where your dad can file a lawsuit against the president, say things that are pretty direct about that president, be critical, stop him from doing something illegal, and I don’t get in trouble.”
Eight years later, Ferguson said he’s “not so sure about that.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Ferguson-sanctuary-presser-6-1024x654.jpg,,,2025-08-19 17:57:23.739947

However, the South and the Midwest are the only regions where a family with typical or median income can afford a median-priced house, according to the report. The group considers a mortgage to be affordable if the monthly payment (principal and interest) is 25% or less of the family’s income.



The affordability gap is highest in the West, where the typical family income is $113,783, just over two-thirds of the $164,832 that would be needed to purchase a median-priced home.
The Northeast, where the typical family makes $114,559, is also unaffordable by this measure, as a median-priced home requires an income of $141,264.
In the Midwest, the median family income is $102,419, more than the $86,256 needed to buy a median-priced home. The same is true in the South, where the median income is $97,812, slightly more than the $96,720 required to buy a typical home.
Nationally, affordability increased slightly compared with June of 2024, with the typical family making $105,431, about 94% of the $111,648 it would need to buy the median-priced home. That’s up from about 92% in June 2024.
In a video posted Aug. 15, Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, said he expects lower interest rates to increase affordability in the months ahead.
“We know that mortgage rates will be coming down and that will bring additional buyers into the market. We just need to make sure we have more supply, more supply to meet that demand,” Yun said.

Police said Tuesday they were awaiting autopsy results to determine the cause and manner of death of the man, who they declined to identify.

A man who police said was assaulted and injured near City Hall Park in Burlington, allegedly by a group of teens a week ago, has died, interim Burlington Police Chief Shawn Burke confirmed Tuesday morning.
News of the man’s death had previously been reported on news sites and on social media. 
Burke said that he was still awaiting autopsy results determining the cause and manner of the man’s death. The chief declined to provide the man’s name or any other details surrounding the man’s death.
Officers on foot patrol around 1:30 p.m. on Aug. 11 in City Hall Park in Burlington came upon an assault taking place involving several people on Church Street near the park, according to a press release issued last week by Burlington Police. 
“As the Officers approached, the group fled on foot and by bicycle,” the release stated. “Officers were able to chase and apprehend three juveniles who were involved in the assault.”
The juveniles were later issued citations to appear in Chittenden County Superior family court, the release stated. Juvenile court matters are heard behind closed doors. 
Because the matter involved juveniles, Burke said he could not provide additional information, including their ages. He also declined to discuss what may have prompted the incident. 
“That’s all germane to the investigation, and we have to preserve the integrity of that,” the police chief said. 
One of the teens arrested had a firearm, according to the release, and “further investigation revealed the firearm having been displayed during the assault of the victim.”  
The injured person, who police described as an adult man, was taken to the University of Vermont Medical Center in Burlington for treatment for serious injuries, the release stated.
The police chief said the investigation was continuing and that there may be additional arrests.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)For the past three months, pedestrians on the tree-lined walking path on Providence’s Blackstone Boulevard could look across the street and see Butler Hospital’s striking workers marching up and down the picket line.
The hospital’s approximately 720 members of SEIU 1199NE who walked off the job on May 15 are going back to work, after 99% of participating members voted Monday night to approve a new four-year contract with their employer and the hospital’s owner, Care New England (CNE).  
“I will enjoy being back inside,” Dan Camp, a Butler employee, said in a phone interview Tuesday morning. “But I gotta say, I got a nice tan while I was out there.”
The tentative agreement between the union, SEIU 1199NE, and Care New England, the psychiatric facility’s owner, was announced Sunday evening. It replaces the four contracts that expired in March and covered unionized nurses, social workers, technicians, environmental service staff and clerical workers.  
A complete copy of the contract was not immediately available Tuesday, but among the highlights are:

A $20-an-hour wage floor for workers across the unionized groups, which is guaranteed for all workers by the end of the four-year deal. Full-time workers will see their pay increase by at least $6,000 in the first year.
Health benefits will remain intact, and the hospital agrees to control costs for its Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). 
Retirement and pension benefits are preserved. 
Concerns about worker safety amid an increasing amount of violence from patients crystallized into a jointly funded “time bank” that will provide financial support to employees injured on the job, ensuring they can supplement workers’ compensation without losing income. 

Union members said the strike, purported to be the longest hospital labor action in state history, dragged on because the hospital’s offers left the lowest-paid employees — including dietary and clerical staff — earning about $18 an hour. That figure would not suffice for a livable wage in Rhode Island, the union argued, and worker solidarity kept employees of all pay grades on the picket line.
For employees like Camp, who now works in the call center of the psychiatric facility but started in one of the lowest-paid departments, dietary services, the deal represents equity.
“That’s always been a priority to make sure that from top to bottom, everyone gets what they need,” Camp said.
During the walkout, Care New England shuttered three units at Butler, cutting the psychiatric hospital’s operations to roughly half of its 197-bed capacity. 
Courtney Threats, a social worker and a member of the bargaining committee, said the union will soon meet with hospital leadership to discuss a phased return to work. She said workers want to “get back sooner rather than later, so that we can resume caring for our patients who we’ve missed and we’re eager to return to.”

A week ago, Threats spoke to the media in what turned out to be the final union press conference, and noted that bargaining sessions the week before had fizzled once more, even with federal mediators present. On its website two days later, the hospital stated that union leaders were mischaracterizing events and ultimately misleading the press and the public.
What changed in seven days? 
The protracted labor dispute was resolved in part because of Rhode Island House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, said Threats. 
Asked if Shekarchi had tipped the scales in favor of the union, Threats said, “Absolutely, absolutely.”
The speaker’s spokesperson Larry Berman said in an email Tuesday that Shekarchi personally convened both sides’ leaders after negotiations continued to collapse, hosting bargaining sessions in his State House office and other locations.
“Sometimes in tough negotiations an outside voice helps bring the parties together,” Shekarchi said in a statement. “Rhode Island’s health care system needs Butler Hospital to be fully operational.  Under the agreement patients will again be able to access all the mental health care services offered at Butler, frontline workers will earn better compensation, the hospital will have more predictability, and there will be increased collaboration on workplace safety. Everyone wins moving forward!”
One accusation leveled by Care New England leadership, including its CEO Michael Wagner, was that union leadership puppeteered the strike and made it longer than it needed to be.
Threats had a different interpretation of union leaders.
“They taught us a lot about ourselves,” Threats said. “When we walked out on May 15, we were colleagues, many of us not knowing one another. And when we return, we’re returning as a family.”
Butler’s costs compromised Care New England’s gains
The union may be emerging from the strike stronger than before, but the hospital — which comprises 10 acres, 37 buildings, and 578,300 square feet — helped incur a $4.4 million loss because of temporary staffing costs used to keep Butler operating during the labor stoppage.
That reverses more positive news for Care New England’s finances from earlier this year — specifically, its bonds issued through the quasi-public Rhode Island Health and Educational Building Corporation, which are backed by the hospital system’s revenues — a common arrangement for nonprofit hospitals that cannot trade publicly on the stock market.










Everyone wins moving forward!


– Rhode Island House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi on the new agreement between Butler Hospital and its unionized workers with SEIU 1199NE


On May 5, just 10 days before the Butler strike began, Fitch’s Ratings upgraded Care New England’s bonds and noted the company’s tighter control of costs, improved revenue, and a slim but improving operating margin. After years of losses, CNE’s balance sheet looked positive, Fitch’s stated.
The strike toppled these projections, according to the third quarter finance report recently issued by Care New England for the nine-month period ending June 30. CNE’s top line grew during this time, and by the end of June, the company had collected $63.7 million in patient service revenue, an increase of 7.1% compared to the previous year. Other revenue sources climbed about 16% from the year prior, a total increase of $25.6 million.   
The expense side of the ledger was less encouraging. Spending on Butler replacement staff contributed to the health system’s overall operating costs ballooning to $95.1 million, a 9% increase year-over-year. 
“It should also be noted that prior to the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, Care New England had generated eight consecutive quarters of generating positive operating income,” the report reads.
As for contract negotiations, Care New England is not done with those either. More than 4,500 employees are union members across its properties. According to the third quarter report, two more unionized workforces — including the SEIU-represented visiting nurses association — had contracts expire earlier this year, with negotiations still underway as of the third quarter report. There are also three new contracts being forged with the Committee on Interns and Residents in multiple Care New England facilities.
The two largest unions with Care New England are currently covered. At Women & Infants Hospital, SEIU workers who were briefly enlisted into the Butler scuffle in July are covered through May 2027 by a contract created last year. Kent Hospital has 1,400 nurses and professionals under a contract set to expire until 2029, though wages and outsourcing can be renegotiated in 2026.

Loose threads from Blackstone Boulevard
Accolades for the strikes’ resolution arrived quickly. Gov. Dan McKee’s praise came in a Monday night email issued alongside AFL-CIO President Patrick Crowley, one of the state’s top union leaders. 
Rhode Island’s entire U.S. congressional delegation — Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, and Reps. Seth Magaziner and Gabe Amo — issued a joint statement Tuesday applauding the contract, while simultaneously jabbing at President Donald Trump’s administration.
“The deal reached this week respects the heroic work that the nurses, mental health professionals, and staff at Butler Hospital do each day for Rhode Island patients in the dangerous environment of looming Republican Medicaid and Medicare cuts,” the delegates wrote.
Meanwhile, state labor regulators are still unwinding the legal saga sparked during the strike. Department of Labor and Training spokesperson Edwine Paul confirmed Tuesday that a lockout case in Rhode Island Supreme Court tied to the strike has automatically entered the appeals process, as both parties appealed. Paul said the Board of Review will examine the case next, after which point either party can decide to continue the appeals.
As for the now defunct picket line on Blackstone Boulevard, Providence mayoral spokesperson Josh Estrella said the total municipal costs associated with the strike were $398,266, which includes a police detail that had a constant presence alongside strikers, waving motorists in and out the long driveway leading up to the Butler campus.
Now Blackstone Boulevard will be a little quieter with the strikers gone. But not that much quieter: Noise violations issued early in the strike, with six as of mid June, stopped as the strike lingered on. 
“There were no additional noise violations issued at this location,” Estrella said.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Family, Florida legislative figures past and present, and Florida State University stakeholders honored the life of John Thrasher Tuesday in an ceremony representing his lifetime of service to the Sunshine State. 
Former Gov. Jeb Bush, Thrasher’s successor President Richard McCullough, and children and grandchildren were among those who eulogized the former Florida House Speaker and senator who died in May at the age of 81.
Inside the Ruby Diamond Concert Hall on FSU’s campus, Thrasher was recalled for his kindness, mercy, and gentleness. 
“If you knew him, you loved him, and chances are he loved you right back,” Julie Weinberg, Thrasher’s daughter, said. “Looking around this room today, it’s clear how many people called him a friend.”
Thrasher’s wife of 60 years, Jean Thrasher, said she remembers him as a “sweet man.”
“He never gave up hope and he never complained, he gave us comfort when we all needed it most,” she said.
Thrasher died about a month after announcing a cancer diagnosis.
Record
Thrasher was president of FSU from 2014 through 2021, the culmination of a lengthy legislative career that began with him lobbying for the Florida Medical Association and eventually led him to serve in both chambers of the Florida Legislature.
He served in the Florida Senate, starting in 2009 and leaving in 2014, and in the Florida House for eight years, starting in 1992 and terming out in 2000. Thrasher was speaker of the chamber for his last two years. 
Former House Speaker and FSU President John Thrasher dies at 81

Bush recalled the record of Florida’s government under Thrasher’s speakership, during the first two of Bush’s eight years in office. Thrasher’s policies, Bush said, “became the building block for a generation of conservative governance.”
“We now live in a world where owning the other side through social media, going on cable news is the way that you measure your sense of accomplishment. You know what? I thank God I got to work with John Thrasher in an era where getting stuff done mattered a lot more than virtue signaling,” Bush said to a round of applause.

Bush called Thrasher the “godfather” of FSU’s medical school, the establishment of which was a priority for the former speaker.
“For a guy who as successful at everything he did,” Bush said, listing all Thrasher’s titles, “John Thrasher had one of the smallest egos — not just among politicians, which are known for ego, but out of everyone. He always deflected praise and shared the credit for success.” Bush called him the “epitome of a servant leader.”
“When things didn’t go according to plan, he took the blame, even if it wasn’t his fault,” Bush said. 
The service was led by David Swanson, pastor of First Presbyterian church of Orlando. It featured musical performances from an FSU choral ensemble and the FSU hymn by the school’s marching band.

FSU
Thrasher was a double alumnus of the school he led, earning his bachelor’s and law degrees from FSU. In between the two degrees, he served in the U.S. Army and received two Bronze Stars for his service in Vietnam and the Army Commendation Medal in Germany. 
Thrasher co-founded The Southern Group, a lobbying firm, too. 
He served on the faculty of the FSU College of Law. In 2010 and 2011 he was chair of the Republican Party of Florida. 
“John made sure that every student that came to Florida State University had a chance to succeed,” McCullough said. 
Ed Burr, who served on the FSU Board of Trustees during much of Thrasher’s tenure, recalled the impressiveness of Thrasher’s responses to the 2014 shooting at Strozier Library shortly after he became president, the death of a fraternity brother after a hazing incident in 2017, and an off-campus shooting that killed a student in 2018.
“I remember when I came here, I had many people, but the ones that really got [to me] were the students telling me that I had very large shoes to fill, and indeed, I had very large shoes to fill,” McCullough said. 
Speakers echoed that Thrasher often credited his successes to God, wife Jean, and FSU, in that order. 
“His schedule never kept [him] from stopping to engage others — student, faculty member, legislator, or a groundskeeper,” Kyle Clark, FSU’s senior vice president for finance and administration said. 
“He treated everyone with the same respect, dignity, and kindness. He believed in listening and finding common ground and in making sure every person, whether they agreed with him or not, left the conversation knowing that they mattered and that they were heard.”

The affordability gap is highest in the West, where the typical family income is $113,783, just over two-thirds of the $164,832 that would be needed to purchase a median-priced home.
The Northeast, where the typical family makes $114,559, is also unaffordable by this measure, as a median-priced home requires an income of $141,264.
In the Midwest, the median family income is $102,419, more than the $86,256 needed to buy a median-priced home. The same is true in the South, where the median income is $97,812, slightly more than the $96,720 required to buy a typical home.
Nationally, affordability increased slightly compared with June of 2024, with the typical family making $105,431, about 94% of the $111,648 it would need to buy the median-priced home. That’s up from about 92% in June 2024.
In a video posted Aug. 15, Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, said he expects lower interest rates to increase affordability in the months ahead.
“We know that mortgage rates will be coming down and that will bring additional buyers into the market. We just need to make sure we have more supply, more supply to meet that demand,” Yun said.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) HARLAN – County supervisors in Shelby and Story counties voted Tuesday to pursue further legal action in their case against Summit Carbon Solutions pertaining to county-specific ordinances on hazardous liquid pipelines.
A U.S. district judge and federal appeals judges have previously ruled on the case in favor of Summit and now the counties are seeking a review of the rulings from the U.S. Supreme Court, though a Summit filing holds the ordinances would still be preempted by state laws.

In Harlan, at the Shelby County Courthouse, landowners opposed to the pipeline gathered to thank the supervisors. 
Sherri Webb, an affected Shelby County landowner, said Iowans across the state look to Shelby County and say “I wish you were our supervisors.” 
“Thank you,” Webb said, noting that it’s no small feat to decide to appear before the Supreme Court. 
“No matter what, I’m behind you guys,” Webb said. 
Another landowner, Jan Norris who lives in Montgomery County and is a neighbor to the pipeline route, called the board a David standing up to a “well-resourced and motivated” Goliath. 
“Your constituents may not know how lucky they are, but I do,” Norris said. “Because my board has chosen to play it safe and avoid the fight.” 
Norris and Webb have been active at their respective county supervisor meetings since they first learned of the Summit project several years ago. The pipeline would connect to biorefineries across the state and transport liquid carbon dioxide through Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, South Dakota and to underground storage in North Dakota. 
The two said the actions of the Board of Supervisors are important for maintaining local control and working toward standards they believe will be safer and better for their properties. 
Norris said if the outcome of the case is reversed and in favor of the counties, it will benefit many Iowa counties, and other states impacted by the pipeline and similar projects. 
“You guys are doing your job and you shouldn’t be sued for doing your job,” Webb said.
Cindy Hansen, who lives in Ankeny but owns affected land in Shelby County with her sister, said the supervisors have restored some of the hope in the state that she had lost from the actions of the Iowa Utilities Commission and state legislators. 
The Shelby County board said the cost of the lawsuits “have mounted,” but have been covered by the county’s insurer, ICAP, and by a fund the board created, shortly after it was sued by Summit in November 2022, that uses American Rescue Plan Act dollars to cover the costs. 
A copy of both counties’ letter of engagement, obtained by Iowa Capital Dispatch, shows fees for the endeavor would be capped at $60,000.
Mike Kolbe, one of the Shelby County board members, said the budget was a consideration in the decision, but with the fund and continued coverage from ICAP, Kolbe said the county can afford it “with no cost to the taxpayers.” 
Bryce Schaben, the chair of the Shelby board, said the feedback he has received from his community showed there was only one way forward. 
“Everything we’ve heard is to do what we did today,” Schaben said following the meeting. “When you get that kind of support, it’s an easy decision.”
Schaben said if the Supreme Court follows the direction of the previous courts on the case, he will be confused. 
“It’s very confusing that the rulings don’t want to make our counties safe,” Schaben said. “That’s what it comes down to.”
Ordinances in both counties established setbacks and permitting requirements for the pipeline company to construct in the county. Summit argued, and a federal judge in the Southern District of Iowa ruled, the ordinances were preempted by federal pipeline safety standards. 
The counties appealed the case, and judges for the Eighth Circuit court of appeals concurred with the lower court, though one judge partially dissented on the case. 
Story County supervisors approved the decision as part of a consent agenda and did not discuss the decision to engage the D.C. law firm on the suit. 
Steve Kenkel, a former Shelby County supervisor who now serves as an adviser to the board on topics related to the pipeline, quoted Iowa Code where it directs county supervisors to “protect and preserve the rights of their constituents.” 
“That’s what we’re trying to do here,” Kenkel said. “Without county zoning ordinances, the tools supervisors presently have in their tool box … will be tools of the past if this ruling is allowed to stand.”
Both counties voted to engage Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick P.L.L.C. to petition the Supreme Court. 
Summit legal filing says ordinances would be preempted regardless
Summit has sued several counties for similar county ordinance issues, including Emmet, Kossuth and Palo Alto counties. The later-filed cases have been paused while Shelby and Story counties’ case was heard and then appealed. The two counties also petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit for an en banc rehearing of the case in July, which the court denied. 
The other affected counties have requested stays through this process again as Shelby and Story counties decided to take the case to the Supreme Court. 
Summit’s legal team submitted a motion to lift the stay for these other counties, arguing that regardless of the outcome of the Supreme Court petition, the county ordinances would be preempted by state laws. 
“Any county ordinance—including the one here—that attempts to impose additional permitting requirements, control pipeline routes, or regulate construction and operation is preempted by state law,” the motion said. 
The Summit motion for leave of stay in Kossuth County also said certiorari from the Supreme Court was “unlikely in general” and “particularly unlikely” in Shelby and Story counties’ case. 
The motion holds that the Supreme Court could only review whether or not the ordinances were preempted by federal pipeline laws. Still in place, it argues, would be a piece of Iowa Code that gives the Iowa Utilities Commission the authority to set pipeline routes. 
This was noted in the ruling from the Eighth Circuit. Here, the judges explained that a county would be inconsistent with state law, and therefore preempted, if it denied a local zoning permit application from the pipeline company to build on a location that had been approved by the IUC. 
The appellate court decision notes some other states cede this power to local governments and might not be preempted as Iowa counties are. 
Kenkel argued Tuesday that if the Supreme Court did not act in the counties’ favor, the IUC would not be able to route the pipeline based on safety considerations. These and permitting and setback regulations, he said, would instead be up to the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration’s rules.
Rob Sand speaks in Harlan on eminent domain
State Auditor Rob Sand, a Democrat who is running for governor, stopped in Harlan Tuesday as part of his campaign tour across the state. 
Among the things he was asked by the bipartisan crowd at Milk & Honey restaurant downtown: How would he protect property rights from such projects? 
Sand said he does not support eminent domain for CO2 pipelines, “period.” The comment was met with applause, especially considering some of the crowd had filed across the street to the restaurant after the board meeting.

Sand said there are two main reasons why he feels this way. He said he is “deeply skeptical” that a carbon capture pipeline can be considered a common carrier and if “there is a true public purpose” to the project. 
“You can be a supporter of agriculture in the state of Iowa and a supporter of ethanol, and say that the carbon capture pipeline ain’t it,” Sand said. 
Sand said there are other options to sequester CO2 that have an established market. 
Sand said Gov. Kim Reynolds’ lack of action, or public opinion on the issue has been her “single biggest failure.”  
“Never in the state of Iowa, if there’s a tremendous issue with lots of people showing up at the state capitol every single year for the legislative session, will I let five years go by before I decide to maybe share my opinion, only after a bill gets passed,” Sand said.
Reynolds, a Republican, is not seeking reelection.

,Mississippi Today,2025-08-19 21:22:54+00:00,Mississippi Today,FBI arrests ex-coach of elite gymnastics in Iowa on child porn charge from Mississippi,Associated Press,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/19/gymnastics-ex-coach-arrested-iowa-mississippi/,"Sean Gardner, who coached at a center in Iowa that has trained Olympic champions, is facing allegations that he abused young female gymnasts in Iowa and secretly photographed others undressing at a prior job in Purvis, Mississippi.","IOWA CITY, Iowa — The U.S. gymnastics world was just recovering from a devastating sexual abuse scandal when a promising young coach moved from south Mississippi to Iowa to take a job in 2018 at an elite academy known for training Olympic champions.
Sean Gardner coached some of the most promising girls at Chow’s Gymnastics and Dance Institute in West Des Moines, Iowa. The club’s owner, Liang “Chow” Qiao, also thought highly enough of Gardner to put him in charge of a premier junior event.
But four years later, Gardner was gone from Chow’s with little notice.
USA Gymnastics, the organization rocked by the Larry Nassar sex-abuse crisis that led to the creation of the U.S. Center for SafeSport, had been informed by the watchdog group that Gardner was placed on its website’s banned list and was suspended from all contact with gymnasts.

The reason for Gardner’s removal wasn’t disclosed. But court records obtained by The Associated Press show the coach was accused of sexually abusing at least three young gymnasts at Chow’s and secretly recording others undressing in a gym bathroom at his prior job in Purvis, Mississippi.
The FBI arrested Gardner, 38, last week in Iowa on a federal child pornography charge from Mississippi. A parent in Iowa said her daughter, who had alleged wrongdoing by Gardner, did not want to seek criminal charges against him.
The arrest happened more than three years after Gardner was suspended from coaching, but his disciplinary case has still not been resolved by SafeSport, which handles sex-abuse cases in Olympic sports.
In cases like Gardner’s, the public can be in the dark for years while SafeSport investigates and sanctions coaches. SafeSport requires that allegations be reported to police to ensure abusers don’t run unchecked outside of sports, but critics say the system is a slow, murky process.
“From an outward operational view, it seems that if SafeSport is involved in any way, the situation turns glow-in-the-dark toxic,” said attorney Steve Silvey, a longtime SafeSport critic who has represented people in cases involving the center.
While acknowledging there can be delays as its investigations unfold, SafeSport defended its temporary suspensions in a statement as “a unique and valuable intervention” when there are concerns of a risk to others.
Nevertheless, in 2024, Gardner was able to land a job helping care for surgical patients at an Iowa hospital — two years after the abuse allegations against him were reported to SafeSport and the police.
And it was not until late May that West Des Moines police executed a search warrant at his home, eventually leading to the recovery of a trove of photos and videos on his computer and cellphone of nude young girls, court records show.
Authorities in Iowa sealed the court documents after the AP asked about the investigation earlier this month, before details of the federal charge were made public Friday. Gardner, Qiao and Gardner’s former employer in Mississippi did not respond to AP requests for comment. Mississippi Today also left phone messages Tuesday at Jump’In Gymnastics & Tumbling in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, seeking comment.
‘The job that I’ve always wanted’
Chow’s Gymnastics is best known as the academy where U.S. gymnasts Shawn Johnson and Gabby Douglas trained before becoming gold medalists at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics.
Qiao opened the gym in 1998 after starring on the Chinese national team and moving to the United States to coach at the University of Iowa. The gym became a draw for top youth gymnasts, with some families moving to Iowa to train there.
Gardner moved to Iowa in September 2018, jumping at the opportunity to coach under Qiao.
“This is the job that I’ve always wanted. Chow is really someone I have looked up to since I’ve been coaching,” Gardner told the ABC affiliate WOI-TV in 2019. “And you can tell when you step foot in the gym, just even from coaching the girls, the culture that he’s built. It’s amazing. It’s beautiful.”
A year later, Gardner was promoted to director of Chow’s Winter Classic, an annual meet that draws more than 1,000 gymnasts to Iowa. He also coached a junior Olympics team during his four-year tenure at Chow’s.
Several of his students earned college gymnastics scholarships, but Gardner said he had bigger goals.
“You want to leave a thumbprint on their life, so when they go off hopefully to school, to bigger and better things, that they remember Chow’s as family,” he said in a 2020 interview with WOI-TV.
Coach accused of sexual misconduct in Iowa and Mississippi
Gardner is accused of abusing his position at Chow’s and his former job at Jump’In Gymnastics & Tumbling, then located in Purvis, Mississippi, to prey on girls under his tutelage, according to a nine-page FBI affidavit released Friday that summarizes the allegations against him.
A girl in Iowa reported to SafeSport in March 2022 that Gardner used “inappropriate spotting techniques” in which he would put his hands between her legs and touch her vagina, the affidavit said.
It said she alleged Gardner would ask girls if they were sexually active and call them “idiots, sluts, and whores.” She said this behavior began after his hiring in Iowa in 2018 and continued until she left the gym in 2020 and provided the names of six other potential victims.
SafeSport suspended Gardner in July 2022 – four months after the girl’s report – a provisional step it can take in severe cases with “sufficient evidentiary support” as investigations proceed.
A month after that, the center received a report from another girl alleging additional “sexual contact and physical abuse,” including that Gardner similarly fondled her during workouts, the FBI affidavit said. The girl said that he once dragged her across the carpet so hard that it burned her buttocks, the affidavit said.
SafeSport shared the reports with West Des Moines police, in line with its policy requiring adults who interact with youth athletes to disclose potential criminal cases to law enforcement.
While SafeSport’s suspension took Gardner out of gymnastics, the criminal investigation quickly hit a roadblock.

Police records show a detective told SafeSport to urge the alleged victims to file criminal complaints, but only one of their mothers contacted police in 2022. That woman said her daughter did not want to pursue criminal charges, and police suspended the investigation.
Victims of abuse are often reluctant to cooperate with police, said Ken Lang, a retired detective and associate professor of criminal justice at Milligan University.
“In this case you have the prestige of this facility,” he said. “Do they want to associate their name with that, in that way, when their aspirations were to succeed in gymnastics?”
Police suspended the investigation, even as Gardner was on probation for his second-offense of driving while intoxicated.
A dormant case reopened, and a year later, an arrest
The case stayed dormant until April 2024 when another former Chow’s student came forward to the West Des Moines Police Department to report abuse allegations, according to a now-sealed affidavit signed by police detective Jeff Lyon. The AP is not identifying the student in line with its policy of not naming victims of alleged sexual abuse.
The now 18-year-old told police she began taking lessons from Gardner when she was 11 or 12 in 2019, initially seeing him as a “father figure” who tried to help her get through her parents’ divorce. He told her she could tell him “anything,” the affidavit said.
When she moved in 2021, she told police, he gave her a hug and said she could text and follow him on Instagram and other social media sites, where he went by the nickname “Coach Seanie,” because gym policy barring such contact no longer applied.
According to a summary of her statement provided in Lyon’s affidavit, she said Gardner fondled her during exercises, repeatedly touching her vagina; rubbed her back and butt and discussed his sex life; and made her do inappropriate stretches that exposed her privates.
She told police she suspected he used his cellphone to film her in that position.
Reached by the AP, the teen’s mother declined comment. The mother told police she was interested in a monetary settlement with Chow’s because the gym “had been made aware of the complaints and they did nothing to stop them,” according to Lyon’s affidavit. The gym didn’t return AP messages seeking comment.
It took 16 months after the teen’s 2024 report for the FBI to arrest Gardner, who made an initial court appearance in Des Moines on Friday on a charge of producing visual depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct, which can carry up to 30 years in prison. A public defender assigned to represent him didn’t return AP messages seeking comment.
It’s unclear why the case took so long to investigate or when the FBI, which had to pay $138 million to Nassar’s victims for botching that investigation, got involved in the case.
Among evidence seized by investigators in late May were a cellphone, laptop and a desktop computer along with handwritten notes between Gardner and his former pupils, according to the sealed court documents.
They found images of girls, approximately 6 to 14 years in age, who were nude, using the toilet or changing into leotards, those documents show. Those images appear to have come from a hidden camera in a restroom in Mississippi.
They also uncovered 50 video files and 400 photos, including some that appeared to be child pornography, according to the FBI affidavit. One video allegedly shows Gardner entering the bathroom and turning off the camera.
Investigators also found images of an adult woman secretly filmed entering and exiting a bathtub, and identified her as Gardner’s ex-girlfriend. That woman as well as the gym’s owner, Candi Workman, told investigators the images appeared to come from Jump’In Gymnastics’ facility in Purvis, which has since moved to the nearby city of Hattiesburg.
SafeSport’s power has limits
SafeSport has long touted that it can deliver sanctions in cases where criminal charges are not pursued as key to its mission. However, Gardner’s ability to land a job in health care illustrates the limits of that power: It can ban people from sports but that sanction is not guaranteed to reach the general public.
While not commenting about Gardner’s case directly, it said in a statement provided to AP that a number of issues factor into why cases can take so long to close, including the 8,000 reports it receives a year with only around 30 full-time investigators. It has revamped some procedures, it said, in an attempt to become more efficient.
“While the Center is able and often does cooperate in law enforcement investigations,” it said, “law enforcement is not required to share information, updates, or even confirm an investigation is ongoing.”
USA Gymnastics President Li Li Leung called the center’s task “really tough, difficult to navigate.”
“I would like to see more consistency with their outcomes and sanctions,” Leung said. “I would like to see more standardization on things. I would like to see more communication, more transparency from their side.”
A case that lingers, even after the SafeSport ban
As the investigation proceeded, Gardner said on his Facebook page he had landed a new job in May 2024 as a surgical technologist at MercyOne West Des Moines Medical Center. It’s a role that calls for positioning patients on the operating room table, and assisting with procedures and post-surgery care.
Asked about Gardner’s employment, hospital spokesman Todd Mizener told the AP: “The only information I can provide is that he is no longer” at the hospital.
Meanwhile, the case lingers, leaving lives in limbo more than three years after the SafeSport Center and police first learned of it.
“SafeSport is now part of a larger problem rather than a solution, if it was ever a solution,” said attorney Silvey. “The most fundamental professional task such as coordination with local or federal law enforcement gets botched on a daily basis, hundreds of times a year now.”

Bromazolam is described in the letter penned by Sunday and 20 other state attorneys general as a “designer Xanax.” The prosecutors say the drug is increasingly contributing to overdose deaths and posing a growing threat to public health in Pennsylvania and beyond. It is also highly potent and unpredictable, Sunday’s office writes, especially when mixed with opioids. Narcan, which is used to reverse an overdose, is ineffective against the drug in such emergencies. 
Bromazolam is unscheduled under the federal Controlled Substances Act.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Despite its clear dangers, bromazolam remains unscheduled at the federal level, creating significant challenges for law enforcement and public health officials trying to respond to this emerging crisis,” the attorneys generals wrote. “Without scheduling, this drug continues to evade traditional regulatory and prosecutorial tools, hindering interdiction efforts and enabling continued distribution through illicit channels.”
“Taking emergency action to schedule bromazolam will help law enforcement remove it from circulation, give prosecutors the tools to hold traffickers accountable, and send a clear signal that this dangerous substance has no place on our streets,” the attorneys general wrote.
Sunday said that “designer” benzodiazepines, such as bromazolam, surfaced in Pennsylvania in 2022 and contributed to 59 overdose deaths that year. Data from the state Department of Health showed that the number of deaths nearly tripled one year later, according to the joint letter.
“It is a race to stay ahead of drug traffickers when dealing with synthetic drugs, and lives depend on immediate action that will give law enforcement the tools to proactively target traffickers,” Sunday said. “This substance has no legitimate purpose, and is becoming far too common in Pennsylvania and across the nation.”
Sunday, who was sworn into office in January, has joined other coalitions of attorneys general on various letters and lawsuits. Earlier this month, he teamed with 50 attorneys general in a letter to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, calling on the U.S. Department of Justice to assist in addressing illegal offshore gaming and gambling across the country.

Santiago/Getty Images)BILOXI, Miss. — The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.
Justice Department demand for state voter lists underscores their importance

The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.












When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances.


– Minnesota Democratic Secretary of State Steve Simon




Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
GOP pressure
Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.
Trump’s DOJ wants states to turn over voter lists, election info

After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
Unreliable data?
But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.
Though noncitizens can vote in few local elections, GOP goes big to make it illegal

A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.












There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside.


– Charles Stewart III, professor of political science at MIT who studies elections




Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

A multi-agency team of New Mexico forecasters released new budget projections Tuesday that predict the state will continue to be on solid financial footing, with nearly half a billion dollars in “new” money. 
(Photo by Anna Padilla for Source NM)Economists tasked with predicting New Mexico’s financial health said Tuesday the state will generate a little more than $14 billion in revenue in the upcoming fiscal year, a figure that means the state will have nearly half a billion dollars in “new” money to spend when they craft the budget early next year. 
Lawmakers with the interim Legislative Finance Committee heard new projections Tuesday about how much the state is expected to generate in revenue via taxes, investment returns and oil and gas royalties over the next few years. One key estimate they provide is how much “new” money lawmakers will have for the upcoming fiscal year, which is the amount of projected revenue minus how much the state will spend this fiscal year.
Department of Finance and Administration Wayne Propst, whose agency is one of four that team up to develop statewide economic forecasts, said the forecast is just the latest positive sign for the state’s financial health after years of record growth and revenue. 
“I keep thinking that one of these days I’m going to have to show up with some bad news,” he told lawmakers. “But fortunately, today is not that day. The fiscal position of the state of New Mexico remains strong.”
In total, the roughly $14.1 billion the state expects to generate in revenue in the fiscal year beginning Sept. 1, 2026 is about $485 million more than the total amount the state is currently spending this fiscal year, which is approximately $13.6 billion. 
That $485 million in “new” money prompted celebratory news releases from Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and fellow Democrats in charge of the Legislature, who said it will help soften the blow of expected federal spending cuts that could mean the state will have to step in to pay for low-income health insurance or food assistance. 
New Mexico economist: Don’t expect huge jump in oil production, even if Trump slashes regulations

“New Mexico’s strong revenue projection announced in Las Cruces today is good news at a time when the federal government is ruthlessly slashing revenues that states have historically relied on,”  Lujan Grisham said in a statement. “Today’s announcement that our state can expect nearly a half-billion dollars in additional revenue will help us protect the essential services for New Mexicans that Washington has abandoned.”
According to state House Democrats, the “One Big Beautiful Bill” Congress and Trump enacted late last month will mean at least $305 million less in federal funding in the budget that lawmakers will craft during the legislative session beginning in January. The governor’s office put that figure at about $200 million each year for the next few years, primarily due to tax code changes. 
In response to the new forecasts, House Democrats championed their approach of investing a glut of oil and gas royalty payments into revenue-generating reserve funds, saying that the investment strategy has removed volatility from the budgeting process and insulated essential services from price fluctuations in the oil and gas sector. 
Oil and gas revenues are expected to contribute about one-third of the state’s general fund over the next few years, but that figure would have been close to 50% if the state hadn’t diverted excess oil and gas revenues into trust funds that fund early child education, behavioral health or other reserve funds, according to estimates forecasters released Tuesday. 
“Despite the constant stream of chaos coming out of Washington, D.C., New Mexico’s economic outlook remains strong thanks to years of hard work and smart budgeting,” said House Speaker Javier Martínez (D-Albuquerque), in a news release. 
New House budget wrangles record revenue again, but experts warn it won’t last much longer

In addition to the federal cuts, forecasters have predicted a slowdown in oil and gas growth and prices in the next few years, a message they they repeated Tuesday. Ismael Torres, the LFC’s chief economist, said the slowdown and uncertainty around President Donald Trump’s economic policies should give lawmakers caution when crafting the state’s spending plan. 
Along with unpredictable effects of federal policy on the global economy, Torres also mentioned that lawmakers have greatly increased the amount of money they’ve dedicated to non-recurring spending, including significant multi-year funding commitments.
He said continued growth in that type of spending is reducing the amount of funds lawmakers can put in reserves could end up hamstringing lawmakers if expected future revenues “don’t materialize.”
“As economists, you might hear us say that there’s a lot of uncertainty always,” he said. “But this time I really mean it.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_0528-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-19 17:57:23.739947

Idaho Department of Lands seeks to balance pending budget cuts with firefighting needs

The Rock Fire was started by lighting late Aug. 12 or early on Aug. 13 and is burning in the Payette National Forest just south of Tamarack Resort, about 5 miles outside the town of Donnelly.
As of Tuesday, the Rock Fire had increased in size to 2,695 acres, with 0% percent containment, officials said. Nearly 700 personnel were helping fight the Rock Fire on Tuesday, using six helicopters and 26 engines, according to the Great Basin Interagency Incident Management Team 6.
As a result of the Rock Fire, the Valley County Sheriff’s Office has issued evacuation notices for nearby residents and the Payette National Forest and Boise National Forest have issued local road, campground and trail closures.
On Tuesday, the Valley County Sheriff’s Office upgraded the evacuation status for Zone WM-07 located near West Mountain Road from “ready” status to “set” status. 
Idaho operates under a three-tier fire evacuation system. 
“Set” means residents and visitors need to be prepared to evacuate at a moment’s notice because there is significant danger in their area, according to the Valley County Sheriff’s Office. The sheriff’s office instructed people within the “set” status area to face their vehicles toward the street and load up pets, important papers, people, priceless items and prescription medication. In preparation for evacuation, people should close all doors and windows to their home and leave their outside lights on so that fire crews can see the property. To prepare for evacuation, people should wear sturdy shoes, dress in clothing with long sleeves and pants to protect them and grab a handkerchief and googles if they have them available. 
Fire conditions and evacuation orders may change quickly. 
The latest fire and evacuation information is available online at the Valley County Evacuation Map and the Valley County Sheriff’s Office’s Facebook page.

The Trump administration is once again pressuring liberal cities and states to cooperate with deportation efforts, despite previous setbacks in court.
Attorney General Pam Bondi sent letters last week telling sanctuary states, cities and counties that “you better be abiding by our federal policies and with our federal law enforcement, because if you aren’t, we’re going to come after you,” she said in a Fox News interview. She demanded the areas answer her by Tuesday.
Cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies generally refuse to assist with immigration raids or accede to requests for local jails to hold prisoners for deportation. Those that responded to Stateline’s questions about the letters said they were not inclined to change their positions about cooperation with immigration authorities.
“It’s the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they’re not going to intimidate you,” Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.
The Trump administration is attempting to force more cooperation with immigration arrests. But it suffered a serious court reversal on July 25, when a federal judge dismissed a sanctuary policies case against Illinois, Chicago and Cook County.
The state and local policies reflect a “decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law — a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment,” Judge Lindsay Jenkins wrote in an order now under appeal.
Bondi’s letters follow the Justice Department’s Aug. 5 release of a list of sanctuary jurisdictions including 12 states, the District of Columbia, four counties and 18 cities. That’s fewer jurisdictions than the 14 states and almost 500 counties and cities that appeared on an earlier list, which the agency withdrew after criticism that it included conservative counties that were fully cooperating with immigration enforcement.
The states on the new list are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington state. The list also includes some counties and cities in those states as well as in Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New Mexico.










It's the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they're not going to intimidate you.


– Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha


Other federal courts have issued injunctions to at least temporarily stop Trump administration from withholding unrelated federal funding from governments that don’t cooperate on immigration. Cities, counties and states have filed lawsuits challenging Trump’s executive orders targeting sanctuary policies, including a February order that federal payments to states and localities must not “by design or effect, facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration, or abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”

“The executive orders are directing agencies to basically take a maximalist approach to putting pressure on local governments to cooperate with immigration [enforcement], even though they’re not required to do so by federal law,” said Jonathan Miller, one of the attorneys working on the California case for the Public Rights Project, a California-based group promoting civil rights protections for states and cities.
One city on the administration’s list was Rochester, New York, which disciplined some police officers for helping federal agents make a March arrest in the city. The city already faces a lawsuit brought by the Trump administration that prominently mentions the arrest of three men from Guatemala; one of whom has since pleaded guilty to re-entering the United States after a previous deportation.

A spokesperson for the city, Barbara Pierce, said in a statement to The Guardian that, “Nothing in Attorney General Bondi’s letter is new and none of it has legal merit.”
“The letter reiterates many of the frivolous arguments that the federal government has already made in its pending suit against the city of Rochester,” she added. “These same arguments were levied against the city of Chicago and were dismissed by the federal district court for the eastern district of Illinois nearly a month ago.”
Ally Sullivan, a spokesperson for Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, said in a statement that Colorado “is not a sanctuary state. The Governor continues to be frustrated by this mistaken and incorrect label.” In a televised interview earlier this year, Polis pointed out that Colorado fully cooperates with federal authorities on criminal matters. Immigration, he said, is a civil matter.
“In Colorado, we are improving public safety, apprehending dangerous criminals, cooperating with federal law enforcement on criminal investigations, and keeping our communities safe,” Sullivan said.
Nevertheless, Colorado faces a federal lawsuit brought by the administration over its alleged sanctuary policies. Polis signed a measure in May that limits local law enforcement’s communication with federal immigration authorities and restricts where federal authorities can operate within schools, child care facilities, hospitals and libraries without a judicial warrant.

Connecticut Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont in a statement said the state’s Trust Act, which the Trump administration has targeted as a sanctuary policy, was passed with bipartisan support and helps ensure local police concentrate on serious crimes. The Trust Act, passed in 2013 and expanded in 2019, limits information sharing and compliance with requests to detain immigrants for federal immigration authorities.
“Nothing about this makes Connecticut a sanctuary in any legal or practical sense — it makes our state one that upholds the Constitution, respects the rule of law, and prioritizes the safety and well-being of our communities,” Lamont said.

In a sweeping 105-page ruling, Aycock, a President George W. Bush appointee, found that the three Supreme Court districts were drawn in violation of the federal Voting Rights Act. Aycock asked the Legislature to redraw those districts in the future to give Black voters a fair shot at electing candidates of their choice.   
Out of the 100-plus justices who have served on the Mississippi Supreme Court, only four have been Black.
Mississippi law establishes three distinct Supreme Court districts, commonly referred to as the Northern, Central and Southern districts. Voters elect three judges from each of these districts to make up the nine-member court. These districts have not been redrawn since 1987. 
The main district at issue in the case is the Central District, which comprises many parts of the majority-Black Delta and the majority-Black Jackson Metro area. Currently, two white justices, Kenny Griffis and Jenifer Branning, and one Black justice, Leslie King, represent the district. 
Last year, Branning, a white candidate who described herself as a “constitutional conservative” and was backed by the Republican Party, defeated longtime Justice Jim Kitchens, a white man widely viewed as a candidate supported by Black voters. 
No Black person has ever been elected to the Mississippi Supreme Court without first obtaining an interim appointment from the governor, and no Black person from either of the two other districts has ever served on the state’s high court. 
“In short, the evidence illustrates that Black candidates who desire to run for the Mississippi Supreme Court face a grim likelihood of success,” Aycock wrote in her ruling. 
The lawsuit was filed in April 2022 by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Mississippi, the Southern Poverty Law Center and private law firms on behalf of a group of Black Mississippians, including state Sen. Derrick Simmons of Greenville, and Ty Pinkins, a previous Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate.
Aycock wrote that the parties will convene a status conference soon to discuss an appropriate deadline for the Legislature to address the districts. The Legislature earlier this year adjourned its regular session, and Gov. Tate Reeves is the only person with the power to call lawmakers into a special session.
The state could appeal Aycock’s ruling to the conservative U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/06101021/HB-1020-appeal1.jpg,,,2025-08-19 17:57:23.739947

(Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer)Housing became more affordable this June, as higher incomes and slightly lower interest rates overcame higher prices, according to a National Association of Realtors report.
However, the South and the Midwest are the only regions where a family with typical or median income can afford a median-priced house, according to the report. The group considers a mortgage to be affordable if the monthly payment (principal and interest) is 25% or less of the family’s income.
The affordability gap is highest in the West, where the typical family income is $113,783, just over two-thirds of the $164,832 that would be needed to purchase a median-priced home.
The Northeast, where the typical family makes $114,559, is also unaffordable by this measure, as a median-priced home requires an income of $141,264.
In the Midwest, the median family income is $102,419, more than the $86,256 needed to buy a median-priced home. The same is true in the South, where the median income is $97,812, slightly more than the $96,720 required to buy a typical home.
Nationally, affordability increased slightly compared with June of 2024, with the typical family making $105,431, about 94% of the $111,648 it would need to buy the median-priced home. That’s up from about 92% in June 2024.
In a video posted Aug. 15, Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, said he expects lower interest rates to increase affordability in the months ahead.
“We know that mortgage rates will be coming down and that will bring additional buyers into the market. We just need to make sure we have more supply, more supply to meet that demand,” Yun said.

Two New Mexico residents, Paul Ortega and Rebecca Scott, both of whom say they were forced to wait for their gun purchases despite quickly passing background checks, sued Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and Attorney General Raúl Torrez over the law on the day it took effect: May 15, 2024. Their suit, backed by the National Rifle Association and other pro-gun organizations, contends the law is unconstitutional under the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, as made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment. A federal district judge in July of 2024, however, denied the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction against the law while the lawsuit proceeded.
In its 2-1 split decision Tuesday, the Appeals Court reversed that decision, pausing the law, and sent the case back to the lower court. “Cooling-off periods infringe on the Second Amendment by preventing the lawful acquisition of firearms,” the decision reads. “Cooling off periods do not fit into any historically grounded exceptions to the right to keep and bear arms, and burden conduct within the Second Amendment’s scope. In this preliminary posture, we conclude that New Mexico’s Waiting Period Act is likely an unconstitutional burden on the Second Amendment rights of its citizens.”
The governor’s office says it is reviewing its legal options for responding to the ruling.
“Today’s decision by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals is deeply disappointing, plainly wrong and likely to cost lives in New Mexico,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement. “New Mexico’s waiting period law was carefully crafted to minimize gun violence while respecting Second Amendment rights. The dissenting opinion in today’s ruling even notes that New Mexico’s law ‘is likely to save approximately thirty-seven lives per year.’”
Bill to establish a 7-day wait for gun sales headed to Gov. Lujan Grisham

The governor’s statement continues to say that the Tuesday ruling ignored a prior Tenth Circuit ruling that upheld Colorado’s law barring gun purchases by anyone under the age of 21, or “a law that requires 18-year-olds to wait three years to purchase a weapon.” Judge Scott M. Matheson dissenting opinion in Tuesday’s decision makes the same argument. The majority opinion acknowledges that precedent and also acknowledges that “courts have only partially fleshed out the boundaries of these commercial conditions.” However, it continues, “even in this murky territory, the Waiting Period Act falls far short of a presumptively constitutional law.”
Lujan Grisham’s statement also contends the ruling mischaracterized New Mexico’s gun-purchase waiting period as applying to “everyone,” when it exempts people with concealed carry permits; law enforcement officers; and people who sell guns to immediate family members.
“The evidence is clear,” the governor concludes. “Waiting periods prevent impulsive acts of violence and suicide, giving people time to step back and reassess their emotions during moments of crisis. I’m disappointed that today’s ruling doesn’t take this into account.”
The NRA issued a statement commending the decision. “In courtrooms across America, the NRA is successfully leading the charge to protect law-abiding Americans’ Second Amendment rights,” said NRA-Institute for Legislative Action Executive Director, John Commerford said in a statement. “The 10th Circuit has sided with the NRA and held that radical waiting period laws are indeed unconstitutional. This decision not only impacts gun owners in New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Kansas, and Oklahoma, but serves as a key piece in dismantling similar gun control laws across the country.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/gun-rack-1-1024x678.jpeg,,,2025-08-19 16:56:23.755042

And what we get consistently from those employees is, ‘I will be happy to share information with you, but I will not come and testify, and I would prefer you don’t use my name, because the retribution that may come back at me in our department could be swift and severe because of what we may be telling you,’” Committee Chair Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay Township) said. 
After reviewing the state’s current whistleblower protection law, DeBoyer found it “woefully inept” saying it provided “exactly zero penalties, maybe a $500 fine if it is determined that an employer, a department head, a supervisor, has intimidated or harassed you because you have come forward and spoke the truth.”
In response, DeBoyer’s bill, which has yet to be introduced and given a bill number, would up the fine to $2,000, with the fine placed in the general fund. 
While the current law allows for the reinstatement of any employee who was terminated for speaking out against misconduct, DeBoyer’s bill would allow them to receive up to three times the amount of back wages as well as full reinstatement of fringe benefits and seniority rights. 
“If all you’re going to get for coming forward and then being treated poorly is your job back, what’s the motivation, right? You’ve been treated poorly, probably, possibly run through the ringer. Your reputation may have been damaged.…Obviously, getting their job back and the $2,000 fine puts a little more teeth into the bill,” DeBoyer said.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Central College has spent this summer making internal changes to leadership and operations, concluding work college leadership said they started strategizing on after the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Central College President Mark Putnam said he’s approached decisions around changing university operations as “rethinking the work” — looking at measures to save money and streamline services without lowering the quality of a Central education and experience.
“I think how any institution approaches this could risk, in a negative scenario, quality, but I think for most it’s about maintaining quality by rethinking the ways in which we do things and beginning to change the conformities and conventional-wisdom pathways that we have followed,” Putnam said.

In spring 2022, Putnam said Central College staff and leadership began looking at how the university could shrink costs in both academic and business areas. The goal was to take a more holistic look at operations and implement measures they believed would work, even if they went against the traditional practices of most universities.
Putnam said the amount they were targeting for savings at the time was around $5 million from an expense base he said was “north of $40 million” in order to reach and exceed a neutral cash-flow budget. The university achieved a balanced budget at the end of fiscal year 2025 in early July, he said, with a “10-percent structural realignment” in funds.
After having academic departments go through quantitative and qualitative data to determine how they could both evolve and sustain themselves, Putnam said the university has, in phases, brought its number of departments down from 18 to seven. This was done by integrating separate programs, like music and art and theatre, into singular departments, categorized by their similarities of subject.
This allowed the Pella university to save money and prompted further collaboration between faculty and staff, which Putnam said could lead to new innovations and efficiencies. The university also offered “voluntary separations” to certain employees throughout this time, he said.
“Having one mind looking across those various interests that are manifested within the campus, and increasingly through ‘Imagine More’ with the community, in partnerships that we’re beginning to form in that arena, well, suddenly this makes more sense, to have a more integrated, thoughtful design, rather than having them isolated from each other,” Putnam said.
The “Imagine More: It’s Central to Pella” initiative, launched in December 2023 to bring college and community closer together, was also factored into thinking about efficiencies on campus, Putnam said. Some Central facilities will be repurposed for projects undertaken through partnerships between the college and outside groups, Putnam said, and the college has taken some buildings offline and moved some operations around to save money and square-footage.
Other areas of integration have come from the business side of the university, Putnam said, including the creation of the executive director for retail management role. Iwan Williams — appointed to the new position in January — oversees everything from local business partnerships and retail services run by Central to catering, concessions, events, clinics and more.
When someone comes to Central hoping to put on an event or partner on a project, Putnam said they can now go to one person for all of their needs rather than having to jump between a bunch of different people to sort things out.
With three years of work now complete, Putnam said the university finished the past fiscal year with a balanced budget, successful fundraising and plans to retire short-term debt the institution still has. This was done through a mix of restructuring and increasing revenue streams.
Central’s advancement division also saw changes this summer, with the university announcing a realignment in a news release in order to support “A World of Good,” a comprehensive fundraising campaign launched in the spring.
Sunny Eighmy, vice president for advancement at Central, said there have been a couple of departures from the team that led to a downsize in the workforce and this summer several people were promoted in order to better integrate communications and advancement staffs and handle alumni engagement.
The “A World of Good” campaign will have Eighmy and other advancement staff working on fundraising, she said mainly for endowed scholarships, and going into communities Central is a part of and tracking the university’s economic impact, which includes recording volunteer service hours from members of the Central campus. According to its website, the campaign has already raised nearly $46 million of its $50 million goal.
“For us at Central, it’s always been about our students first, and they’re really at the heart of most of our decisions,” Eighmy said.
While Putnam said the job of reorganization may be done for now, he is still looking ahead to what could impact university operations in the future. One area which Putnam said could impact the university, and in some ways already is, is AI and its applications both in the classroom and business office.
Changes Central may or may not have to make in the future could come less from an internal need to shift things and more from society as it evolves and its wants change.
“Do I think there’s going to be more organizational development? Absolutely,” Putnam said. “I just don’t know what it’s going to look like.”

(Quenton King | Courtesy photo)Representatives with the United Coal Workers of America have condemned a federal court’s decision to continue delaying the implementation of a federal rule to lower coal miners’ exposure to dangerous silica dust, calling the pushback “bureaucratic cowardice.”
The silica dust rule — finalized under the U.S. Department of Labor and the Mine Safety and Health Administration last year — should have gone into effect on Monday after being delayed for the first time in April.
But now the rule has yet again been pushed back to at least October due to a previous temporary injunction issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in response to a request from the National Sand, Stone and Gravel Association to block the rule’s implementation completely.
The rule would have gone into effect on Monday only for coal mines; the NSSGA — along with several other industry groups who joined the organization in its request — would not have been impacted by the new regulations until 2027, per the rule.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Meanwhile, as the rule is delayed, more and more coal miners are working in dusty conditions known to cause and exacerbate black lung disease.
“This is bureaucratic cowardice, plain and simple,” said UMWA International Secretary-Treasurer Brian Sanson. “We’ve buried too many friends, too many fathers, and too many sons because of black lung. Bowing to corporate interests doesn’t solve the problem; it puts more miners at risk. The science is clear, the rule is needed, and the delay is shameful.”
Other industries have had similar protections in place for their workers for years due to settled science showing the dangers posed by constant exposure to silica dust.
“This delay is simply a death sentence for more miners,” said UMWA International President Cecil E. Roberts. “The fact that an industry association with no stake in coal mining can hold up lifesaving protections for coal miners is outrageous. The Department of Labor and MSHA should be fighting to implement this rule immediately, not kicking enforcement down the road yet again. Every day they delay, more miners get sick, and more miners die. That’s the truth.”

Black lung has no cure. Experts say the most effective way to stop the disease from forming or from evolving into a more complicated case is to limit exposure to silica dust.
The finalized silica dust rule, if implemented, would cut the exposure limits for coal miners in half for the first time ever. It would also impose new penalties for mines that operate out of compliance and require companies to offer free medical monitoring for their workers with the hope of detecting black lung and other respiratory diseases earlier.
Coal miners and advocates for people with black lung have been directly fighting since at least 2009 for industry protections against the disease.
Rebecca Shelton, director of policy for the Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center, said the continued delay of the rule shows that “the Trump Administration and the coal companies are seemingly working hand-in-hand to slow down the process and weaken future protections.”
“These delays and efforts to weaken the rule are a disgrace, and undermine the claims of anyone in the Trump Administration who claims to be on the side of coal miners,” Shelton said.
While the rule is being continuously delayed, President Donald Trump has called for the country to increase coal production.
But coal miners in Central Appalachia and beyond are already seeing higher rates of black lung than any time in the previous 25 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The disease is also hitting coal miners at younger ages than ever before due to a lack of easily accessible coal. Today, miners must cut through more layers of silica-rich sandstone to reach the coal that remains in existing seams, creating dustier conditions that increases their risk of developing black lung.
“Every American worker deserves to come home from work with their lungs intact, miners included,” Roberts said. “It’s as simple as that.”

State Ports Authority)MOUNT PLEASANT — Tariff uncertainties dented cargo numbers at the Port of Charleston last month, although the drop was in line with State Ports Authority expectations.
And, overall, the maritime agency finished its most recent fiscal year with an increase in containers.
“We’ll see,” Barbara Melvin, the authority’s president and CEO, said when asked about the impact of the Trump administration’s wide-ranging and on-again, off-again tariffs on foreign imports.
European imports to see 15% tariffs after Trump strikes trade deal

“There has certainly been a responsiveness in importers to watch the implementation of tariff deals as well as what might come in the future,” Melvin said. “I think, just as in any economic cycle that we have endured, the port — because of our infrastructure investments — will come out on the strong side of that.”
The port finished fiscal 2025, which ended June 30, handling a little more than 1.4 million containers of all sizes – up 2.3% from the previous 12-month period.
But in July, the first month of the new fiscal year, the port moved 117,059 cargo containers of all sizes through its terminals. That’s a nearly 6% drop from the same month a year ago.
Containers that arrived at the port loaded with goods declined by 7.5% year-over-year.
How all of that translates into money for South Carolina’s economic driver is unclear. The port’s financial numbers for the fiscal year will come out next month.
“I think that, obviously, there’s a substantial amount of uncertainty that we’re seeing” among shippers, Phil Padgett, the authority’s chief financial officer and vice president of administration, told the agency’s board of directors during a meeting Tuesday.
Depending on how tariffs play out, the port could see cargo levels land somewhere between an 8% loss and a 6% gain by the time the current fiscal year ends next June, according to an analysis by Joey Von Nessen, a research economist at the University of South Carolina.
The authority is projecting containerized cargo will be flat year-over-year.
Melvin said Charleston’s port could see import growth in the coming months as retailers look to stock their shelves with holiday-related merchandise. A 90-day pause in tariff hikes on Chinese goods, announced earlier this month, will likely help those numbers.
“Chinese imports have stayed steady during the first quarter of our fiscal year,” Melvin said.
Another boost could come from two new container line services that will start stopping at Charleston’s port in September.
Mediterranean Shipping Co. will add weekly calls on both its Albatross and Dragon services linking the port with stops in Europe, the Mediterranean and Asia. Ships on those routes can carry up to 15,000 cargo boxes measured in 20-foot equivalents.

The national outlook isn’t as bright.
U.S. ports are expected to see a year-over-year 5.6% decline in imported cargo by the end of this year, according to the National Retail Federation and Hackett Associates, a maritime consultant.
“Tariffs are beginning to drive up consumer prices, and fewer imports will eventually mean fewer goods on store shelves,” Jonathan Gold, the federation’s vice president of supply chain and customs policy, said in a written statement. “Small businesses especially are grappling with the ability to stay in business.”
The forecast comes as tariffs on dozens of countries around the world that had been announced, postponed and then finally enacted after months of negotiations and deals began to take effect.
“Friends, allies and foes are all being hit by distortions in trade flows as importers try to second-guess tariff levels by pulling forward imports before the tariffs take effect,” analyst Ben Hackett said in a statement.
Hackett said the result will be “a downturn in trade volumes by late September because inventories for the holiday season will already be in hand.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/wando-welch-1024x575.jpg,,,2025-08-19 16:56:23.755042

Expanded use of mobile centers, which can be set up in rural areas that are miles away from brick-and-mortar clinics, are seen as a way to address access challenges. 
“We know that transportation is a tremendous barrier to people in this state receiving treatment particularly in rural parts of our state where there is a lack of public transportation and there are long distances between clinics and where people live,” said First Lady Anna Stein, who spoke at the mobile center’s unveiling Tuesday. 
“Mobile units can help alleviate burdens felt in our rural areas,” she said. “They also have the potential to serve highly vulnerable and harder to access populations such as people living in shelters or in jails.” 
The Morse Clinics, founded by Dr. Eric Morse, runs the clinic parked outside Healing Transitions in Raleigh.
Stein called him a leader in advocating for mobile opioid treatment programs in the state. 
The state’s rules have staffing and counseling requirements for the mobile units. They are considered extensions of brick-and-mortar programs and must operate within 75 miles of a clinic. 
Healing Transitions offers a long-term recovery program for Wake County residents. Having the mobile unit on its campus puts medications and counseling within easy walking distance of the main building. However, it’s not necessary to be in a Healing Transitions program to use the van. 
More mobile units may be open by the end of the year.  
Vaya Health, the regional mental health agency with a footprint in western and central North Carolina, plans to use Hurricane Helene recovery money for six units. 
Three more mobile units sponsored by private providers could be open in Greensboro, Charlotte, and Raleigh by the end of the year, according to a state Department of Health and Human Services news release. 
Fifty-five of the state’s 100 counties have at least one opioid treatment clinic.
Morse said he sees using mobile units to help scout locations for future brick-and-mortar programs. 
“I see mobile units as an opportunity to set up locations in places where we’re not sure whether or not they’ll be successful,” he said. “If it is, great, we’ll keep it here. If it’s really successful. We might actually build a clinic here. And if it’s not successful we can just move it to another location.”
County data on the location of overdose deaths can point to places where opioid treatment programs are needed, he said. 
“It makes sense to target where people are dying and need our help the most,” Morse said. 
Stein said one of her missions is to reduce the stigma surrounding mental health and substance use disorders. 
“That stigma has too often resulted in a lack of access to medication-assisted treatment,” she said. “Methadone and buprenorphine, medications provided in our opioid treatment programs, are gold standard treatments for opioid use disorder, and everyone who can benefit from these medications should have access to them.”
Stigma is one of the reasons people don’t seek help, said Kelly Crosbie, director of the Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Use Services at DHHS. 
Part of the stigma comes from the claim that medication-assisted treatment substitutes one drug for another. 
“That’s just silly,” Crosbie said. People aren’t made to feel ashamed for taking medication to treat diabetes or heart conditions, she said. 
“Methadone and other medications for opioid use disorder save lives,” Crosbie said. “They help people maintain long-term recovery. To have the lives they were meant to have.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_4697-1024x587.jpg,,,2025-08-19 16:56:23.755042

Idaho governor calls on state agencies to cut budgets by 3%

On Friday, Idaho Gov. Brad Little issued an executive order requiring all state agencies, other than public schools, to reduce spending by 3% in the current fiscal year 2026, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
During an interview Tuesday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise, Idaho Department of Lands Director Dustin Miller confirmed the department is subject to the 3% cuts. 
“The 3% holdback planning work is occurring right now,” Miller said. “Nothing’s been finalized, but we are making sure that we continue to maintain strong initial attacks (in response to wildfire) and a robust firefighting force, because we’ve got another four weeks or so – knock on wood – of fire season left. So we’re going to continue to ensure that we’re making the necessary proposals to reduce our general fund component of our budget by 3%, while at the same time still providing that same level of fire protection and services for our customers and the public.”
The Idaho Legislature already low-balled the amount of state funding available to fight wildfires this year. During the 2025 legislative session, Idaho legislators approved a one-time $40 million transfer to the state’s Fire Suppression Deficiency Fund. 
The $40 million is less than Little requested and less than the $58 million the state spent fighting wildfires during the long and difficult 2024 fire season, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
 How much has Idaho spent fighting wildfires this year?

So far this year, the state has accrued about $18.9 million in total fire season costs, Miller told Little and members of the Idaho State Board of Land Commissioners during the land board’s monthly meeting Tuesday.
Little’s executive order on the budget holdbacks and the state’s overall revenue situation are also having an effect on the Idaho Department of Land’s upcoming 2027 budget request that officials will submit to the state by the end of this month.

Miller shared documents with the State Board of Land Commissioners showing that the department was preparing to request new general fund budget enhancements totalling $1.9 million with three new full-time positions for 2027. However, after meeting with the Idaho Division of Financial Management about the state’s budget guidance, the department is reducing next year’s general fund budget request to just $16,600 in new, ongoing general fund spending, an increase of 0.14%. The $16,600 is just enough to cover inflation and a 1% change in employee compensation pay increase for timber protection associations that fight fires, land board meeting documents show. 
“This is a maintenance budget only,” Miller told the Land Board, borrowing the phrase “maintenance of operations budget” that state legislators now use to refer to a bare-bones budget that is basically just intended to keep the lights on.
 Why are Idaho state agencies forced to cut their budgets in the middle of the year?

The decision to reduce state agency budgets by 3% came just months after Little and the Idaho Legislature reduced the amount of revenue available to spend in the state budget by more than $450 million during the 2025 legislative session so they could cut taxes and pay for a new tax credit that reimburses families for education expenses including tuition at private, religious schools.

Additionally, state revenues have come in below the projections the Idaho Legislature set in building the state budget several times in recent months. 
Most recently, state revenues came in $39.1 million below the state’s new projection for the month of July, which is the first month of the current 2026 fiscal year. That’s a miss of nearly a full 10%, according to the Idaho General Fund Revenue Report for July that the Idaho Division of Financial Management released Friday. 
By law, all state agencies must submit their budget requests for next year to the state by Sept. 1.

(Exhibits from Iowa District Court files) Lawyers for the family of an Iowa woman murdered by her estranged husband say that had it not been for Bellevue police officers’ “deliberate refusal to enforce the law” and “arrest their buddy,” the woman would be alive today.
The family of the late Angela Prichard sued the Bellevue city police in 2024, arguing that despite Christopher Prichard’s well-established pattern of defying court orders and behaving in a threatening manner, city police repeatedly failed to enforce a no-contact order against him in the summer and fall of 2022.

Shortly before 8 a.m. on Oct. 8, 2022, the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office responded to a 911 call from the Mississippi Ridge Kennels where Angela Prichard worked. When police arrived, Angela Prichard was found dead from a gunshot wound to the chest. She was 55 years old.
The next day, Christopher Prichard was located in a Jackson County residence with the murder weapon and ammunition still in his possession. He was later convicted of murder in the first degree.
The lawsuit claimed the murder was the result of a “state-created danger” caused by the malfeasance, reckless or intentional behavior of the Bellevue Police Department. It accused city police officers of “showing favoritism toward Christopher Prichard,” and alleged that his friendly relationship with the police “enabled and fostered” his ability to murder his estranged wife.
In October, the chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa, C.J. Williams, dismissed the family’s lawsuit, writing that he was “skeptical that more aggressive conduct by the officers would have changed anything.”

The judge said the position of the plaintiffs seemed to be that “had the officers arrested Christopher more often, it would have prevented Angela’s murder. Arguably, one could equally speculate that it was the officers’ arrest of Christopher for violating the no-contact order that angered him enough to kill Angela.”
David O’Brien, the Cedar Rapids attorney for Angela Prichard’s family, has appealed that ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.
In court filings, O’Brien says Christopher Prichard “avoided a lengthy jail sentence solely because of the defendants’ deliberate refusal to enforce the law … Had the defendants held (Christopher Prichard) accountable for even a fraction of his unlawful conduct — like they would any other defendant — he would have been incarcerated and Angela would be alive.”
O’Brien also says the city’s “repeated and intentional violations” of the Iowa Open Records Law and federal civil procedure involve efforts by the city to “intentionally conceal” information about the matter.
Plaintiffs point to inaction by the city police
In a brief filed with the appellate court, O’Brien includes what he calls a “list of critical pleaded facts, entirely ignored by the defendants on appeal,” that should overcome any deficiencies in the case cited by Judge Williams.
Among those alleged facts:
— Christopher Prichard was out on bail for a felony offense, and his bail could have been revoked at any time for unlawful behavior, placing him behind bars at the time he murdered Angela Prichard.
— The police allowed Christopher Prichard “to get away with another Class C felony after he placed a tracking device in Angela’s car, a serious breach of (his) bail requirements that would have resulted in prolonged pre-trial incarceration and a ten-year prison sentence if convicted.”
— There were at least four documented violations of the temporary restraining order that were “ignored” by the police, any one of which could have led to bail revocation or a prison sentence.
— Nine days before the killing, then-Jackson County Attorney Sara Davenport wrote an email to the police advising them that Christopher Prichard had until 2 p.m. the next day to report to jail. “If he does not report I will be requesting a warrant,” she wrote. “I wanted all of you to be aware as I’m afraid he might try to do something tonight.” The next day, she wrote to the police, “Prichard did not show for (jail) and a warrant has been issued!” The police department’s failure to act on that warrant demonstrates the department’s “complete disregard for foreseeable harm,” O’Brien alleges.
In his appellate brief, O’Brien goes on to state that in the week before the murder, the police opted not to arrest Christopher Prichard but did find time to escort “a large vehicle” through town, chaperone a high school dance, make six traffic stops, perform funeral escorts and investigate complaints of a sick-looking raccoon and a growling dog.
It’s reasonable to infer from those actions, O’Brien argues, that city police officers “intentionally avoided arresting their buddy, Christopher Prichard, and there was not a competing resource allocation issue preventing them from doing so.”
City: We’re not liable for ‘murder committed by a third party’
In its brief to the appellate court, the city has argued that the plaintiffs’ assertion of due-process violations fails because, as other courts have held, the state’s failure to protect an individual against violence at the hands of another person does not constitute a violation of due process rights.
Under prevailing law, the Constitution only requires that the government protect a private individual in two circumstances: when the individual is in government custody, or when the government, through its actions, has fostered a state-created danger.
The city’s lawyers note that while Judge Williams recognized allegations related to inaction by the police, there was no evidence to show the police “affirmatively acted” to put Angela Prichard at increased risk.
Lawyers for the city also argue that even if the police had arrested Christopher Prichard prior to the murder, “this does not guarantee that the tragic outcome of this case would have been any different,” noting that prosecutors or judges might have dismissed any case initiated by the officers or simply released Prichard from custody.
“Plaintiffs ask this court to hold the defendants liable for an intentional murder committed by a third party,” lawyers for the city argue in their brief to the appellate court. “Implied in this demand is that the defendants be held liable for factors well outside their control …  This court should affirm the district court’s ruling.”

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images).Self-driving vehicle technology continues to advance, prompting a wave of liability and safety regulations from state lawmakers.
This year, lawmakers in Arizona, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada and the District of Columbia enacted legislation to regulate driverless vehicles, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures.
While much of the legislation aims to update existing law to include new definitions for autonomous vehicles, other measures put rules in place regarding insurance, permitting, licensing and road testing.
In total, lawmakers in 25 states introduced 67 bills related to autonomous vehicles, according to the database. California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania currently have bills under consideration. Alaska, Delaware and Washington have bills that will be carried over into the next legislative session.
Governors vetoed two measures this year. Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis shot down a measure that would have required a driver to be present in any commercial vehicle being operated by an automated driving system.
Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a measure that would have put rules in place for “high-risk artificial intelligence systems,” but would have excluded “autonomous vehicle technology” from that category.
As of now, there are no vehicles that have achieved full autonomy, according to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ criteria. But several car companies have introduced automated driving features, allowing drivers to take their hands off the wheel.
Tesla is rolling out its Full Self-Driving feature, a system under which a vehicle can drive itself almost anywhere with minimal intervention from the driver. Tesla Autopilot, which the company made available to the public in late 2024, also helps with basic vehicle maneuvering.
And Waymo, the country’s first autonomous ride-hailing service, is currently operating in Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Los Angeles; Phoenix and San Francisco. The robo-taxi company plans to expand to Miami and Washington, D.C., next.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, vehicle safety is the main benefit of driverless cars. With higher levels of automation, there is less room for human error or driver distractions. The new technology also could improve safety for bicyclists and pedestrians, according to the agency.
But driverless cars have been involved in hundreds of accidents over the past few years. Between 2021 and 2024, there were 696 accidents reported that involved a Waymo vehicle, according to an analysis by California-based law firm DiMarco | Araujo | Montevideo.
And last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began investigating Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system after multiple reports of crashes that occurred in low-visibility conditions.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma is a “blueprint” for Washington, D.C. of how to implement public-private partnerships in biotechnology, said a federal official who has been tasked with reviewing advancements in the industry. 
Michelle Rozo, vice chair of the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology, said Oklahoma stands out from other states because of the collaboration between industries and the public-private partnerships in the state.
The Commission, which was established by Congress to advance the United States’ leadership in biotechnology, is traveling across the country to discuss how states are advancing biotechnology and understand how the group can best implement its recommendations. 
The main recommendation, Rozo said, is to maintain public-private partnerships in the biotechnology industry.
“I like to say we’re beginning to be able to program biology like we program computers, but the outcomes are going to have much more of a wide- reaching effect,” Rozo said. “‘When you program computers, you just get ones and zeros out. When you program biology, you get medicines, you get food, you get materials, you get treatments. … The limits almost do not exist.”
Rozo was joined by a handful of other commissioners, including Republican U.S. Rep. Stephanie Bice, during a stop in Oklahoma City on Tuesday as part of a nationwide roadshow to discuss how biotechnology advancements could shape national defense. The Commission provides recommendations about the intersection of national security and biotechnology, which uses biology or living organisms to develop new products and technologies or improve existing ones. 
The commission in April offered Congress a series of recommendations. 
Representatives from Oklahoma State University, the University of Oklahoma and the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation spoke about the importance of higher education in pushing innovation in biotechnology forward. Research at these institutions ranges from food security and supply chain resiliency to developing medical treatments and devices. 
The commission also heard from state leaders about strategies to create hands-on learning opportunities and address gaps in the workforce. 
The greatest need is more talent and researchers in Oklahoma to push for innovation, but it can be difficult to draw them when most research dollars go to institutions on the East and West Coasts, officials said. 
When asked about federal cuts to research grants and higher education, Bice said Congress “isn’t interested” in huge cuts to research. 
“We recognize that research at large, whether it is through organizations like OMRF or organizations like OU and OSU that are doing really innovative things, is important,” Bice said. “And we’ll continue to invest in those things moving forward.”
Since President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has proposed cutting over $1 billion from the National Institutes of Health, which conducts and supports medical research. Some of the proposals have faced legal challenges. 
Bice said the commission is on the road to highlight the importance of biotechnology and address the role Oklahoma can play in addressing challenges the U.S. faces in national security.

Miller,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/08/newsom-redistricting-republican-lawsuit/,"California Democrats used a common legislative tactic called ""gut and amend"" to rush legislation for a special election on new election maps. Republicans say that violates the state constitution.","In summary
California Democrats used a common legislative tactic called “gut and amend” to rush legislation for a special election on new election maps. Republicans say that violates the state constitution.


A group of California Republicans is suing the state to block the Democratic-controlled Legislature from considering the bills that would allow Gov. Gavin Newsom to facilitate a special election on gerrymandered congressional maps. 
The legal action could slow down the process by which elections officials, already tight on time, get the maps onto Californians’ ballots for the Nov. 4 special election Newsom wants. But that depends on how quickly the California Supreme Court moves, and whether it suspends the process while considering the lawsuit.
Newsom needs voter approval for the maps because California has an independent redistricting commission that draws election maps after every census. He’s in a hurry to get the measure on the ballot as a response to Republican gerrymandering efforts in Texas that are intended to sway the 2026 congressional elections in the GOP’s — and President Donald Trump’s — favor.
The Republicans argue that Democratic leaders violated the state constitution by bypassing a rule that says with few exceptions legislation must be publicly available for 30 days before lawmakers vote on it. 
To get the maps on the ballot, Democrats repurposed two existing bills rather than introduce new legislation that would trigger the 30-day window.
Sen. Tony Strickland, Republican of Huntington Beach and the lead lawmaker on the lawsuit, slammed Newsom and Democrats for drawing up a “backroom deal” with “ “no public input, no transparency, no light of day”
“If they did it right, they would have public hearings, public notice, they would get the authority from the people of California, and then they would draw the maps,” Strickland said.
The bills in question, Assembly Bill 604 and Senate Bill 280, were first introduced and given bill numbers in early February. The new language on the redistricting effort was posted early Monday morning. 
Chris Micheli, a longtime lobbyist, said lawmakers “for decades” have viewed a bill’s initial introduction date – often in early January near the start of session – as the date that starts the 30-day clock. For gut-and-amends, the Legislature abides by a different rule added to the state constitution by voters in 2016: the language needs to be published for 72 hours before lawmakers can vote.
“To be fair, it is untested and there’s no court decision on this,” Micheli said of Republicans’ lawsuit. But, “I don’t think it will succeed.”
Lawmakers frequently use the gut-and-amend tactic to skirt deadlines and introduce new legislation late in the season. Rarely, if ever, does the opposition party call on the California State Supreme Court to mediate what is otherwise a wonky game of insider legislative baseball.
But with the redistricting push, Republican lawmakers have doubled down on their defense of the state’s citizen redistricting commission, established in 2010 on a bipartisan basis to prevent politicians from drawing maps that are self-serving. 
“The public cannot have a voice if they do not know what’s going on,” said Assemblyman Carl DeMaio of San Diego, who is not party to the lawsuit. “What Governor Newsom and the legislators are trying to do is prevent the public from knowing what’s going on before it’s too late.”

(Getty Images)Representatives with the United Coal Workers of America have condemned a federal court’s decision to continue delaying the implementation of a federal rule to lower coal miners’ exposure to dangerous silica dust, calling the pushback “bureaucratic cowardice.”
The silica dust rule — finalized under the U.S. Department of Labor and the Mine Safety and Health Administration last year — should have gone into effect on Monday after being delayed for the first time in April.
But now the rule has yet again been pushed back to at least October due to a previous temporary injunction issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in response to a request from the National Sand, Stone and Gravel Association to block the rule’s implementation completely.
The rule would have gone into effect on Monday only for coal mines; the NSSGA — along with several other industry groups who joined the organization in its request — would not have been impacted by the new regulations until 2027, per the rule.
Meanwhile, as the rule is delayed, more and more coal miners are working in dusty conditions known to cause and exacerbate black lung disease. 
“This is bureaucratic cowardice, plain and simple,” said UMWA International Secretary-Treasurer Brian Sanson. “We’ve buried too many friends, too many fathers, and too many sons because of black lung. Bowing to corporate interests doesn’t solve the problem; it puts more miners at risk. The science is clear, the rule is needed, and the delay is shameful.”
Other industries have had similar protections in place for their workers for years due to settled science showing the dangers posed by constant exposure to silica dust. 
“This delay is simply a death sentence for more miners,” said UMWA International President Cecil E. Roberts. “The fact that an industry association with no stake in coal mining can hold up lifesaving protections for coal miners is outrageous. The Department of Labor and MSHA should be fighting to implement this rule immediately, not kicking enforcement down the road yet again. Every day they delay, more miners get sick, and more miners die. That’s the truth.”
Black lung has no cure. Experts say the most effective way to stop the disease from forming or from evolving into a more complicated case is to limit exposure to silica dust.
The finalized silica dust rule, if implemented, would cut the exposure limits for coal miners in half for the first time ever. It would also impose new penalties for mines that operate out of compliance and require companies to offer free medical monitoring for their workers with the hope of detecting black lung and other respiratory diseases earlier.
Coal miners and advocates for people with black lung have been directly fighting since at least 2009 for industry protections against the disease.
Rebecca Shelton, director of policy for the Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center, said the continued delay of the rule shows that “the Trump Administration and the coal companies are seemingly working hand-in-hand to slow down the process and weaken future protections.”
“These delays and efforts to weaken the rule are a disgrace, and undermine the claims of anyone in the Trump Administration who claims to be on the side of coal miners,” Shelton said.
While the rule is being continuously delayed, President Donald Trump has called for the country to increase coal production. 
But coal miners in Central Appalachia and beyond are already seeing higher rates of black lung than any time in the previous 25 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The disease is also hitting coal miners at younger ages than ever before due to a lack of easily accessible coal. Today, miners must cut through more layers of silica-rich sandstone to reach the coal that remains in existing seams, creating dustier conditions that increases their risk of developing black lung.
“Every American worker deserves to come home from work with their lungs intact, miners included,” Roberts said. “It’s as simple as that.”

(Pool photo by Bethany Baker/The Salt Lake Tribune) The Utah Board of Pardons and Parole has denied Ralph Menzies’ request for clemency, one of the death row inmate’s final appeals ahead of his execution scheduled for Sept. 5. 
The announcement came Tuesday afternoon, four days after the commutation hearing for the 67-year-old inmate, where board members heard arguments for and against granting Menzies mercy. 
Menzies is scheduled to die by firing squad after spending nearly four decades in prison for the 1986 murder of Maurine Hunsaker, a 26-year-old gas station clerk whom Menzies kidnapped. Hunsaker was brought up Big Cottonwood Canyon, where Menzies tied her to a tree, strangled her, then slashed her throat.

Last week, the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole conducted a two-day commutation hearing, listening to testimony from Menzies’ attorneys, the Utah Attorney General’s Office, and 10 victim representatives, including eight members of Hunsaker’s family. 
With death penalty cases, the board has the power to instead impose a sentence of life without the possibility of parole. The arguments don’t have to be legal — for instance, Menzies has terminal dementia, and his attorneys said that the state should simply allow him to die in prison, rather than his scheduled execution. 
But in a statement Tuesday, board members wrote that, “after carefully reviewing all submitted information and considering all arguments from the parties, the Board does not find cause to commute Mr. Menzies’ death sentence.”
The Utah Board of Pardons and Parole has never granted a death row inmate clemency. 
Menzies’ attorneys, in a statement, called the notion of executing a 67-year-old inmate with dementia a “grotesque spectacle” — meanwhile Matt Hunsaker, Maurine’s son, said he was “very pleased” with the ruling. 
‘He does not deserve two seconds more’: Victim’s family makes emotional plea to execute Menzies

With his execution less than three weeks away, the commutation hearing marked one of the final appeals for Menzies. His attorneys contend that his dementia makes him incompetent to be executed, and will argue their case before the Utah Supreme Court on Thursday. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox also has the power to delay the execution, though he cannot issue clemency. 
“Ralph Menzies is a 67-year-old man with progressively worsening dementia. He’s tethered to an oxygen tank, uses a wheelchair, is confused and disoriented, and no longer understands why Utah is trying to kill him,” said Lindsey Layer, one of Menzies’ attorneys. “This is reason enough to grant mercy.” 
In addition, Layer said the judge who sentenced Menzies later changed his mind, writing in a 2010 affidavit that he incorrectly applied the law that allowed for the death sentence, and should have instead sentenced him to life in prison. And, the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s independent Conviction Integrity Review Panel has since found that Menzies’ death sentence should be vacated, pointing to false testimony at the time of the trial. 
“Mr. Menzies’s record for nearly 40 years on death row confirms he poses no threat to anyone in prison if given a life without parole sentence. We will continue our fight to save his life to avoid a grotesque spectacle of shooting to death a severely debilitated man with dementia,” Layer said. 
Matt Hunsaker, in a text message to Utah News Dispatch, thanked the board, calling the decision one of the final hurdles. 
“This closed all but one door for his ability to get out of being executed. We look forward to going to the Supreme Court this week and again as a family,” he said.

He stands outside the Borden Avenue Veterans Residence, a short-term housing facility in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens, N.Y., where he lives. Chavis relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and is worried about new work requirements for the program, commonly known as food stamps (Shalina Chatlani/Stateline).NEW YORK — After a year in the U.S. Navy, Loceny Kamara said he was discharged in 2023, because while on base he had developed mental health issues, including severe anxiety and nightmares, and had fallen into alcoholism.
Kamara, 23, went to rehab and managed to get sober for some time while living with family in the Bronx, he said. But after he lost his job as a security guard in December, Kamara was kicked out of his home. Now he lives at a veterans homeless shelter in Long Island City, a neighborhood in Queens, New York, and he relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — commonly known as food stamps — and odd jobs to make ends meet.
Each month, nearly 42 million people receive SNAP benefits to help supplement their grocery budgets. Able-bodied SNAP recipients who are between 18 and 54 and don’t have children have always been required to work. Veterans, however, have been exempt from those rules — but that’s about to change.
The giant domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 eliminates that exemption. Beginning in 2026, veterans will have to prove they are working, volunteering, participating in job training, or looking for work for at least 80 hours a month to keep their food stamps beyond three months, unless they qualify for another exemption, such as having certain disabilities.
Republicans in Congress and conservatives who helped formulate the law say these eligibility changes are necessary to stop people who could be working from abusing the system. But critics say the change fails to take into account the barriers many veterans face, and that the new work rules will cause thousands of veterans to go hungry.
“I’m pissed. I mean, I cannot get a job. Nowhere to live,” said Kamara. As he spoke, Kamara pointed to his collared shirt, noting that he had just dressed up to interview for a job as a security guard. He learned that morning he hadn’t gotten the job.
“I’ve been out of work for eight months,” Kamara told Stateline. “It’s hard to get a job right now for everybody.”
Nationally, around 1.2 million veterans with lower incomes, or about 8% of the total veteran population of 16.2 million, rely on food stamps for themselves and their families, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group.
An analysis by the group found veterans tend to have lower rates of employment because they are more likely to have health conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries, that make it difficult for them to work. They also tend to have less formal education, though many have specialized skills from their time in the military.
There has been a work requirement for most SNAP recipients since 1996. But Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the rules have “never really been enforced.” Rector argued that able-bodied people who have been exempt from the work requirement, such as veterans and homeless people, create an unnecessary burden on the system if they are capable of working but don’t.
“Most of the people that are in this category live in households with other people that have incomes, and so there really isn’t a chronic food shortage here,” Rector said in an interview. “We have tens of thousands of free food banks that people can go to. So it’s just a requirement to nudge these people in the proper direction, and it should no longer go unenforced.”
Darryl Chavis, 62, said that view ignores the difficulties that many veterans face. When Chavis left the U.S. Army at 21 after two years of service, he said, he was “severely depressed.”
“Nobody even came to help me,” said Chavis, who served as a watercraft operator, responsible for operating and maintaining tugboats, barges and other landing craft.
Chavis said he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which has made it difficult for him to keep a job. He just moved back to New York from Virginia after leaving a relationship. He’s been at the housing shelter in Long Island City since January.
“What I’m trying to do is get settled in to, you know, stabilize into an apartment. I have the credentials to get a job. So it’s not like I’m not gonna look for a job. I have to work. I’m in transition, and the obstacles don’t make it easy,” Chavis said.
The new SNAP work rules apply to all able-bodied adults between 55 and 64 who don’t have dependents, and parents with children above the age of 14. Some groups, such as asylum-seekers and refugees, are no longer eligible for the program.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 300,000 New Yorkers could lose SNAP benefits due to work requirements. Of those, around 22,000 are veterans, homeless or aging out of foster care, she said. Almost 3 million New Yorkers relied on SNAP as of March 2025.
Veterans in other states are in a similar situation. In California, an estimated 115,000 veterans receive SNAP benefits, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The number is nearly 100,000 in Florida and Texas, and 49,000 in Georgia.
Between 2015 and 2019 about 11% of veterans between the ages of 18 and 64 lived in food insecure households, meaning they had limited or uncertain access to food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP.
“We know that SNAP is the best way to help address hunger. It gets benefits directly to individuals,” Guinn said. “There are other ways that people can get assistance if they need it, through food banks or other charitable organizations, but we do not think that those organizations will have the capacity to pick up the needs.”
 A greater burden on states

In addition to the work rule changes, the new law reduces federal funding for SNAP by about $186 billion through 2034 — a cut of roughly 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office, an independent research arm of Congress. The federal government expects the new work requirements to reduce SNAP spending by $69 billion as people who don’t comply are dropped from the rolls.
SNAP has historically been funded by the federal government, with states picking up part of the cost of administering the program. Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of SNAP costs starting in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they distribute benefits to people who are eligible for the program.

“This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so, because they knew they are making it so incredibly burdensome to run and operate and unaffordable,” said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a poverty and hunger advocacy group.
“States are going to have to cut something, because there’s no surplus. There are no unlimited resources that states may have in order to be able to offset the harm.”
Guinn said New York expects to see a new cost burden of at least $1.4 billion each year. In California, new state costs could total as much as $3.7 billion annually, according to the California Department of Social Services.
Kaitlynne Yancy, director of membership programs at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said many veterans with disabilities will not be able to fulfill the work requirements or find resources elsewhere. And it’s unclear whether states will be able to provide their own relief to people who are no longer exempted from work requirements or will be excluded from the program.
“It is a frustrating thing to see, especially for those that have been willing to put everything on the line and sacrifice everything for this country if their country called them to do so,” she said.
Yancy, 35, served in the U.S. Navy from 2010 to 2014. She began to use food stamps and the Medicaid program, the public health insurance program for people with lower incomes, as she navigated life’s challenges. They included going back to school to pursue her bachelor’s degree, becoming a single mother, and a leukemia diagnosis for one of her children. Frequent trips to the hospital made it hard for her to work steadily or attend school for 20 hours each week, she said.
Guinn said the new rules will create significant administrative challenges, too; even SNAP recipients who are working will struggle to prove it.
“Maybe they’re working one month, they have a job, and then their employer cuts their hours the next month,” Guinn told Stateline. “There are mechanisms for people to upload documentation as needed to demonstrate compliance with the program, but from an administrative standpoint, right now, we don’t have any super-high-tech automated way of doing this.”

(Photo courtesy of City of Rochester)The Trump administration is once again pressuring liberal cities and states to cooperate with deportation efforts, despite previous setbacks in court.
Attorney General Pam Bondi sent letters last week telling sanctuary states, cities and counties that “you better be abiding by our federal policies and with our federal law enforcement, because if you aren’t, we’re going to come after you,” she said in a Fox News interview. She demanded the areas answer her by Tuesday.
Cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies generally refuse to assist with immigration raids or accede to requests for local jails to hold prisoners for deportation. Those that responded to Stateline’s questions about the letters said they were not inclined to change their positions about cooperation with immigration authorities.
“It’s the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they’re not going to intimidate you,” Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.
The Trump administration is attempting to force more cooperation with immigration arrests. But it suffered a serious court reversal on July 25, when a federal judge dismissed a sanctuary policies case against Illinois, Chicago and Cook County.
The state and local policies reflect a “decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law — a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment,” Judge Lindsay Jenkins wrote in an order now under appeal.
Bondi’s letters follow the Justice Department’s Aug. 5 release of a list of sanctuary jurisdictions including 12 states, the District of Columbia, four counties and 18 cities. That’s fewer jurisdictions than the 14 states and almost 500 counties and cities that appeared on an earlier list, which the agency withdrew after criticism that it included conservative counties that were fully cooperating with immigration enforcement.
The states on the new list are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington state. The list also includes some counties and cities in those states as well as in Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New Mexico.
Other federal courts have issued injunctions to at least temporarily stop Trump administration from withholding unrelated federal funding from governments that don’t cooperate on immigration. Cities, counties and states have filed lawsuits challenging Trump’s executive orders targeting sanctuary policies, including a February order that federal payments to states and localities must not “by design or effect, facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration, or abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”
“The executive orders are directing agencies to basically take a maximalist approach to putting pressure on local governments to cooperate with immigration [enforcement], even though they’re not required to do so by federal law,” said Jonathan Miller, one of the attorneys working on the California case for the Public Rights Project, a California-based group promoting civil rights protections for states and cities.
One city on the administration’s list was Rochester, New York, which disciplined some police officers for helping federal agents make a March arrest in the city. The city already faces a lawsuit brought by the Trump administration that prominently mentions the arrest of three men from Guatemala; one of whom has since pleaded guilty to re-entering the United States after a previous deportation.

A spokesperson for the city, Barbara Pierce, said in a statement to The Guardian that, “Nothing in Attorney General Bondi’s letter is new and none of it has legal merit.”
“The letter reiterates many of the frivolous arguments that the federal government has already made in its pending suit against the city of Rochester,” she added. “These same arguments were levied against the city of Chicago and were dismissed by the federal district court for the eastern district of Illinois nearly a month ago.”
Ally Sullivan, a spokesperson for Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, said in a statement that Colorado “is not a sanctuary state. The Governor continues to be frustrated by this mistaken and incorrect label.” In a televised interview earlier this year, Polis pointed out that Colorado fully cooperates with federal authorities on criminal matters. Immigration, he said, is a civil matter.
“In Colorado, we are improving public safety, apprehending dangerous criminals, cooperating with federal law enforcement on criminal investigations, and keeping our communities safe,” Sullivan said.
Nevertheless, Colorado faces a federal lawsuit brought by the administration over its alleged sanctuary policies. Polis signed a measure in May that limits local law enforcement’s communication with federal immigration authorities and restricts where federal authorities can operate within schools, child care facilities, hospitals and libraries without a judicial warrant.

Connecticut Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont in a statement said the state’s Trust Act, which the Trump administration has targeted as a sanctuary policy, was passed with bipartisan support and helps ensure local police concentrate on serious crimes. The Trust Act, passed in 2013 and expanded in 2019, limits information sharing and compliance with requests to detain immigrants for federal immigration authorities.
“Nothing about this makes Connecticut a sanctuary in any legal or practical sense — it makes our state one that upholds the Constitution, respects the rule of law, and prioritizes the safety and well-being of our communities,” Lamont said.

U.S. Agriculture officials announced a new initiative Monday to stop subsidies for solar energy panels that take up farmland while supporting cuts in agriculture grants to Tennessee universities.
Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins introduced the initiative by the Trump administration after a Future Farmers of America breakfast at the State Fairgrounds in Lebanon where she said the federal government will make new grants to bolster Tennessee farming while targeting grants that don’t help farmers’ production.
Rollins criticized the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act and “market distorting incentives” for solar panels, which she said are eliminating Tennessee farmland.
The secretary made the statements even though a study by the nonpartisan Tennessee Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations found that solar facilities aren’t likely to be the “primary driver” of development on farmland for decades. The study also determined that land can be returned to farming once a solar facility goes out of use.

Earlier this year, the federal government made dramatic cuts to higher education grants, including eliminating more than $31 million in funding to the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture, which houses agricultural research and resources for Tennessee farmers and communities in 95 counties.
Rollins defended the reductions, saying “Those cuts were being made in programs that did not align with the president’s vision of putting farmers first.”
Deputy Secretary Stephen Vaden of Tennessee described the reduction as a “repurposing” and said changes were made in research funding based on whether a grant “helps a farmer in the field make more money.” Projects aimed at “clean energy” or based on “racial criteria” were eliminated, he said.
In addition to stopping solar panel development on farmland, Rollins announced that nearly $89 million will go toward 13 rural development projects in 28 Tennessee counties to “promote partnerships” and infrastructure investments for rural education. The department has distributed nearly $100 million this year to more than 10,000 farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, according to Rollins.
Some farmers have said they expect prices to increase because of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which are forcing them to pass on higher rates to customers. Rollins said Monday the administration has signed eight new trade agreements expected to boost the nation’s economy.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Other states should emulate Florida’s election laws, which have been changed twice following the 2020 election but still allow people to vote by mail, Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday.
“So, we showed it can be done. I think our model is the best model for the country,” DeSantis said.
His remarks somewhat distanced the governor from President Donald Trump, who on Monday said administration lawyers are drafting  an executive order to eliminate mail-in voting. He made the announcement after Vladimir Putin told him the 2020 U.S. elections were rigged because of postal ballots. (Election laws are set at the state level and Trump cannot unilaterally end mail voting.)
DeSantis contended that Trump’s remarks were aimed more at other states.
“When [Trump] says vote-by-mail, I think, is the states like California and Nevada and others where they just send all these ballots out into the ether, basically, ” the governor said, alleging voting lists aren’t accurate in those states and they allow “ballot harvesting” by third parties, including volunteers or campaign workers.
Ballot harvesting — delivering mail-in ballots belonging to anyone except the single voter and immediate family members — is a third-degree felony in Florida, punishable by five years in prison and $5,000 in fines.
Voting-rights groups have long used ballot harvesting to get out the vote but DeSantis demonized it after the 2020 elections and again Tuesday.
The “mass voting of ballots has been a huge mistake and I don’t think that they’re adequate safeguards on that, when you start talking about the Californias and the Nevadas, and so I think it should be discontinued.”
First round of changes
Trump lost the 2020 election to former president Joe Biden. Trump, at the time the incumbent, alleged widespread fraud, an assertion that has been repeatedly debunked.
While DeSantis acknowledged in 2023 that Trump lost the election, he initially dodged answering the question and focused his efforts on changing the state’s election laws.
And the Legislature delivered in early 2021 with SB 90. The changes include requiring voters to show ID and provide the last digits of their Social Security numbers to request a vote-by-mail ballot.
SB 90 also restricted the locations of drop boxes for ballots to be returned to the local supervisor of elections office or at an early-voting location during early voting hours. Or via the U.S. Mail, FedEx, UPS, or another mail carrier.
The law bars anyone other than poll workers from distributing food or water to people in line within 150 feet of a polling place or drop box.
Challenges and more changes
The League of Women Voters and other voting- and civil-rights organizations successfully challenged SB 90 in court, arguing the changes suppressed voting by Blacks voters, Latino voters, and others.
In a 288-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Mark Walker in Tallahassee barred the state and county supervisors of elections from enforcing, among other things, the ban on supplying food and water to people waiting in line to vote and limiting the use of drop boxes.
Walker also ordered the state to clear any future changes in voting laws during the next 10 years with him. But the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eleventh  Circuit largely reversed Walker’s decision.
Before DeSantis’s 2022 historic landslide re-election, the Legislature in early 2022 passed another round of election law changes in SB 254. That bill established an elections crimes unit. He said he worked on the initiative with his then-chief of staff, now-Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier.
It “has actually brought people to justice for violating election law. Illegal aliens voting, people voting in multiple jurisdictions, people that have been convicted of homicide and sexual assault illegally voting, and those folks have actually been brought to justice in Florida,” DeSantis said.

A recent National Association of Realtors report found affordability increased slightly from last year, but the typical family is still priced out in the West and Northeast. (Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer)Housing became more affordable this June, as higher incomes and slightly lower interest rates overcame higher prices, according to a National Association of Realtors report.
However, the South and the Midwest are the only regions where a family with typical or median income can afford a median-priced house, according to the report. The group considers a mortgage to be affordable if the monthly payment (principal and interest) is 25% or less of the family’s income.



The affordability gap is highest in the West, where the typical family income is $113,783, just over two-thirds of the $164,832 that would be needed to purchase a median-priced home.
The Northeast, where the typical family makes $114,559, is also unaffordable by this measure, as a median-priced home requires an income of $141,264.
In the Midwest, the median family income is $102,419, more than the $86,256 needed to buy a median-priced home. The same is true in the South, where the median income is $97,812, slightly more than the $96,720 required to buy a typical home.
Nationally, affordability increased slightly compared with June of 2024, with the typical family making $105,431, about 94% of the $111,648 it would need to buy the median-priced home. That’s up from about 92% in June 2024.
In a video posted Aug. 15, Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, said he expects lower interest rates to increase affordability in the months ahead.
“We know that mortgage rates will be coming down and that will bring additional buyers into the market. We just need to make sure we have more supply, more supply to meet that demand,” Yun said.

,Mississippi Today,2025-08-19 19:51:55+00:00,Mississippi Today,Setting the runway or flying the plane in Jackson’s economic development department,Molly Minta,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/19/setting-the-runway-or-flying-the-plane-in-jacksons-economic-development-department/,"In a city that struggles with poverty, low educational attainment and suburban competition, the lack of development justifies the lack of development, a paradox that has faced nearly every leader of the city of Jackson’s planning and development department in recent years.","If it weren’t for Drake, a row of abandoned homes next to Jackson State University might still just be sitting there, slipping into disrepair.
About a month ago, two real estate investors from California bought them up – a deal facilitated by the city’s former planning and development director Jhai Keeton, who met the pair through connections he had made working on tour logistics for the Canadian rapper. 
Keeton did this off the clock in part because he wanted to prove that something, anything, could happen in the economically stagnant city. 
But if another developer tried to rehab the properties through a more traditional route – that is, by securing a bank loan – Keeton said they might be out of luck. In recent years, so few homes have sold in this area of Jackson, it’s impossible to get what’s called a “comparable,” a measurement of a property’s value that without, banks won’t issue a loan. 
“It ain’t no comp because a bank ain’t financing any new thing to be built for somebody to buy,” said Keeton, who headed up the crucial city department for just a year.
In a city that struggles with poverty, low educational attainment and suburban competition, the lack of development justifies the lack of development, a paradox that has faced nearly every leader of the city of Jackson’s planning and development department in recent years.  
“The rule of money often is that money goes where it can grow,” said Mukesh Kumar, a former professor of urban planning who led the city department from 2017 to 2019. 
This problem isn’t going away any time soon, even as Jackson’s newly elected Mayor John Horhn had pledged to make the city more business friendly. His search for a new planning and development director has gone national, but with low salaries at City Hall, it might be hard to entice the leader Jackson needs to come work in the fastest shrinking large city in America. 
When that’s the case, what can any one head of the city’s planning and development department even do to turn the tide? Former department heads agree – it takes gumption, social capital and a good deal of finagling to bring development to a city as statistically challenged as Jackson: High poverty rates, low property values and poor economic mobility.
“People are always like why don’t we have this, why don’t we have that,” said Jordan Hillman, who served as director from 2019 to 2022 and is now the chief data officer at JXN Water. “Well, it’s math.” 
Historically, Jackson’s planning and development department has focused more on the process, pushing through zoning and permitting documents and writing comprehensive plans. That’s because most development in a city is led by the private market, not the government. 
“Rarely do cities drive economic development,” said Chloe Dotson, who led the department from 2022 to 2024. “It’s questionable to even look at a city, and say, ‘well why isn’t a city pushing economic development?’ That’s not its job.” 
The department’s goal, then, is to work to make a city’s conditions favorable for private development. When Kumar led the department, he said he tried to change its mindset from regulating to enabling, even as much of its work was purely administrative: issuing grants, conducting code enforcement or overseeing the bus system. 
For big businesses that want to come to Jackson, Kumar said the planning and development’s role was to “get out of the way” or offer an incentive, like tax-increment financing, that could help them locate in the city while turning a profit. 
But Kumar felt the department needed to do a better job of fostering the city’s small businesses. 
“The businesses that are not making the market-driven decisions, they’re making the personal decisions,” he said. “They may not even know they need a business license.” 
Dotson had a similar philosophy: “We can’t create demand, but we can shape it,” she said. 
Keeton, whose background is in economic development, not planning, took somewhat of a different course. Starting at the city in 2020 as a deputy director in the department, Keeton said he wanted to fly the plane, not set the runway. 
“I’m trying to get out of the abandoned group,” he said. “I’m at the bottom. I might make more money than my peers, but I’m trying to engage in power.” 
He found his taste for big-picture ideas aligned with former Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba’s. The former mayor, who lost reelection last spring, found in Keeton a staffer who would prioritize a pair of long-held dreams: bringing a Top Golf and a Dave and Busters to Jackson.
“He was looking for some family-type of entertainment,” Keeton said. 
Keeton quickly realized that Jackson’s math didn’t compute for attracting Dave and Busters. But Top Golf seemed more promising — especially if the city could make it happen at a site on Lakeland Drive, one of the busiest corridors in the state, in a part of Jackson where residents have more disposable income. 
Though Keeton said the demographic data supported the project, state-owned institutions in the area opposed it. Top Golf ultimately went the way of other developments pitched for this particular site — to Madison County. 
“There’s not really much you can do when the institution shuts you out,” Keeton said. 
The day the news hit social media two years ago, Keeton was leaving Atlantic City. He said he texted Lumumba, “Mayor, I need you to help me to determine how to feel about this. He said ‘I feel just like you, I’m deflated, it sucks that we didn’t even get an attempt to play the game.’” 
It seemed that everywhere Keeton turned in his department, something was out of his control. After a stint at the Mississippi Development Authority, Keeton returned to the city as director in 2024.
Could he bring a shopping center to downtown Jackson? “We don’t have an after five population in downtown Jackson,” he said. 
Could he work with small businesses to help them meet Jackson’s regulations for storefronts in downtown Jackson? “We only have four, five inspectors for the whole city.” 
Then there was “the famous RFQ,” he said. 
The vacant lot across from the downtown Jackson Convention Center, the site of decades of failed development, was another task on Keeton’s plate.
But after the prospective hotel development became the center of an FBI corruption probe that led to federal indictments against Lumumba, the county prosecutor and two council members, Keeton said he couldn’t talk about the project because “it was political.”

He decided to do something different. Keeton said he asked himself, “What do we have the resources to do right now without waiting for a $100 million deal?”
A project known as “The Pulse at Farish Street” was born. The goal was to turn the lot into an outdoor space with a skate park and pickleball courts that would attract more people to downtown Jackson, to provide a justification for building another hotel in the future. 
Then Lumumba lost reelection. Keeton got a text that Horhn would not be keeping him on as director. The new administration quickly announced it was abandoning The Pulse and turning the vacant lot into a “functional, upgraded parking area,” the Clarion Ledger reported.
Keeton has returned to his consulting firm, including working with One Voice, a civic engagement nonprofit born out of the state’s NAACP and headed up by Lumumba’s reelection campaign manager. 
Keeton considers breaking ground at The Pulse to be one of his biggest accomplishments in his year leading the office. His other was working with the 1% Sales Tax Commission to unlock funds to repave the roads around the Northwest Industrial Park in northeast Jackson. 
“That is a huge win,” Keeton said. “Site development is the name of the game.”                                                                          
Creative solutions exist to combat Jackson’s data doldrums. In areas of the city that lack “comps”, Dotson said investors who are shut out from traditional lending could turn to programs like the low-income housing tax credit to help them build rental properties tenants can eventually own. 
“I am not as pessimistic,” said Dotson, who is now the chief program officer at the HOPE Enterprise Corporation. “I believe that Jackson can do whatever it wants to do. It just has to have the correct leaders and it has to have the correct partnerships and the right people that know what they’re doing.” 
The secret to overcoming a city’s bad math, Kumar said, is twofold: A mindset shift that can lead to “momentum.”
“It is real,” he said. 
But a city’s priorities change when leadership turns over.
Recently, Kumar, who now works in planning in Waco, Texas, said he was looking at satellite images of Congress street in downtown Jackson, where he’d deployed a small grant the city received to build wooden benches, tables and an archway that became a popular destination for graduation pictures.

Photo by Rilyn Eischens/Minnesota Reformer. An anti-pipeline demonstrator convicted of a felony is entitled to a new trial after the Minnesota Court of Appeals ruled Monday that the prosecutor’s repeated misconduct robbed her of a fair trial.
A jury in Aitkin County found Mylene Vialard, 56, guilty of felony obstruction of legal process for tying herself to another demonstrator in a 25-foot structure to protest the Enbridge Line 3 replacement pipeline in 2021. The appeals court ruled the jury’s decision may have been tainted by the prosecutor’s “pervasive” misconduct, including telling the jury to weigh facts not in evidence.
“It is rare for the system to hold prosecutors accountable, even though the system is all about accountability,” Vialard’s attorney Claire Glenn said. “We’re hopeful this will be the end of the road for Mylene’s case.”
The decision is the latest rebuke of Garrett Slyva, a former Aitkin County assistant attorney who oversaw numerous since-dismissed prosecutions of Line 3 protesters including prominent Ojibwe activist Winona LaDuke.
Slyva left the Aitkin County Attorney’s Office in April 2024, according to his LinkedIn page, just before he was suspended from practicing law by the Minnesota Supreme Court for 30 days. The suspension stemmed from misconduct in North Dakota, where Slyva sexually harassed two jailed female defendants while working for the Fargo Public Defender Office, the court found. He was fired and reprimanded by the North Dakota Supreme Court and then suspended in Minnesota.
The Aitkin County Attorney’s Office and Slyva did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  Photos included in court filings show law enforcement officers removing Mylene Vialard and another anti-pipeline protester from a structure on an access road that led to the Line 3 pump station.
Enbridge’s Line 3 replacement pipeline stretching across northern Minnesota was the source of widespread protests led by Indigenous activists during its planning and construction, leading to hundreds of arrests and charges.
The criminal proceedings have carried on for years after the protests ended and the pipeline began carrying millions of gallons of oil from Alberta, Canada to Superior, Wisconsin. Activists have accused local prosecutors of weaponizing the justice system, using felony charges to crack down on free speech.
In August 2021, Vialard and another protester installed themselves in hammocks suspended from a bamboo structure on an access road that led to the Line 3 pump station.
As law enforcement approached them in a bucket truck to remove them, Vialard and the other protester locked their arms to one another through a pipe in a maneuver called a “sleeping dragon.” The officers initially tried to remove them together, but the other protester removed his arm from the device, allowing officers to extract them separately.
The Minnesota Attorney General’s Office represented the state on the appeal and conceded to five of the 20 instances of Slyva’s alleged misconduct.
The misconduct includes attempting to bolster one of the law enforcement witness’ testimony by asking him about his lack of ethical violations and asking a second law enforcement witness if he had sustained injuries responding to Line 3 protests that were unrelated to Vialard’s case.
Slyva also improperly suggested that Vialard would have pleaded guilty if there was better video evidence and invited the jury to “draw reasonable inferences off of what’s not in evidence.”
“It is extremely troubling that the prosecutor made explicit arguments during the state’s closing and rebuttal encouraging the jury to base its verdict on facts outside the record,” Judge Jeanne Cochran wrote for the court.
The court also held that Slyva was wrong to say the sheriff was elected to protect “our” community, which aligned the state with the jury and may have “inflamed the passions of the jury by creating an ‘us versus them’ scenario” since Vialard is a Colorado resident who speaks with a French accent.
Vialard also argued the appeals court should reverse the jury’s verdict because there wasn’t enough evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she intentionally locked herself into the sleeping dragon to obstruct law enforcement. She said she locked herself in the device to protest Line 3.
The appeals court found the jury did have sufficient evidence for the conviction, although it noted the evidence wasn’t particularly strong because the state’s witnesses’ accounts were inconsistent at times.
Vialard said in a statement that she was glad the appellate court recognized the prosecutor’s misconduct, but that a larger fight against Enbridge remains.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Does a state lawmaker qualify as an independent contractor when hired by Rhode Island’s court system to represent clients who can’t otherwise rely on a public defender? 
That was the question that kept the Rhode Island Ethics Commission debating for more than 40 minutes as its members weighed Rep. Jason Knight’s bid to rejoin the judiciary’s roster of attorneys representing indigent clients. 
Commission staff say the state’s ethics code clearly bars Knight from returning to the court’s list because he’s a lawmaker and thus an independent contractor that would be paid by the court. But the panel is now exploring whether there’s a way to let him back without running afoul of its own “revolving door” rule.
Knight, a Barrington Democrat, had been on the list before his election to the Rhode Island House of Representatives in 2016. In 2019, he requested his name be removed because the rates the criminal courts paid were not high enough.
“The cases were basically practice killers,” he said in an interview after the ethics commission meeting. “To do them correctly, you would have to set aside just about everything in your world and (as) criminal defense lawyers, we’re solo outfits, you need to be thoughtful in what your two hands can do on any given day.”
At the time, court-appointed lawyers were paid by the judiciary $90 an hour for representing clients facing Class 1 felony charges for crimes like rape, kidnapping and robbery. The rate was $60 an hour for Class 2 crimes such as breaking and entering, larceny, possession of a stolen motor vehicle and certain drug offenses.
Lawyers representing someone accused of murder were paid $100 an hour.
In April, the Rhode Island Supreme Court increased the range from $112 for most cases to $142 per hour for clients facing murder charges. Knight now says he wants to return to the court’s rotating list as a way to gain some additional revenue as he “thinks about what the future’s going to bring.”
“I need to get back on the horse,” Knight told the Ethics Commission.
There’s just one problem: The state ethics code bars elected officials from taking state jobs until they’ve been out of the General Assembly for at least a year. That’s the position staff attorney Lynn Radiches urged the commissioners to keep.
“Indigent clients do have a right to an attorney, they do not have a right to Mr. Knight as their attorney.” she said. “I don’t write the rules, but I’ve become pretty good at interpreting them.”
Officials can work for the state if they held the position at the time of their election, but Radiches said because Knight withdrew from the court list in 2019 he is ineligible to return.
But commissioners argue that just because Knight would be appointed by the court to a client does not mean he is necessarily working for the state.
“He is providing services, as an attorney, to his client — just like a private attorney would be,” said commissioner Frank Cenerini. “And he, or any person providing indigent services, is still bound by the legal code of ethics.”
That’s not how John Marion, executive director of Common Cause Rhode Island and a longtime observer of the commission, sees it.
“The money is coming from the state of Rhode Island,” Marion said in an interview. “That’s the point of the rule.”
Chairman Lauren E. Jones acknowledged that the court may cut Knight’s checks, but said it’s only in order to represent a third party.
“He’s not representing the interest of his contractor,” Jones argued. 
The panel ultimately rejected its staff’s advisory opinion but stopped short of ruling in Knight’s favor. Instead, it directed staff to draft a new opinion on what legally defines an independent contractor in Rhode Island.
Should the commission grant an exception for Knight, Marion warns it could set a dangerous precedent.
“If we start down that path, that only leads to a place where there is no enforceable code of ethics and that’s not a good place,” Marion said.
The new advisory opinion is expected to be complete by the time the panel reconvenes in September.

Will Carpenter, R-El Dorado, says he doubts the state can ever build the nursing staff needed to operate state psychiatric hospitals in Larned and Osawatomie. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The state of Kansas invests more than $60 million annually to hire contract nursing staff to work at state psychiatric hospitals in Larned and Osawatomie, but the financial boost hasn’t closed job vacancy gaps exceeding 33% at both facilities.
On Tuesday, Kansas legislators on a special committee exploring contract nursing shared disappointment with results of years of stopgap appropriations to hire temporary nurses provided by private companies. The state also has devoted resources to raising salaries and providing bonuses to encourage state-employed nurses to remain at the hospitals.
Lawmakers expressed skepticism Kansas would ever have enough people to fill vacancies at state hospitals serving involuntarily committed or criminally charged individuals with mental health issues, as well as sexually violent offenders detained at Larned after serving prison sentences.
“In my experience, we’re not going to build this staff to take care of the number of people that are out there right now,” said Rep. Will Carpenter, an El Dorado Republican who chairs the Legislature’s interim health committee. “Prove me wrong, because I want to be wrong.”
Carpenter suggested consideration be given to transferring about 100 patients from Larned to other locations so staffing levels could be sustained without contract nurses. In 2027, Kansas is scheduled to open a new 104-bed state psychiatric hospital in Sedgwick County.
Expenditures at Larned State Hospital for nursing contract labor increased from $5.9 million in 2019 to $8.6 million in 2021, $43.1 million in 2023 and $46 million in 2025. At Osawatomie State Hospital, contract costs surged from $233,000 in 2019 to $3.2 million in 2021, $16 million in 2023 and $15.4 million in 2025. The job vacancy rate at Osawatomie stood at 35.5%, while the rate at Larned was 33.5%.
“I’ve been incredibly disappointed on how that’s worked,” Carpenter said.
 
Contract labor not answer
Scott Brunner, deputy secretary of the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services, said the agency used state tax dollars to bring in dozens of registered nurses and licensed practice nurses to care for patients who generally had complex medical needs. Some require one-on-one care.
“To keep our bed count open at the levels that they are,” he said, “we have to have enough staff to make sure patients are safe.”
He said the starting salary for a registered nurse at the state hospitals was about $40 per hour. The state paid companies providing contract registered nurses $90 to $100 per hour to take on the same responsibilities, with the nurse receiving approximately two-thirds of the total.
“We certainly don’t think contract labor is a solution,” Brunner said. “It’s a way of addressing the need to keep beds open and keep patients moving through the system.”
He recommended the Legislature pass House Bill 2237, which is hung up in the Senate, to place in state law the ability of state agencies to award employee bonuses in amounts up to $10,000 per year. He urged lawmakers to keep funding cost-of-living and market-rate adjustments to salaries so state hospitals could compete with the private sector for labor. The existing budget for contract nurses needs to be sustained, he said.
In addition, Brunner suggested the state expand college scholarships for nurses, consider providing nursing students with financial support in exchange for post-graduation employment agreements and provide training opportunities for experienced nurses to advance their careers.
 
  Lindsey Topps, superintendent of Larned State Hospital, said the facility serving about 400 patients with mental illness relies extensively on contract nursing staff to operate programs serving sexual predators, individuals charged with crimes and people struggling with acute illness.

‘Increase the salaries’
Ashley Byram, superintendent of the Osawatomie hospital, said only half of the facility’s RNs, LPNs and mental health technicians were state employees. Here’s the split between state employee and agency contract workers at Osawatomie: RNs, 16 state and 16 private; LPNs, three state and 13 private; and mental health techs, 39 state and 33 private.
She said Osawatomie contract nurses were asked what it would take for them to accept state employment. The nurses weren’t interested in signing bonuses or housing allowances, she said, but were keen to earn salaries of at least $50 per hour. The average RN at Osawatomie has been paid $44 per hour, or $59 per hour when benefits were included.
“I would increase the salaries,” Byram said. “It’s the current wage gap between agency and state positions that is our primary obstacle.”
If the Legislature prohibited payment of contract nurses to staff the Osawatomie hospital, she said, the facility had enough nurses to make use of 43 beds. She said 116 beds at Osawatomie would be closed if contract nurses were removed and replacements weren’t hired.
Lindsey Topps, superintendent at Larned, said the hospital averaged 400 patients with more than half the total in a sexual predator treatment program.
“We have, I say, no fat on campus,” Topps said. “We’ve maximized the amount of residents or patients to the RNs and LPNs in order to provide safe and good patient care as well as follow the regulations.”
Here is the breakdown between state employees and contract laborers at Larned: Registered nurses, 17 state and 38 private; LPNs, nine state and 27 private; mental health workers or CNAs, 194 state and 179 private.
Topps said debate by the Legislature about reducing contract nursing labor should take into consideration the aggressive, disruptive, suicidal and homicidal conduct of people at Larned. She said most community-based health facilities didn’t have the staff or facilities to deal with individuals who ended up at the state hospital.
“We have some of the most severe mentally ill individuals in the state of Kansas,” Topps said.
 
‘It’s not translating’
During the 2025 legislative session, the House and Senate didn’t approve financing for new spending on contract nursing at the two state hospitals.
“Sometimes we set aside money because that feels good and we think that’s going to to do something,” said Sen. Beverly Gossage, a Republican from Eudora.
Sen. Renee Erickson, R-Wichita, said the state had a handful of initiatives designed to develop a Kansas pipeline of nurses who could fill jobs at state hospitals. She said the state spent millions of dollars so 2,700 high school students could take courses required to become a certified nursing assistant. She said only one-third of those students became CNAs.
“We’re paying to fill that pipeline, but it’s not translating,” she said. “It doesn’t appear like (it’s) actually reducing the demand and getting to the root of the problem. It doesn’t seem to be making the impact it should or we would hope it should.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4100504-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-19 15:58:25.280966

(Photo by Chris Trotman/LIV Golf)The LIV Golf team championship is set to host professional stars and international music acts this weekend at The Cardinal at Saint John’s Resort in Plymouth, Michigan – but with it comes criticism from at least one of the resort’s patrons over the league’s connection to the Saudi Arabian government and its noted record of corruption and human rights abuses.
LIV Golf was founded in 2021 and is owned by the Saudi government’s Public Investment Fund. The mammoth $941 billion sovereign wealth fund was created in the 1970s as a means to invest the Saudi royal family’s money on the government’s behalf. 
Much of that funding has gone to prominent Saudi business families with strong ties to the royal family, all controlled by the nation’s Crown Prince, according to reporting from The Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal. 
Current Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud, the nation’s prime minister and its de facto ruler, has been described as an authoritarian leader who has since taken power created an oppressive regime that stifles women’s and human rights activists, and tortures and kills political dissidents.
The U.S. The Central Intelligence Agency also concluded that the bin Salman regime was responsible for the brutal assassination of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, who was highly critical of bin Salman and helped amplify progressive Saudi political thought.
All those noted instances of political violence and repression have raised questions about Saint John’s Resort hosting the event.
The resort is owned by the Pulte Family Charitable Foundation, which prides itself as a key funder of humanitarian initiatives through nonprofit organizations and education institutions across the globe.
Some of that work focuses on the basic human needs of marginalized people, socioeconomically disadvantaged youth, seniors, people with disabilities and impoverished people.
The resort in Plymouth is also one of the foundation’s three “Humanitarian Hotels,” which delivers all of its net profits to Pulte’s charity work.
David Chrzanowski, a California based filmmaker and actor who was born and raised in Michigan, is a frequent patron of the Plymouth resort. For him, the foundation’s charity work and the stated mission of the hotel doesn’t appear to jive with the LIV Golf event and the Public Investment Fund’s connection to an oppressive regime like the one that rules Saudi Arabia.
“They have the literal word humanitarian embossed on their front desk,” Chrzanowski said in an interview with Michigan Advance. “The question of ethics and money when you’re using a lot of that money for charity is an age-old discussion. Is it OK to take 100 percent of your money going toward charities [from an organization like the Saudi Public Investment Fund]? I don’t know the answer to that question, but what I do know is that we need to be talking about it.”

The Advance asked the Pulte Foundation if it viewed its decision to host the LIV event in conflict with the hotel’s mission and its charity work. Pulte was also asked if it weighed the ethical concerns of hosting a Saudi-backed sports event before agreeing to embrace the league, and if it would consider making a public statement disavowing the human rights abuses of the Saudi government.
In an email, the foundation said the resort was “deeply committed to giving back, with 100% of our net profits supporting communities in need – both in SE Michigan and around the world.”
The foundation said that mission was at the heart of everything it did in terms of its charity work. Quixotically, while the Pulte Foundation said that hosting the LIV event was part of that mission, it did acknowledge that it was “aware of the broader discussions around LIV Golf’s funding.”
“Our participation in the tournament is focused solely on the charitable impact we can make through an event of this scale,” the foundation said. “The LIV Golf tournament presents a unique opportunity to highlight our Humanitarian Hotels and Foundation’s broader charitable mission on a global stage, offering unprecedented exposure and the chance to amplify the important work we do.”
The foundation also went to bat for the LIV Golf league, saying it works with dozens of nonprofit organizations “to uplift underrepresented communities, make the game of golf more accessible, and support local charitable efforts around the world – including programs at Saint John’s Resort.”
“Not only will this event allow us to expand our local charitable programs, but it will also drive local business growth and provide a strong economic boost to the region,” the foundation said. “LIV Golf events drive an average estimated $40 million in economic impact within each local community, and to date, have generated over $1 billion in economic impact across the globe.”

The foundation went on to say that it believes it “can bring a deeper purpose to the LIV Golf tournament, beyond the completion,” and that it remains committed to “upholding our values as a foundation during this event and all events held at our property.”
Reputation laundering, by way of sports
Although the resort highlighted ways that LIV Golf also works with charities and humanitarian causes, several critics have accused Saudi Arabia’s various engagements with the sports world through its Public Investment Fund – like LIV Golf – as ways for the government to “sportswash” its image.
The term is self-explanatory, defined as the act of a nation or a company to use sporting events or teams to improve the reputation of the nation and to distract from its ongoing and past human rights abuses.
According to testimony provided to the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Investigations in 2023 by Joey Shea, a Saudi Arabia researcher with Human Rights Watch, the nation’s Public Investment Fund reportedly owned a 93% controlling share in the LIV Golf league. 
Calls for LIV Golf to develop a strategy to limit the laundering of the nation’s reputation through the league’s events have gone unanswered, Shea said, adding that LIV Golf’s proposed commercial merger with the PGA Tour and the DP World Tour, with an aim to form a new for-profit entity to unifying the game, has enabled the Saudi government to have a position of major influence across the entire golf world. 
The deal has not yet been inked yet, however, due to significant delays, but some professional golfers on the PGA Tour, including Tiger Woods, and the tour’s top brass, have publicly stated their opposition to joining the league and taking Saudi money.
The Center for a New American Security, an independent bipartisan nonprofit organization that focuses on national security and defense policies, has also been sharply critical of the Saudi government’s attempts at cloaking its human rights abuses through the fanfare of sports.
Sarath Ganji is the director of the center’s Autocracy and Global Sports Project, which was launched to investigate the role of malign finance in global sports leagues. He was featured in a 2023 discussion about the LIV Golf league and its attempts to merge with the PGA Tour produced by WBUR-FM, Boston’s NPR station.
The host of that discussion, WBUR’s Meghna Chakrabarti, noted that PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan at first banned his players from engaging with LIV, questioning the movies and ethics of the league.
Monahan later embraced the ongoing merger with LIV when it was announced, throwing away his earlier criticisms.
Ganji said the Saudi interest in LIV and galvanizing the larger share of the golf world was a clear example of sportswashing.
“If we think of sports and entertainment as a singular sector, there are two qualities about it that make it really attractive to investors in general, but to autocratic investors in particular,” Ganji said. “The first is its high visibility. We know about the English Premier League. We know about the World Cup. We know about the Dustin Johnsons and the Cameron Smiths and the Phil Mickelson’s of the world. These are all leagues and franchises and players and nine-figure broadcasting and sponsorship contracts that have global reach.”
Ganji added that visibility might serve a purpose for nations with “dirty, stained reputations and are looking to district audiences from those games by linking themselves with highly positive brands.”
The low bar of access helps wealthy firms, families and nations help those bad actors latch on to ownership stakes in those leagues, Ganji said, because they often are unregulated environments.
As some nations try to keep abuses buried beneath stadiums and flashy trophies, Chrzanowski told the Advance that he just wants host sites for LIV, much like Saint John’s Resort, to acknowledge the issue in a transparent way.
After visiting the resort for the last three years with his family, Chrzanowski, who also plays golf, also sought answers from the Pulte Foundation when he visited Saint John’s this year.

In response, the Pulte Foundation told Chrzanowski that the foundation remains “committed to transparency and to upholding our values as a Foundation during this event and all events held at our property.”
The line about transparency, without engaging further in a discussion about whether the foundation should reconsider the event given its mission and stated values, irked Chrzanowski.
“A simple search on my end showed that the foundation made no public statement about this, and they’re hiding from it,” Chrzanowski said. “They know what they’re doing and they’re just taking the money. That made me really question going back to stay at that place again.”
An offer to discuss the matter further was floated to Chrzanowski, which he told the Advance he was eager to take up. But when he inquired about when they could have that conversation, Chrzanowski said he never heard back from Pulte.
“They say they want to talk about it, and they say they want to be transparent, well then, great, let’s do that,” he said. “Let’s talk about the human rights abuses and where the money is coming from. … They’re playing a billion dollars, they’ve got four really good pros. Look, I’m not trying to take money out of their pockets, but in the same sense, I don’t take money for doing shady [things] in my life.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/liv-golf-adelaide-1024x6831749856100-1.jpg,,,2025-08-19 15:58:25.280966

(Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer)Attorney General Keith Ellison sued TikTok on Tuesday for violating Minnesota consumer protection laws, alleging the social media giant illegally preys on young users’ developmental vulnerabilities with addictive algorithms.
“TikTok has created a dangerously addictive platform that exploits the unfinished reward system in our children’s brains,” Ellison said at a press conference Tuesday.
The lawsuit alleges TikTok ensnares young users with multiple parts of its design.
The suit says TikTok feeds young users personalized recommendations to keep them on-site and scrolling. The app allows for what’s called “infinite scroll,” a never-ending stream of content that its own inventor described as addictive.
The lawsuit addresses TikTok’s “beauty filters.” TikTok acknowledged in an internal report cited in the lawsuit that teens are “more susceptible” to the negative effects of beauty filters while they are “at a critical period for developing body dysmorphia [and] eating disorders.” Despite knowing this, TikTok deployed hundreds of beauty filters and would turn on filters for young users by default, the suit alleges.
The lawsuit highlights the livestreaming feature called “LIVE” introduced by TikTok in 2019, which allows users to pay creators through an unregulated marketplace that the lawsuit charges can be used for sexual exploitation.
“Operating in part like a virtual strip club, LIVE allows young streamers to turn their homes into a performance stage, and allows other users to entice streamers into sexual acts in exchange for virtual money,” the lawsuit alleges.
The suit also makes a pointed comparison between TikTok and nicotine.
Minnesota and a bevy of other states that have brought suits against social media companies are using a similar playbook that led to billions in damages levied against Big Tobacco in the 1990s and helped drive down American nicotine use until vapes and pouches brought about a revival.
These features — combined with TikTok’s misrepresentations of its own dangers — amount to “deceptive and unfair” practices constituting multiple violations of consumer protection law, according to the suit.
“It’s an unfair thing to expect that a kid can overcome the pressures and the design features and the research and the brain science of some of the most highly trained people in the world,” Ellison said.
The lawsuit seeks $25,000 per violation, which could rise to stratospheric levels given the app’s popularity among teens, though Ellison’s office said they could not provide an estimate of how much TikTok could be forced to pay if they’re victorious after what’s expected to be a yearslong legal battle.
Ellison’s office previously announced in 2022 that Ellison would join a nationwide coalition of state attorneys general to investigate TikTok’s possible consumer law violations. Thirteen states — comprising a mix of Democratic and Republican attorneys general — from that coalition filed suits last October against TikTok, with Minnesota joining them just now.
The lawsuit also follows the attorney general’s suit against Meta in October 2023, which was similarly part of a coalition of states accusing the social media behemoth of deliberately targeting children in its addictive design. Nearly two years out, that case is still in the “mushy middle” of a discovery phase, said Assistant Attorney General Bennett Hartz.
In a statement, a TikTok spokesperson said that the lawsuit is “based on misleading and inaccurate claims that fail to recognize the robust safety measures TikTok has voluntarily implemented.”
The spokesperson noted that the platform has many safety features built into teen accounts, along with parental controls for screen time, content and privacy.
TikTok is fighting for survival in the U.S. on multiple fronts. The U.S. Congress and then-President Joe Biden signed a law requiring Chinese parent company ByteDance to divest TikTok, fearing Chinese propaganda and surveillance. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the law in January.
The divest-or-ban law has not been enforced in practice, though, and President Donald Trump has since punted enforcement three times, with a new deadline of September 17.
At the press conference, Ellison declined to offer an opinion on TikTok’s ownership.
“This lawsuit is designed to make them obey the law, whether they’re owned by somebody in the U.S. or China,” Ellison said.

(Dan Severson/USFWS)TOPEKA — The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will not allocate water in 2026 to a Kansas wildlife refuge that serves as a key destination for hundreds of species of migrating birds.
Kansas Republican U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran in an Aug. 14 announcement applauded the service’s decision to take no action to honor water rights for the Quivira National Wildlife Refuge, a more than 22,000-acre marsh and sand prairie in central Kansas.
Federal officials made the same decision in 2020 and again in 2023, despite a report from Kansas regulators that found the refuge received insufficient amounts of water in two out of every three years between 2008 and 2021.
“I met with FWS Administrator Brian Nesvik and emphasized the need for long-term solutions led by stakeholders at the local level, and I am pleased by the recognition of the progress that is being made,” Moran said in a news release.
Moran did not specify what progress entails, but he said the service acknowledged a Kansas Department of Agriculture group’s conservation efforts.
A 2016 analysis determined that irrigators upstream from Quivira were infringing on its state water rights, which entitle it to more than 14,000 acre-feet of water each year, equivalent to about 4.6 billion gallons. Irrigators reduce the groundwater in Rattlesnake Creek, which flows into the refuge. Conservationists say lower flows threaten endangered species.
In 2024, the refuge reportedly used none of its allocated water for the first time since 2017, according to state water rights data. In 2023, it used 45 acre-feet.
U.S. Rep. Ron Estes, a Republican representing Kansas’ 4th District, wrote a letter in February to U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, asking for assurance that the department wouldn’t call for water allocation for Quivira.
“Agriculture is the basin’s primary industry, generating millions of dollars in direct and indirect revenue,” Estes said. “Losing the ability to irrigate crops would reduce these revenues by tens of millions of dollars, forcing many of these already struggling family-run farms to exit the industry entirely.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/usfws-waterfowl-quivira-national-wildlife-refuge-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-19 15:58:25.280966

Article Summary

Former federal officials are backing an effort to reform the state legislature’s redistricting process. Congressional districts would be unaffected.
Illinois’ state Senate map gives a partisan advantage to Democrats, and its House map isn’t compact enough, according to researchers at Princeton.
Ray LaHood and Bill Daley hope to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot in November 2026, but they’ll need hundreds of thousands of signatures and millions of dollars to do so.
Past efforts to reform legislative redistricting, most notably in 2016, failed after ballot measures were thrown out by state courts.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story. 

CHICAGO — A group of former Obama administration officials and election lawyers announced Tuesday they are attempting to reform the way the state draws district maps for the state legislature. They want to do this by passing a state constitutional amendment via a ballot initiative during the 2026 general election.
They say the current legislative redistricting process leads to overrepresentation of Democrats and few competitive legislative districts, meaning politicians must do less to serve their constituents.
Former U.S. Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood, a Republican, and former Secretary of Commerce Bill Daley, a Democrat and member of the Daley political family, are leading the effort. Both served under President Barack Obama, with Daley as his chief of staff.
Former State Board of Elections Chair Bill Cadigan and election lawyer Michael Dorf, whose past clients include the Democratic Party of Illinois and several sitting statewide officials, also are backing the effort.
12-member redistricting commission
The proposal would create a 12-member “Legislative Redistricting Commission,” appointed by the top Democrat and Republican in each legislative chamber. Each legislative leader would appoint one member of the General Assembly and two members who are not lawmakers.
Commissioners would be barred from considering political party registration or voting history data when drawing maps. Districts also would be required to be compact, contiguous and drawn along existing county and municipal lines where possible.
The amendment would only apply to the redistricting process for the state legislature. It would not apply to congressional districts, which would still be drawn by state lawmakers.
The amendment would also change the size of the state legislature, so that if the state’s population significantly increases or decreases, so too would the number of districts.
This model is based on Iowa, Arizona and Pennsylvania. The Princeton Gerrymandering Project, which analyzes how severely gerrymandered states’ legislative maps are, gives Illinois a “B” grade for the state House and an “F” for the state Senate. Iowa and Arizona received A grades for their state maps and Pennsylvania received “B” grades.
“I’ve talked to people in Iowa and I’ve talked to people in California,” LaHood said. “They love the idea that politicians are not drawing their maps. And if you look at their maps, they’re compact and contiguous. And people like that.”
The amendment, according to its backers, will need about 320,000 valid signatures to appear on the 2026 November ballot. Because some signatures might be invalid, Cadigan said they’ll aim for roughly double that.
LaHood said the effort would need “3 to 4 million” dollars, “primarily to pay people to help us get the signatures.”
Failed 2016 effort
In 2016, the state Supreme Court case threw out an effort to reform legislative redistricting on a 4-3 vote. The court ruled along partisan lines that the wording of the amendment didn’t comply with the state’s constitution’s narrow wording on citizen initiatives.
The Supreme Court now has a 5-2 Democratic advantage after the General Assembly redrew its district lines in 2021.
The 2016 effort was itself a response to a 2014 court case that tossed out a proposed constitutional amendment that year.
Dorf said the wording of the proposed amendment takes into consideration court precedent, but LaHood noted that “no one will predict what the Supreme Court does.”
Still, Daley said the amendment will hopefully influence the 2026 campaign.
“I think politicians will respond to that when it’s on the ballot for the general election in 2026. Everyone running — from state rep to the state Senate, congressional and statewide officeholders — will be asked the question ‘Where do you stand on the fair maps amendment?’” Daley said. “And woe with those who don’t say they’re for it.”
The effort comes as Texas considers an unorthodox mid-decade redistricting in order to expand the Republican majority in Congress, which has sparked Democratic states like California and Illinois to consider something similar to counteract Texas’ move.
“As far as the congressional thing is concerned, I fully understand what (California Gov. Gavin) Newsom is doing and what Gov. (JB) Pritzker has said he’s considering because of the egregiousness, at the congressional level, of what’s going on in Texas,” Daley said. “If Texas just played according to the rules and in five years wanted to do a map to do away with five Democrats, that’s their right.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — U.S. Secretary of Education Linda Mahon on Tuesday didn’t rule out a plan to end statewide standardized testing in Oklahoma during a local visit focused on limiting federal involvement in public education.
McMahon, whom President Donald Trump tasked with closing the U.S. Department of Education, said she’s “very happy to sit down with any state” to discuss new policy ideas. 
“We want to give them the most flexibility that we can give them to operate within their state,” McMahon said while speaking with reporters at the state Capitol. “So, we’re happy to sit down in Oklahoma or other states that we’ve already sat down with to push those programs along.”
However, she said the proposal from state Superintendent Ryan Walters to replace statewide tests with a mixture of district-selected assessments still “has not gone through all the different steps that it needs” to gain federal approval.
Walters wasn’t present for McMahon’s visit despite being a vocal supporter of the Trump administration. She said meeting with him wasn’t on her schedule Tuesday.
Instead, McMahon joined Gov. Kevin Stitt and former House Speaker Charles McCall, now a gubernatorial candidate, for a tour of Dove Science Academy, a high-performing charter school with a new campus in Warr Acres. Once allies, Stitt and Walters have been publicly at odds with each other for the past six months.

Dove high school students demonstrated robots they had built and coded, flew drones and tested virtual reality software, even having a remote-controlled robot dog give McMahon a handshake. U.S. News and World Report on Tuesday ranked Dove Science Academy as the No. 3 high school in the state, behind Classen High School of Advanced Studies and Harding Charter Preparatory High School, both in Oklahoma City.
McMahon later accompanied Stitt at the state Capitol as the governor signed a bill prohibiting diversity, equity and inclusion programs from higher education institutions, another major policy goal of the Trump administration.
“I think Oklahoma should be very proud of what I’ve seen this morning,” McMahon said.
Oklahoma was the latest stop in McMahon’s 50-state “Returning Education to the States Tour,” which started earlier this month in Louisiana. 
The tour has highlighted McMahon’s goal of cutting federal regulations and giving individual states more authority and flexibility in how they operate their public school systems. Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration to proceed with mass layoffs and downsizing at the federal Department of Education.

The administration has proposed sending federal funds in large block grants that individual states could decide how to spend. Congress would have to agree to any wholesale changes to the federal structure of education funding.
McMahon declined to answer whether she has any concerns over expanding the powers of the Oklahoma State Department of Education, which has been consistently in turmoil under Walters.
Stitt touted policies Oklahoma enacted in recent years that increased facility funds for charter schools, expanded student transfer options, offered tax credits to private-school families and increased state funding for public education overall.
National testing, though, has shown the state as a whole is still struggling to improve its poor academic outcomes.
While Oklahoma has promoted more choices for parents to select their children’s school, Stitt said he is eager for the federal government to grant more flexibility, as well. He said educators and school district administrators have to spend too much time on paperwork that federal programs require.

“That’s, I think, what President Trump wants and what we believe in is let’s get rid of the bureaucracy and let’s get those dollars on target to kids in Oklahoma City and in Enid and in Lawton and all over the country,” Stitt said.

Nevada received about $24 million in funding from the Victims of Crime Act, or VOCA, in 2024 according to the Victim Assistance Data Dashboard. Withholding funds would put the state, and the 58 organizations that receive grant funding, at risk of losing money needed to offer support services to victims. 
The U.S. Department of Justice threatened to block VOCA funding nationwide, which provides critical grant funding for state agencies and nonprofits addressing domestic violence and sexual assault, if states don’t cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Survivors of crime “should not be used as pawns to score political points” in Trump’s efforts to force states to comply with aggressive immigration enforcement”. Ford said in a statement earlier this week.
“It is despicable that President Trump is using vital funding to play political games,” Ford said. “He is putting victims and survivors of crime in even more precarious situations when what they deserve is help with regaining a sense of normalcy.”
The act was created in 1984 and has allowed helped fund a variety of services and assistance, including paying for emergency shelter, medical expenses, crime scene cleanup, and sexual assault forensic exams. 
“Between 2021 and 2024, states have used federal VOCA funds to assist, on average, more than 8.5 million crime victims per year and to pay more than 200,000 claims per year for losses suffered by crime victims,” the lawsuit reads.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/flashing-lights-police-car-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-19 15:58:25.280966

(Courtesy of Nebraska Department of Correctional Services)LINCOLN — Nebraska’s version of the so-called “Alligator Alcatraz” immigration detention center appears to be headed for the southwestern part of the state, Red Willow County.
President Donald Trump’s administration is set to build or create a major center to hold migrants in McCook, the county seat of Red Willow, according to documents obtained by the Washington Post from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The detention center is to be located at or adjacent to the McCook Work Ethic Camp, a medium-security facility operated by the state prison system. While the state facility is intended to house up to 200 people, the Post documents indicate federal plans that the Nebraska center in McCook will have capacity for 300 detainees. 
People briefed by Gov.  Jim Pillen’s team said he plans an announcement Tuesday afternoon about at least the McCook part of a larger effort to assist the Trump administration’s effort to dramatically increase detention capacity for migrants.
Will Nebraska be home to the next ‘Alligator Alcatraz?’

Laura Strimple, a Pillen spokeswoman, declined to comment Tuesday about the state facility or plans. ICE and Department of Homeland Security officials did not respond immediately to a request for comment. FBI Director Kash Patel was in Nebraska on Tuesday, having met with state and local law enforcement, including Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers.
Gene Weedin, a McCook City Council member, said he was still learning details and forming an opinion on the center coming to his city of nearly 8,000.
He said Pillen was in McCook with the Corrections Director over the weekend talking to various local officials. Weedin’s understanding is that the work ethic center would stop operating in its current form, and those in the facility would be transferred to other places.
Weedin said the people currently housed at the center have contributed to the community by picking up trash, putting up annual Christmas decorations and doing other public service.
“There are just a lot of questions,” said Weedin.
Sen. Teresa Ibach of Sumner, who represents part of west central Nebraska outside McCook, said she only just learned about the ICE effort and was “still gathering more information.”
Nebraska owns nearly 45 acres at the McCook site. It is unclear whether the ICE facility would be built new or as an expansion to the existing facility.
In its detention expansion strategy, the Trump administration has revived other dormant prisons, repurposed military bases and secured partnerships with private prison contractors, local sheriffs and Republican governors to house its record number of detainees, the Post reported.
Nebraska has historically struggled to hire enough staff to use the McCook Work Ethic facility as it was originally intended, to reform younger men who’ve committed crimes by assigning them jobs and tasks. The camp focuses its counseling and other efforts on encouraging behavior changes to reduce recidivism.
It is the least crowded of Nebraska’s adult prison facilities, running a daily census of about 184 in Fiscal Year 2025. But it is also one of the prison facilities with the greatest need for additional staffing. The department’s census says it was staffed to house an average of about 125 people in FY 2025.
Cristine Schwartz, the public information officer at the McCook Work Ethic Camp, referred calls to a state Correctional Services spokeswoman, who did not immediately return calls. 
The state has been working around the Douglas County Jail deciding to no longer actively participate in ICE detentions. Detainees from eastern Nebraska have been sent to Council Bluffs, Iowa, and as far away as the Lincoln County Jail in North Platte — where the 76 workers arrested in the high-profile immigration raid at Omaha’s Glenn Valley Foods plant were transported. Many are still there.
ICE also plans to contract with jails in eastern Nebraska’s Sarpy and Cass Counties for 30 beds each and the Washington County Jail for 15, according to the Post’s ICE documents. It is apparently Nebraska’s contribution to a plan that the federal documents showed would open or expand 125 immigration detention facilities this year.
By January, it said, ICE would have capacity to hold more than 107,000 people, up from close to 50,000 currently. That road map, last updated July 30, reflected ICE intentions to rely increasingly on makeshift “soft-sided” structures that could be built in a few weeks and taken down as easily. 
The government is also planning to make more room for detaining parents and children.
Earlier this month, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in an interview with CBS News that Nebraska was being considered as a home to one of the state-run, federally funded migrant detention centers that the Trump administration hoped to launch across the country in the likeness of the so-called “Alligator Alcatraz” state-run facility in the Everglades.
Noem said she had already appealed to governors and state leaders. Strimple at the time responded to the Examiner’s request for comment by saying it was premature to comment on potential detention operations. She added, “Gov. Pillen will make details public at the appropriate time.”

Lindsay James announced Tuesday she is running for Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District seat, joining two other Democrats in the race to challenge U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson in 2026.
James, a Presbyterian pastor who is serving her fourth term as a state lawmaker, had said in July she was considering a run. In an interview Tuesday with the Iowa Capital Dispatch, she said in the past month, she has spent time talking with Iowans in the northeast Iowa congressional district about which issues matter most to them. She said she came to the decision to run in part, because of her “faith commitment that compels me to stop and lend a helping hand” in working to better Iowans’ lives.
“I am running because too many hard-working Iowans are being forced to make impossible choices in their lives,” James said. “Choices like, ‘Do I pay child care costs, or say, for a house? Do I pay my utility bill or buy my child a new winter coat?’ Washington, D.C., works for billionaires and lobbyists. It is not working for everyday families, and they need to hear the truth from us here in Iowa.”

Many of the policies coming out of Washington that Hinson supported — like the budget reconciliation bill that made cuts to Medicaid and SNAP — are policies that will make costs rise for average Iowans, James said, both threatening rural hospital access and potentially causing electricity and fuel costs to rise.
The Dubuque Democrat said Hinson, first elected in 2020, has “lost her way” since being elected to Congress.
“She has just become a talking head in Washington, D.C., and she is no longer listening to Iowans,” James said. “… Her vote record is staggeringly devastating.”
In addition to the budget reconciliation bill, James said Hinson has supported President Donald Trump’s “reckless, sweeping tariffs that are raising costs and threatening Iowa’s egg industry,” has voted against capping the cost of insulin, and has not taken action to address the loss of more than 2,000 jobs in the district.
Republican advocates said James is fighting a losing battle in taking on Hinson.
“Lindsay James is extreme, out of step, and totally unelectable,” Emily Tuttle, spokesperson for the National Republican Congressional Committee said in a statement. “She’ll only help drive the clown car in this Democrat primary further off the rails, while Ashley Hinson delivers for Iowans.”
The Republican incumbent won reelection with 57.1% of the vote in 2024 against Democratic challenger Sarah Corkery, who garnered 41.6%. While political forecasters including the Cook Political Report have highlighted Iowa’s 1st and 3rd Congressional District races as potentially competitive in the 2026 midterms, Iowa’s 2nd District has not received the same attention.
But before Hinson won her first term in office, northeast Iowa was represented by former U.S. Rep. Abby Finkenauer, a Democrat who won in 2018. James said she believes the district can flip in the upcoming election as voters reflect on the struggles their communities face with struggling schools, job losses and higher economic pressures.
“I’m excited because people are really hungry for change,” James said. “And people are able to see through her perfectly polished politician act, right? Iowans are smart, and they can see that the decisions that she’s making (have) not resulted in their lives becoming any better.”
If elected, James said she would focus on issues like making housing, child care and health care affordable and accessible, as well as supporting public schools.
Two other Democrats have announced campaigns for the Democratic nomination: Clint Twedt-Ball, the founder of the nonprofit Matthew 25 and Kathy Dolter, the former dean of nursing at Kirkwood Community College and a retired Army nurse. James said her work fighting for Iowans in the state Legislature, as well as her “moral compass,” will make her the best contender in the race.
“What I am passionate about doing is calling out Hinson for all of the ways in which she (served) special interests and billionaires in Washington, D.C.,” James said. “She has forgotten about us and left us behind, and people want someone who isn’t going to be blown about by political winds.”

Aug. 19, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceWhile canvassers work to collect signatures in support of enshrining ranked choice voting in the Michigan Constitution, lawmakers are mulling a potential ban on the practice, with the bill’s sponsor arguing it flies in the face of “one person, one vote.” 
Rep. Rachelle Smit (R-Martin), chair of the House Election Integrity Committee on Tuesday testified on her House Bill 4707, which would prohibit ranked choice voting in the state, and invalidate any local ordinance that permits it.
Rather than casting a ballot for one candidate, ranked choice voting asks voters to rank candidates for a position based on preference. However, Smit argued the system is confusing, and would burden clerks after sweeping changes to Michigan’s election system were approved by voters in 2022. These include allowing for nine days of early voting, permitting voters to use a photo ID or sign an affidavit in order to verify their identity and allowing voters to place themselves on a permanent absentee voter list. 
“By prohibiting ranked choice voting, we will ensure that the principles of one person one vote continues, and we will avoid confusion and additional burdens on our already-stressed election administrators,” Smit said. 
In her testimony, Smit noted that two states currently use ranked choice voting, Alaska and Maine. Sixteen others have prohibited the practice, while its legal status remains up in the air in Michigan. 
However, Rep. Stephen Wooden (D-Grand Rapids), the committee’ minority vice chair, questioned the need for a ban, noting that Michigan’s election law already prescribes the time and manner of each election in a way that does not allow for ranked choice voting.
Five cities in the state have adopted Ranked Choice Voting measures for their local elections: Ann Arbor, Ferndale, East Lansing, Kalamazoo and Royal Oak. However, state law has kept the localities from implementing these measures. 
  House Election Committee Minority Vice Chair Stephen Wooden (D-Grand Rapids). Aug. 19, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan Advance
In response, Smit said the state does not expressly prohibit or allow for ranked choice voting, and that the goal of the bill is to clearly establish that it is not allowed in state, local or federal elections. 
Responding to another question from Wooden, Smit said the bill was a response to the Rank MI Vote ballot effort, later confirming that if Michigan voters were to approve the proposed constitutional amendment, her bill would be rendered unenforceable. 
Trent England, one of the chairs of the anti-ranked choice voting coalition Stop RCV, argued ranked choice voting makes the whole process more difficult, complicating ballot design, lengthening instruction on the ballot and requiring voters to have more information both about the ranked choice voting process, and the candidates themselves. 
“You might say, ‘Well, I only have one candidate I like,’ but if you don’t rank other candidates, you run the risk of being actually disenfranchised in the election,” England said.

He also cited a 2022 incident in Alameda County, California where the county’s ranked choice voting system was not properly configured. As a result, the initially certified results for an Oakland school board race were not correct. 
Shelly Lake, deputy clerk for Irving Township in Barry County, said that if ranked choice voting was approved in Michigan, she expected the number of spoiled ballots would greatly increase due to issues with how a voter fills out their ballot. 
However, Joe Spaulding, campaign director for Rank MI Vote, said the error rate for ranked choice elections is roughly the same as single-candidate elections. 
Spaulding noted that Michigan’s political parties currently use a modified form of ranked choice voting in selecting their nominee for attorney general and secretary of state. 
“If ranked choice voting is good for the party in the primary, I promise it’s good for the public in the general election,” Spaulding said.

Spaulding also argued that single-choice elections punish voters when more candidates run, while ranked choice voting incentivizes collaboration over partisanship. 
“Liberals and conservatives don’t want to vote for the lesser of two evils. Progressives want options outside of the oligarchy, in their words. [Make America Great Again Republicans] want choices beyond what they call a uniparty.…ranked choice voting is a very simple solution to the issue of voters getting punished when they’re given more choices in an election,” Spaulding said.

States and clinicians are working on getting correct information on vaccines to vulnerable groups amid shifting federal guidance. (Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Heading into the respiratory illness season, states and clinicians are working to encourage pregnant patients to get COVID-19 vaccinations, even though the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services no longer recommends that they should.
Along with being older and having an underlying health condition, pregnancy itself is a risk factor. Pregnant women are more vulnerable to developing severe illness from COVID-19. They’re also at high risk for complications, including preterm labor and stillbirth. The vast majority of medical experts say getting the shot is safe and effective — much safer than having the illness.
But HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in May that the agency would no longer recommend that pregnant women get the vaccine. Before testifying before Congress in June, Kennedy circulated a document on Capitol Hill claiming higher rates of fetal loss after vaccination. But the authors of those studies told Politico that their work had been misinterpreted.
Experts say the federal shift puts the onus on state health agencies to ramp up vaccine guidance and outreach. Clinicians and public health organizations are trying to dispel misinformation and make sure information reaches low-income people and people of color, who had higher maternal death rates during the pandemic. During the first two years of the pandemic, the virus contributed to a quarter of maternal deaths, according to federal data.
“We are severely disappointed,” said Dr. Neil Silverman, a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine. He has studied vaccines and pregnancy for the past 15 years and specializes in high-risk pregnancies.
Silverman called the federal shift a “public health tragedy on a grand scale.”
Vaccinations against COVID-19 help prevent severe illness in pregnant people as well as their newborns, who are too young to get vaccinated, Silverman said. In what’s called passive immunity, vaccinated mothers pass on antibodies to their babies through the placenta and through breast milk.
“State public health agencies are probably going to have to implement vaccine guidance that differs from the federal recommendations. And that’s going to be an interesting can of worms,” said OB-GYN Dr. Mark Turrentine, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.
Turrentine serves on a board of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that focuses on immunization and infectious diseases. He said his recent pregnant patients who had COVID-19 hadn’t gotten the vaccine.
“The change in guidance on the federal level just really makes a lot of confusion, and it makes it very challenging to try to explain to individuals why all of a sudden the difference,” Turrentine said.
A slew of public health organizations have been making a concerted effort to dispel vaccine myths. They include the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization of maternal-fetal experts. At a news briefing the society held this month, clinicians stressed the safety and long-standing science behind COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the shots for RSV and the flu. Cases of RSV and the flu tend to peak in the winter months, while in recent years COVID-19 cases have spiked in the summer and the winter.
Dr. Brenna Hughes, an OB-GYN who chairs the organization’s infectious diseases and emerging threats committee, pointed to survey data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that less than a third of eligible pregnant patients received COVID-19 shots, and only 38% received RSV shots for the 2023 to 2024 season. Less than half — 47% — received flu shots, and 59% received TDAP (whooping cough) vaccines.
CDC data shows that for last year’s and this year’s season, only between 12% and 14% of pregnant patients got the COVID-19 vaccine.
“The complications from the infection are so much greater than the complications and the very few and typically minor adverse events that might occur from the vaccine,” said microbiologist Sabra Klein, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
In June, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and 30 other professional health organizations signed a letter urging insurers to continue covering the COVID-19 shot for pregnant women, and have continued to urge coverage since then.
CVS Caremark, one of the nation’s three major pharmacy benefit managers, told Stateline it will continue covering the vaccine for pregnant women. The Arizona, California and North Carolina state Medicaid agencies also told Stateline they are still currently covering COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women.
Dr. Kimberly Fortner, president-elect of the Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, said during the maternal-fetal medicine briefing that she hopes medical groups’ joint messaging will bolster insurers.
“Hopefully by us linking arms, that can then help develop consistency so that insurers will continue to pay for the vaccine,” she said.
Exacerbating disparities
Dr. Ayanna Bennett, director of the District of Columbia Department of Health, said the federal government’s new stance has upended “a system that’s been stable for a very long time.”
Bennett said her agency used federal pandemic aid to shore up vaccine outreach efforts to communities of color. Now that flow of money is ending.
The changes in federal guidance and funding will “almost certainly exacerbate” maternal health disparities, said Marie Thoma, a perinatal epidemiologist and an associate professor in the University of Maryland Department of Family Science who researches pregnancy and COVID-19.
Black and Indigenous women died at higher rates. The virus exacerbated existing racial disparities in maternal health — and created new ones: Latina mothers, who generally see low rates of maternal mortality, saw deaths surge to 28 per 100,000 in 2021. Their rate was about 12 per 100,000 in 2018, according to federal data.
“We are going in with some exposure already that we didn’t have during the start of the pandemic. So, there will be some protection, but now that will erode,” said Thoma. “If we’re not getting vaccines, or if people are hesitant to take them, we could see some increase.”
Silverman said the administration’s efforts to strip mentions of race from government policies makes it difficult for institutions to reach populations at greatest risk. He called the dismissal of decades of data “saddening and infuriating.”
“The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most,” said Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council.
Many women “are trying to navigate an economic system that’s not always in their favor in terms of also providing access to the kind of educational material that they need,” she said.
Not just COVID-19
In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics.
The change is creating chaos. Some states have vaccine laws, such as mandates for kids and coverage statutes, that are specifically tied to the committee’s decisions.
The Vaccine Integrity Project at the University of Minnesota called on frontline health workers, health officials and professional societies to “counter the spread of inaccurate and confusing vaccine information.”
At a news briefing this month held by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, representatives from Alabama, Connecticut and Washington, D.C., said they will continue to recommend vaccines.
Alabama’s state health officer, Dr. Scott Harris, said clinicians will be instrumental in getting correct vaccination information to patients.
“We don’t think that we necessarily have the same authoritative voice that we might have had a decade ago in trying to guide people in what to do, but we do believe that people trust their health care providers in most cases and are certainly willing to listen to them,” he said at the briefing.
Bennett said she is hopeful that strong, consistent messaging from respected medical organizations will help combat confusion.
“Having established groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics or the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology make very firm recommendations that keep us essentially not changed from where we have been, I think, should reassure families,” she said.
